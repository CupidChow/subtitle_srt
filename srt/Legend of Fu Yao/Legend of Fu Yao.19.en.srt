00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,380
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,530
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,660
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,930
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,970
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,760
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,530
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,010
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,710
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,830
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,920
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,610
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,310
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,430
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:21,560
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,800
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,940
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,500
~ Episode 19 ~

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,090
I heard that the abducted Elegant Miss is from the Prime Minister's Manor.

23
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,970
She's even your newly named goddaughter.

24
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,640
Prime Minister, you have a soft heart.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,170
When she was sent and had arrived at the palace gates,

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,500
did you suddenly feel regretful and came up with this idea?

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,040
Of course not.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,420
Not mentioning a goddaughter,

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,570
people in the whole Deep Water are Your Majesty’s people.

30
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,930
I did indeed oversee the supervision.

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,880
But I don't intend to shield myself.

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,230
Your Majesty, please give me a few days.

33
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,410
I'll surely catch the culprit to calm your fury.

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,140
Then thank you for your hard work, Prime Minister.

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,740
There’re also assassins who entered the Prime Minister’s Manor.

36
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,460
And your manor even caught fire.

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,950
You’re also looking for the culprit throughout the whole town.

38
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,990
I’m afraid that you might be too busy.

39
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,290
The nation’s matter is a big matter. Your manor’s matter is a small matter.

40
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,360
And Prime Minister is usually busy with court responsibilities.

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,310
Just let Zhang Henian investigate the case today.

42
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,240
As Your Majesty wishes.

43
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,730
Right. If Zhang Henian wants to investigate, he'll need people.

44
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,290
If he wants to catch the culprit, he'll need soldiers.

45
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,990
And naturally, he needs funds.

46
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,960
Since he has asked for money on his memorial, just give it to him.

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,800
Your Majesty, catching the culprit and asking for military expenditure are two different matters.

48
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,780
Prime Minister.

49
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,420
Prime Minister,

50
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,260
who’s the king of Deep Water?

51
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,400
Is it you or me?

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
Do you think that

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,810
it was you, Qi Zhen, who pushed me up to the throne,

54
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,150
so Deep Water will have to listen to you from now on?

55
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,350
Don’t forget.

56
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,890
You’re not the only official in the imperial court.

57
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,400
Besides, you're not the only one with military power.

58
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

59
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,880
Prime Minister, you’re tired.

60
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,230
Quickly go back and rest.

61
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,420
Report!

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,830
They found Elegant Miss Yuwen Zi outside the palace.

64
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,320
She’s being carried into the palace now.

65
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,190
Waiting for Your Majesty's orders.

66
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,660
Where is she now?

67
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,020
Answering Your Majesty. Elegant Miss is waiting outside the palace.

68
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,380
It's just that she is unconscious.

69
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,520
Her personal maid is taking care of her.

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,900
- Summon her in quickly.
- Yes.

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,870
Summon her!

72
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,060
What happened?

73
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,330
Answer Your Majesty. After Miss Yuwen was abducted,

74
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,760
the guards and I had chased them a long time until reaching the lakeside.

75
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,820
It seemed like the culprit had recognized her by mistake.

76
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,990
He threw Miss into the lake. That’s why we were able to save her.

77
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,430
But, our pitiful Miss...

78
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,550
Was it real?

79
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,650
Why would this happen? Quick!

80
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,870
Someone please come.

81
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,550
Quickly call the imperial doctor to check.

82
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,700
Your Majesty, you take good care.

83
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,060
- Prime Minister, isn’t Medical Sage Zong Yue staying in your manor?
- Yes.

84
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,920
Why don’t you call him here?

85
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,120
I guess Prime Minister would rather use your own man, right?

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,090
I will use. I will use.

87
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,900
Mister, your acting was beautiful just now.

88
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,560
Look at Qi Zhen. He couldn’t even talk because he was shocked by you.

89
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,040
Can't you tell whether I'm angry for real or not?

90
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,020
Someone touched my person, but I didn’t know.

91
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,850
He honestly did get angry.

92
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,430
Back then, if it wasn't for me who assisted him, could he have today?

93
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,110
Go down.

94
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,300
He had the nerve to reprimand me in front of the imperial court.

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,910
He used Zhang Henian to pressure me!

96
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,780
Who does he think he is?

97
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,900
Godfather, please calm down.

98
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,370
He’s just a puppet I supported onto the throne.

99
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,780
Yun Hen has no right to say this.

100
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,390
But this place is Deep Water.

101
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,110
No matter how useless the puppet is,

102
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,830
the king is still the king.

103
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,670
Are you reminding me that his surname is Xuanyuan?

104
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,190
I don’t dare to.

105
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,200
You’re right.

106
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,660
His surname is Xuanyuan.

107
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,650
Only by tolerating and holding in your anger can you retain the capability to solve any problems.

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,470
But today's incident is not simple.

109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,420
Godfather, are you suspecting that the abduction was arranged by Xuanyuan Min?

110
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,820
You’re right.

111
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,970
Then, he could push all the blame on me this way.

112
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,350
Agreeing to give Zhang Henian military expenditure

113
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,170
will be achieved without effort then.

114
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,100
He’s actually this treacherous.

115
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,390
Not only treacherous, but also out of control.

116
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,470
If this continues, I’m afraid that it would be even harder and harder to control him.

117
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,080
Then our spies in the palace?

118
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,130
Even though we have Cao Cheng to spy and bring us news,

119
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,860
he is still one layer away.

120
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,350
We still have to think of another way to keep a close eye on him.

121
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,820
Yes.

122
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,980
Fifth Older Brother! Fifth Older Brother!

123
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,670
Prince Zhan!

124
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,480
I heard the Elegant Miss sent by the Prime Minister's manor was abducted by a powerfully impressive expert.

125
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm guessing, it's you Fifth Older Brother who saved Fuyao. Right?

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,410
I also think so, Prince Zhan. Where is Older Sis Fuyao right now?

127
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,930
Fuyao has her own arrangements.

128
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,870
She doesn't plan on leaving Prime Minister's Manor .

129
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,600
She plans to enter into the palace.

130
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,440
Why?

131
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,690
The palace is so dangerous.

132
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,320
Will Fuyao be fine by herself?

133
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,600
The palace isn't a place that you or I could easily enter and leave.

134
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,740
Fuyao has always been smart.

135
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,370
She can handle it on her own.

136
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,560
Also, you helped to change her appearance, so she should be all right.

137
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,920
What are you doing?

138
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,450
I still have things to take care of.

139
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,990
I originally planned to save Fuyao to repay my gratitude and leave the Deep Water for some time.

140
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,540
Now, Fuyao doesn't need me to get involved.

141
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,870
I plan on immediately setting out.

142
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,960
You guys take these gold leaves.

143
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,310
You will have a use for them in the future.

144
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,720
Thank you, Fifth Older Brother.

145
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,820
Great. We will go with you wherever you go.

146
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,570
So you have someone to take care of you on the road.

147
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,810
No.

148
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,830
Why?

149
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,650
Official Yun.

150
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,980
Is Mr. Zong available?

151
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,850
He is taking an afternoon nap. No one can disturb—

152
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,430
No problem.

153
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,080
Why did Mr. Yun come to see me today?

154
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,020
The Prime Minister's goddaughter Miss Yuwen got abducted by an abductor this morning.

155
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,030
Is this the same Miss Yuwen who didn't die from the night of the big fire?

156
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,540
Yes, it is she.

157
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,590
Fortunately, she was rescued and only suffered some shock.

158
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,080
Sorry to trouble you to help and take a look at her.

159
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,790
Since Mr. Yun has asked personally,

160
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,920
then naturally Zong Yue shall respect your request and sincerely obey.

161
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,570
Qing Feng, deliver my medical box over.

162
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,040
Yes.

163
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,100
- Just see me off here.
- But—

164
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,110
I don't like repeating myself.

165
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,300
Fifth Older Brother, this trip is so long and full of danger.

166
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,440
I'm not at ease letting you go alone.

167
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,680
It's exactly because it is too dangerous, that I'd be too preoccupied to take care of you.

168
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,960
- Bringing you along would just be a burden.
- But—

169
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,690
That place isn't a place you should be going to.

170
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,790
I know you're concerned for my safety.

171
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,420
All day long, you wear a harsh strict facial expression.

172
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,680
Eyes glaring wide intently like those of a bull's.

173
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,670
Can't you be a little nicer to me?

174
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,360
About my departure this time, you must not let Deep Water nor Heaven Fiend find out.

175
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,680
If they catch wind of it,

176
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,050
you will never be able to see me again.

177
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,250
Don't worry, Fifth Older Brother. I definitely won't tell a single soul.

178
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,480
The situation of Deep Water's capital is hard to tell right now.

179
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,980
It's a problematic place.

180
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,160
When I'm not here, there will no longer be anyone who cares whether you are alive or dead.

181
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,340
If you feel unsafe, just go back to Qiongye first.

182
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,060
No need to wait for me.

183
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,220
These last six years, I accompanied you, ran through the entire Five Regions.

184
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,830
How could there be something that I can't take care?

185
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,900
I'm going.

186
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,510
About the big fire in the manor that night, I wonder if there is any news of the culprit?

187
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,590
The culprit and his associates were all caught the next day.

188
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,050
Really? What kind of criminal would dare to be so audacious?

189
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,930
They're just some infamous pirates.

190
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,710
Who knows what muddled their minds for them to get the idea to aim at the Prime Minister's Manor.

191
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,070
But the Prime Minister has ordered for them to all be killed.

192
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,290
They're all dead?

193
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,800
Yes. Once the culprits are dead,

194
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,640
unexpected troubles can't spring up.

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,570
Mr. Yun's execution is sharp.

196
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,580
It's Prime Minister's blessing.

197
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,470
It’s so late. Does Mr. Yuan have something to see me about?

198
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,820
Can I come in to talk?

199
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,650
We flipped the place inside out today trying to find the assassin.

200
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,730
The assassin has a wound on his body, so he should be easier to identify.

201
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,070
I don’t know if Mister would be willing to let me take a look at your arm.

202
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,840
You guessed correctly.

203
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,800
I’m the person you’re looking for.

204
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,680
Then I must ask you to please come with me to see the Prime Minister.

205
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,940
Don't you want to ask me why I readily just confessed?

206
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,670
Mister can personally report the hidden reasons to Prime Minister.

207
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,550
If I'm not wrong, your real birthday is the fourth day of the sixth month.

208
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,850
You're 19 years old this year.

209
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,690
What does that mean?

210
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,610
You were five years old when you entered the manor.

211
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,350
The old housekeeper personally told Qi Zhen, that you were his biological nephew.

212
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,730
But before he died,

213
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,190
why did he tell you your real birthday and tell you not to tell anyone,

214
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,830
especially your godfather, Qi Zhen?

215
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,490
You dare to say another word.

216
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,660
Have you found anything from investigating your real identity for so many years?

217
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,650
How did you find out?

218
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,730
I coincidentally know of an old story

219
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,520
that may be related to your identity.

220
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,840
I wonder if Mister has time for about seven minutes?

221
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,020
Has Mister heard of the late Heir Apparent Wenyi?

222
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,390
That year, Heir Apparent Wenyi established a brilliant military success.

223
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,900
But he had a disloyal heart and

224
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,860
coveted the throne of Deep Water.

225
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,780
As he was such a disloyal and unfilial man, his whole household was exterminated.

226
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,420
Naturally, everyone in Deep Water knows about this incident.

227
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,000
What if I told you, that the truth of this incident isn't such?

228
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,160
When Heir Apparent Wenyi was famous all over the world,

229
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,230
King Renzong was at his peak.

230
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,450
Heir Apparent was brave, capable and benevolent.

231
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:20,680
The citizens of Deep Water only know about Heir Apparent not Renzong.

232
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,740
There were malicious people in the palace who spread slander about him.

233
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,940
Renzong became more and more suspicious.

234
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,530
In the end, an evil person set up a plot to frame Heir Apparent.

235
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:39,560
King Renzong couldn't tolerate this Heir Apparent who stood out more than him.

236
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,650
The person who set him up...

237
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,200
was the former Heir Apparent's best friend,

238
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,250
now the most powerful Prime Minister, Qi Zhen!

239
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,720
About the execution of the Heir Apparent's whole family,

240
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,610
everyone thought it was the extermination of his lineage.

241
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,280
But I know he still has two descendants.

242
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,010
The two of them are living ignoble lives.

243
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,480
Both of them have an aquatic dragon tattoo on their shoulder!

244
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,630
Could it possibly be that Mister's shoulder coincidentally has the same tattoo as mine?

245
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,830
Impossible!

246
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,010
I was abandoned when I was young.

247
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,810
Prime Minister gave me the chance to start over!

248
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,820
You've become so familiar with living a life with the foe as your father,

249
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,320
that you've forgotten what's flowing in your blood.

250
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,150
♫ A solitary sailboat is drifting everywhere with no boundary ♫

251
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,880
It's fine, too.

252
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,720
If you think what I've just said is just nonsense,

253
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,900
then arrest and take me to Qi Zhen now.

254
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,560
♫ My heart isn't an isolated island ♫

255
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:33,470
♫ Changing mind and fluctuating only takes one second ♫

256
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,680
♫ The world is the embrace ♫

257
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,080
Mister Qiu is making sugar art in the south of the city.

258
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,280
You can ask him to confirm.

259
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,100
Mr. Zong is here.

260
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,010
Miss Yuwen, Mr. Zong is here to attend to your illness. Please open the door.

261
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,420
Come in.

262
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,200
This way, please.

263
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,670
I didn't expect that we'd meet again inside the palace.

264
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Are you able to recognize me?

265
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,750
Look at your fierce-look.

266
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,230
Who else could it be but Fuyao?

267
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,340
You should have said earlier.

268
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,650
Back to the point. My head has been hurting a lot.

269
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,560
It feels like my head is about to split from moving slightly.

270
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,130
I think you must've been kicked by a donkey.

271
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,020
You'll be fine after a few acupuncture needles.

272
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,220
No need. Thank you, thank you.

273
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,330
What are you up to today?

274
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,350
Why have you summoned me into the palace?

275
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,240
I'm just worried about you.

276
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,210
I wanted to see if you were dead or alive.

277
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,540
If you keep hassling me, I'll really be a dead soon.

278
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,360
You're a medical sage.

279
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,830
Even dead people can be brought back to life by you.

280
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,260
If you die one day, I definitely won't ask the king of hell to give you back.

281
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,010
Come on, you. I've at least delivered the item for you, didn't I?

282
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,030
Even if I don't get credit for it, I still used effort to do it.

283
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,150
Why don't you ask me about my situation?

284
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,190
You're already in his harem.

285
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,430
What other situation do I need to ask about?

286
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,860
Maybe he has convinced you to be his internal agent in the palace.

287
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,770
About the item I've given you, as long as it lands in his hands,

288
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,680
you don't need to worry about anything else.

289
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,090
I really am worried about your safety.

290
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,520
I really feel uneasy because you took the arrow in my place that day.

291
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,830
Think about it. Danger is hiding behind every corner in the Prime Minister's Manor.

292
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,460
Even if we're not friends, we did live through hardships together.

293
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,680
Shouldn't you at least give me some condolences?

294
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,220
All right. If you're really feeling unwell, I'll give you a diagnosis.

295
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,860
What's wrong?

296
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,350
Am I going to die soon?

297
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,720
Yes.

298
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,890
You're not going to live for long.

299
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,670
Fortunately, there's these effective medicines.

300
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,370
You'll be fine after you take it.

301
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,830
Black one is for saving lives.

302
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,480
White is for killing people.

303
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,400
For the vermilion one, ask me before you use it.

304
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,130
Then what is the vermilion one for?

305
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,900
Her pulse is like that of a living person, but also a dying one.

306
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,040
Why is it so strange?

307
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,430
Mister was burning with anxiety when Miss Fuyao was abducted that day.

308
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,640
But now, Miss Fuyao is already in the palace.

309
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,740
Is Mister going to visit Miss Fuyao?

310
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,420
Do you like me?

311
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,400
Find her!

312
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,530
Or else the Five Regions will once again be doomed eternally because of her.

313
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,820
There's no rush.

314
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,390
There is plenty of time.

315
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,010
[Prince Fierce is very ill.]

316
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,000
[He has gone to the mountains for resting quietly to recuperate.]

317
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,420
Fifth Older Brother, Fifth Older Brother.

318
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,970
Your mind is only filled with your Fifth Older Brother the whole day.

319
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,810
You don't even know where he is now.

320
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,120
How are you going to find him by yourself on a horse?

321
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,090
Leave Deep Water. Head North and it's Heaven Fiend.

322
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,800
I can absolutely find him.

323
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,270
But-- But didn't you promise to wait here for his return?

324
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,440
Why are you going to find him?

325
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,540
I did promise him.

326
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,280
But I've gotten used to running after him over the years.

327
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,610
For me to stay here alone to just sit and wait, I can't take it.

328
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,720
But the road is dangerous.

329
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,680
For a lady on her own,

330
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,690
what will you do if someone bullies you?

331
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,300
Who will dare to bully me?

332
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,830
I'm the one who bullies others.

333
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,330
How about it? Do you want to come along with me?

334
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,550
Heaven Fiend is covered with ice and snow.

335
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,580
They also have mountain foods Deep Water doesn't have.

336
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,300
It's quite fun.

337
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,920
Really?

338
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,660
Why would I lie to you?

339
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,580
It's winter all four seasons there.

340
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
You can ski or ice skate.

341
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,560
There are mountain stags to eat wherever you go.

342
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,880
They also have sugared fruits made with liquid sugar.

343
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,800
I guarantee you, you wouldn't have eaten anything as delicious.

344
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,600
Then... all right, then. I—

345
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,980
No. I can't go with you.

346
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,300
Why not?

347
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,110
I have to go find Fuyao.

348
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,990
I left Mt. Mystic Soul with her at the start,

349
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,460
but now she's stuck in the palace.

350
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,590
There are unknown dangers,

351
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,260
so I can't leave her on her own.

352
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,730
A loyal friend!

353
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,120
Fuyao didn't dote on you wastefully.

354
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,130
But the palace is now heavily fortified.

355
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,840
Fuyao has become an Elegant Miss.

356
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,820
How would you find her so easily?

357
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,190
That doesn't matter. I have a solution.

358
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,970
But I can't tell you yet.

359
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,220
All right.

360
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,990
Anyway, when I come back with Fifth Older Brother,

361
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,480
I must see a living and kicking Fuyao.

362
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,320
If she gets hurt, I'll blame it on you!

363
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,820
Don't worry.

364
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,940
Then, I'll wait for you to bring back sugared fruits for me.

365
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,100
Deal! I'm leaving then.

366
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,560
Take good care of yourself!

367
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,400
You take good care of yourself, too.

368
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,570
I really look forward to this eagerly.

369
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,730
Don't you look forward to this?

370
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,500
Master is the one in the spotlight.

371
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,830
I am fine as an onlooker.

372
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,560
You're getting better at acting.

373
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,150
Summon the Elegant Misses!

374
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,340
Welcome, Your Majesty!

375
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,660
Today is the day I'm choosing a consort.

376
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,410
I've purposefully summoned you all here to help me come up with an idea.

377
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,240
Your Majesty, choosing consorts is a serious matter.

378
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,010
How do we dare take precedence?

379
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,160
It is because it's a serious matter,

380
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,610
that I especially summoned you all to help me make a final decision.

381
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,720
Summon the Elegant Misses into the palace hall!

382
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,600
Respectful greetings, Your Majesty.

383
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,740
These are all excellent beauties.

384
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,990
Next time, when I act in a play,

385
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,130
I wouldn't have to be worried about not having someone to act with.

386
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,010
You.

387
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,400
Come to the front.

388
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,160
What is your name?

389
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,290
My name is Tang Zhirong.

390
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,450
Greetings, Your Majesty.

391
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,560
She is the daughter of General Border Security Tang Bonian, Tang Zhirong.

392
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,460
She is seventeen years old.

393
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,810
General Border Security.

394
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:27,940
Your Majesty, General Border Security, Tang Bonian, has guarded the borders for many years.

395
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,970
He is a subject who has contributed greatly to Deep Water Nation.

396
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,530
Is that so?

397
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:38,170
Then, I will choose the one whom Prime Minister thinks is best.

398
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,830
For serious matters like choosing consorts, Your Majesty should decide yourself.

399
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,940
Then, you're picked.

400
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,330
Thank you, Your Majesty.

401
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,410
Who is the next one?

402
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,730
Greetings, Your Majesty. My name is Chen Xiangxie.

403
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,900
- Go back.
- Yes.

404
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,840
- My name is Yuwen–
- Why is there still so many people?!

405
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,260
Your Majesty.

406
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,110
- This Elegant Miss is Yuwen from the North–
- All right, all right, all right.

407
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,230
Jiang Feng, hand the jade tablets to Prime Minister.

408
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,140
I'll just choose whoever Prime Minister thinks is good.

409
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,790
Yes.

410
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,720
Your Majesty, don't make a joke such as this with me.

411
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,470
Prime Minister, please.

412
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,670
Your Majesty, I am not deserving of this good fortune.

413
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,840
Prime Minister, why are you being so polite?

414
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,560
Although choosing consorts is a matter of the harem,

415
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,100
it is also related to the frontal palace.

416
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,090
As Prime Minister works in the best interests of the country, for you to choose consorts for me,

417
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,820
naturally you shouldn't refuse to accept the responsibility.

418
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,710
- I don't dare.
- You–!

419
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,590
Since that is the case, the ones I've chosen before are void!

420
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,220
Today, I'll set a precedent,

421
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,350
spinning the jade spinner.

422
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,760
- Don't be impatient, don't be impatient.
 - I want this one.

423
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,470
- Okay, okay.
- This one looks good.

424
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,790
Don't be impatient. Don't be impatient.

425
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,380
- Does it look good?
 - Yes!

426
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,750
This one for you two to eat.

427
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,580
You two eat this one. Take it. Take it.

428
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,050
- Thank you, Grandpa.
- Thank you.

429
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,830
Take it.

430
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,460
This one is for you two to eat.

431
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,670
Older Brother, wait for me!

432
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,080
Hurry! Mr. Qiu is blowing sugar art again!

433
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,560
Okay.

434
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,810
- Which one do you want today?
- Mister Qiu.

435
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,570
This one is for you.

436
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,290
Take it. Okay, okay.

437
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,680
This one is for you.

438
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,080
Little Mister, do you want to buy a sugar art?

439
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,770
Little Mister is still the same as the past, only looking at it.

440
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,320
You couldn't bring yourself to eat it even when it melted.

441
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,430
Mister Qiu.

442
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,450
Every miss, lessen your impatience!

443
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:59,970
Your Majesty has said, whoever the jade spinner lands on,

444
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,730
she will be chosen into the harem.

445
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,750
You all just wait for the summons.

446
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,860
Hey! How could there be such logic?

447
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,430
In all of Deep Water's history and former generations,

448
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,430
nothing as ridiculous as this has ever happened before!

449
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,330
All history and former generations are in the past.

450
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,110
Today, His Majesty has spoken.

451
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,170
So we, who are under his command, should follow.

452
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,740
- Let's go.
- Preposterous!

453
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,120
Three queens were from our Prefect Xiping's Manor.

454
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,330
I've never heard of them being chosen by spinning a jade spinner.

455
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,540
What are you smiling about?

456
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:45,170
I think someone who is like a baldhead worries that she has no hair so she put flowers on her head.

457
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,490
You-You're insulting me?

458
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,560
Enough, enough, enough! Enough.

459
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,540
We still have to get by as sisters in the palace. Don't break the harmonious atmosphere.

460
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,860
- Who do you think you are?
- Me?

461
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,400
You were born from a concubine!

462
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,480
Don't think that just because His Majesty chose you before, you're qualified for calling me "sister."

463
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,530
Yeah.

464
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,330
Say, if even those borne from a legal wife aren't picked,

465
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,120
how could she be fit to be our sister?

466
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,410
You wild brat! I'm going to tear your mouth!

467
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,950
You–!

468
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,380
Look at your face that has been kicked by a donkey.

469
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,840
If I were you, I wouldn't dare to come out to scare people.

470
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,540
- Older Sister.
- What?

471
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,730
Your mouth.

472
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,940
What's wrong with my mouth?

473
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,730
- You–!
- Today is really a good day.

474
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,150
The wish that Miss Gao has just made has come true.

475
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,850
Older Sister, your face is so pretty.

476
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,360
Choosing consorts is an important matter.

477
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,130
It's not quite appropriate to treat it like a game, right?

478
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,630
I asked Prime Minister to choose, but Prime Minister wouldn't.

479
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,010
I-I can only ask the gods to choose.

480
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,450
Whoever this lands on will be picked.

481
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:03,240
Summon! Tang Zhirong, Jian Xue, Yuwen Zi,

482
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,320
Fu Jiayi, Na Lanjing, Chen Xiangxie,

483
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,540
Zhang Wanting, Liu Jueqi, into the palace hall!

484
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,620
I'm not included? How could I not be included?!

485
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,910
I'm not included?

486
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,190
Miss Gao, how unfortunate.

487
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,620
Even if Zhirong wants to use you to get higher in status and be sisters,

488
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,520
- I'm afraid there's no chance now.
- You–!

489
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,100
Mister, please have a seat.

490
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,120
Look, you—

491
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:48,960
Zong Yue said you were the one who betrayed your master for selfish gains.

492
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,190
What First Mister said about the past is right.

493
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,140
Why?

494
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,230
Second Mister,

495
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:23,820
do you know what was written on the imperial decree fifteen years ago?

496
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,480
"In the Heir Apparent's manor, no matter if they're male, female, old, young,

497
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,210
high or low in status, are to be killed with legal authority."

498
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,720
What is this?

499
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,200
This is to cut that final tie Heir Apparent Wenyi had with Deep Water!

500
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,390
It was to exterminate his lineage!

501
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,640
Killed with legal authority.

502
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,260
But you're still alive!

503
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,090
I am alive.

504
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,880
I am still alive.

505
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,540
All the people criticize behind my back and call me a traitor.

506
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,510
Saying that I betrayed my master for selfish gains.

507
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,510
But who can understand?

508
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,060
If I didn't get Qi Zhen's trust at that time,

509
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,620
how could I have protected the two misters' lives?

510
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:42,290
That year, when I acted to have betrayed my master for my gains,

511
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:50,090
that was... that was the last thing Heir Apparent entrusted to me!

512
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:58,200
I... Even if I have to go down in history infamously,

513
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,760
I still could never fail him!

514
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,230
I've seen so many ladies today.

515
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,830
In terms of appearance and demeanor,

516
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,250
I think...

517
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,830
you are the best.

518
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,480
Thank you for your compliment, Your Majesty.

519
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,390
What should I reward you with?

520
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,280
You will be conferred Lady Precious.

521
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,640
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Get up.

522
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,520
Your Majesty! The rules of the Deep Water has always been to

523
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,200
name the 4 ladies, Precious, Virtue, Virtuous and Fair among Elegant Misses at the same time.

524
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,810
Then decide on the Queen from among them.

525
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:46,000
There is no previous antecedent event, where titles were given one at a time.

526
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,730
You–

527
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,380
You.

528
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,880
You. Say your names.

529
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,360
My name is Jian Xue.

530
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,300
My father is Jian Shen, an Imperial Secretary from Hanlin Imperial Academy.

531
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,290
My name is Yuwen Zi.

532
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,980
My father is Yuwen Jian, the Deputy of South Island County in the north area.

533
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,870
Miss Yuwen is Prime Minister's goddaughter.

534
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,750
What?

535
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,790
All right, then. Both of you look pleasing to the eye.

536
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,770
How about this, you'll be conferred Lady Virtue.

537
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,830
You'll be Lady Fair.

538
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,870
All the others will be Vibrant Miss!

539
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,170
Thank you, Your Majesty!

540
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

541
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,390
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

542
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,600
Three of the four main lady consorts have been chosen.

543
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,520
There is only one Lady Virtuous missing. There's–

544
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,580
This– Let's end here today, all right?

545
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,120
Let's discuss all others another day. Okay?

546
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,260
Your Majesty.

547
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,660
I didn't expect choosing consorts to be this tiring.

548
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,960
Jiang Feng, accompany me back.

549
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,150
Yes.

550
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,880
Selecting consorts is an important and serious issue!

551
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,760
All right, all right!

552
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,860
If there's anything else, let's discuss after I wake up. Okay?

553
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,300
Second Mister.

554
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,430
Mister Qiu!

555
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:09,260
Second Mister, I dragged out an ignoble existence till now

556
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,210
just to let Mister know who your enemy is.

557
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,990
You can never be softhearted and light-handed;

558
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,110
more so, you can't name the villain as your father!

559
