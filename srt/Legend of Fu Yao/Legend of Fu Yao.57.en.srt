♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,300
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:23,480
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,900
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,400
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,400
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,300
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,300
~ Episode 57 ~

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
I also found out a few things on my side.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,600
I can vaguely see the truth behind the royal palace of Plough.

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,100
Maybe your true identity is deeply connected with the secret of this royal palace.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,000
We must start here.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,200
But if we want to find the truth out, we must still ask one person for help.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
Who are you talking about?

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,100
Alioth.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,500
He is already an old person in this palace.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,560
As Feng Xuan's shadow, everything that happened here in the palace,

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,500
he knows it more than anyone else.

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,200
Why would he help us?

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
I made an agreement with him.

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
As long as I can help him find the whereabouts of his wife and daughter,

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,000
he then will secretly help us here in Plough Palace and try his best to restrict Feng Xuan.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,100
The matter you want to investigate and the truth that I'm looking for are the same.

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,800
Different paths but towards the same ending.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,400
Maybe, the two of us are people of the same boat.

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,500
You are loyally serving under Feng Xuan, bringing disaster to your nation and its citizens, killing loyal and good subjects.

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,200
How can I qualify to be talked about in the same manner as you?

41
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,570
That's right.

42
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,570
I'm being controlled by another.

43
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,800
What other choice could I have?

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,400
For so many years, I've been played by Feng Xuan in the palm of her hand.

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,900
It was not because I desire for wealth, fame, glory, or being able to live a luxurious life.

46
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,200
It's only because...

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,900
there is a knot in my heart that won't go away.

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,500
And the person who can help me untie this knot is Feng Xuan.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,700
Because... only she knows the whereabouts of my wife and daughter.

50
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,400
Only her.

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,760
Veteran, you're looking for Feng Qi and Feng Wuming.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,100
I know that I might never find them.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,200
For so many years, I've hidden behind Feng Xuan to be her assassin

54
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,100
just because she told me that they're still alive.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,400
I dare not listen to her words.

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,400
What if... they are truly still alive?

57
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,750
Veteran,

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,600
your daughter is probably still alive.

59
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,800
Hence, why didn't he know that his wife was already dead?

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Alioth was the commander of the Purple Cloak of Plough Nation.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,360
He had the duty to protect his nation.

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,000
When Feng Qi was eight months pregnant,

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,800
I heard that in the Misty Sea of Fufeng, a sea monster wreaked havoc and the citizens there were in a terrible situation.

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,770
Of course, Alioth wouldn't just sit and not intervene.

65
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,400
He then led his men south to Misty Sea.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,800
In the end, he missed the birth of his own child.

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes. When he returned, five or six months had passed.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,300
Feng Qi and her daughter were already missing.

69
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,600
At that time, Feng Xuan had become the queen.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,800
All these must have been done by Feng Xuan to obtain the royal throne.

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Feng Qi's death must be connected with her.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,430
He also had the same thoughts.

73
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:41,200
But he never expected that other than having a deep desire for the royal throne,

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,270
this Feng Xuan also keeps him in her mind constantly.

75
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:49,200
Afterwards, Feng Xuan used the whereabouts and lives of his wife and daughter to threaten him to stay by her side.

76
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Although Alioth is part of the ten saints, he has made a pact with Plough

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,400
that as long as Feng Xuan is still in power, he would obey her command.

78
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Does Alioth believe her that much?

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,500
It's not that I believe her,

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,600
but it's more that I can't lose this hope.

81
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,200
It's almost twenty years.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,800
Actually, I have stopped imagining that they are still alive,

83
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
but I mustn't end this hope.

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,000
If I don't have even this hope to rely on,

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,100
what else would be my meaning of living in this world?

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,800
I promise you that I'll bring them back to you,

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,400
but you must cooperate with us especially during the critical time.

88
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,460
What do you want?

89
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,070
What do you want in exchange?

90
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,400
If she's really your daughter, I just hope that you two can reunite.

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
That's all.

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,800
Talking about it, this Alioth is also a pitiful person.

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
Hurry! This way!

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,700
Alioth and I agreed to meet at Astute Time Palace two hours from now.

95
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,800
- Hurry up!
- Let's quickly leave now.

96
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,200
Over there!

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,500
Still trying to escape?

98
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,000
I've kept these incenses for a long time.

99
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,400
I initially planned to light them when you get married.

100
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
From the looks of it now,

101
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I don't need to keep storing them anymore.

102
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,180
Zhi'er...

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
you can't blame me for being ruthless

104
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,680
or blame Fan'er for harming you.

105
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,450
If you want to blame anyone, you can only blame being born in the royal clan of Plough.

106
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,800
Since you were born,

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,700
you should have known that this path is a life and death struggle,

108
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,900
that only one will survive in the end.

109
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,200
Of course, I know that the person who killed you isn't that fake doctor.

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,900
Of course, I know that the person who killed you isn't that fake doctor.

111
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,100
I also know you died in an unjust manner.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,100
But so what?

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,300
The phoenix crown of Plough has always been stained with blood.

114
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,600
You are my flesh and blood that I bore in my womb for ten months.

115
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,200
How could I truly bear to watch you die?

116
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,770
But...

117
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,600
your fate was bad.

118
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,450
You heard those words that you shouldn't have heard.

119
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,200
It's not that I don't trust you.

120
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,300
What I don't trust is the rotten hearts of the Plough's royal clan.

121
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,990
The royal throne can only belong to one.

122
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,770
Although you're older by a few years,

123
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,100
in terms of intelligence and strategies, schemes and ruthlessness,

124
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,300
you are way inferior to Fan'er.

125
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,900
This royal throne... is a prison...

126
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,500
and more so a bait.

127
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Massacring one another, not caring about one's life or death,

128
00:09:51,220 --> 00:10:00,800
whoever is the victor in the end will become Plough's most respected person.

129
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:22,310
You should feel fortunate that only one Feng Jingfan competed with you,

130
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:28,100
or else you might have been out of the game long ago.

131
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,000
If you can understand my painstaking efforts,

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,400
then bless and protect your mother while you're in heaven.

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,600
Let me stay on this royal throne longer.

134
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,300
Let my reign be smoother and steadier.

[Astute Time Palace]

136
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,840
What's going on exactly?

137
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,550
Say it.

138
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,090
Unhealthy disease-causing influences can be divided into clean and dirty. Your exterior and interior—

139
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,610
What sickness do I have exactly?

140
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,550
It's... an omen of a demonic poison.

141
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,980
Nonsense!

142
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,400
The queen of Plough will never get poisoned.

143
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,810
Your Majesty, you're wrong.

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,350
Everyone is made of flesh; hence, you can't avoid getting poisoned, dying, encountering disaster and happiness.

145
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,520
Leave.

146
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,260
I have the Plough Phoenix Soluble Elixir protecting me.

147
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,460
No poison within Five Regions can harm me.

148
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,960
I heard that the Phoenix Soluble Elixir indeed has magical effects,

149
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,950
but how much of this rumor is true and how much is fake?

150
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,740
I'm sure Your Majesty knows it more than I.

151
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,930
Moreover, the poison from Firmament isn't that easy to cure, either.

152
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,030
You actually dared to poison me.

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
So despicable.

154
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,240
What is your intention?

155
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,880
I instead want to ask Your Majesty, in poisoning yourself,

156
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,030
in doing this monologue that has caused everyone here in the palace of Plough to feel imperiled,

157
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,670
what is your purpose, Your Majesty?

158
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,740
But Your Majesty need not excessively panic.

159
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,170
The poison I gave you is weak.

160
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,320
It won't kill you.

161
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,780
At most, you'll just look bad.

162
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,640
You are the crown prince of the Imperial City,

163
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,120
the future emperor of the Five Regions.

164
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,450
You shouldn't be doing these kinds of things.

165
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,350
Conniving with evil people to harm the queen of Plough, if this reaches the Imperial City,

166
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,000
your Emperor Father will punish you for your crime.

167
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,600
The inheritance of the royal throne of the different nations in Five Regions can be challenged,

168
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,990
but only your Plough royal throne can't.

169
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,280
If Imperial City learns about the strange occurrences here in Plough,

170
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,470
learns that the flow of the Lava Gold River will be stopping soon,

171
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,100
learns that the person on the throne shouldn't have been you;

172
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,350
let me ask you then, who would be punished for her crime?

173
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,310
You can't be thinking that I will tolerate you all for framing my people and not do anything, right?

174
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,240
Fuyao is a person that I deem more important than my life.

175
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,940
Her one word can match your 100,000 shining spears and armored horses!

176
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,410
If I'm unable to protect the person I love today,

177
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,320
how then can I protect the Five Regions tomorrow?

178
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,950
Your Majesty, you are a smart person.

179
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,380
You probably have guessed my intentions.

180
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,940
I endured everything until today just for one thing,

181
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,710
I want to know what happened in the royal palace of Plough nineteen years ago!

182
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,800
Dream on.

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,800
Dear Shuo, he wants to harm me.

184
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,060
Kill him. Immediately kill him!

185
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,650
I only want to know the truth.

186
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,310
Immediately kill him! Right now!

187
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,960
I never thought that...

188
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,020
even you would betray me.

189
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,870
Kill me then.

190
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,370
Rather than getting covertly killed or poisoned by them,

191
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,060
why don't I just die by your sword today?

192
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,990
Where are they exactly?

193
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,990
Do it.

194
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,880
Move aside.

195
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,420
Princess, you can't go in.

196
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,890
This person is highly skilled in martial arts.

197
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,120
If you get hurt, what should we do?

198
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,700
This lady has committed a grave crime.

199
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,470
As ordered by the queen, she must be immediately eliminated.

200
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,000
You actually dare to block me?

201
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,710
Aren't you going to hurry and drag that female criminal out here now?

202
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,760
The female criminal... has escaped.

203
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,590
What?

204
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,230
You're a bunch of useless garbage!

205
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,710
You couldn't even guard one person?

206
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,860
Quickly go search for her!

207
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,560
Even if you have to turn this place upside down, you have to find her!

208
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,080
Yes!

209
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,020
Student, stop.

210
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,700
Grand Teacher...

211
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,970
No one is allowed to hurt Fuyao.

212
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,340
Grand Teacher, why not?

213
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,880
She's just a bitch!

214
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,330
Do you know what will happen to you for disobeying my command?

215
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,130
Do you still remember the name of this sword?

216
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,860
The Chief Plough Sword.

217
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,720
In it is Merak and Alioth.

218
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,290
It has you and me.

219
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:27,280
In the past, I poured out all the resources of Plough Nation just to make this sword for you.

220
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:36,490
Never expected that today you would attempt to use it to harm me twice.

221
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,040
Dear Shuo, you can refuse to accept me,

222
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,160
ignore me, or betray me.

223
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,540
But... you must not doubt my feelings for you,

224
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:55,720
not treat the efforts I've spent on you as fake.

225
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,700
I don't want to kill anyone!

226
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,290
Just this last time.

227
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,360
Just this one time.

228
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,060
As long as you kill him,

229
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:14,730
I promise you that I will tell you everything that you want to know.

230
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They are all just using you.

231
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Only I care about you the most.

232
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,160
Kill him.

233
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,090
I will tell you the truth then.

234
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,150
I fear that it's too late.

235
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,160
Veteran, look carefully.

236
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,360
Fuyao must be your daughter.

237
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Because she... is Feng Wuming.

238
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,630
Is what he said true or not? True or not?

239
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,420
Tell me, where are my wife and daughter exactly?

240
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,600
With my several years of affection for you,

241
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,820
can it not compare to a few words by a stranger?

242
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,730
Who doesn't know to make up things?

243
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,500
Just to take away my royal throne,

244
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,070
they've invested so much effort and time.

245
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,400
First, killing my first queen heir Feng Jingzhi.

246
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,100
Now, they come to harm me with poison.

247
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,970
And even standing here to make wild remarks to drive a wedge between us.

248
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,560
Creating a fake daughter for you.

249
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,630
Can't you see through it?

250
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,470
They are just using you.

251
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,060
Why must I believe you?

252
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,530
Because your daughter...

253
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,380
has long been dead.

254
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,690
I know that you care so much about your daughter.

255
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,080
I couldn't dare to tell you.

256
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,140
I was afraid that once you learned of this news,

257
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,560
you would lose hope and be unable to continue livng.

258
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,800
Dear Shuo, in this world,

259
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,660
only I care about you.

260
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,860
Even if you hate me or bear a grudge against me,

261
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,140
I won't let you suffer any pain!

262
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,260
But I never thought that they...

263
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,220
they would actually use this matter...

264
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,500
to harm me, to hurt you!

265
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,330
How can you leave people with such evil intentions alive?

266
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:17,200
I'd rather die because of not having any antidote

267
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,490
and hope that you kill them!

268
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,590
Kill these two liars!

269
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,040
Veteran, I've made you a promise.

270
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,860
If she's really your daughter,

271
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,190
I only hope that you two can reunite.

272
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,600
This is my answer and the fulfillment of my promise.

273
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,960
At this point, you can choose to believe or not.

274
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,300
But let me remind you first, that as long as I'm here,

275
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,000
no one can harm Fuyao!

276
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,400
I have a way that can prove if she's really Feng Qi's biological daughter.

277
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,060
Say it!

278
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,160
Open the incense cauldron and light the phoenix gallbladder.

279
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,550
The ancient way of identifying a kin.

280
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,620
Grand Teacher.

281
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,190
Grand Teacher, is it you?

282
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,100
Grand Teacher,

283
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,010
why did you bring me here?

284
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,980
Grand Teacher, I beg you to help me.

285
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,000
Just a small favor.

286
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,840
Help me kill Fuyao.

287
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,250
Help me kill her.

288
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,020
Don't you also want to kill her?

289
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,080
When did I think of killing Fuyao?

290
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,840
I can kill everyone in this world,

291
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,900
but I won't kill her.

292
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,700
Is Grand Teacher also protecting her?

293
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,090
She is a bitch that should have died nineteen years ago! A bitch!

294
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,450
How come all of you are risking your life to protect her?

295
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,080
Why?

296
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,370
Grand Teacher, help me kill her.

297
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,590
Help me...

298
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,260
- Help me.
- Do you really not know?

299
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:07,510
It was written on the Plough's ancient techniques that in verifying the authenticity of a royal bloodline,

300
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,150
a hair from both people will be taken

301
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,990
and then placed inside Yingu after a phoenix gallbladder has been burned.

302
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,450
It says here that once the phoenix gallbladder is completely burned,

303
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:25,070
if you two are really of royal bloodline, there will be a red light inside Yingu.

304
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,060
If not, if you two are completely unrelated,

305
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,990
there then will be a dense and persistent black fog that will envelope this place.

306
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,050
This is the ancient technique of the Plough's royal clan.

307
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,000
It can't go wrong.

308
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,790
You two? You two actually fooled my dear Shuo?

309
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,390
Look. Look.

310
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,620
How could I lie to you?

311
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,100
The one who was lying to you all this time are them!

312
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,790
Your Feng Qi is dead.

313
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,080
Your daughter is also dead.

314
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,920
What you have now is only me, dear Shuo.

315
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:09,570
Dear Shuo, as long as they are around, Plough won't be our Plough anymore!

316
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,960
Wuji!

317
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:43,830
Let me tell you that below Young Phoenix Lake, there is an auspicious fire phoenix.

318
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:50,770
Only the royal heiress of Plough who bears the phoenix spirituality can call it out.

319
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,990
I... am a princess who was born with a lotus flower.

320
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,930
I am the only heiress of the royal clan of Plough.

321
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,430
I have a phoenix spirituality.

322
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,020
I can help you, Grand Teacher.

323
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,800
Just to wake this fire phoenix, I've waited for so long.

324
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,580
Being able to help Grand Teacher is my greatest blessing,

325
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:34,110
as long as Grand Teacher kills Fuyao after I succeed.

326
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,150
She can't live!

327
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,640
She must die!

328
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:47,590
Fuyao... will eventually die.

329
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:54,550
But to how she will die, by what method she will die, only I will decide that.

330
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,750
Grand Teacher said it right.

331
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,190
Her life and death can only be decided by you.

332
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,450
You have the final word.

333
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,140
As long as you are willing to kill her,

334
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,530
I will do anything you want.

335
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,600
I'll call the auspicious fire phoenix for you now.

336
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,860
Quickly come out...

337
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,540
Lad, I don't care about your fight for the royal throne nor will I force you to help me out.

338
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,120
But in this matter, you lied and used me.

339
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,870
You were asking for death!

340
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,020
Veteran, when you were training in Firmament,

341
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,950
have you ever heard of what the phoenix in Young Phoenix Lake is guarding?

342
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,220
What do you want to say?

343
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,900
If the person sitting on the royal throne of Plough Nation doesn't have a phoenix spirituality,

344
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,710
and is unable to suppress the Young Phoenix Lake,

345
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,030
the fire phoenix will then rise high to the sky and disaster will come.

346
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,520
The ones that will suffer this destructive catastrophe won't just be Plough!

347
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,160
Who are you exactly?

348
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,820
It's not important who I am.

349
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,070
What's important is that you must know...

350
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,350
that she's your daughter.

351
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,430
Lying to me... All are lying to me!

352
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,200
All of you are lying to me!

353
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,560
Fuyao!

354
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,660
Quickly come out!

355
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,690
Quickly come out... !

356
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,370
Grand Teacher, believe me! Believe me!

357
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,640
Stop wasting your energy.

358
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,510
You know very well if you would be able to wake the auspicious fire phoenix or not.

359
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,210
I can! I can!

360
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,410
I am the princess born with a lotus flower.

361
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,510
I am... the only heiress.

362
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,720
Believe me Grand Teacher. I can do this.

363
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,470
- You are not the rightful main royal descendant of Plough.
- I am!

364
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,390
You are just a useless imitation.

365
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,370
Imitation?

366
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,930
I am not an imitation!

367
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,570
I'm the rightful one!

368
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,530
I'm not an imitation.

369
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,770
If I'm an imitation, then who is the legitimate heiress of Plough?

370
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,510
Who is?

371
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,880
Who has the real phoenix spirituality?

372
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,360
Who has it?!

373
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,220
Girl's seal has been activated again.

374
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,030
This altar is where the spirits within Plough gathered.

375
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,310
This place can open her third seal.

376
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,770
The true legitimate heiress of Plough has appeared.

377
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,620
Who?

378
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,430
It's Fuyao.

379
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,110
Do you believe it now?

380
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,220
Plough's spiritual phoenix bathed in fire to be born.

381
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,110
It turns out that the blood is the fire,

382
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,900
the phoenix is the queen of Plough.

383
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,910
You are the real legitimate heiress of Plough.

384
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:21,450
You are my biological daughter.

385
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,300
I am finally able to wait for it.

386
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,580
I remember everything.

387
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,820
I initially...

388
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,930
was born in this royal palace of Plough.

389
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,390
They said that I'm a princess that was born with a lotus flower.

390
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,890
Because I was born during the winter,

391
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:22,630
the lotus flowers that originally had withered all blossomed.

392
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,100
You have committed a crime.

393
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,230
Your crime is being born in the royal family.

394
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:34,340
Since you were born, you are destined to have a tragic fate.

395
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,660
Did you come here today to fight with me?

396
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,660
Let me tell you that the royal throne is mine.

397
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,590
Alioth is also mine.

398
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,340
You can't steal him away.

399
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,220
Our daughter still has no name.

400
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,850
I'm going to stay and wait for him to return.

401
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,930
You won't be able to wait for him anymore.

402
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,070
The person who saved me was called Xu Wan.

403
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,700
She is mother's personal servant maid.

404
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:26,020
Afterwards, I learned that to avoid the searches in the palace,

405
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,400
she stayed with me in that narrow secret chamber for 7 days.

406
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,370
She told me to forget about my true identity.

407
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,050
From now on, my name is Wuming.

408
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,650
Afterwards, Xu Wan got banished to Limbo Palace.

409
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,800
Are you that Miss Wan who just arrived?

410
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,660
- She endured all the hard and exhausting work.
- Come...

411
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,560
Open them.

412
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,190
Even if she lived a hard life,

413
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,500
she did everything to hide me and ensure my safety.

414
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,260
If you still want to hide that child...

415
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,660
Just to keep this secret, she went through all those unbearable humiliations.

416
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,870
Just let me have my way.

417
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:50,690
At that time, the abandoned lotus pond behind Limbo Palace was the only place where I could go.

418
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,410
It was also...

419
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,100
the only place where I could let down my guard.

420
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,530
Until that day... I met him.

421
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,090
Who are you?

422
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,880
He was the most good looking person I'd seen.

423
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,290
He was cleaner than all the lotus flowers I'd seen.

424
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:32,360
I was thinking that he must be the brightest and most wonderful god-given gift in this world.

425
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,780
How are you? Are you all right?

426
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,890
Are you cold?

427
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,820
Let's go.

428
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,820
I didn't know how long those happy moments would last.

429
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,010
Maybe, just an instant.

430
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,670
Maybe, forever.

431
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,900
But I knew that it was him who gave me hope.

432
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,490
It was him who showed me that there are still wonderful things in this world

433
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,160
that're worthy for me to keep living for.

434
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,590
What is this?

435
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,900
This is called Mystic Spirit Leaf.

436
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,000
I've been wearing it ever since.

437
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,920
I'll give it to you.

438
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,070
Just treat it as our token.

439
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,390
No one has ever gifted me anything.

440
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,230
I'll be leaving Plough Nation tomorrow.

441
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,700
- Are you willing to leave with me?
- Yes.

442
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,510
What does that mean?

443
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,100
I want to leave, but I can't bear to leave Auntie Wan behind.

444
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,710
Let's bring her with us then.

445
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,940
Your Highness Crown Prince!

446
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,500
I'm leaving now.

447
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,050
It's agreed then. Wait for me here tomorrow at daybreak.

448
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,990
We'll leave this place together.

449
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:18,060
When he said that he'll take me away, I really thought that the dark days would be over.

450
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:25,470
I never thought that the person who would break the agreement and didn't show up was actually me.

451
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,430
Give that to me.

452
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,630
I won't.

453
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,750
Are you going to give it to me or not?

454
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,830
I have a way to make you hand it to me.

455
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,940

00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,480
♫ Have someone's company♫

480
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,490
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

481
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:52,600
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

482
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,480
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

483
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,320
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

484
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,520
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

485
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,770
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

486
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:11,210
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

487
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:16,590
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫
