♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,470
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,700
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,950
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,990
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:39,980
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,600
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,240
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,780
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,910
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,920
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,100
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,500
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,430
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,500
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,640
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,860
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,910
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,880
Stop being so sneaky.

24
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,630
I made this just for you.

25
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,640
Really? You made this just for me?

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,550
How does it taste?

27
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,780
Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!

28
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,360
You must have used all that you saved up, right?

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,740
Let me tell you. Lower your volume.

30
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,000
If the kids outside hear about this,

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,790
I can guarantee that they will finish it with only bones left in no time. Do you believe me?

32
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,100
I won't talk loud. I won't talk loud.

33
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,380
I want that one. That one.

34
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,890
Eat the soup first. Eat the soup first.

35
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,840
All of it is yours.

36
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,070
How does it taste?

37
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,750
I am sorry, Xiaoqi.

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,470
Tell me about it.

39
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,170
Do you still wake up in different places every day?

40
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,510
That's-That's right.

41
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,810
I-I originally thought that I was just dreaming.

42
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,840
But it turns out that it really wasn't a dream.

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,370
I would be in a tree, in the water.

44
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,880
And one time, I woke up in Ancestral Funeral Hall.

45
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,860
Luckily, I ran away quickly. No one saw me.

46
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,100
Do you think that I am being possessed?

47
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,950
Tell me what do you dream about.

48
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,920
But I really can't remember how this dream started.

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,430
Every time, there is nothing there that you can find in real life.

50
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,820
In there, there are no trees, no water, or Ancestral Funeral Hall.

51
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,290
It just darkness, endless darkness.

52
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,390
What else is there?

53
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,510
I can't remember.

54
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,010
It seems like this thing is really coming true.

55
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,500
What are you mumbling to yourself about?

56
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,570
Where is the poker that I gave you?

57
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,630
Poker?

58
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,110
I remember now!

59
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,180
Tell me.

60
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,360
But how can that be?

61
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,090
Didn't I bring the poker to compete?

62
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,670
And then when I fell into the deep pond,

63
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,280
that poker changed in form and shape

64
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,650
and hooked tightly to the bottom of the pond.

65
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,660
That thing was like it could attract souls.

66
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,540
I couldn't take my eyes off it.

67
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,910
How can that be?

68
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,260
You are speaking nonsense again.

69
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,350
It seems that your brain is still not healed yet.

70
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,050
Even the medical sage doesn't work every time.

71
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,010
Do you... Do you not believe what I said?

72
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,330
- I am not lying. Really. Really.
- That's enough.

73
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,200
- Listen to me. Pour that dirty water out.
- No. I'm not...

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,940
- Let me first—
- Do you want to eat or not?

75
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,530
Go pour out the dirty water!

76
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,490
- I will give it to you when you come back.
- Save it for me!

77
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,110
- Don't touch it.
- Okay.

78
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,350
- You—
- Go. Go.

79
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,950
I really saw it.

80

81

Greeting, Clique Leader Yan.

82
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,140
Give out the stuff.

83
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,030
What stuff?

84
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,810
Are you playing possum?

85
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,650
The bead used for the game.

86
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,390
The bead used for the game?

87
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,280
That... We didn't see that.

88
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,200
The Hologram Box never lies.

89
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,880
The blinking point was in the kitchen of your Mystic Black Section.

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,590
The bead must be here.

91
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,810
Hand it in.

92
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,490
Don't wait until we search around.

93
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,700
I already told you, I didn't see it.

94
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,230
You look like an honest person.

95
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,160
- I didn't expect that you don't even blink when you lie.
- Clique Leader Yan.

96
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,780
What do you want that stuff for?

97
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,290
You didn't hide it in her place, did you?

98
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,680
Uncle.

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,060
You... listen to me.

100
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,350
Although we are people from the Mystic Black Section,

101
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,040
we don't do things like stealing.

102
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,700
That's hard to say.

103
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,970
Old Zhou is an elderly of Mt. Mystic Soul.

104
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,110
It's unlikely that it's him.

105
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,130
Fuyao!

106
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,010
Hand it in.

107
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,530
- Hurry and take it out!
- I don't have it.

108
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,350
- Check to see if you have it on you.
- I—

109
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,750
- Take a look!
- How is it possible?

110
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,190
- Won't you—
- Why would I take something like that? Look.

111
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,010
Look.

112
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:04,140
You... I will teach you a lesson later, kid!

113
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,480
The child is still young.

114
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,020
I didn't teach her well.

115
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,390
What do you mean not teaching her well?

116
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,560
She is obviously stealing. What else are you going to say?

117
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,350
You-You must not say that!

118
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,910
I can't bear the responsibility of the word "stealing."

119
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,150
Not just me, everyone in the Mystic Black Section can't bear the responsibility.

120
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,570
Take her away.

121
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,470
Wait...

122
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,390
- Clique Leader Yan.
- Uncle Zhou, you—

123
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,970
All the mistakes are my fault.

124
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,970
You must not take the child away.

125
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,850
If you need to take someone away, then take me away!

126
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,680
- I was wrong. I was wrong.
- Uncle Zhou!

127
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,170
- I am begging you, Clique Leader Yan. I am begging you.
- Uncle Zhou.

128
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,460
- I beg you.
- Get up, Uncle Zhou.

129
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,170
I really don't know why the bead was on me.

130
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,220
But I know the rules of the Hunting and Fighting Game.

131
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,930
The person who is in possession of this bead can enter the third round of the game.

132
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,450
Let's stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking.

133
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,550
Let me finish talking!

134
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,270
Since this bead is on me,

135
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,320
it means-it means that it was already on me when I fell into the deep pond.

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,410
Since I entered the second round of the game,

137
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,520
does that mean with this bead, I can continue onto the third round of the game?

138
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,310
- Shut up!
- Let me finish talking!

139
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,990
Do you still want to enter the third round of the game?

140
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,690
What nonsense are you speaking?

141
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,060
I didn't say anything wrong!

142
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,220
May I ask if this bead had another owner before me?

143
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,800
It doesn't have another owner.

144
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,070
- Then that's right.
- Stop talking. Stop talking.

145
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,950
Then this bead belongs to me.

146
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,930
I can enter the third round of the game.

147
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,050
All right then.

148
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,300
Since you are so heedless to the consequences,

149
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,600
I will fulfill your wish.

150
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,190
Fuyao! Fuyao! I—

151
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you hungry?

152
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,110
Here.

153
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,230
Has the bead been found?

154
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,800
Remember, when the owner asks a question, you must answer first.

155
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,550
This is the rule between us.

156
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,540
If you're always hungry for food, you will get so fat that you won't be able to work.

157
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,510
I can only send you back home.

158
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,790
They've found the bead, haven't they?

159
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,830
That girl wants to enter the competition, doesn't she?

160
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:03,480
I am curious as to how you will get past the final round.

161
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,700
Uncle Zhou, have you woken up yet?

162
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,620
Uncle Zhou?

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,290
I know that you are listening.

164
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,260
Today is the last day of the Hunting and Fighting Game.

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,030
I'm kowtowing to you.

166
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,120
You know that I've been stubborn since my youth.

167
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,610
I always cause trouble.

168
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,300
Luckily, you have been protecting me all these times.

169
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,570
I usually talk back and upset you.

170
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,690
Although I haven't talked about it, I understand them all.

171
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,140
You are doing everything for my good.

172
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,310
You are afraid that I'll suffer.

173
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,070
I don't have any other relatives. I—

174
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,270
I only have you.

175
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,800
If-If something unfortunate happens to me today...

176
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:04,030
If-If something unfortunate happens to me today...

177
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,230
take care, Uncle Zhou.

178
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,570
- Prime Minister.
- Clique Leader Yan, please.

179
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,350
Prime Minster, please.

180
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,210
The last round will be a one-on-one duel.

181
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,080
But to choose the last two people, they still have to go through a round in an imaginary realm.

182
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,610
These Dragon Candles with twelve colors represent the twelve contestants.

183
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,500
The intensity on the Dragon Candles represents my students’ results.

184
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,830
The last two burning Dragon Candles represent the students who break through the imaginary realm

185
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,750
and will continue to the final round.

186
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,730
What happened?

187
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,930
They will not lose.

188
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,990
Look, the Dragon Candle doesn't have much fuel left.

189
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,100
Clique Leader Yan, there’s only three Dragon Candles left now.

190
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,180
I wonder if Young Folk Hero Yan can successfully exit from the realm.

191
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,420
Don't be so impatient, Prime Minister.

192
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,380
Let's wait a while more.

193
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,700
- It's Fuyao.
- It's Fuyao for real.

194
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,020
Fuyao.

195
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:45,800
First Senior Brother!

196
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,000
First Senior Brother.

197
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,070
How come it's you?

198
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,030
Miss!

199
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,960
Miss.

200
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,750
Yuan Bao!

201
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,950
Come here. Come here.

202
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,480
There’s food on the table for you. Hurry up.

203
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,970
Never did I think that the last person to battle with me would be you.

204
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,130
I also never thought that the last one standing here would be me.

205
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,800
But how is this possible?

206
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,400
How were you able to pass all these different obstacles?

207
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,480
Was it just by luck?

208
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,430
But a person's luck couldn't always be so good.

209
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,950
That's right.

210
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,260
A person's luck won't always hold out,

211
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,550
but one won't always get misfortunes, either.

212
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,900
Fuyao, you are not my opponent.

213
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,930
Standing here is already enough for you to take off your black garment.

214
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,760
I don't want to see you get hurt.

215
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,690
Withdrawing now can allow you to leave without injuries.

216
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,170
Thank you, First Senior Brother, for your concern.

217
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,540
I clearly know that I'm inferior to you.

218
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,930
But I traveled all the way and am standing here now.

219
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,230
If I can’t compete with First Senior Brother fairly,

220
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,770
I will not be able to face myself and everyone here.

221
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,580
Are you really going to be against me?

222
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,160
Of course, I'm not going to be against you.

223
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,790
I just want to give myself a conclusion.

224
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:09,680
If I can leave here alive after this competition, I'll be a free person.

225
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,740
I can then leave Mt. Mystic Soul and you.

226
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,410
I can go out to the outer world and take a look.

227
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,720
So today’s competition

228
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,170
will be the last memory between you and I on Mt. Mystic Soul.

229
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,040
You're leaving?

230
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,680
I've grown up, First Senior Brother.

231
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,300
Teacher, Pei Yuan has something to say.

232
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,460
Say it.

233
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,810
We don't know where that lowly slave Fuyao learned a type of evil martial arts.

234
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,560
She was able to overcome all difficulties.

235
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,620
That technique is definitely not from our Mystical Soul Clique.

236
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,590
You should stop the competition and investigate the technique she's using.

237
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,010
Kick her out of the clique.

238
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,460
Attack.

239
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,640
Does it just start like that?

240
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,700
I heard that the swordsmanship of Mystic Soul Clique tops the Five Regions.

241
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,060
Today, we all must watch and learn from this.

242
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,140
Clique Leader Yan.

243
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,300
- Clique Leader Yan.
- Yes?

244
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,640
When are we starting?

245
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,280
Teacher.

246
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
The last round of the Hunting and Fighting Game

247
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,000
starts now.

248
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,200
Fuyao.

249
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,000
I said before, swords are ruthless.

250
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Once we become competitors, I won’t show mercy.

251
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,500
Me, either.

252
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,300
I lost, First Senior Brother.

253
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,620
♫ I don’t know about the migration of snow geese, ♫

254
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,200
♫ Voyage of the fishes or the loneliness of plants, mountain and water ♫

255
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,600
♫ Following my own heart, walk forward step by step ♫

256
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,200
♫ Sadness, cowardice and broken heart brought me a new life ♫

257
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:21,200
♫ I'm able to take it with no fear ♫

258
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:28,200
♫ I can’t apprehend why fate departs from my initial intention ♫

259
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:35,000
♫ Life and death, come and go, are all like duckweed ♫

260
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,400
♫ I risk my all in exchange for a peace of mind ♫

261
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,530
♫ Overcome all the difficulties in the way ♫

262
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:48,300
♫ Sweep away all obstacles ♫

263
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,600
♫ Even if I don't know how to pull out the sword of time, ♫

264
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,200
Fuyao, do you know in what direction Capital Kun is?

265
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,730
It's over there.

266
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:09,500
One day, I will take you to Capital Kun together.

267
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,600
Really?

268
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,800
Of course.

269
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
♫ Even if I don't know how to get down the horse of time, ♫

270
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,800
♫ How colors in one's dream exaggerate, ♫

271
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I'm announcing that the brave champion of this Hunting and Fighting Game

272
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,800
is the first senior student of the Ling generation in our clique, Yan Jingchen!

273
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:44,000
First Senior Brother! First Senior Brother!

274
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,600
First Senior Brother! First Senior Brother!

275
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,700
Everyone. Everyone, it's clear that the girl just now threw her sword.

276
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,200
Does she make a concession?

277
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
- Indeed.
- No wonder she intentionally and humbly gave way.

278
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,600
- Uncle Zhou.
- The opponent is the son of the Clique Leader.

279
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,300
This is just yielding the fight.

280
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,870
Clique Leader Yan, I’ll give you a toast.

281
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,700
Everyone, thank you for your attendance.

282
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,400
I, Mr. Yan, give everyone a toast.

283
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,000
Clique Leader Yan, this competition was quite unfair.

284
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,200
- Right.
- Clique Leader Yan.

285
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,850
How many rounds were there only?

286
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,600
Are you all brushing us off with just that?

287
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
We all came from so far away.

288
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,300
Are we just here to do a routine walk and

289
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,400
drink your Mystic Soul Clique’s wine?

290
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,200
- Right.
- That's way too unfair.

291
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
That's right.

292
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,800
Clique Leader, even I, the Heir Apparent, also think that it was unfair.

293
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,000
Why don’t you let them compete again?

294
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
- Right.
- Compete again.

295
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,000
Right.

296
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
One more round.

297
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Everyone here doesn’t know.

298
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,500
This Fuyao was originally a lowly slave in our Mystic Soul Clique.

299
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,600
She’s a dog that serves people.

300
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,000
When she was young, she got abandoned below the mountain.

301
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,100
When she was six years old, she still didn’t know her name.

302
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,800
It was Clique Leader and First Senior Brother

303
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,000
who thought she was pitiful and took her into the clique.

304
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,500
Who knew that she actually broke the rules and learned martial arts secretly,

305
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,200
and secretly registered for the Hunting and Fighting Game.

306
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,200
As a lowly slave, she was supposed to be executed.

307
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
It were because of Clique Leader and First Senior Brother's kindness,

308
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
they allowed her to live till today.

309
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,300
Allowed her to take part in the Hunting and Fighting Game.

310
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,200
Who'd think that this lowly slave would be so evil.

311
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Who knows where she learned this seducing witchcraft

312
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,100
and overcame all the difficulties in the way by this seducing witchcraft.

313
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,000
If you saw it clearly just now,

314
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,350
it won't be hard to tell.

315
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,200
It was clearly that First Senior Brother had the upper hand.

316
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,100
It was she who used her seducing witchcraft to seduce First Senior Brother.

317
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,800
Good thing that First Senior Brother has a strong mind and

318
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,200
is profound in martial arts, so he didn’t fall into her trap.

319
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,900
First Senior Brother, am I right?

320
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,570
Say it.

321
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,300
Is she right?

322
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,500
Yes.

323
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
Everyone heard it?

324
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,600
Such a lowly witch.

325
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,400
How could we allow her to run wild during the Hunting and Fighting Game?

326
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,100
Based on my thoughts, it’s better to kill her.

327
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,200
Fuyao.

328
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,400
Since I’m a shameless and lowly slave maidservant in your eyes,

329
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,200
then I’ll show you what kind of witchcraft I learned.

330
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Fuyao.

331
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Pull out your sword.

332
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,800
Why are you only defending but not attacking?

333
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,200
I let you have three moves first because I used to call you Senior Brother.

334
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
I don't need you to yield.

335
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,800
Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

336
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,500
First Senior Brother, you've lost.

337
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,090
- What's going on?
- Right.

338
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,780
Why did the Clique Leader get involved?

339
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,470
What's going on?

340
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:25,810
Everyone, the move she just demonstrated was from Po Jiu Xiao, a set of moves that has been stolen from the clique.

341
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,860
This set of moves is aggressive and hard to get under control.

342
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,840
If someone with an unkind heart trains in it, they will become someone evil and will be hard to eliminate.

343
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,480
That's why our ancestors sealed it.

344
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,900
They don't want a traitor to come out of our clique.

345
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,260
Today, under the pressure of the circumstances, I, Yan Lie,

346
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,130
was forced to seal her Kung Fu, in order to figure things out.

347
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:47,560
This is an internal matter within my clique.

348
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,990
Everyone please understand.

349
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,510
- That's right.
- How is it possible that the First Senior Brother lost?

350
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,390
That's right.

351
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,350
She learned it in secret.

352
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,120
You are so despicable!

353
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,360
You actually launched a sneak attack on me!

354
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,310
You've learned the top secret techniques of this clique secretly.

355
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,060
I am just acting according to the clique rules.

356
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,720
When did I learn the top secret techniques of your clique secretly?

357
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,930
You let me go!

358
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,190
It's better for you to be honest.

359
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,090
I've used the cosmic chain to seal your limbs and inner vital channels.

360
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,020
No matter how capable you are, you can't get out of it.

361
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,720
You are the mighty Clique Leader and yet you are using such despicable methods.

362
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,910
What do you want exactly?

363
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,470
I want you to hand me the technique manual of Breaking the Nine Clouds.

364
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,190
Where would I get the technique manual of Breaking the Nine Clouds?

365
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,030
Stop pretending!

366
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,910
Where did you learn the techniques? Who taught you?

367
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,130
No one taught me!

368
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,580
All right, then.

369
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,940
I will keep you for as long as you don't tell me.

370
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,290
If you won't say for the lifetime, then I will keep you here for a lifetime.

371
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,150
You!

372
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,340
Think about it.

373
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,180
Let go of me! Let go of me!

374
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,600
Come back! Come back!

375
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,830
Let go of me! Let go of me!

376
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,340
Young Master, eat some food.

377
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,420
Clique Leader.

378
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,840
Does Jing Chen still not eat anything?

379
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,920
Young Master hasn't eaten for three days.

380
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,120
Father.

381
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,560
You merely lost the Hunting and Fighting Game.

382
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,720
You lose your wits this much.

383
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,370
How would you be able to achieve greatness in the future?

384
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,850
Stand up.

385
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,000
Follow me.

386
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,670
The ancestors of Mystic Soul above,

387
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:57,950
student Yan Lie, after looking so hard for so long, is finally able to see Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

388
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:01,670
I didn't disappoint my past ancestors.

389
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,260
Right now, the secret manual is within the Mt. Mystic Soul.

390
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,160
I will not let it continue to be hidden.

391
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,830
No matter how,

392
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,220
I will surely get it back to redeem our Mystic Soul Clique's past glory.

393
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:20,570
In the future, we, Mystic Soul, will definitely top the Five Regions.

394
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,640
Father, why did I never know that there was a secret path here?

395
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,620
This is a secret passed down among the Clique Leaders every generation.

396
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,520
The two of you!

397
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,030
You've worked hard. You've worked hard.

398
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,840
These are some desserts made by Mystic Black Section.

399
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,800
I made it purposely for you both.

400
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,330
Old Man, you really know who to fawn.

401
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,250
If you can persuade her,

402
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,690
Clique Leader said, you'll get rewarded heavily.

403
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,760
If she doesn't even listen to your words,

404
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,120
then you don't have to leave that old life of yours.

405
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,580
Right.

406
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,810
All right. Go in.

407
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,860
Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou!

408
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,160
Did they beat you?

409
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,820
All right. No one will eavesdropping about this.

410
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,530
What are you doing?

411
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,820
I put in some sleeping pills.

412
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,460
They'll sleep for two hours with no problem.

413
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,120
You... how come you know how to do that?

414
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,990
There're a lot of things I can do.

415
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,710
Uncle Zhou.

416
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,910
Let me see.

417
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,620
How is it? Does it hurt?

418
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,280
Just external injuries. They couldn't even compare to your poker.

419
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,170
You, this kid.

420
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:36,200
I always thought that if you could peacefully stay in Mystic Black Section forever,

421
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,380
it would be great.

422
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:44,060
Yes, although we are slave servants, but you can’t—

423
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,930
It's all right.

424
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,900
Everything is fated.

425
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,920
What's wrong?

426
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,750
I worked hard to hide it,

427
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,410
but you still were able to learn Breaking the Nine Clouds.

428
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,250
But I didn't learn it.

429
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,500
It was just in my dream.

430
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,670
Could it be... Could it be that is Breaking the Nine Clouds?

431
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,780
What really is that Breaking the Nine Clouds?

432
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,100
Breaking the Nine Clouds is a swordsmanship, a nascent soul,

433
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,180
an illusion and even a heart's demon.

434
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,910
It is a technique created by nature.

435
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,860
It's even a chaotic force of both heaven and earth.

436
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,580
It can break the balance of the world

437
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,850
and also the worries within one's heart.

438
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,940
It has a moving soul, a life, and never exists alone.

439
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,810
It's just like a nascent soul carved inside the cultivating person,

440
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,870
formless, invisible, and sharing life and death.

441
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,570
Was the Breaking the Nine Clouds recorded in a book?

442
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,000
