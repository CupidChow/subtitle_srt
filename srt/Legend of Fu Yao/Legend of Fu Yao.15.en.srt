♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,600
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,820
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,930
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,970
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,770
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,590
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,120
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10

♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,540
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

~ Episode 15 ~

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,850
Prime Minister, please.

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,600
Your Majesty, Prime Minister has arrived.

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,510
- Prime—
- Your Highness.

25
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,500
I should call you differently today.

26
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,130
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,010
What's going on?

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,320
Could it be that Your Majesty has watched too many plays

29
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,250
and you want to do cosplay?

30
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,860
Prime Minister, what do you mean by this?

31
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,690
When I was on Mt. Mystic Soul, Your Majesty suddenly disappeared.

32
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,680
I couldn't eat or drink well and had been wishing for Your Majesty's return.

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,500
A few days ago, I heard that Your Majesty appeared at the slave market.

34
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,100
I immediately sent soldiers over to investigate.

35
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,720
I didn't hear anything all along.

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,460
But today, Your Majesty suddenly appeared.

37
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,270
Your Majesty, and yet you are asking me questions.

38
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,290
How would I think?

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,860
Prime Minister, you misunderstood.

40
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,350
I definitely did not intentionally avoid Prime Minister.

41
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,330
I’m a useless imperial heir to start with.

42
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,470
Aside from knowing how to sing and act for a bit, I am not good at anything.

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,070
First, you guys told me that I am the heir apparent.

44
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,070
I originally thought that Heaven finally opened his eyes,

45
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,310
that this throne of the Xuanyuan clan finally belonged to me.

46
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,880
But I haven't even sat on the throne yet,

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,820
and I've already been kidnapped and have been the target of assassination.

48
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,540
I was forced to drift from place to place and suffered through many hardships.

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,520
If I have to pay with my life in order to sit on this throne,

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,230
then I am better off not getting this throne at all!

51
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,210
From what you're saying, when Your Majesty went missing in the Mt. Mystic Soul,

52
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,260
you were kidnapped by kidnappers.

53
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,810
Prime Minister, I was hoping every day that

54
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,130
you would come save me.

55
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,850
Do you know the backgrounds of this group of kidnappers?

56
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,930
How would I recognize them?

57
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,490
I just heard someone mention a marquis.

58
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,530
It seems like he had something to do with everything.

59
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,830
I wonder what the personage is.

60
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,890
Then how did Your Majesty escape?

61
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,750
That group of kidnappers!

62
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,240
Although they never abused me,

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,240
I still suffered through a lot!

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,790
I was muddled the entire way as I was escorted to Capital Kun.

65
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,080
And I was then locked up in a secret chamber that was completely dark.

66
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,380
Until a few days ago, when their guards suddenly loosened their hold,

67
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,230
and so I used the opportunity to escape.

68
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,020
Just like that?

69
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,910
Then why did Your Majesty suddenly appear at the slave market?

70
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,840
After I escaped from the secret chamber,

71
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,910
I had no money on me and I almost died of starvation.

72
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,980
I heard that Prime Minister frequently appeared at the slave market.

73
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,790
That's why I went there to search for you.

74
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,050
Who knew that as soon as I arrived at the slave market, I would encounter such chaos.

75
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,470
I am not good at martial arts and am not nimble with my movements.

76
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,030
I carelessly let a lowly slave stab me with a sword.

77
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,480
If I hadn't bumped into the prefecture princess,

78
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,440
I would have died.

79
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,410
Your Majesty, you must have been frightened.

80
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,060
Please tell me my punishments.

81
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,580
Prime Minister, please don't say that.

82
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,630
You see, I am still just an heir apparent.

83
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,400
I already had a lot of hardships and suffered so much.

84
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,560
If I really do sit on that throne,

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,790
do I still want my life?

86
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:32,180
After manipulating water today, you no longer have a say whether you want to take the throne of Deep Water.

87
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,080
Here, let me change your clothes for you.

88
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,290
How is it?

89
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,250
That lowly slave really injured me.

90
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,740
My wounds have not healed yet.

91
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,380
I am too clumsy.

92
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,490
It's better if I ask for someone to change your clothes.

93
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,920
Someone!

94
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,960
Prime Minister.

95
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,040
You haven't told me,

96
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,830
if someone wants to do harm to me,

97
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,800
then what should I do?

98
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,330
I am here.

99
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,050
Who dares to harm you?

100
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,920
You!

101
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,800
Didn't you see how Xiaoqi is?

102
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,050
He is almost dying!

103
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,190
Didn't you see that Prime Minister's Manor is on high alert today with heavy guarding?

104
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,930
No matter how good your martial arts are, you won't be able to get through!

105
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,220
Let alone bringing that sickly weak boy with you!

106
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,130
He can't endure much for any longer!

107
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,630
You must be calm, especially in this kind of situation.

108
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,870
Pei Yuan's target is you. As long as you don't appear,

109
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,200
she won't let Xiaoqi die.

110
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,350
If Xuanyuan Min was the one who told you to come say these things to me today,

111
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,890
let me tell you, that's not necessary!

112
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,270
If you have anything to say, say it to him directly.

113
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,580
I won't be your messenger.

114
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,910
Also, if you want to save Xiaoqi, stay put in the manor.

115
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,470
When you calm down, you will automatically come up with a solution.

116
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,210
Welcome Your Majesty.

117
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,070
Kneel down.

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,090
Welcome Your Majesty!

119
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,460
Bow!

120
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,230
Rise!

121
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,180
Offer the Royal Seal!

122
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,180
Kneel down!

123
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,190
Bow!

124
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,310
Rise!

125
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,620
Bow again!

126
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,800
Rise!.

127
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,740
Third bow!

128
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,220
Rise!

129
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,310
[Prime Minister's Manor]

130
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,180
He didn't eat it at all?

131
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,870
Wait.

132
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,890
Tell the kitchen not to put out the fire of the stove.

133
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,620
Perhaps Old Master will get hungry some time.

134
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,120
Yes.

135
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,350
How is Prime Minister?

136
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,300
It's been almost four hours.

137
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,170
Old Master just locks himself up in the study room.

138
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,810
Mr. Yun, what do you think is wrong with Old Master?

139
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,520
You must urge him.

140
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Do you believe it?

141
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,060
What is Godfather saying?

142
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,700
Life or death, poor or rich, are all fated.

143
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,140
Could it be that everything happened today,

144
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,530
Heaven had planned for it a long time ago?

145
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,560
Godfather is overthinking.

146
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,380
In order to wear the imperial robe and become the king, I put so much into planning for years.

147
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,480
I even had to betray people and leave my family

148
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,900
and bear the infamy of a traitor.

149
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,010
In the end, after exhausting every power of my mind,

150
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,030
and yet all I got was the loss of everything.

151
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,520
What exactly did I do wrong?

152
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,050
I clearly already obtained the Water Manipulation Technique that day.

153
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,730
And yet today, I lost again.

154
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,180
Huh?

155
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,760
Why?

156
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,940
Have you pacified that girl?

157
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,640
It seems like you have the free time to care about other people.

158
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,720
Can you be more gentle?

159
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,630
Are you jealous?

160
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,040
You can really be ruthless to yourself.

161
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,950
If I hadn't, that Old Fox Qi Zhen wouldn't believe me easily.

162
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,830
Does he believe it?

163
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,420
I am afraid that he is even suspicious of himself at least three times a day.

164
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,920
How would he believe me that easily?

165
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,380
Put this medicine on three times a day and your wound will be healed.

166
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,650
You say, this Qi Zhen must be so confused.

167
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,100
He clearly already obtained the Water Manipulation Technique long ago,

168
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,210
and yet he got into an embarrassed situation like this.

169
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,630
Do you know the reason behind it?

170
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,650
I don't know what you did.

171
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,830
I only know that the only people who can activate Water Manipulation Technique are the bloodlines of Xuanyuan clan.

172
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,940
When Qi Zhen was able to try manipulating water that night, naturally, it wasn't his own ability.

173
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,190
You weren't there that day.

174
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,920
Don't you want to ask me who that person is?

175
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,190
That day when he tried manipulating water,

176
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,190
I was only using the ability of the bloodline of Xuanyuan that was by his side.

177
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,330
And then today, I just intentionally sent that person away from him.

178
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,990
My business, you don't have to get involved.

179
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,830
I am already enthroned as the King of Deep Water,

180
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,010
and you are just telling me not to get involved.

181
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,410
You know very well the matter I am talking about.

182
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,460
Things have developed to the current situation.

183
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,830
You should tell him the truth, right?

184
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,430
If there is nothing urgent in the future, don't ask for me to come to the palace.

185
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,960
There are tens of thousands of eyes on your position.

186
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,290
If you want to die, don't drag me with you.

187
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,120
I am afraid right now

188
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,830
there are already dangers waiting for me.

189
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,210
What you mean is?

190
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,920
Qi Zhen painfully lost his throne, but he definitely wouldn't give up just like that.

191
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,800
I am guessing that he will try to assassinate again.

192
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,980
Your Majesty.

193
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,540
Come in!

194
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,010
Your Majesty.

195
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,940
Greetings to Medical Sage Zong.

196
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,690
Look. This is the butler of the inner servants, Butler Cao.

197
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,640
All my big and small matters are handled by him.

198
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,250
If there's nothing else, I will be leaving now.

199
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,390
I will send you off.

200
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,190
Medical Sage Zong has superb skills in medicine with healing hands and a kind heart.

201
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,850
Just a few needles in, and I already feel my whole body is unobstructed.

202
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,310
For all this, I really have to thank Prime Minister for being thoughtful and considerate.

203
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,860
I, the King, am gratified to see that.

204
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
Butler Cao.

205
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,630
Your Majesty, according to the rules of the Deep Water Palace,

206
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,160
when a new king is enthroned, he must host a big celebration within the capital for the officials.

207
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,310
The inner court had specifically chosen a few dates.

208
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,490
Please take a look and decide.

209
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,840
It's not fun having a big celebration.

210
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,690
Nothing much can happen from eating.

211
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,510
Let's do something new.

212
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,750
Before, when I was in Quan City, I already heard that

213
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,690
the royalties of Deep Water have a tradition of hunting.

214
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,790
It will be grand and exciting.

215
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,650
Change it to hunting.

216
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,360
Hunting?

217
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,860
The hunting season in Deep Water is in the last month of the lunar year.

218
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,060
Plus, the inner court did not prepare before hand.

219
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,780
Whether you guys arranged it or not, I don't care.

220
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,120
- Whether it is the season to hunt, I don't care about that either.
- That—

221
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,750
You just have to know that a new king is enthroned and Deep Water is auspicious.

222
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,990
At a time like this, that's the best season to hunt.

223
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,180
This...

224
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,920
What?

225
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,150
Do you disagree?

226
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,030
No, no. I don't dare.

227
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,720
It's just that, this hunting event is happening in a rush.

228
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,360
I will go immediately to notify inner court of Imperial Business

229
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,760
and let them arrange it as soon as possible.

230
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,680
I will trouble Butler Cao for it.

231
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,210
Yes. I will be leaving.

232
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,010
Godfather, take care of your health.

233
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,450
No one could have predicted all that happened today.

234
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,720
In the future, we can just find another good opportunity and try to achieve our goals again.

235
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,150
Furthermore, Xuanyuan Min being the new king on the throne

236
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,270
is better than someone from Zhang Henian.

237
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,180
Do you think he is simple?

238
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,980
What Xuanyuan Min said, I only believe 30% of it.

239
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,180
Today, if the situation wasn't that critical,

240
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,200
how would I let him be the king?

241
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,510
Then what Godfather saying is... ?

242
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,260
Since I have given up everything and stepped on this path of conspiracy,

243
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,410
I must burn all the bridges and cause the skies to change.

244
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,450
You must remember.

245
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,530
Today, the person who stole my throne;

246
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:49,260
in the future, I must make him pay this debt with his blood!

247
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,090
You all, go out.

248
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,120
I want to nap for a bit.

249
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,440
Tell people not to bother me.

250
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,960
Yes.

251
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,920
There are assassins! There are assassins!

252
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,720
There are assassins!

253
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,240
Didn't we agree that you would leave as soon as this matter was resolved?

254
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,750
Why did you break your promise?

255
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,900
What's there to worry about?

256
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,570
That muddled Prime Minister has long thought that I, the short-lived heir apparent, have died with my corpse and all tracks obliterated.

257
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,470
Even if someone comes in now, who can recognize that I am Xuanyuan Hui?

258
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,200
You.

259
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,190
You've gone back on your word.

260
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,220
You clearly said that if I helped you, you would have a real fight with me.

261
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,000
Today, I have knocked out all your guards outside this palace.

262
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,440
What excuse could you have?

263
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,620
When did I agree to you?

264
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,680
From beginning to end, I never wanted you to meddle with my business in Deep Water.

265
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,320
You didn't cultivate yourself well in Firmament.

266
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,640
Relying on your knowing of Firmament's Water Manipulation Technique, you actually hurt Xuanyuan Hui on purpose.

267
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,110
Why else would I ask you to impersonate?

268
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,330
The things I want to do, who can stop me?

269
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,810
If you do not have a proper fight with me today,

270
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,490
I will turn this place upside down.

271
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,640
We will see how you continue being a king.

272
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,870
Taiyan, stop causing trouble.

273
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,560
I won't. What can you do to me?

274
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,470
I said, you cannot win.

275
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,130
If you want to win over me, you should go back and cultivate for another thirty to fifty years.

276
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,000
That does not count! Let's fight again.

277
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,840
One try is like this, and it is the same after ten tries.

278
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,000
Taiyan, you are always pestering me.

279
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,330
Is it really only for fighting?

280
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,530
You... Quickly release me!

281
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,880
Once I release you, go back immediately.

282
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,290
If you don't listen, don't complain if I report to Uncle Teacher and call for people to take you away.

283
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,110
- You are really—
- Giving you too much leeway.

284
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,740
Taiyan, I will remember your favor on things you've helped out today.

285
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,350
Don't waste my rare good intention.

286
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,620
I don't want you to remember any favor.

287
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,250
One day, I will beat you.

288
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,960
Master, the Prefecture Princess—

289
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,510
Do not mind her.

290
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,430
I've hurt her acupoints.

291
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,680
She won't be able to come out of the cultivation until three to five months later.

292
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,870
But is this okay?

293
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,320
After all, she is—

294
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,090
You also came here to say these useless things.

295
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,480
A secret letter from Megrez Imperial City.

296
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,370
[Ji'er, I heard that Earth Absorbing Bell appears in Capital Kun. Please obtain it and send it to Imperial City.]

297
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,600
[You also need to finish your trip in Deep Water and return to Megrez as soon as possible. ~ Father]

298
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,440
Is it something troublesome?

299
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,850
Unexpectedly, this Earth Absorbing Bell has just surfaced.

300
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,060
Everyone knew about it right away.

301
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,530
Then, how is Mister planning to face this?

302
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,930
Now everybody wants to get this Earth Absorbing Bell.

303
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,420
It would not be glamorous for me to be unable to complete my duties.

304
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,230
I understand.

305
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,860
[Prime Minister’s Manor]

306
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,020
Although our Face Changing Technique of Qiongye can make you look like the real one,

307
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,290
it has a fatal flaw.

308
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,340
What flaw?

309
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,780
After changing your face, it can only last for five days.

310
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,090
In order to not to show the flaw, the spell will have to be cast again.

311
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,490
It’s almost five days.

312
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,800
If Little Tail doesn’t help me recast the spell, I’ll be exposed after an hour.

313
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,890
I will return to my original face.

314
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,610
Miss.

315
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,890
What is Miss doing?

316
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,920
I am about to dress and do my makeup.

317
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,360
Then, go for a walk.

318
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,740
Today, His Majesty invited the officers to attend the hunting event.

319
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,740
I fear that their female family members will have to accompany.

320
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,940
Miss should not go running about.

321
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,250
Hunting?

322
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,800
I was always afraid of bloody scenes since I was a child.

323
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,440
Can you help me tell the Prime Minister that

324
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,850
I'm not feeling well and will not be going?

325
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,290
This is not Changning Manor.

326
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,210
You cannot act willfully and make a scene.

327
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,050
The new king is enthroned. All officials have to congratulate him.

328
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,930
How can you not go?

329
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,230
The new king is enthroned?

330
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,680
That guy is enthroned.

331
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:13,710
Oh, yeah. You mentioned just now that all the female family members have to attend.

332
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,000
Then will our Prefecture Princess, Miss Pei Yuan, go as well?

333
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,360
Of course.

334
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,170
Then what are we waiting for? Help me dress.

335
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,310
Your Majesty, we are almost there.

336
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,980
Your Majesty, these are all the female family members of the court’s important officials.

337
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,720
They all rushed here once they heard the new king of Deep Water had not married yet.

338
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,200
They all manage to compete with each other for beauty.

339
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,930
I guess all of them want to get themselves a good position.

340
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,530
That old fox Qi Zhen must have done his calculation.

341
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,930
He brought so many female family members.

342
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,300
From the surface, it looks like it’s for welcoming the king.

343
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,410
I’m afraid that there is murder behind the laughter and chatter.

344
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,190
Who are you?

345
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,080
Entering the king’s hunting field without a passport is a capital crime.

346
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,420
I got invited here. Why do I need a passport?

347
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,570
A VIP has arrived.

348
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,560
Why stop him?

349
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,100
It's you?

350
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,990
Greeting, Your Majesty.

351
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,770
You are actually—

352
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,550
Knowing you by repute is not as good as seeing you in person.

353
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,290
I’ve heard that Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend is mighty.

354
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,620
After seeing you today, you should be respected indeed.

355
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,420
I wish Your Majesty is safe and healthy.

356
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,250
Prime Minister, you must recognize Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend.

357
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,070
I coincidentally knew that he was in Capital Kun,

358
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,680
and thought, "How could there be a hunt without him?"

359
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,690
And so I acted on my own and invited Prince Fierce here.

360
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,870
How can it be called "act on your own" when Your Majesty does business?

361
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,240
I just remembered that I checked the almanac this morning before I left my house.

362
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,920
It said, “You'll get the benefit if you move forward. An important person is a fierce person.”

363
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,140
Looking at this now, I guess that “important person” is Your Highness Prince Fierce.

364
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,160
Your Highness Prince Fierce, I’ve heard a lot about you.

365
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,500
I’m rough and clumsy.

366
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,240
I can't bear Prime Minister’s praise.

367
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,870
Come, Prince Fierce.

368
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,390
Come in, please.

369
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,190
Prince Fierce.

370
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,610
Prime Minister, please sit.

371
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:12,200
Prince Fierce, I have not asked you yet. Where are you currently residing?

372
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,670
The palace of Deep Water is spacious.

373
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,480
Do I need to arrange for you to move in?

374
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,830
No need to bother.

375
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,790
I was living in Heaven Fiend’s Official Post initially, but now I’m staying in an inn.

376
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,690
Why is that?

377
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,210
A few days before, someone entered my Official Post and tried to assassinate me.

378
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,490
They intended to take my life.

379
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,000
At the same time, they also burned down my lodging.

380
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,020
Who’re the evildoers? So arrogant.

381
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:48,130
They’re just some small evildoers who don’t deserve to be mentioned.

382
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:58,060
Just that... our Heaven Fiend’s treasure, Earth Absorbing Bell, was also stolen during that day.

383
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,120
I hope that Deep Water will give us some explanation.

384
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,020
Earth Absorbing Bell?

385
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,220
What is that?

386
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,500
Your Majesty, I heard that the Earth Absorbing Bell can release hotness and coldness,

387
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,530
and can control people’s spiritual sense.

388
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,680
Such a treasure was actually stolen?

389
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,930
Prime Minister, this should be thoroughly investigated.

390
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,680
Heaven Fiend Nation's priceless treasure was actually stolen in my Deep Water Nation.

391
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,780
They were purposely ruining the relationship between the two nations, Deep Water and Heaven Fiend.

392
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,620
Of course, I will investigate.

393
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,580
But Capital Kun is so big,

394
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,040
I am afraid I will not find any clues anytime soon.

395
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,380
What Prime Minister says makes sense.

396
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,470
But Your Highness Prince Fierce,

397
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,160
why would Heaven Fiend's priceless treasure be in Deep Water territory?

398
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,750
There wouldn't be...You understand what I mean, right?

399
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,680
That–

400
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,170
That-That...

401
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,790
You would have to ask the Prime Minister.

402
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,850
Ask me?

403
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,820
Maybe, I've told a Heaven Fiend’s ambassador previously that

404
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,540
there’s a fairy in Deep Water’s water.

405
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,800
Previously, Dragon Scale Armor showed its power in the Forever Water.

406
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,470
If it isn’t because King of Heaven Fiend found out

407
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:26,790
and wants to bring the Earth Absorbing Bell here to test its power.

408
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,030
But I heard—

409
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,710
"Heard?" That means it was only rumors and not to be trusted.

410
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,850
Just as you said the Earth Absorbing Bell was lost here, but who actually saw?

411
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,320
Who can come out to prove it?

412
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,120
Prime Minister is saying that we, Heaven Fiend, are making wrong accusations on you, Deep Water?

413
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,730
How is that so?

414
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,540
Both of our countries have had a good relationship for so many generations.

415
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,320
How can I easily suspect Prince Fierce's intentions?

416
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,540
But, this time, Prince Fierce suddenly came to Capital Kun

417
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,930
and said that the Earth Absorbing Bell was lost here.

418
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,320
Was it really lost?

419
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,390
Or did Prince Fierce place it somewhere else

420
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,100
and just couldn't remember through an oversight?

421
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,380
I understand what Prime Minister means.

422
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,200
No matter what I say today,

423
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,600
I would be intentionally defaming you, right?

424
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,600
Is Prime Minister worried that besides the Earth Absorbing Bell being stolen, I would say

425
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,800
something else that sounded bad?

426
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,000
Your Highness Prince Fierce may not understand me well.

427
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,900
Everything I do is always frank and forthright.

428
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,400
Even if someone tries to defame me,

429
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:01,600
I think His Majesty would discover the truth and prove my innocence.

430
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,220
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?

431
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,070
Naturally, yes, Prime Minister.

432
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,460
About this matter, how did you turn the discussion into an argument?

433
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,800
And you guys are even talking about innocence.

434
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Let me tell you. Both of you, stop arguing.

435
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
Let me, the King, decide.

436
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,000
Your Highness Prince Fierce, about the Earth Absorbing Bell being stolen, our Deep Water should investigate into it.

437
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
If you would please wait for a few days. Wait for our good news.

438
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,910
Okay.

439
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,500
Then I will look forward to it.

440
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,510
The auspicious time for hunting has come!

441
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,780
Where is Old Master?

442
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,270
I am afraid that he won't be able to come out at this moment.

443
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,250
Is there anything wrong?

444
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,600
It was taken by Prefecture Princess Pei?!

445
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,470
It is absolutely true.

446
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,200
It happened the day before yesterday.

447
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,500
The guards didn’t know how important this was.

448
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,170
They were worried about making the Prefecture Princess angry.

449
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,000
That's why they didn't come to ask for punishment until now.

450
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,360
I-I see what's going on.

451
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,600
I am afraid that something might happen.

452
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,200
Have you sent people to East Park and asked for the person?

453
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,800
They went, but they didn't see the Prefecture Princess.

454
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,200
The one working there also said that he didn’t see the person at all.

455
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,000
The Prefecture Princess is within the hunting grounds right now.

456
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,200
I am afraid Prime Minister will have to personally resolve this.

457
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,600
What about this? Go send someone to monitor East Park.

458
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,800
I will find an appropriate time to report to Prime Minister.

459
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,300
Okay. Okay.

460
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
This sickly boy has been half-dead for the entire way.

461
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,650
It looks like he has some kind of strange illness.

462
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,000
Nothing bad will happen, right?

463
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,500
Who cares about what kind of illness he has?

464
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,400
As long as he is still breathing, he is the bait that will bring Fuyao here to her doom.

465
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,700
But what if Fuyao doesn't come?

466
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,900
If she doesn't come, then Xiaoqi will have to suffer and take the punishments for her.

467
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,800
If she finds out later on that Xiaoqi took the punishments because of her,

468
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
she will definitely be even more sad.

469
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,700
As long as she is sad, I will feel better.

470
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,800
It's a rare occasion for this place to be this lively.

471
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,900
I must find something interesting and have fun.

472
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,700
Your Majesty, these are the hunted preys.

473
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,000
It has only been a short time and you guys already hunted so much?

474
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,400
Reward them! Reward them well!

475
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

476
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,130
Your Majesty, our Deep Water is a rich land that fosters talents.

477
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,600
Not only are all the men outstanding,

478
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,400
but all the females are also a match for men.

479
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,600
Archery and equestrianism are all nothing for them.

480
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Prefect Xiping, is there someone you want to recommend?

481
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,000
I was thinking, why don't we have—

482
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What Prefect Xiping said was right.

483
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,900
Why not let me go hunt and liven things up for everyone today?

484
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,100
Prefecture Princess Pei, long time no see.

485
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,900
I still remember in Mt. Mystic Soul,

486
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,900
Prefecture Princess was dashing and spirited, not losing to any man at all.

487
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,200
That's good, too.

488
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,200
We will have Prefecture Princess go hunt and show everyone today.

489
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Since it's the new king's enthronement, a grand event of the royalties,

490
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,500
there should be a new astronomical phenomenon.

491
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,800
In a normal hunt, the prey being hunted are only jackals, tigers, leopards and such.

492
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,080
It's nothing out of the ordinary.

493
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,800
Why don't we do something new?

494
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,500
Huh?

495
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,900
Xiaoqi.

496
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,300
Prefecture Princess, what do you mean?

497
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,570
This person is a lowly slave who committed a deadly crime.

498
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,000
He was originally supposed to be executed.

499
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But today, I want to give him a chance of survival.

500
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,900
Would Your Majesty please allow for this?

501
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,200
Tell me about it.

502
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,620
Today, this lowly slave will be the prey.

503
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,400
Have him enter the hunting grounds first riding a horse.

504
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,200
After he has moved for one hundred steps, everyone can start hunting.

505
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,400
Whoever hunts and gets the person first will be the winner today.

506
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,800
Okay, then we will do according to the Prefecture Princess' plan.

507
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,900
Whoever hunts this person first will be rewarded well by me.

508
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,400
Your Majesty, don't you want to give it a try?

509
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,350
Prime Minister, you know already.

510
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,800
My martial arts are not good.

511
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,600
Whether it is archery or equestrianism, I only know a bit of it.

512
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
About this matter, it's better to leave it to the ones capable.

513
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,000
Your Majesty is really humble.

514
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,900
It's just that traditionally, the King always personally participates during hunting events.

515
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,600
About today's arrangement, I am afraid all the officials won't be happy about that.

516
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,800
About that—

517
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,100
All right, King, you don't have to worry at all.

518
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,600
With me right by your side,

519
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,700
your safety will definitely be kept.

520
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,200
Your Majesty, rabbit!

521
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,100
Great. Prime Minister, why don't we compete and see who will get this rabbit first?

522
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,870
Okay. Your Majesty, please go ahead first.

523
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,500
Okay.

524
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,600
The prey has entered the trap.

525
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,300
For the remaining, let's leave it to Palace Leader Fei Yan.

526
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,900
Did Godfather even engage Palace Leader Fei Yan?

527
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,600
Long time no see.

528
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,700
Senior Sister, it really has been a long time.

529
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,000
The grudge between you and me has nothing to do with other people. Please let Xiaoqi go.

530
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,060
I am the one who sets the rules.

531
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,800
You don't get a say!

532
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,500
Both of you must die!

533
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,400
