00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,300
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,300
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,400
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,400
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,600
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,100
~Episode 55~

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,300
What is that up front?

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,970
That is the forbidden area here in Luan Bamboo Terrace.

24
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,600
I also have never entered it.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,900
The old people here in the palace say that the Fire Phoenix is guarding inside.

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,800
The root of the bloodline of Plough's royal clan is also hidden in there.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,800
Who is it?

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,900
It turns out to be a petal.

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,300
It's actually as beautiful as you.

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
Let us...

31
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,680
go look someplace else.

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,900
Mr. Zong.

33
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,750
Mr. Zong, you...

34
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,960
Do you have any girl that you like?

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,400
I have been studying medicine for so many years.

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
I haven't considered romantic relationships.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,100
Mr. Zong, you should consider it already.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,400
Sometimes, a romantic fate is just in front of you.

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Isn't it?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,900
Let's go back.

41
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,660
Yuan Bao, go open the door.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Genealogical record of the Feng clan.

43
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,000
Yuan Bao, look at those holes below.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,300
There must be some trap mechanism in there.

45
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,400
Once we remove the object on top, without the weight,

46
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,500
the weapons inside will immediately fire to kill us.

47
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Go in now and destroy the trap mechanism.

48
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,500
You said before that there are only a few people from the different nations who can go to Firmament to train.

49
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
This person is following Feng Xuan's orders.

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,800
It means that he is a saint from Plough.

51
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
If our guess is right,

52
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
as long as we can find old records of Plough in the Luan Bamboo Terrace,

53
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,500
we surely can unravel one or two clues.

54
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
This means...

55
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,100
she's dead?

56
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,800
Feng Qi is Feng Xuan's sister.

57
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,200
She should have died when she was 24.

58
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,940
And Yu Heng is her husband.

59
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,700
He's still alive.

60
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
But who is this Feng Wuming?

61
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,800
How come her phoenix is different from the others?

62
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,970
Is she alive or dead?

63
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,500
The situation below Young Phoenix Lake seems to be more dire than imagined.

64
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,100
Be frank with me.

65
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,600
The gold production of Plough

66
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,400
has always been closely related with the amount of the Lava Gold River of the Young Phoenix Lake.

67
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,500
But now, there is less gold being produced.

68
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,500
That is because beneath Young Phoenix Lake, the turbulent flow of the sea of fiery magma isn't like it used to be.

69
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,300
If this continues,

70
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,000
the flow rate of Young Phoenix Lake can only be maintained for a year.

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,200
Have you investigated it well?

72
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,890
I searched Young Phoenix Lake three times and saw it with my own eyes.

73
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,000
All are very true.

74
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,700
Young Phoenix Lake is a miraculous manifestation of the heaven that formed Plough.

75
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,200
It's not something that us mere mortals can control.

76
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,400
Maybe... these destructive changes are just temporary.

77
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Or maybe, you are just worrying too much.

78
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,800
Yesterday, it was my third time leading a team into Young Phoenix Lake.

79
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,600
It was very clear that the fluid level in the Lava Gold River is decreasing continuously.

80
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
I have never seen such a situation before.

81
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,400
This time, I fear that we're really in trouble.

82
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,800
Do you know what the consequences will be if what you say is real?

83
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,800
Young Phoenix Lake is the lifeline of Plough.

84
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,500
Once it dries up, I fear that the whole underground city of Plough will collapse and get destroyed.

85
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,800
And before that,

86
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,900
if any rumors leak out that will lead to panic among the citizens.

87
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,000
Listen well.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,400
I don't care if the citizens will be in a panic or not.

89
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,300
Your Tang family has been loyal for generations.

90
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,300
You are the secret subjects that my Plough's Feng clan has personally relied on the most.

91
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,400
You surely know what item I care about the most, right?

92
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,300
You surely know what item I care about the most, right?

93
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,400
I'm not living for myself.

94
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,800
Nor am I living for this single Plough nation.

95
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,700
Whether my body is healthy

96
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,800
concerns the survival of the whole Plough and Five Regions.

97
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Now, my two daughters are not showing any signs of special phoenix spirituality.

98
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,900
If I fall gravely ill and am unable to recover,

99
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm afraid that Plough will really be doomed.

100
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
That Medical Sage Zong Yue was right.

101
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,900
I don't have some mysterious illness, but was harmed by villains.

102
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,000
Go investigate it.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,100
You must find out that person hiding behind me who has secretly poisoned me.

104
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,400
I want to see what evil intentions that person is harboring.

105
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes.

106
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,060
Mr. Zong's treatment seems to be working.

107
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,900
- Why don't—
- Mr. Zong?

108
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,170
Who is Mr. Zong?

109
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,600
He is the Medical Sage of Five Regions that His Highness Crown Prince Wuji brought here.

110
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,000
To say that His Highness Crown Prince has no ulterior motive,

111
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,300
do you believe it?

112
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,500
Since we have doubts, we can't truly trust him.

113
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,600
Two uninvited guests, keep watch of them well.

114
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,700
If they do any strange movements, immediately report back to me.

115
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,200
Yes.

116
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,450
Who were the people who infiltrated Young Phoenix Lake with you?

117
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,600
They are all trustworthy guards of the Phoenix Lead Pavilion.

118
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,300
They will surely not leak any news out.

119
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,400
Report their names to the inner court.

120
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,900
- Since they took on such an important duty, they should be heavily rewarded.
- Yes.

121
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,800
Go now.

122
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
You tell me,

123
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,460
will he notice anything?

124
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,440
Fine then.

125
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,700
Even if he does, what can he do?

126
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,300
Right now, I only have this path I can take.

127
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,700
You, just go do it well.

128
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,010
Your disciple Folian is begging for Grand Teacher's help.

129
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,890
What do you ask for?

130
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,110
Don't worry.

131
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,570
I already found a way to deal with Fuyao.

132
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,790
I earnestly ask Grand Teacher to bestow on me the heart-confusing technique.

133
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,580
She'll become your servant soon,

134
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,050
while I'll be able to obtain the power that I want.

135
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,040
What you want and what I want

136
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
will all be realized very soon.

137
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,960
Miss Fuyao.

138
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,320
Miss, don't worry.

139
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,430
I was just asked by someone to look for you here.

140
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,860
Hope Miss can follow me to meet an old acquaintance.

141
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,850
Is your mistress Princess Folian?

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,190
Fine then.

143
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,230
You exposing my identity here means that you're threatening me to see her.

144
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,600
I dare not.

145
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,210
It's just that my mistress now can't move around that conveniently.

146
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,610
She can only use this method to invite you.

147
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,400
Well, I haven't seen her for a long time, either.

148
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,210
Please lead the way.

149
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,320
This way, please.

150
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,290
First Queen Heir, please sit.

151
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,010
Since Crown Prince came to our Plough, I haven't had time to personally attend to you.

152
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,120
Today, I've brought some precious toys and musical instruments of our Plough.

153
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,450
If you find anything you like, you can keep them.

154
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,960
How come I'm not seeing Mr. Zong?

155
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,290
First Queen Heir, did you come to see me or Zong Yue?

156
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,080
If I say that I was looking for Mr. Zong, that's why I came to look for you,

157
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,140
will you be unhappy?

158
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,760
That will depend on how happy or unhappy our succeeding chat will be.

159
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,420
You're really something, Crown Prince Wuji; always calculative.

160
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,550
What do you want to chat about?

161
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,610
I heard that you have an auntie called Feng Qi.

162
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,100
From whom have you heard that?

163
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,130
Is it true or not?

164
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,590
You already know it, so why do you still ask me?

165
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,940
Are you trying to trap me or trip me?

166
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:52,050
Your Queen Mother doesn't have a grave illness, but was poisoned.

167
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,370
Don't you know?

168
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,950
What do you, Crown Prince, mean by that?

169
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,740
Are you suspecting me for deliberately harming her?

170
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,680
This is Plough.

171
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,580
Even if you're some Megrez Crown Prince, you have to be below us here.

172
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,960
My Plough's internal affairs won't tolerate an outsider like you to play with it or casually interfere.

173
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,240
Don't get agitated.

174
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,390
If you're too hot-tempered and rash like this,

175
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,210
how can you find the real culprit who poisons?

176
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,430
And how can you inherit the royal throne?

177
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,570
If you really care about Plough,

178
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,790
then you should calm your heart down and finish drinking this cup of tea.

179
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,460
I know more than anyone else the survival relationship between Young Phoenix Lake and Plough.

180
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,160
My natural stand is that I don't want any strange thing to happen to Young Phoenix Lake.

181
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,990
For this matter, we both are completely the same.

182
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,950
What do you want to say?

183
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,170
I hope that you can cooperate with me in investigating the truth and do your best to ensure the stability of Young Phoenix Lake.

184
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,710
Plough and the different nations of Five Regions are deeply connected with the life of your Megrez Imperial City.

185
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,790
If one lives, all live. If one dies, all die.

186
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,780
I believe what you said.

187
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,660
I'm sure that the culprit behind the poison is after the royal throne.

188
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,060
You don't wish for the throne to end up with others either, right?

189
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,160
If that's the case, then think about it well.

190
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,660
What kind of person will be unscrupulous at this time

191
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,220
to use poison to harm someone disregarding any consequences?

192
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,970
It must be that bitch.

193
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,290
Younger Sister, you're finally here.

194
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,380
I was waiting for a long time.

195
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,890
Older Sister, long time no see.

196
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,700
Have you been well lately?

197
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,070
I wonder how many temples you've recently visited and how many people you've saved.

198
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,690
Younger Sister, are you still mad at me?

199
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,060
Everything before was my fault.

200
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,080
Although I was also tricked by Zhangsun Pingrong continuously,

201
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,660
that I was given no choice,

202
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,200
I know that I still committed a mistake.

203
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,900
I asked you to come today to give you an apology.

204
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,980
Apology?

205
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,310
Older Sister, such a casually said apology.

206
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,940
If not because I was fortunate then, I would have been in hell now.

207
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,530
Older Sister might need to be burning paper money just for me to hear your apology.

208
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,970
I clearly know that after everything I've done,

209
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,070
it will indeed be hard to make up for what I owed you.

210
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,260
But now, look.

211
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,370
Although I'm the second queen heir of Plough,

212
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,580
I'm being locked up here with my life being uncertain.

213
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,910
When I think back, I think about your sincerity towards me,

214
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,990
yet I did such a muddled thing.

215
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,200
I really... deeply regret it.

216
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,630
May you accept this item.

217
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,500
Why must I accept your gift?

218
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,650
In our Plough,

219
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,990
each royal descendant will have their own unique ruyi.
(a small scepter like item)

220
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,660
This ruyi not only represents glory and status,

221
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,270
but also one's lifeline and it's connected to one's blood and Qi.

222
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,570
This is my phoenix ruyi.

223
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:55,000
I want to give it to you, symbolizing that I'm putting all my dignity for you to decide on.

224
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,660
I won't excessively ask for your forgiveness.

225
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,520
But by doing this, I could at least let you see my sincerity.

226
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,790
It could at least diminish my guilt.

227
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,460
I don't believe that after saying so much, you're just going to apologize.

228
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,180
Other than asking for your forgiveness, I don't have any other motive.

229
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,210
I know that you still doubt me.

230
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,130
That's just normal.

231
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,300
Actually, since Wuji entered the palace,

232
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,430
I've guessed that the role of the medical sage by his side might be replaced you.

233
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,530
But only today did I boldly disturb you.

234
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:43,700
I was afraid that you'll misunderstand that I still have other intentions towards Wuji.

235
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,930
Younger Sister, you must accept it.

236
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,390
This is my sincerity.

237
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,000
After hearing you say so much, I'll accept this ruyi of yours.

238
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,510
I also have heard your apology.

239
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,980
No need to say anything anymore.

240
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,630
Younger Sister!

241
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,020
Younger Sister, don't worry.

242
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,700
Regarding you disguising as Zong Yue, I will surely keep it a secret.

243
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,450
Now that I've fulfilled my wish,

244
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:33,100
I will now just pray for blessing for the citizens of Plough for the rest of my life,

245
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,610
try to guide the endless suffering masses towards nirvana.

246
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,990
Yesterday, Folian came to me and insisted to give me this item.

247
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,990
She said that the royal descendants of Plough each have their own unique ruyi.

248
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,280
She is sincerely handing it out to me and I can do anything I want with it.

249
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,090
What she said is true.

250
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,650
Here in Plough, if she gives you this ruyi,

251
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:13,590
it equates to entrusting to you her dignity and status as a Plough's Queen Heir.

252
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,680
What do you plan to do with it?

253
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,030
How about this?

254
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,460
Let's pawn it and buy Yuan Bao some food.

255
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,200
That is indeed a good idea.

256
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,330
It should be worth a lot.

257
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,960
What did you discover in Luan Bamboo Terrace?

258
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,690
Feng Xuan still has an older sister named Feng Qi.

259
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,540
She died a year before she ascended the throne.

260
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,620
What's the cause of death?

261
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,720
It was unclear.

262
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,460
But rumors say that these two sisters are very close.

263
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,290
In the year that Feng Qi died, Feng Xuan even insisted on becoming a nun because of severe grief,

264
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,620
so that she could transcend the soul of her older sister.

265
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,000
I finally know from where Folian learned her method.

266
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,920
Like mother, like daughter.

267
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,330
After Feng Qi died, the only person who could inherit the throne would be Feng Xuan.

268
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,470
The officials begged her several times and she finally ascended to the throne.

269
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,130
I heard that she even gave Feng Qi the highest form of funeral rites.

270
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,320
She also handled her after burial matters adequately.

271
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,000
It's just that—

272
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,360
[Feng Qi]

273
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,010
This means that... she's dead?

274
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,540
[Feng Wuming]
(Wuming means no name)

275
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,430
But who is this Feng Wuming?

276
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,900
How come her phoenix is different from the others?

277
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,890
Is she alive or dead?

278
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:55,330
Based on the record in Luan Bamboo Terrace, Feng Qi should have one more descendant called Feng Wuming.

279
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,710
But this Feng Wuming probably isn't her real official name.

280
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,840
What's weird is, inside their genealogy record,

281
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,640
she doesn't seem to be dead nor alive.

282
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,360
What does that mean?

283
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,620
In their royal clan genealogy record, each person has their unique totem and mark.

284
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,580
A living and a dead person will appear differently,

285
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,210
but there are only two statuses, dead or alive.

286
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,550
However, only for this Feng Wuming, her totem isn't alive nor dead.

287
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,350
However, only for this Feng Wuming, her totem isn't alive nor dead.

288
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,830
Maybe this is a clue.

289
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,470
We can continue to follow it.

290
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,520
We probably will find something.

291
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,350
What I can be sure of right now is the person who poisoned Feng Xuan probably isn't Feng Jingzhi.

292
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,540
The most likely suspect is—

293
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,120
Folian.

294
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,420
That's right.

295
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,720
She can endure silently and is also patient.

296
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,810
In terms of scheming and methods, she's far more wise than Feng Jingzhi.

297
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,530
Or else, she wouldn't have wasted so many years to create a Lotus Saintess image.

298
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,490
When you face her next time, you must be extra careful.

299
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,970
Say, with a girl like that,

300
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,690
how come an extremely intelligent person like Crown Prince Wuji

301
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,480
would have an engagement with her?

302
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,050
That's right.

303
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,370
How come it got set like that?

304
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,400
All these originated from the lotus pond in this palace.

305
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,290
This place is?

306
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,430
When I was little, I came to Plough with Emperor Father.

307
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,660
Since this place is very different from other places in Five Regions,

308
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,160
hence, I got so excited and leisurely toured around this palace.

309
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,450
I accidentally discovered this place.

310
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,520
What place was this back then?

311
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,850
This place used to have breezes ruffling the green water.

312
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,560
What you can see are all lotus flowers and leaves.

313
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,070
Ten li of lotus flowers, so splendid.

314
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,360
Who are you?

315
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,490
That girl was full of injuries.

316
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,350
She was so small.

317
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,450
It was there when I met her for the first time.

318
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:12,640
That time, she was full of wounds, so thin and so little,

319
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,780
but she had a pair of eyes that could see through a human heart.

320
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,530
That time, I thought that she was the daughter of some maidservant.

321
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,190
Seeing how she had suffered too much torture, I took pity on her.

322
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,200
Let's go.

323
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,880
Higher!

324
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,270
Afterwards, whenever I had the time,

325
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,690
I'd frequently come to this lotus pond, visit her, and play with her.

326
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:57,020
Hence, was that girl then Folian?

327
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,940
I actually didn't care who she was at the time.

328
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,370
I was just thinking to let her suffer less torment and take care of her a little.

329
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:15,260
Up to the end, didn't she tell you her name nor what she's going through?

330
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,440
She was like a newly born child.

331
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,660
Towards herself and this world, she was still confused.

332
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,060
That time, I was also curious in what kind of environment she was raised,

333
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,410
that she would be ignorant of everything around her.

334
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,070
I finally see my love coming back to me.

335
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,710
How come my anxious mind won't calm down?

336
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,480
I finally see my love coming back to me.

337
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,960
How come my anxious mind won't calm down?

338
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,700
Wild wind is howling and sudden rain is pounding.

339
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,090
The mating call from roosters is non-stopping.

340
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,660
Wild wind is howling and sudden rain is pounding.

341
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,690
The mating call from roosters is non-stopping.

342
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,270
I finally see my love coming back to me.

343
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,540
How come my lovesickness won't go away?

344
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,240
I finally see my love coming back to me.

345
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,610
How come my lovesickness won't go away?

346
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,980
But she was extremely smart.

347
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,350
I tried to teach her how to read and write then.

348
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,240
I never thought that she was so outstandingly smart that in a few days,

349
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,880
she was able to memorize the whole "Book of Songs."

350
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,420
How can I not feel pity towards her?

351
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,450
You are the Megrez crown prince.

352
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,520
It shouldn't have been hard for you to help her.

353
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,190
Of course, I wanted to help her.

354
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,480
Seeing how she got cruelly beaten up every day, I would ask her who did it, but she wouldn't say.

355
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,220
I then told her afterwards that I'm going to take her away from Plough and bring her to Megrez Imperial City.

356
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,590
She refused?

357
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,900
She was willing.

358
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,120
That day, I waited there for a long time, but she didn't appear.

359
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,950
Girl!

360
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,080
Girl! Where are you?

361
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,330
I'm going back home now!

362
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,220
Girl! Girl!

363
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,190
Are you coming with me?

364
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,990
I'm going home now.

365
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,200
The time to set out had arrived.

366
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,170
I could only leave.

367
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,090
Hence, you kept feeling that it was you who abandoned her at that time.

368
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,290
I once said

369
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,190
that I will protect and take care of her.

370
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:28,140
I won't let her live in fear every day and would ensure that she would be safe forever.

371
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,130
But I didn't fulfill my promise.

372
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,440
From then on, didn't you hear from her again?

373
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,930
Afterwards, I went to Firmament to train.

374
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,220
Only until five years ago, the name Plough Saintess Folian became popular throughout Five Regions.

375
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,270
She was doing charitable works everywhere and gained a good reputation.

376
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,780
While I was thinking if it could be her,

377
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,930
I received a letter from Folian and that Mystic Spirit Leaf.

378
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,480
This is called Mystic Spirit Leaf.

379
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,630
Treat it as a token of our meeting.

380
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,440
No one has ever gifted me anything.

381
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,680
What was written in the letter was completely the same as what happened in the Plough Palace then.

382
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,610
If I'm going to base it on what she wrote in that letter,

383
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,510
she then was that girl that I'd met.

384
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,350
Then, Folian also must have mentioned in her letter

385
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,040
that you once promised her that you will protect her for a lifetime, right?

386
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:45,110
Silly. I told you before that based on the law of Plough,

387
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,730
if Feng Jingzhi inheirted the throne and Folian hadn't been married off yet,

388
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,280
she then wouldn't be able to escape getting executed.

389
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,250
She also mentioned that in her letter;

390
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,340
hence, she hoped I could marry her as soon as possible to protect her life.

391
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,400
That's why, since your heart still remembered that promise, you agreed to her request.

392
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,130
Yes.

393
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,420
There's just one thing I don't understand.

394
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,330
Marriage is such an important matter.

395
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,610
With your personality, how could a letter have dictated your decision?

396
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,870
For me, marriage and romantic affection can be present or not.

397
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:35,270
If through this marriage, I am able to save a childhood friend, why not?

398
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,360
No other reason?

399
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,020
Fine. You guessed it right.

400
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,610
My other motive was to get Plough's support.

401
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,480
I never thought that I would fall in love with anyone.

402
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,700
I also never thought that anyone could affect the plans that I've devised for a long time.

403
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,490
Only you.

404
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,190
Hence, are you really sure that Folian is that girl from before?

405
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,960
I, Tang Yizhong from Plough, greet Crown Prince Wuji and Prefect Vast.

406
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,450
Get up first before speaking.

407
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,220
Thank you, Crown Prince.

408
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,120
In the competition of the Gold of Heaven Fiend before,

409
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,250
I was fortunate to meet the real Medical Sage of Five Regions.

410
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,270
Hence, when I saw you in Astute Time Palace,

411
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,760
I already knew that you were fake.

412
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,180
Just call me Fuyao.

413
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,080
Miss Fuyao, you are bold.

414
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,580
Who else knows this?

415
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,050
Crown Prince, no need to worry.

416
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,230
Although the Phoenix Lead Pavilion is the secret agent team of the Queen,

417
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,590
the identity of Miss Fuyao has nothing to do with our Plough at this time.

418
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,410
I won't tell it to anyone.

419
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,760
What is your purpose for coming here today?

420
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,860
I was raised in the Phoenix Lead Pavilion of Plough.

421
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,770
Ever since, I've been handling several secret missions for the royal clan of Plough.

422
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,960
You can say that I'm one of the few who knows about the secrets of the Feng royal clan.

423
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,610
I know what you two are investigating about.

424
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,670
And then?

425
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,850
The palace system of the Plough is very strict.

426
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,960
Even the records in Luan Bamboo Terrace might have been tampered with.

427
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,630
If you want to know the truth, you should look for the people present at that time.

428
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,090
Who are you referring to?

429
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,820
Go look for a person named Feng Wu.

430
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,740
Why are you helping us?

431
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,590
For Plough.

432
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,670
Have you finished preparing the medicine for Astute Time Palace?

433
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,970
We've just finished cooking it and were about to deliver it.

434
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,150
Go rest. Let me do it.

435
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,650
Yes.

436
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,270
Just to earn Her Majesty's favor, you're doing everything personally.

437
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,080
You must have something you want to ask of her.

438
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,370
That's right.

439
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,900
So what?

440
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,080
Is it that you want to be married with Crown Prince Wuji as soon as possible?

441
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,620
Although Crown Prince Wuji is good, he isn't my taste.

442
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,340
I have someone else I like.

443
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,170
When I go to Queen Mother later, I must make her agree.

444
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,360
That Crown Prince Wuji has great martial arts skills. I've repeatedly tried to assassinate him,

445
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,040
but didn't get any chance.

446
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,380
Are you not able to kill him, or you don't want to kill him?

447
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,740
I can't and I don't want to.

448
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,260
Shut up!

449
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,000
You want to borrow his hand to investigate what happened that year, right?

450
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,200
For so many years,

451
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,880
don't you still understand my feelings for you?

452
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:00,760
I tell you, in this world

453
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,910
who most understands you, who most cares for you,

454
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,150
who loves you the most,

455
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,090
is now only just me.

456
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,490
Do you still not understand

457
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,810
that the only person who can give you answers is just me?

458
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,310
The people who know the truth of that year are dead.

459
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,720
They're all dead!

460
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,540
They've all been killed by me.

461
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,820
You can only listen to me.

462
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,420
If you still want to live

463
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,780
and still find out about the whereabouts of Feng Qi and her daughter, you...

464
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,490
can only listen to my command.

465
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,050
I understand.

466
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,240
You must continue to give me those poisons.

467
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,460
No need to give me too much.

468
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,450
Just make me look a bit weak.

469
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,140
I can't let anyone know...

470
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,850
that their Plough queen...

471
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,730
doesn't really have any phoenix spirituality.

472
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,370
I can't let anyone know...

473
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,280
that the occurrences in Young Phoenix Lake...

474
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,110
started because of me.

475
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,830
Who is there?

476
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,980
[Astute Time Palace]

477
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:46,930
Please forgive me for not being well dressed in front of you.

478
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,250
Please rise.

479
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,860
Thank you, Crown Prince.

480
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,420
Since you recognize us, we won't beat around the bush.

481
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,570
We have some questions regarding the Plough royal clan that we want to ask you.

482
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,070
Sit down and talk. Please.

483
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,160
Your Highness Crown Prince, just ask away.

484
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,340
To investigate the truth, we once went inside Luan Bamboo Terrace.

485
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,780
Inside the genealogical record of the Plough royal clan,

486
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,280
the past queen Feng Yu had two daughters and four sons.

487
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,260
These two daughters are Feng Qi and Feng Xuan.

488
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,990
Which means that one of them surely has the phoenix spirituality and will inherit the royal throne.

489
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,450
Am I right?

490
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,770
Indeed. Please drink some tea.

491
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,830
Then, is this person Feng Xuan?

492
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,730
It's hard to be sure.

493
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,960
You two only knew that Feng Xuan and Feng Qi are sisters,

494
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,570
but do you know that they are twins?

495
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,240
They were born just 30 minutes apart;

496
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,160
hence, it was hard to determine who had the phoenix spirituality.

497
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,740
Is there any possibility that both of them don't have it?

498
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,310
There has never been such a situation for the past thousands of years.

499
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,160
Young Phoenix Lake and the phoenix spirituality of the Plough royal clan are interconnected;

500
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,300
hence, there will always be one among the royal descendants who has this kind of phoenix spirituality.

501
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,300
But no matter what, only one will have it.

502
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,740
That's why, there was never any conflict as for who will get the royal throne.

503
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,740
Things like phoenix spirituality can't be seen nor touched.

504
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,200
Who then can clearly prove it?

505
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,070
We then have to rely on Young Phoenix Lake then.

506
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,330
The qualified royal heiress will be brought to Young Phoenix Lake after being born.

507
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,630
If she's the fated heir, there will be a miraculous manifestation.

508
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,210
A human heart might make a mistake, but Heaven's will won't.

509
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,170
Am I right, Your Highness Prefect Wu?

510
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,390
Yes.

511
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,870
Because Feng Xuan and Feng Qi are twins,

512
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:57,230
based on Plough's time and rules, they must be sent to Young Phoenix Lake together.

513
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,730
That has never happened in the past.

514
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:06,930
If they were sent together, then won't that be harder to differentiate who has the phoenix spirituality?

515
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:12,010
Hence, Young Phoenix Lake didn't show any miraculous manifestation then.

516
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,810
Queen Mother got very nervous and was afraid that if this matter gets out, it will cause great chaos.

517
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:22,110
But the Plough then didn't show any obvious disaster.

518
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,310
Could it be that those sisters both have the phoenix spirituality?

519
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,770
No.

520
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,090
Queen Mother was afraid that it would cause great chaos,

521
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,360
so she claimed that because they were twins, they reinforced and counteracted each other;

522
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,400
that's why, the phoenix spirituality didn't manifest.

523
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,130
Only by waiting for the two first queen heirs to grow up, get married, and have children,

524
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,540
would we be able to find the phoenix spirituality in one of their daughters.

525
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:48,410
By then, we can then determine who the real first queen heir is.

526
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:54,500
But we never thought that after twenty years, a similar event happened.

527
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,520
Hurry! Hurry up!

528
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,650
It was quite a coincidence, too.

529
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,230
Afterwards, Feng Xuan and Feng Qi almost simultaneously got pregnant

530
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,900
- and went into labor on the same day.
 - Push hard!

531
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,890
- They successively gave birth to two babies.
 - Hurry!

532
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,870
Push hard!

533
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,700
- Legend says that when Feng Xuan gave birth to her daughter,
 - Put in more energy!

534
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,480
- that girl had a lotus flower on her mouth, such an auspicious sign.
 - It will be over soon. Put in more energy, Your Highness.

535
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,500
- And at that time, Young Phoenix Lake actually had a miraculous manifestation.
 - Push hard! It's coming out...

536
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,590
- Hence, everyone firmly believed that this child with a lotus flower
 - It's coming out. Push hard!

537
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,470
- was the one with phoenix spirituality.
 - Use more energy.

538
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:31,400
- Using it as proof, they made Feng Xuan the first queen heir.
 - Push hard, Your Highness!

539
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,900
Not long after that, Feng Qi got sick and died.

540
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,790
And then afterwards, Feng Xuan successfully ascended the throne.

541
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,620
Who then is this person who was born with a lotus flower?
