00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,400
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,100
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,700
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,000
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,900
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,300
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,700
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,780
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,000
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,600
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,900
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,200
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,060
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,800
~ Episode 4 ~

22
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Fuyao!

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,800
- First Senior Brother.
- Are you all right?

24
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,300
First Senior Brother!

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
- First Senior Sister.
- Shut up!

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

27
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,560
Who's that?

28
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,800
I've never seen her before.

29
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,400
She looks so majestic!

30
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Let me tell you, that is the ancient mythical beast.

31
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,600
It's totally tamed by the girl.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,880
She’s so good.

33
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,700
She is very majestic.

34
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,100
This is?

35
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,700
This is—

36
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Isn’t she that slave maidservant during the banquet that day?

37
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,800
Clique Leader, Mt. Mystic Soul really has hidden talents.

38
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Even a slave maidservant has such excellent skills.

39
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,700
What an eye-opener!

40
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,460
I'm flattered, Your Highness!

41
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,100
Obviously, Cyan Team has won this round.

42
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,200
How can one person win?

43
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,900
Oh.

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,200
Older Sis Fuyao. Older Sis Fuyao. Initially, you were like this to me.

45
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Right now, you're this.

46
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,200
You're really amazing! Amazing!

47
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,800
Fuyao, I was originally really worried about you.

48
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,580
Never imagined that you would be so glamorous today.

49
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,400
You were even riding such a cool beast. Am I right?

50
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,200
That's right!

51
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,900
The Mystic Black Section being able to win in this competition is really unheard of!

52
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,800
I never thought something like this could happen in my lifetime.

53
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
That's right!

54
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,300
Older Sis Fuyao!

55
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,690
- It hurts.
- Sorry. Sorry, I was wrong.

56
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,300
Do you know that you're really amazing, Older Sis Fuyao?

57
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,480
You must win the game.

58
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,400
After you win, you can take off this black garment.

59
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Then no one will look down upon you, no one will bully you, and no one will bully us! Right?

60
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
- Right!
- Fuyao!

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
Let me say something.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,600
That... I came back alive and even won the competition

63
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,200
because God is helping me,

64
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,200
but I will work hard for the future.

65
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Where there's a will there's a way! Where there's a will there's a way!

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,600
Fuyao is the best!

67
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,200
Uncle Zhou, everyone’s looking for you.

68
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,210
You go first.

69
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,100
I'll stay here alone for a bit.

70
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,300
Are you unhappy?

71
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,700
No.

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,910
You see that you're able to come back alive with so much glory,

73
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,980
why would I be unhappy?

74
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,600
I was raised by you.

75
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
If you're happy or not, how would I not know?

76
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,430
You, this kid, are always like this.

77
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,700
For this kind of matter, you’re smarter than the monkeys.

78
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,400
You always mess up the big matters.

79
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
What about me?

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,200
In today's big scene, you came out riding on Zitie.

81
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,100
Yan Lie is petty.

82
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,100
How can he let a slave from the Mystic Black Section receive all the glory? Yes?

83
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
I didn't think much about it.

84
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,100
Anyhow, today, you've passed the first risky round.

85
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,500
What about the second and the third one?

86
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,000
Even if God is helping you, will Yan Lie and that Pei girl let you off the hook?

87
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,300
What you mean is?

88
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Being able to allow someone from Mystic Black Section to take part in the Hunting and Fighting Game,

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,200
if it’s not a conspiracy, he wouldn’t allow it.

90
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,600
Anyway, I'll continue down the road.

91
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,800
I had thought clearly before taking part in the game, life and death are fated.

92
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,700
So, this time I came back alive. It's already considered that I benefited.

93
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,200
As for later, no matter what the result is, I already tried it.

94
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,700
I won't regret at all.

95
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,600
- Be careful of everything.
- Okay.

96
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Go then. Go then.

97
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,500
I'll accompany you to drink a few drinks.

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,600
First Senior Brother, here. Drink the medicine.

99
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Leave it here first.

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,100
I'm unfilial and I let Father be worried.

101
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,100
You've already injured yourself in the first round.

102
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,200
It wasn't because First Senior Brother was careless, nor was Zitie difficult to challenge.

103
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,600
- First Senior Brother got injured because of saving someone.
- Junior Sister!

104
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Who did he save?

105
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,830
That lowly servant rode Zitie out today and was so immensely pleased with herself,

106
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,500
just like she’s a heroine.

107
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,600
She snatched everyone’s limelight.

108
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,940
But why didn’t she think of this?

109
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,400
If it was not for your help, how could she put on the green ring?

110
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,800
And how could First Senior Brother be injured?

111
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,000
The Hunting and Fighting Game is such an important event,

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,400
you actually still got distracted by that lowly slave.

113
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,800
Listen.

114
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,400
Never allow that lowly slave to enter Mystic Main Section in the future.

115
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,800
If she does, I will punish her according to our rules.

116
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
How come it's you again? You liar.

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,800
What? I can't come here?

118
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,700
Silly girl, catch this.

119
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,280
Zitie's claws have poison.

120
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,000
Usual medicines won't heal the wound.

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Keep this Congealed Dew of Crystal Water.

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,300
Why are you giving me medicine?

123
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,600
Do you like me?

124
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,700
What do you say?

125
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
Did you raise this stupid mouse?

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,400
Stupid mouse?

127
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
Are you stupid?

128
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,500
He's not stupid.

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,000
You bullied people first.

130
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,230
You didn’t even suffer any loss.

131
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,300
You even stepped on her.

132
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,830
There’s thousands of hairs on your bottom.

133
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,700
How do I know which hair you've lost?

134
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Come. Stand up well.

135
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,140
Be honest.

136
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,700
Did you wash your bottom yesterday?

137
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,700
What?

138
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,000
Say, why did I smell something weird?

139
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,100
Stupid mouse, you—

140
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Both of you fighting each other for my love.

141
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,600
Then I... am really enjoying the pleasures of having several partners.

142
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
I don’t even want to fight over a stupid mouse for your love.

143
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,400
Then, who do you want to fight with?

144
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll—

145
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
All right, you—

146
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
- You—
- I'm leaving.

147
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,800
You... You're taking advantage of me.

148
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,000
It's very late at night and the air is too humid. Don't stay here for too long.

149
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,400
Who on earth are you? Liar!

150
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,600
You'll know when I take off my mask one day.

151
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,110
All right. I know.

152
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,180
I like you the most. Okay?

153
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,810
Fuyao. Come.

154
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,000
Wash the clothes.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,260
Is this... First Senior Brother's?

156
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,200
Is he... severely injured?

157
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,810
You did take all the limelight.

158
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,540
Young Master was badly hurt in order to save you.

159
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,250
I don't know what kind of monster it was. How could it be so fierce?

160
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,190
We've used all kinds of medicines on the wound of Young Master, but it doesn't seem to be healing.

161
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,970
Doesn't the village have a medical sage?

162
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,400
Don't mention it.

163
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,950
Medical Sage Zong just happened to go to Mt. West to collect herbs these two days.

164
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,860
All right, the village still has things going on.

165
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,300
I'll go back first.

166
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,730
I-I want to see First Senior Brother.

167
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,040
You must not go.

168
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,630
Clique Leader has ordered,

169
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,200
if you go to the Mystic Main Section again,

170
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,980
you'll be punished harshly for breaking the rules.

171
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,820
Don't go there to cause trouble.

172
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,920
Fuyao.

173
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,630
Senior Brother.

174
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,480
I just knew... I knew that you'd come see me.

175
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,750
How is your injury?

176
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,470
It's fine.

177
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,820
I heard that the wounds caused by Zitie are hard to heal.

178
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,140
This medicine will have a miraculous effect.

179
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,400
Senior Brother, please take it.

180
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,690
From where did you get this?

181
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,790
No need to ask, Senior Brother.

182
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:06,640
No matter what, I will never hurt you from no on.

183
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,910
Senior Brother, take care of yourself.

184
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,690
I'll take my leave.

185
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,490
Later...

186
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,050
I won't come see you again.

187
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,470
Fuyao.

188
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,060
Why are you refusing to accept my suggestion?

189
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,450
You clearly care for me.

190
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,640
I know that Senior Brother has taken care of me since childhood.

191
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
This time...

192
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,260
This time, it was because of me that you were injured.

193
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,180
But I have limited abilities.

194
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,490
If Senior Brother needs me later,

195
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,970
I will surely not refuse to go through water and tread on fire.

196
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,060
You clearly know

197
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,480
that this wasn't what I meant.

198
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,050
But between you and I,

199
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,620
there won't be anything else.

200
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,070
I know that we are not of the same path.

201
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,340
Goodbye, Senior Brother.

202
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,070
Fuyao!

203
00:17:50,520 --> 00:18:02,270
[Reception Hall]

204
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,930
Stand there!

205
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,660
Take her down.

206
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,830
You've completed your work cleverly this time.

207
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,210
Thank you, Senior Sister.

208
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,770
I originally only wanted to punish her for sneaking into the Mystic Main Section.

209
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,640
I didn't think there would be a surprise.

210
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,000
It seems like heaven above is helping me.

211
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,390
Fuyao, this lowly slave, is doomed for sure this time.

212
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,520
What have I done wrong? Why do you catch me?

213
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,500
Is Mystic Main Section somewhere you can enter freely?

214
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,650
Is a little lowly maidservant, who just stole the show during the Hunting and Fighting Game,

215
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,710
not abiding by the rules anymore?

216
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,260
It looks like I need to reorganize my Mt. Mystic Soul's rules.

217
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,280
Clique Leader, although this slave broke a rule, she did not cause any major problems.

218
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,900
I think we should respond with some compassion.

219
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,010
It can also show our sect's benevolence.

220
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,800
I was thinking the same.

221
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,590
Sneaking into the Mystic Main Section is just a small matter.

222
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,690
Stealing is the one that's a grave crime.

223
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,640
What did I steal?

224
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,890
I didn't steal!

225
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,360
Then, that's fine.

226
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,080
Bring it up.

227
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,440
This is what you gave to Jingchen, right?

228
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,160
I gave this to First Senior Brother to treat his wounds.

229
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,050
This bottle was made from the amethyst obtained under the West Sea.

230
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,820
It is extremely valuable.

231
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,710
Where did you, a little servant, come across this?

232
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,910
You’re a smart person.

233
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,770
You should know that you have to be careful with your words.

234
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,100
If you want to live, shut your mouth then.

235
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,630
Someone else gave it to me.

236
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,870
Someone gave it to you?

237
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,060
Then, who gave it to you?

238
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,960
I cannot say.

239
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,130
You cannot say? I think you are afraid to tell.

240
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,850
You clearly stole it.

241
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,240
I didn't steal anything.

242
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,410
You said you didn't steal, but can not prove it.

243
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,700
Elders, how must we handle this case?

244
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,830
It's been a long time since Mystic Soul Clique punished people in Emotionless Realm.

245
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,230
Whether Fuyao speaks the truth or lies,

246
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,000
I think we should just leave it to the spirits of our ancestors to decide.

247
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,540
Activate the realm.

248
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,270
- First Senior Sister.
- How is she?

249
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,340
First Senior Sister.

250
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,490
She has been in there for a long time.

251
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:50,080
Since the ancient time, no people in Mystic Soul Clique were able to escape this Emotionless Realm.

252
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,340
How can a lowly slave be able to solve and escape the traps inside it?

253
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,950
Won't you all just hurry and claim her corpse?

254
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,620
Once this Emotionless Realm is opened, entering it means death to all of us.

255
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,380
That's right. It was even recorded that a highly skilled ancestor in our clique

256
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,540
entered this Emotionless Realm because of disobeying a major rule,

257
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,920
but he still could not overcome the stong energy inside.

258
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,730
He was immediately reduced to bones.

259
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,770
- There was such a thing?
- Of course.

260
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,220
Stop wasting your breath.

261
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,120
What's the use of talking so much?

262
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,750
While she's inside, are you all just going to wait out here?

263
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,850
How would we know if she dies inside?

264
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,370
Clique Leader said that if she dies in this Emotionless Realm,

265
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,160
the forest will be covered in black evil energy.

266
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,660
We can just wait here patiently.

267
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,900
She can't hold on for too long.

268
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,780
Then I'll wait here

269
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,090
for this black evil energy to arise.

270
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,390
Girl!

271
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,620
Girl! Girl!

272
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,370
This is impossible.

273
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,070
I want to know, too.

274
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,410
How is she able to stand this bone-chilling coldness?

275
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,550
Saving life is more urgent.

276
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,570
Fortunately, I came here in time.

277
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,640
I hope that after you go out of this Emotionless Realm,

278
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,440
no one will give you a hard time again.

279
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,010
Let’s go.

280
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,180
First Senior Sister, something bad happened.

281
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,960
Say it properly.

282
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,420
When I passed the forest at the back of the mountain just now, I discovered a blue light.

283
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,090
I immediately rushed forward to check.

284
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,690
Unexpectedly, that lowly slave was able to charge out of the Emotionless Realm and was lying there.

285
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,800
What? You said who’s lying there?

286
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,010
It’s-It's the lowly slave from Mystic Black Section, Fuyao.

287
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,230
How can it be?

288
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,600
Could it be that she was able to break though the Emotionless Realm?

289
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,840
Older Sis Fuyao! Older Sis Fuyao! You’re awake. Older Sis Fuyao.

290
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,640
How do you feel?

291
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,190
Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou! Older Sis Fuyao is awake.

292
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,150
Older Sis Fuyao, how do you feel now?

293
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,890
How is it? Are you feeling better?

294
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,400
Get up. Get up. Get up. Let me look at it.

295
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,470
You’re finally awake.

296
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,870
Uncle Zhou.

297
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,310
Good. It’s good enough that you’re alive.

298
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,990
It’s good enough that you’re alive.

299
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,180
Go and get some medicine.

300
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,730
Does it mean that after breaking through the Emotionless Realm,

301
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,010
the accusations before will just be forgotten and put down?

302
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,730
Yes.

303
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,710
This is a rule for a few hundreds years.

304
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,720
No matter how much Yan Lie wants to punish you, he won’t dare to abolish the rule.

305
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,600
It's just that Yan Lie must have never thought that someone could break through the Emotionless Realm.

306
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,770
Is there no one to ever survive from it?

307
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,530
No one.

308
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,690
This matter ends here.

309
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,900
But if I withdraw now,

310
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,400
even I will look down on myself.

311
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,300
The more they are going to suppress me, the stronger I want to get.

312
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,670
All right. All right. All right.

313
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,700
I’ll stop persuading you.

314
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,100
Then take care of yourself.

315
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,030
Next round of the game is coming soon.

316
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,210
If this is her fate,

317
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,810
then I’ll follow the God’s will.

318
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,670
The second round of the Hunting and Fighting Game will start soon.

319
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:28,980
I will explain the second round’s rules in more detail.

320
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,260
The second round of competition will be held here.

321
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,530
You all must each form a group of two and complete the task together.

322
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,080
You choose your own team, two people a team.

323
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,560
Those that will make an alliance must write your names in blood and put the note inside the Fangding.

324
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,320
Teacher, can we submit our names now?

325
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,690
The Fangding is already burning, which means that the second round has started.

326
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,990
Of course, you can.

327
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,990
[Lin]

328
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,970
[Wang]

329
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,320
Now onwards, you will wear the brown belt.

330
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,170
By then, two of you must move and retreat together,

331
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,250
share glory and humiliation together.

332
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,860
You can register by the night before the second round.

333
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,390
By then, if there’s anyone without a team,

334
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,400
they will be randomly matched and not be informed anymore.

335
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,420
I am asking guidance from ancestral teacher.

336
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,710
During the second round, no matter what, Pei Yuan will try her best

337
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,140
to help First Senior Brother, Yan Jingchen.

338
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,070
Not for myself, nor for my honor,

339
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,160
just so that First Senior Brother can get the top rank.

340
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,620
Just so that Mystic Soul can look down on the world.

341
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,340
First Senior Brother, do you understand Yuan’er’s heart now?

342
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,400
It seems like during tomorrow’s game,

343
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,400
that girl is going to die for sure. Right?

344
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,360
Uncle Zhou.

345
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
You woke up so early.

346
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,500
What are you going to do?

347
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,000
I couldn’t sleep.

348
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,980
There’re so many ways in this world for you,

349
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,390
but you purposely chose the hardest way.

350
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,360
Don’t be worried.

351
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,800
This is the way which God chose for me.

352
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,490
He will definitely cover for me.

353
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,230
Yes, I know.

354
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,050
I can’t stop you, either.

355
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,920
You can’t go there empty-handed.

356
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,330
Take this.

357
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,130
Who cares about their famous or precious swords?

358
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,310
They surely will not be as easy to use as this poker.

359
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,230
Don’t be worried.

360
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,120
I will definitely come back alive.

361
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,420
By then, make delicious food for me.

362
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,190
I’m leaving.

363
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,400
Clique Leader.

364
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,900
Informing Clique Leader, all the participants have gathered.

365
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,200
Everyone, please sit.

366
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,900
This way please. Please.

367
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
Teacher, I've arranged A'Chen to be paired with that lowly slave.

368
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,600
Once the game starts, A'Chen will abandon that lowly slave.

369
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,100
By then, she'll just be left alone. It's impossible for her to break out of the enclosure.

370
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,500
Teacher, just be at ease.

371
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,800
Look at that lowly slave.

372
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,960
Not only did she secretly join and bluff her way out of the first round,

373
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,800
she's even holding that rotten stick to join this round.

374
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,800
She's really bringing extreme shame to Mystic Soul Clique.

375
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,320
Indeed.

376
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,400
It looks like a typical poker they use in the kitchen.

377
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,000
In a grand event like this, she actually dared to bring out such a lowly item.

378
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,600
First Senior Brother,

379
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,940
the game will start soon.

380
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,000
If you’re being distracted by other things and affect the competition,

381
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,600
you will lose more.

382
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,370
Now’s the time.

383
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,000
Students, please enter the field.

384
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,400
Fuyao,

385
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,080
the competition today is very difficult.

386
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,800
Once you enter, your life might be in danger.

387
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
You’re alone.

388
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,400
How is it possible to win?

389
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,680
Why don’t you withdraw?

390
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,900
I’ll beg Father to spare your life.

391
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,200
Thank you, First Senior Brother, for your care these years.

392
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,860
The situation is already like this.

393
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,700
All the decisions are made by myself.

394
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,100
No matter what happens today, it has nothing to do with you at all.

395
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,200
Fuyao.

396
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
Heir Apparent.

397
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,500
Heir Apparent.

398
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,200
Someone come over here quickly.

399
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,900
The Heir Apparent has disappeared.

400
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,400
Shall we inform the Prime Minister?

401
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,600
Let’s look around first. Maybe the Heir Apparent is playing somewhere.

402
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,200
The Prime Minister is watching the game. It’s not good for us to rush in.

403
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,000
Find him first.

404
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,800
Clique Leader Yan, everyone came today to observe the game.

405
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,800
We're not just going to look at the wonderful scenery of Mt. Mystic Soul, right?

406
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
Prime Minister, don’t worry.

407
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Is this the... ?

408
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,400
Prime Minister, you have such good eyesight.

409
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,000
This is our Mystic Soul Clique's most precious treasure, Luque Hologram Box.

410
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,700
Although this box is small, it has the universe inside it.

411
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,200
The whole scenery of Mt. Mystic Soul,

412
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,400
every single trap and weapon, can be seen from this.

413
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,000
The Luque Hologram Box is well known worldwide.

414
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,510
Why don’t you show it to us,

415
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,200
so everyone can look at it?

416
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,440
- Right.
- Let us see it.

417
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,900
Show us this eye-opener.

418
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,100
Rise.

419
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,000
Once the Luque Hologram Box is opened, you can see the whole Mystic Soul landscape inside it.

420
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,800
From as large as the peaking mountains ranges,

421
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,800
to as detailed as a grain of water.

422
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,100
This is where the Hunting and Fighting Game is taking place at.

423
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,800
Although you are all here, you can still observe everything.

424
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,200
If you want to see it more detailed,

425
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,000
then we have to invite our other treasure from Mt. Mystic Soul,

426
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,200
Red Dragon Candle.

427
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,600
All the competitors must only focus on the direction pointed out by the fluorescence light.

428
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,200
They will first stand in front of a fan blade with the same color as their belt.

429
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,200
There are four people in each group and two people with the same belt color will be a team.

430
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,800
The four people standing on the balancing beam must compete to get Dragon Bone Umbrella placed in the center

431
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,740
and afterwards, can go back down to the ground.

432
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,200
The Dragon Bone Umbrella can only carry two people at the most.

433
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,800
Only when two people of the same team standing on opposite sides pass the trial together,

434
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,140
putting on the bead on Dragon Bone Umbrella,

435
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,900
and arrive at the designated destination,

436
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,800
they will then win the game.

437
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,400
The time for this competition is one Dragon Incense.

438
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,500
The ones who can’t escape in the designated time will be eliminated.

439
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,200
I don't know which unlucky person I will be meeting.

440
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,670
We are here already.

441
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,900
Is First Senior Brother still unable to trust me?

442
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,600
Of course not.

443
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,340
When the Dragon Candle is lit, the Hunting and Fighting Game starts.

444
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,400
I wonder if Prime Minister can give me the honor

445
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,700
to light the Dragon Candle for our Mystic Soul Clique.

446
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,410
Look at those floating clouds and high cliffs.

447
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,000
We can’t see anything. How do we know who loses and who wins?

448
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,800
This Dragon Candle is divided into twelve young dragons in total.

449
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,600
Just now, there were twenty-four people in twelve teams who entered the field.

450
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,600
After this round, we will only have six teams, including twelve people left.

451
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,400
These twelve young dragons will go through unlimited changes

452
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,800
and explain everything to everyone.

453
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,400
My disciples have been divided into groups of two, using the color of their belt to identify their group.

454
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,000
If two people were able to pass, the young dragon will spit out a fire of the same color.

455
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,600
By then, we will know who won.

456
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,600
Thank you everyone for supporting us Mystic Soul.

457
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,200
The second round of the Hunting and Fighting Game has started.

458
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,300
In here, I respectfully invite everyone to watch this grand event with me.

459
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,700
I'm toasting everyone first then.

460
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,400
Junior Sister.

461
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,000
How did you come up? Why are you here?

462
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,790
I also asked myself that earlier.

463
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,200
Maybe because I'm already addicted to meddling with other people's business.

464
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,710
Who are you exactly?

465
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,000
Why are you helping me?

466
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,800
I’m the one who saved you. You just need to remember this.

467
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,200
I will ask you to pay me back in the future.

468
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000

♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫
