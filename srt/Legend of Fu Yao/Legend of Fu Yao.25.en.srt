2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,380
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,540
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,660
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,890
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,980
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,930
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,530
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,050
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,730
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,800
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,930
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,610
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,340
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,370
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:21,430
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,830
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,970
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,430
~ Episode 25 ~

22
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,900
Mr. Zong, please.

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,160
Medical Sage Zong, I only have one daughter.

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,760
Save her, please.

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,390
I'll do my best.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,190
Are you saying that the Dragon Scale Armor was on Qi Yun?

27
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,700
Why?

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,160
Have you seen anyone resurrected from the dead?

29
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,520
I have seen it.

30
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,720
Qi Yun's mother gave birth to her at seven months.

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,830
Ever since she was born, her blood counter-flows.

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,930
The location of her muscles and bones is also different from normal people.

33
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,350
All the physicians in the city said that she would not survive past six years old.

34
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,840
Now I see Qi Yun again. She is normal.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,700
She is either cured or

36
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,440
the Dragon Scale Armor is on her.

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,150
How can we ascertain this?

38
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,350
A physician has his way of knowing.

39
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,680
As long as we make her sick, I naturally will have a way to check it.

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,220
If we take down the Dragon Scale Armor,

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,940
she will die.

42
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,290
What then?

43
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,160
Of course, I want to save Fuyao.

44
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,980
But I don't want to let innocent people get involved.

45
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,680
Is there a way where we won't harm anyone?

46
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,990
Older Brother Yue...

47
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,480
She already woke up.

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,290
I will come by every day for the next few days.

49
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,600
Although her illness is urgent, it's not life-threatening.

50
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,880
Thank you so much, Mister.

51
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,860
Prime Minister, you can go in and check on her.

52
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,660
But don't tire her too much.

53
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,210
- Let her rest.
- Yes.

54
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,150
Take care of Mister for me.

55
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,630
Yes.

56
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,210
Mister, this way please.

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Mister,

58
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,450
ever since, disasters shouldn't involve the children.

59
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,310
Our family grudge has nothing to do with Qi Yun.

60
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,570
She's just a little girl.

61
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,710
Every person has their own grudge and fate.

62
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,640
You're unable to put it aside nor change it.

63
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,440
These are all fated.

64
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,660
Competing with the heavens is pointless.

65
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,580
Don't hurt her.

66
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,230
I beg you.

67
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,070
Don't, don't, don't. D-don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

68
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,890
I already took care of those few corpses.

69
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,870
No one will suspect this place.

70
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,060
You can rest assured.

71
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,150
Right.

72
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,840
Are you tired?

73
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,080
I didn't expect...

74
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,590
I didn't expect that they would end up in that bleak situation.

75
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,660
They don't even have a burial place.

76
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,730
They wanted to kill you.

77
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,070
What's there to be pitiful about?

78
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,270
They after all just harmed me once.

79
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,730
The god of destiny makes fools of people.

80
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,910
Who can you blame?

81
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,510
Thank you.

82
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,780
You better just rest first.

83
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,290
No. I've prepared some dishes.

84
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,160
How about... How about you eat some?

85
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,500
No matter if you're hungry or not, eat some. All right?

86
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,450
Why are you suddenly treating me so nicely?

87
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,650
Is this...

88
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,520
yours?

89
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,620
Mister said, as long as you keep this purse on you,

90
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,550
Dense Beam Palace Hall will be the safest place in the palace.

91
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,400
I knew it was you. I knew it was you.

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,780
I knew that you were my Lian'er.

93
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,610
I thought that I would never see you again.

94
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,840
It's really hard to predict things.

95
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Do you know that when-when I was forced to abandon you back then,

96
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,090
I placed this purse on you.

97
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,590
I thought that one day

98
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,440
I might be able to see you again.

99
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,070
It's been so many years.

100
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,210
I really thought you were no longer alive.

101
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,810
No, Older Sister Immortal.

102
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,170
You still call me Older Sister Immortal?!

103
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,440
Are you holding a grudge against me?

104
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,250
Lian'er, how could there be a mother like that?

105
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,900
It's not that I don't think of you.

106
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,340
I really thought you already died.

107
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,390
Do you know that I was missing you every day?

108
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,730
For so many years,

109
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,330
I've been inside this dark room.

110
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,480
I was suffering.

111
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,690
I had it hard.

112
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,380
But even if I destroyed my throat from shouting, no one cared.

113
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,890
I... cursed the Xuanyuan family hundreds of times, hated your Zhangsun clan thousands of times,

114
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,300
bore grudges against this blind heaven ten thousand times!

115
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,500
Good thing...

116
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,870
Good thing you came back.

117
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,160
If not because you appeared alive in front of me,

118
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,320
I... I...

119
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,640
I might really have been unable to continue living.

120
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,760
Right. Before, I didn't know who you were.

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,860
I even captured you and hit you.

122
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,840
You're not injured, right? Let me see.

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm all right. I'm all right.

124
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,330
Don't blame, Mother. I'm getting old.

125
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,840
I have a weak brain.

126
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,950
Don't blame, Mother. Don't blame, Mother. Don't blame, Mother.

127
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,820
- I'm not blaming you!
- Don't blame, Mother.

128
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,960
I'm not blaming you. I'm not blaming you.

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,040
I... but you're really not my Mother.

130
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,170
I'm an orphan.

131
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,080
They said that since I was young. I didn't have a mother.

132
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,510
They're lying to you!

133
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,590
Those are just lies that they fabricated so we wouldn't get reunited!

134
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,920
Oh, right. Look.

135
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,040
So old and tattered.

136
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,960
It's all because you don't have a mother.

137
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,980
Now. Now, come to Mother's side.

138
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,290
I can...

139
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,460
mend it really well. It's true. I can mend it really well.

140
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,040
No need, no need. It's all right, it's all right. No need to trouble you.

141
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,870
- It's all right, it's all right.
- It's not troublesome.

142
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,690
How about this? How about this? We don't want these.

143
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,560
We don't want these anymore.

144
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,800
You, take a look. You, take a look.

145
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,720
Lian'er, these past years, you are my only yearning.

146
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,760
I will think about your physique every year.

147
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,170
Think about how tall you must be and made you a lot of clothes.

148
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,270
When you were little, I thought that you must be growing up very quickly.

149
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,820
Hence, I made a lot of colorful dresses.

150
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,910
Look. These are the colorful dresses.

151
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,190
I made a lot of them.

152
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,540
And this one. Look. This is also a colorful dress.

153
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,630
Later on, when you reached the marriageable age,

154
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,050
I thought that you should wear a ruqun already.
(ruqun: blouse and skirt)

155
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,210
Look. This is a ruqun.

156
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,970
Also, you should wear some inner clothing, too.

157
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,030
You, take a look. Look at how pretty it looks.

158
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,250
Afterwards, when you were older,

159
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,370
I thought that you should have more loose clothing.

160
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,100
Right. Look. Anyway, I've been sewing these for these past years.

161
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,200
I-I was then able to gather this much clothing.

162
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,020
You, take a look.

163
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,750
If you don't like it then, I can make some more. Okay?

164
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,870
As the daughter of me, Xuanyuan Xiao, you must look beautiful.

165
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,590
I finally found you.

166
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,810
You, take a look.

167
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,100
My daughter is so beautiful.

168
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm going to let you wear a lot of pretty clothes, all right?

169
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,940
Come.

170
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,360
You, take a look.

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,460
My daughter looks so pretty.

172
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,590
Wrong, let's not talk about these anymore.

173
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,670
Go rest first, Daughter.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,820
I've asked the servants to go pick some flowers.

175
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,280
Have you forgotten?

176
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,340
When you were little,

177
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,230
you liked looking at yuyan flowers the most.

178
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,700
That's right.

179
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,570
At that time, I placed yuyan flowers on your head.

180
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,760
You would smile the whole day.

181
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,170
Having those flowers was really good.

182
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,340
With those flowers, one will become more energetic, right?

183
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,460
Let's eat first. Look.

184
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,210
Taste this. It's aromatic.

185
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,400
Taste it.

186
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,780
- Quickly taste it.
- Granny!

187
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,160
I've picked the flowers!

188

197
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,190
Prefecture Princess, you've just recovered from your illness.

198
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,620
Be careful of contracting a cold.

I seemed to have seen you somewhere else.

201
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,720
I've been living in the Prime Minister Manor for a long time.

202
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,550
There are so many people going in and out of this manor.

203
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,580
It's not strange for you to have seen me.

204
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,610
No. It's not that.

205
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,460
You seem like an old friend... an old friend that I haven't seen for a long time.

206
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,780
Prefecture Princess is weak.

207
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,330
It can't be helped for you to have hallucinations.

208
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,620
You better just rest well.

209
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,930
I'll take my leave.

215
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,440
So great! I finally am able to see you, Older Sis Fuyao!

216
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,390
You tell me, you little ancestor, why did you come here?

217
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,750
Do you know how dangerous this place is?

218
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,460
- I came to save you.
- You...

219
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,150
You're here to save me? What can you do to save me?

220
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,160
I just have to save you. I just have to save you.

221
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,620
Okay... Save me...

222
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,290
Where is Little-Little Tail?

223
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,770
- Zhuzhu?
- Yes.

224
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,950
She-She went to look for General Zhan.

225
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,100
I knew that you were inside the palace.

226
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,050
Hence, I initially planned to sell myself as a slave to enter this place.

227
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,280
But who would have known that upon entering, they wanted to take my—

228
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,530
Take your what?

229
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,060
My... The root of my life.

230
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,190
I surely wouldn't allow it; hence, I quickly escaped.

231
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,880
And then, I met this Granny and she saved me.

232
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,090
Or else, I'd be dead.

233
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,590
But I finally was able to see you. So great!

234
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,210
Say, you-you're really bold.

235
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,620
You dared to come in here. This...

236
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,750
- Wasn't it all because of you?
- And you're even looking like this.

237
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,770
What is this? What is it?

238
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,090
Let me see.

239
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,720
This Granny doesn't like men.

240
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,910
She only wants women to serve her.

241
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,350
I had no choice. I can only disguise like this first.

242
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,810
You're not allowed to laugh at me.

243
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,560
It was very dangerous. Give it back.

244
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,310
- It quite suits you.
- Really?

245
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,200
- You're quite pretty.
- Give it back.

246
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,730
Say, this Granny looked so fierce.

247
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,800
She still was willing to save you?

248
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
You don't know. This Granny's temper may look weird on the surface,

249
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,240
but she knows how to dote on people very well. I tell you.

250
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
And sometimes, when she couldn't see clearly,

251
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,140
she would mistake me as her daughter.

252
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,350
Sometimes, she's sane. Sometimes, confused.

253
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,050
And think about it. With such a huge courtyard, she's living alone.

254
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,810
She's really quite pitiful.

255
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,390
Does it look okay now?

256
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,590
Are you really fine?

257
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,210
For a lady, appearance is the most important.

258
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,160
You must be careful in maintaining it.

259
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,420
First, for this hair, you mustn't casually mess it up.

260
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,640
Good thing, this Older Sister Immortal is confused.

261
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,100
Or else, my altered face would have been exposed in front of this mirror.

262
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,280
There has never been anyone who told me those.

263
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,060
I don't know how to be a lady, either.

264
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,550
That is because you didn't have a mother before.

265
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,280
Now, it's different.

266
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,000
You're back to my side.

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,920
You will have everything that other lady did.

268
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,770
I will slowly teach you what ladies should do and should think.

269
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,610
Actually, I've never seen my parents since when I was little.

270
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,270
I don't know why they abandoned me after giving birth to me.

271
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,170
Too bad, you're not my real mother, either.

272
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,670
Of course, I am your mother.

273
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,410
Look. Look. Your ears, eyes, and lips,

274
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,560
aren't they all exactly the same as mine?

275
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,930
This child is as pretty as me when I was younger.

276
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,080
In the future, you surely will find your ideal husband

277
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,410
and live forever bound by love.

278
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,050
Then... Then, what about you?

279
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,490
With you being this beautiful, where is your husband?

280
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,690
My husband?

281
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,170
My husband...

282
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,620
My husband...

283
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,840
What to do?

284
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,050
He doesn't love me.

285
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,240
He doesn't like me.

286
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,040
He doesn't like me!

287
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,190
He only likes her!

288
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,940
He has always liked her!

289
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,830
They-They have a child.

290
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,700
The two of them have a child.

291
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,740
What should I do?

292
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,930
It's fine now. It's all right.

293
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,930
I am the princess of Deep Water!

294
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,400
I am a princess!

295
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,660
I marrying into your Megrez as your empire's hundred years worth of blessings!

296
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,170
You... You can't kill my Lian'er.

297
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,130
You all mustn't treat me like this.

298
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,140
No! You can't treat me like this!

299
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,310
You mustn't kill my Lian'er!

300
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,060
You can't! My Lian'er.

301
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,330
- My Lian'er.
- It's all right now!

302
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,600
You all can't! You can't kill my...

303
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,220
Never thought...

304
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:22,070
Never thought that in your heart, there are so many sad things.

305
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,800
It's fine now...

306
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,340
From now on, I am your Lian'er.

307
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,590
Older Sis Fuyao!

308
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,900
- Older Sis Fuyao—
- She just fell asleep.

309
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,960
- Bad news. Someone's here to catch you. Quickly escape.
- Why would someone arrest me?

310
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,990
Who—

311
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,550
Are you Lady Fair, Yuwen Zi?

312
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,360
It's me.

313
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,980
That's good then. May Lady come with us.

314
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,680
Prime Minister is asking for you.

315
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,630
It's like this. His Majesty gave a decree before

316
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,040
that I must stay here in this Limbo Palace as a punishment.

317
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,020
I'm not allowed to casually leave.

318
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,680
I don't dare to disobey that.

319
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,490
My Ladyship, His Majesty went to worship heaven in Forever Water based on ancestral edict and isn't in the palace today.

320
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,530
Prime Minister asks for you because someone from Changning Manor, your hometown, is here.

321
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,740
Your mother traveled far to come here just to see you.

322
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,930
Moreover, with the graces bestowed on you by His Majesty and Prime Minister,

323
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,920
it's still better that you go, My Ladyship.

324
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,470
Prime Minister is so considerate.

325
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,830
I really have to thank him well.

326
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,450
It's just that I haven't seen my mother for a long time.

327
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,240
I should change into a more decent clothing and doll myself up.

328
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,260
What do you say?

329
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,660
That's good, too. My Ladyship, please hurry.

330
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,200
We'll just wait here.

331
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,020
The water ritual in Forever Water is such an important event.

332
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,760
Why didn't Prime Minister come?

333
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,440
Prime Minster has a cold so he really can't get up.

334
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,630
He already asked for a sick leave from the inner court very early this morning.

335
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,850
The auspicious time has come.

336
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,820
Let the water ritual begin!

337
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,760
Offer blessed water.

338
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,360
Deep Water is tiny to the water area of the Five Regions.

339
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,030
Rely on the heavens to bestow us continuous flowing rivers.

340
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,760
Hope that the Xuanyuan clan can forever have a shining dome.

341
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,270
Water as the vital channel of the nation and is to be venerated upon.

342
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,050
Every drip is intelligence which radiates colorful light.

343
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:11,000
Set up an altar to make an offering with sincere intention.

344
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,600
End of ritual.

345
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,620
Do the rite of worship.

346
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,700
Kneel down.

347
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,400
First kowtow!

348
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,090
Rise!

349
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,760
Another kowtow.

350
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,960
Rise!

351
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Third kowtow.

352
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,510
Stand up. The rite is complete.

353
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,090
Sink the offering.

354
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,900
Water is gentle and firm. It has unending strength.

355
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,340
The weight of the offering will cause it to float or sink

356
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,440
Sea God will know if it's a standard or experimental one.

357
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,920
Alas, I beg you, the dead, to partake of this sacrifice.

358
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,540
The great offering has ended.

359
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,250
Sea God has returned to his palace.

360
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,550
His Majesty will now give out his blessings.

361
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,240
What do we do, Older Sis Fuyao?

362
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,340
I fear that we're in great danger today.

363
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,800
What?

364
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,760
Why don't we hurry and run away now then?

365
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,950
Or once we get to the Prime Minister's Manor with so many people inside and outside,

366
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,170
it won't be as easy to run away anymore.

367
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,690
What about this? I will go distract them. You run first. Okay?

368
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,030
We can't.

369
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,530
Why?

370
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,550
You— What are you going to do?

371
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,880
I can't escape.

372
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,490
If I escape, I will drag down a lot of people.

373
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,810
They will all lose their lives because of it.

374
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,560
Then... Then other people's lives are lives, but don't you want your life?

375
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,260
Of course, I want my life.

376
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,290
I am not done having fun with this life of mine.

377
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,900
Don't worry. When necessary, I'll think of a way to escape.

378
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,280
After this water ritual, all the big and small etiquettes probably tired Your Majesty out.

379
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,070
That's right. Let's hurry and go back to take a rest.

380
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,080
- Your Majesty, Your Majesty.
- Yes?

381
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,070
According to the ancestral rules, you still can't go back yet.

382
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,440
Your Majesty.

383
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,230
This matter is related to the living of tens of thousands of people.

384
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,810
It can't ever be done sloppily.

385
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,740
According to the ancestral rules, after the end of the ceremony,

386
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,410
Your Majesty should also stay at the Forever Water Altar for a day.

387
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,440
Eat vegetarian dishes and chant the sutras. Pray for the common people to receive blessings.

388
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,980
Only then will the ritual be completed.

389
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,760
Yes. Yes. Yes.

390
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,930
If that's the case, then let's follow the rules.

391
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,860
But the Prime Minister is past 50 years old.

392
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,770
He is working so hard every day that he is getting sick.

393
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,270
Hurry and appoint someone to pay a visit at the Prime Minister's Manor.

394
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,240
If Prime Minister really does get seriously sick, who would handle all the important matters of Deep Water?

395
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,090
I will go do that immediately.

396
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,470
Go then.

397
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,620
Your Majesty.

398
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,690
And I even have to live in a place like this.

399
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,960
Tell me. It's so cold and humid here, and I even have to eat vegetarian dishes alone and chant the sutras.

400
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,640
Who knew being a king would have to suffer so much?

401
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,490
I understand how you feel, Your Majesty.

402
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,500
I already prepared it for you, Your Majesty.

403
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,930
All right.

404
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,550
Your Majesty.

405
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,370
Your Majesty.

406
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,230
Greetings to Your Majesty.

407
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,910
You did quite well.

408
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,330
Thanks, Your Majesty.

409
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:34,170
Your Majesty, I know that when you stay in this palace, you'll surely be bored.

410
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,520
And so I thought, no matter what, I must come here to relieve your boredom.

411
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,980
I even brought your favorite snacks from the palace.

412
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,600
I hope that Your Majesty won't blame me.

413
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,820
Forever Water is a bitter, cold place to start with.

414
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,160
Not only are you not disliking and avoiding the place, you are even willing to accompany me to here.

415
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,620
Why would I blame you?

416
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,410
It's just that I feel bad that a beauty has to suffer with me.

417
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,830
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

418
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,360
I am so thrilled.

419
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,860
Bring it over.

420
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,660
Bring them up there.

421
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,160
Fuyao.

422
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,190
- Cao Cheng.
- Here.

423
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,500
Arrange for some dancers to come here.

424
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,710
Let me have some fun.

425
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,810
I understand.

426
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,930
What's the situation?

427
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,580
Hurry and let Xuanyuan Min go to the Prime Minister to save Older Sis Fuyao.

428
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,640
Hurry! There's not a lot of time.

429
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,430
I'm a bit tired today.

430
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,340
All of you guys can leave.

431
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,170
Your Majesty, I was serving you at the palace that day.

432
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,290
I didn't expect that I would fall asleep because I was feeling unwell.

433
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:11,760
Not only did I not fulfill my responsibilities as a concubine, I even ruined Your Majesty's mood.

434
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:18,190
Every time I think about that, I feel very ashamed.

435
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,860
Your Majesty,

436
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,090
I don't know if Your Majesty can give me another chance today,

437
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,940
I'll definitely serve Your Majesty well.

438
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,420
Rong'er, do what I said.

439
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,390
Don't scream.

440
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,300
Don't shout.

441
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,780
Okay?

442
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,240
Okay.

443
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,010
Your Majesty. So annoying.

444
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,800
Your Majesty.

Lady Fair, please.

452
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,840
Lady Fair, please wait for a bit.

453
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,020
I'll excuse myself now.

454
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,750
Godfather,

455
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,800
didn't we say that I would meet Mother today?

456
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,400
Where is she?

457
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,310
It's not that your mother wants to see you,

458
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,870
it's I who have something to ask you.

459
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,810
If Godfather needs anything, you could just directly ask for me. Why should—

460
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,250
How dare you?

461
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,440
You dare to conspire with Xuanyuan Min.

462
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,260
Have you, Godfather, misunderstood something?

463
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,900
I've never conspired with His Majesty.

464
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,540
Is that so?

465
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,940
Then why is it that as soon as I arranged for someone to bring you out of the palace,

466
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,400
he immediately hurried back from Forever Water to find you?

467
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,260
Is His Majesty really in the manor?

468
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,890
Water Ritual, an important matter like that,

469
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,960
he could abandon everything and come to my manor to find you.

470
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,000
He said that he knows I invited Lady Fair over without letting him know about it first,

471
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,100
he is so angry that he rode a horse and came over.

472
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,480
No one could persuade him.

473
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,240
He wanted to bring you back no matter what.

474
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,530
You tell me, are you two so close that you can't bear to be separated from each other

475
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,400
or is there another reason?

476
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:56,500
Godfather, I'm a person that got punished into Dense Beam Palace Hall.

477
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,950
Moreover, His Majesty has never spent a night with me.

478
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,790
How could I dare to conspire with him?

479
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,240
You, Yuwen Zi, are just a pretext.

480
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,050
This guy's ulterior motive isn't on you. It's on me.

481
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,700
Do you still remember?

482
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,650
Before I sent you to the palace,

483
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,070
I told you that your birth star is an overlord star.

484
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,900
At that time, how did you answer me?

485
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,590
My life was all given by you, Prime Minister.

486
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,550
If you have any orders, you, Prime Minister, only need to say it.

487
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,400
Now, you're already the Lady Fair.

488
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,530
Does your past words still count?

489
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,960
Even if there is thunder or rain, as long as you say it and I can do it,

490
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,190
I will surely not refuse and go through water and fire to fulfill it.

491
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,150
Being able to share your burden is my blessing.

492
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,760
Is that so?

493
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,790
Then today, your chance has come.

494
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,790
Since Xuanyuan Min ascended the throne, I kept enduring and making considerations.

495
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,820
But he has become more absurd and willful.

496
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,590
He has disregarded the life and death of the citizens.

497
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,370
He's not worthy to rule Deep Water Nation.

498
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,560
That throne was originally mine.

499
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,760
I made him my puppet, did not breed a tiger to give me trouble.

500
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,120
Now, Xuanyuan Min has become a thorn in my heart and must be eliminated.

501
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,410
Today, he came to my manor alone.

502
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,140
That's like willingly walking into a net.

503
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,130
This is a rare and great opportunity.

504
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,220
Xuanyuan Min is currently in the mid courtyard drinking tea and resting.

505
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,390
I want you to go and personally kill him.

506
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,080
Let me see your loyalty.

507
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,960
If he dies, I'll guarantee you a luxurious life for the rest of your life.

508
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,970
Or else, your Yuwen family will die with him.

509
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,120
Your Majesty.

510
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,440
Prime Minister didn't give you a hard time, right?

511
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,340
I especially rushed back from Forever Water to fetch you back to the palace.

512
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,340
Your Majesty, I am just a concubine's daughter of the Yuwen family.

513
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,880
Because of Prime Minister's care, I was able to serve you like this.

514
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,800
Today, I am still under punishment.

515
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,740
How can I trouble Your Majesty to personally come fetch me?

516
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,360
For the Winter Clothing Festival matter, there is another story behind it.

517
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,030
Sorry I had to hastily punish you to go to Dense Beam Palace Hall.

518
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,540
Since Lady Virtuous was harmed by someone else,

519
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,320
we must investigate this matter clearly.

520
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,620
You are usually clever and cute; hence, I'm very fond of you.

521
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,070
No matter what mistakes you've made, I'm writing it all off today.

522
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,870
In another ten minutes,

523
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,960
if she still doesn't take action,

524
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,830
then kill her for me.

525
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,380
Yes.

526
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,190
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

527
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,490
You...

528
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,350
Your Majesty. Your Majesty...

529
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,290
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

530
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,370
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

531
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,760
My god, you killed His Majesty.

532
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,230
Godfather, I've killed someone. Godfather, I've killed someone.

533
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,120
Let me take a look.

534
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,640
It's a wizard that's about to die.

535
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,210
It's his blessing to have died in your hands.

536
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:35,940
- Heng'er, spend some money to console his family.
- Yes.

537
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,910
- I... !
- Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Okay?

538
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,510
I'm here.

539
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,550
- Godfather.
- Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

540
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,460
Come, come, come. Sit down first.

541
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,070
You're in shock.

542
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,540
Listen to me. It's just a small trick. Okay?

543
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:10,980
But I was able to see very clearly your loyalty to me.

544
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,590
I didn't think...

545
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,080
I didn't think...

546
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,930
that you... don't trust me at all.

547
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,690
Everything I have today was given by Godfather.

548
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:33,490
Even if it wasn't for Godfather but myself,

549
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,930
I would surely listen to you, too.

550
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,260
Being afraid is normal.

551
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,220
If you're not afraid, then that's wrong.

552
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,170
I've killed someone. I've killed someone. I've killed someone.

553
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,670
You can kill someone for me.

554
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,040
I now know how much loyalty you have for me.

555
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,640
Listen to me. In a while, I'll send people to escort you back to the palace.

556
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,060
You must still continue living your days well. Okay?

557
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,070
Leave the rest to me.

558
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,090
But you have to remember that no one else can give you a luxurious life.

559
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:15,250
No one else will care if you're alive or dead.

560
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,330
I can protect you.

561
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:23,280
When you go back, just continue being Your Lady.

562
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,240
You surely will have wealth, splendor, and glory.

563
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,780
In the future,

564
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,080
I still have a very important task for you.

565
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,800
I will remember it.

566
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,940
You!

567
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,800
It's you.

568
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,690
It's really you.

569
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,110
