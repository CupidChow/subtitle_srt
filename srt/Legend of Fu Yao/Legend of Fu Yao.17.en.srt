00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,370
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,530
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,690
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,940
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,900
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,650
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,510
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,030
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,720
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,830
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,890
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,590
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,360
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,560
~ Episode 17 ~

22
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,390
It's just a small scale from the Dragon Scale Armor in front of us,

23
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,370
but it's able to hold the dome of Deep Water and control all the mountains, rivers, lakes, and oceans of Five Regions.

24
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,820
If one can really obtain the Dragon Scale Armor, how omnipotent can one become!

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,580
I didn't know Mister would be interested in such a thing.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,250
A gentleman is in awe of three things:

27
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,010
the fate, great political figures, and the words of sages.

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,680
I don't believe in the words of sages,

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,920
but I have to believe in fate.

30
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,030
Mister, there's a fire in the Prime Minister's Manor.

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,270
I'm not sure if Mr. Zong is able to deliver the thing.

32
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,320
Fuyao!

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,140
You got him, Godfather!

34
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,630
Chase!

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,460
North Park is on fire. It's a big fire!

36
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,280
Now everyone is busy trying to put out the fire.

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,960
How did the fire start?

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,690
Tonight, the wind chimes array was making sounds. There were intruders who got inside the manor.

39
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,020
I already ordered a search.

40
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,720
I'm afraid this is related to the fire.

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,070
They've got some nerve! How dare they intrude into the Prime Minister's Manor!

42
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,820
You must catch them!

43
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,210
Yes!

44
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,260
- Are you all right? There—
- Don't touch it.

45
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,810
There's poison.

46
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,260
Go this way.

47
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,600
Take me to the palace.

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,880
What did you say?

49
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,920
Cut the crap! Take me to the palace.

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
You!

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,300
Let's go!

52
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,200
They are right in front, chase!

53
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,250
Assassins were seen in Qi Zhen's manor, but now they have escaped

54
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,450
and people are chasing after them.

55
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,960
One of them must be Zong Yue.

56
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,430
And the other one must be that girl.

57
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,520
One of them has an arrow wound.

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,940
I'm afraid Mr. Zong is unable

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,040
to deliver the thing that we are waiting for.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,570
Therefore, the plan will be—

61
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,890
Opportunities come and go quickly.

62
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,890
There's only this specific time in a year

63
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,660
that we can find out the whereabouts of this Dragon Scale Armor.

64
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,390
If we miss it, we will have to start all over again.

65
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,030
Are we safe here?

66
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,310
There are always two thousand guards at the palace.

67
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,590
And three thousand backup troops within three li outside the palace,

68
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,790
in addition to the garrison led by Qi Zhen.

69
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,460
So even a fly won't be able to flee from here.

70
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,500
Are you crazy? City of Capital Kun is so big,

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,380
but you pick here as a hideout. Do you want to get yourself killed?

72
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,350
If I die, it's because of someone's fault.

73
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,620
Die with everlasting regret.

74
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,890
Okay, okay, okay.

75
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,810
Today is a bad day. You cannot die.

76
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,330
I'll help you escape even if I have to die. Hurry, let's go!

77
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,570
You're the only one who would do self-destructive things.

78
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,720
Come with me.

79
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,030

[Garrison]

82
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,750
There are assassins who got inside the palace.

83
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,590
Take my order, lock all nine city gates.

84
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,060
Do your best to capture the assassins.

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,950
Big rewards for anyone who can capture the assassins.

86
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,760
Open the door!

87
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
Are you all right?

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,170
What is this place?

89
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,470
- This is a safe place.
- You?

90
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,150
Be careful.

91
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,810
You?

92
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,450
- Help tear my clothes open.
- You—

93
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,520
Rip it open!

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,430
It's going to hurt.

95
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,640
What kind of poison is that?

96
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,020
Your wound is all black.

97
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,120
Are you able to endure the pain?

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,250
If not because my medicine has superb healing power,

99
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,960
for an ordinary person, he would have died a long time ago.

100
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,370
This Qi Zhen, he appears so composed normally,

101
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,160
but I didn't realize that he is in fact a man hidden with extraordinary skill.

102
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,870
In the past, Qi Zhen became famous in Five Regions by the Sun Shooting Bow.

103
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,860
He and the former Heir Apparent Wenyi, one was prominent in martial arts, and the other one in literature,

104
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,540
were named as the two heroes of Deep Water.

105
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,420
However, it had been such a long time ago,

106
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,140
and most of the people during that time already passed away.

107
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,300
Therefore, such old memories were buried.

108
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,920
For such a highly skilled person, it's hard to believe that his own arrows are tipped with poison.

109
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,390
He is indeed very evil!

110
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,370
He has suffered such a big loss today.

111
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,330
He certainly won't just let it go.

112
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,100
I think very soon he will come to the palace to search.

113
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,860
Then-- Then what should we do?

114
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,590
You can't go anywhere.

115
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,830
You need to rest first then leave this place.

116
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,380
No, I have something important to do and can't stay here.

117
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,500
Slower!

118
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,260
Be careful!

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,060
Don't push yourself too hard, all right?

120
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,490
For your current physical condition, you will die before you can leave this place.

121
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,610
All right, all right. It's me who dragged you down. Okay?

122
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,060
How about, whatever urgent matter that you have,

123
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,920
if you trust me, you let me do it for you. All right?

124
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,490
You don't trust me, do you?

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,160
Don't complain that I didn't offer help.

126
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,450
You just don't need my help.

127
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,050
Look at yourself.

128
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,590
Look at yourself that you can't even stand up.

129
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,450
Help me deliver this safely.

130
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,520
What is this thing?

131
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,670
There's no need for you to know what it is.

132
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,880
Just safely deliver it.

133
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,750
Just give it to me, okay?

134
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,840
How do I deliver it and to whom?

135
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,350
Follow down this path, keep walking.

136
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,050
Don't stop at any junctions.

137
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,690
Just keep walking straight.

138
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,980
Don't hesitate, then you will see a person.

139
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,530
Don't worry.

140
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,260
I'll surely deliver this successfully.

141
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,010
You rest well here.

142
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,190
I have to get back to the Prime Minister Manor right away

143
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,120
to avoid any suspicion from Qi Zhen.

144
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,410
Without you, I can get away more easily.

145
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,590
It doesn't matter if you die, but don't lose that thing.

146
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,880
Because of what you have just said, I definitely will come back alive and make you pay.

147
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,800
How come it's you?

148
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,300
I should ask you the same question.

149
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,930
Did you miss me so much that you even dare to dash into the palace?

150
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,300
Don't flatter yourself!

151
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,120
Put on your clothes quickly.

152
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,090
This is my bedroom.

153
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,820
I was about to call upon people for help changing my clothes.

154
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,020
How about you do it!

155
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,040
You wish!

156
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,730
Your Majesty, there is an assassin.

157
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,270
I was late in coming to protect you.

158
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
Do you want to die?

159
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,810
I want to stay alive with you.

160
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,580
Your Majesty!

161
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,240
I was afraid that the assassin would agitate Your Majesty.

162
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,520
I especially came to check it out.

163
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,280
I was just enjoying my sleep.

164
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,300
Prime Minister really spoiled my joy.

165
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,020
I am just really worried for Your Majesty's safety.

166
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,040
What if there was an assassin?

167
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,750
There are so many guards in the palace,

168
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,710
and there is even Prime Minister outside guarding.

169
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,120
What kind of assassin would want to throw away their life like this?

170
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,210
I think it's better to take caution in everything.

171
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,700
Can't you see now that I am all well?

172
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,090
All right. Prime Minister, go work on your things.

173
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,210
Can it be that Prime Minister thinks the assassin is hiding here?

174
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,990
I said just now already

175
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,820
it's better to take caution in everything.

176
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,660
Why don't you, Prime Minister, come on my dragon bed and take a look?

177
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,410
What if the assassin is hiding under the blanket?

178
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,810
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

179
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,380
Your Majesty.

180
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,140
Don't be scared. I am just joking with the Prime Minister.

181
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Sorry to have interrupted the King's enjoyment.

182
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,410
I will go outside the palace to guard Your Majesty.

183
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,030
It's good that you know.

184
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,360
Don't spoil my joy.

185
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,940
His Majesty really is in the mood to enjoy.

186
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,990
It's the prime of the King's manhood. It's natural.

187
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,570
I see.

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,860
All right, that old fox is gone.

189
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,330
I suffered a great deal this time. How are you going to compensate me?

190
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,660
How to compensate?

191
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,700
Accompany you to get it back.

192
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,190
You-- You go die!

193
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,540
You can't beat me in fighting.

194
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,400
Let go of me!

195
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,390
Let me ask you. I was originally waiting here for someone else.

196
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,350
Why did you come instead?

197
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,010
And you dare ask that?

198
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,270
If you hadn't framed me at the hunting grounds that day,

199
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,230
Qi Zhen wouldn't have me enter the palace.

200
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,290
And I wouldn't have to be in such a troubled state right now.

201
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,010
So you came into the palace to interrogate me?

202
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,380
How would I have a moment of leisure?

203
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,980
It's all because that damn doctor is injured.

204
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,040
What has happened?

205
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,990
- Godfather.
- How is the situation?

206
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,010
We have searched through the palace. We didn't find any evidence of an assassin.

207
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,270
The person clearly ran towards the direction of the palace. Continue searching!

208
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,770
Yes.

209
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,090
Reporting to Prime Minister. Zhang Henian has mobilized 3,000 men from the eight garrisons

210
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,360
and are gathered outside the Dragon Moist Gate.

211
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,230
What?

212
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,970
Our garrison went into the palace to investigate the assassin,

213
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,420
but Zhang Henian said that weapons don't have eyes and is afraid to hurt His Majesty.

214
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,760
He commanded to transfer the garrison to protect His Majesty.

215
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,340
That's him having a suspicious mind, and assuming that godfather has ulterior motives.

216
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,070
I am afraid he will make a big deal out of what happened tonight.

217
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,410
Dismiss everyone.

218
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,390
We can't leave a subject for talk right now, but we also can't just let this matter go.

219
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,170
Even if the person escaped out of the palace,

220
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,650
he or she can't escape out of the City of Deep Water.

221
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,100
Yes.

222
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,050
He was hurt quite badly.

223
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,650
That's why he told me to give this to you.

224
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,940
What exactly is inside this?

225
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,630
Do you want to know?

226
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,370
I don't want to know.

227
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,410
This is the key that starts the Imperial Qilin Stage.

228
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,090
Zong Yue used so much effort just to deliver a key?

229
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,050
You do want to know, after all.

230
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,880
I don't want to know.

231
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,700
Why not?

232
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,780
You're too sly.

233
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,220
Really? Tell me.

234
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,430
How am I sly?

235
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,760
You are always acting secretly.

236
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,030
You never explain clearly about anything that you do.

237
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,880
You even use your friends.

238
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,600
You like fooling other people.

239
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,190
It looks like you won't forgive me easily on that incident at the hunting ground that day.

240
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,000
Of course not.

241
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,420
A petty person like me will hold grudges.

242
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,060
Do you know why I wanted to lie to you that day?

243
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,640
It's because I don't want to let you go.

244
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,840
I knew if you were to leave that day, perhaps I wouldn't see you again.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,210
I want to see you more.

246
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,500
Your Majesty has such sweet words.

247
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,000
However, unfortunately, I don't believe a word you say.

248
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,270
All right. I already gave you the thing.

249
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,890
I don't owe him and I don't owe you.

250
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,630
I will leave first.

251
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,750
Don't you know you should try your best to do what was entrusted by others?

252
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,970
If Zong Yue were here today, only half of the mission is accomplished.

253
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,250
I am not Zong Yue.

254
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,940
Go find him to accomplish the other half.

255
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,540
Mister, are you letting her out just like that?

256
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,550
No need to worry.

257
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,170
The tea has gotten cold.

258
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,660
Okay.

259
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,870
Two cups.

260
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,270
What?

261
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,400
Why did you come back?

262
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,350
I am worried that you would miss me too much.

263
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,610
That's why I am showing you some mercy and keeping you company for a little longer.

264
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,930
I not only hate to part with you, but also feel for you.

265
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,380
There are so many guards outside.

266
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,420
It's probably not easy to escape, right?

267
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,330
Here, have some tea to calm yourself down.

268
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,990
What exactly is your intention for keeping me here?

269
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,560
I've said that I hate to part with you.

270
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,610
Stop with that.

271
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,040
All right, no matter what motive you have,

272
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,210
I will agree to finish up the task. Okay?

273
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,910
Okay.

274
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,490
Let's go.

275
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,910
Don't let anyone in.

276
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,550
Yes.

277
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,340
Follow me.

278
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,390
Through here again?

279
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,040
Yuan Bao.

280
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,860
Is he coming with us, too?

281
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,620
Down there is filled with cobwebs, and there is no sun, moon or the stars to guide our direction.

282
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,400
A common person won't be able to tell clearly, but it can.

283
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,120
Come here.

284
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,940
Let's go!

285
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,980
Hey, aren't you Your Majesty?

286
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,630
Are you still so cautious?

287
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,380
In this palace, there are Qi Zhen's informants everywhere.

288
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,750
We have to be careful.

289
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,460
Your underground of Deep Water Palace has so many secret passages.

290
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,360
Since ancient times, were there any rulers not afraid to die?

291
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,100
The more power they had, the more they were afraid people would cast greedy eyes on them.

292
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,360
Therefore, kings from every generation started to build all these passages.

293
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,030
So when that day came, they could keep their lives safe.

294
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,580
Then, what happened to the people who built the secret passages?

295
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,970
- They are all dead.
- All dead?

296
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,550
Only dead people would not disclose secrets.

297
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,130
Wasting thousands and thousands of lives to keep one life at the top to live.

298
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,220
This is unfair.

299
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,130
Fairness? What is fairness?

300
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,680
To a king,

301
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,690
strengthening his own power and maintaining his rulership

302
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,430
are the fairness that they wanted.

303
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,950
No wonder there are so many people

304
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,890
willing to risk the lives of their families

305
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,860
in order to attain absolute power.

306
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,330
All men are greedy.

307
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,780
And power is the most desirable thing.

308
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,040
Then, are you that kind of person?

309
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,680
If I say I'm also like that,

310
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,320
would you still stand beside me just like what you do today?

311
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,660
You have to go strive for the things you want

312
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,120
but don't use dirty tricks.

313
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,350
Don't turn yourself into someone that even you yourself don't recognize.

314
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,230
What about you?

315
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,710
What do you want?

316
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,990
Can Your Majesty give me what I want?

317
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,490
Tell me about it.

318
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,940
That will not be necessary.

319
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,900
I will fight for the things I want myself.

320
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,310
You need to know,

321
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,160
the one who only relies on oneself for their whole life may live a difficult life.

322
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,670
Of course, I know that.

323
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,530
Gain because of luck; loss because of fate.

324
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,530
But if I fought hard and still didn't get what I wanted,

325
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,530
that's my fate and I would accept it.

326
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,450
Remember what you have said today.

327
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,880
Look, quick! Your stinky hamster can't wait any longer.

328
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,150
- Looks like we have arrived.
- Where?

329
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,160
Imperial Qilin Stage.

330
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,770
Old Master.

331
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,570
Didn't they say the fire was under control?

332
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,950
It is under control.

333
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,430
But the wind was blowing just now, the fire started again,

334
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,980
and it spread to the other courtyards.

335
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,130
What is the condition in North Park?

336
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,560
It's all burned down.

337
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,050
- What about Yuwen Zi?
- Miss Yuwen... she...

338
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,240
I'm afraid she—

339
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,710
- Godfather...
- How is it going?

340
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,720
I've searched the inner city, but there's no trace of the assassins.

341
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,100
Incompetent thing! You failed again and again.

342
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,910
You used two thousands people from the garrison.

343
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,620
Now you actually are telling me that you couldn't find them.

344
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,060
My trusting you on handling everything is in vain.

345
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,730
I've made you in charge of the guards in the Prime Minister's Manor,

346
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,500
but you let people freely come into the manor to do vicious things.

347
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,830
Those are assassins.

348
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,000
The assassins who wanted to kill me.

349
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,880
Remember, if you fail to catch them,

350
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,980
there's no need for you to keep this job anymore.

351
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,190
Hey!

352
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,790
Touching it, may not be a big deal to you.

353
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,550
But Deep Water will have to face the calamity of being drowned.

354
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,120
It seems that I've seen this place before.

355
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,230
Unless you've been here before,

356
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,230
otherwise, there's only one Imperial Qilin Stage in this world.

357
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,730
It's really the first time that I came to visit the Deep Water Palace.

358
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,490
But this place, there's a sense of deja vu.

359
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,360
In this world...

360
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,040
In this world, there is actually such a color that exists.

361
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,030
Although there are millions of colors that exist in this world,

362
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,380
they are all formed by the combinations of red, green, and blue.

363
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,420
They look complex,

364
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,380
but in fact they are just ordinary things, overlying millions and millions of times.

365
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:39,290
In a year, now is the only date and time that one can see this wonder.

366
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,020
Dragon Scale Armor.

367
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,020
The Dragon Scale Armor is appearing.

368
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,700
Is there a foreshadow?

369
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,040
Fuyao!

370
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,370
Such radiance!

371
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,990
Could it be... the Five-Colored Stone?

372
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,600
You are the one predestined by the Mystic Spirit Leaf.

373
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,680
Only you can change the universe.

374
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,840
Find the girl with the Five-Colored Stone.

375
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,630
Or else, the Five Regions will once again be doomed eternally because of her.

376
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,720
This Five-Colored Stone is unexpectedly with this girl.

377
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,900
Could it be she's the one that my respectful teacher wanted me to search for?

378
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,140
The Dragon Scale Armor is summoning the girl.

379
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,690
Could there be seals in her body?

380
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,410
They mutually reinforce and restrain each other.

381
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,800
The Dragon Scale Armor can break this girl's seals.

382
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,650
Once they are broken,

383
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,140
her destiny will be forever changed.

384
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,980
If not broken, her life will be in danger.

385
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,430
What should I do?

386
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,870
What has happened?

387
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,250
When did we come back here?

388
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,840
What happened to me earlier?

389
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,580
Do you not remember?

390
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,170
Remember what?

391
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,650
You fell asleep suddenly, so I could only carry you back here.

392
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,700
That being said, what have you eaten lately?

393
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,530
You are so heavy!

394
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,670
Nonsense!

395
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,790
Then let me try to hold you once again.

396
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,360
Don't try that again.

397
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,100
Let me go help you get some water.

398
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,890
Get up.

399
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,920
Between you and I, we can do without the formal greeting ritual.

400
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,030
I know women who have slept on my dragon bed were reluctant to leave.

401
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,590
Don't worry.

402
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,220
I'll be nice to you.

403
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,370
You—

404
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,890
As a girl, you hit people when you get upset.

405
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,330
I like that!

406
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,890
Are you feeling better?

407
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,430
What technique did you just use?

408
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,340
How long have you been in this condition?

409
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,210
- What condition?
- Dream realm.

410
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,010
Did you always see unusual scenes in your dreams?

411
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,690
Your heart was heavy every time you woke up.

412
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,220
How do you know all this?

413
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,000
Come into the palace, then I'll tell you.

414
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,860
- You want me to stay in the palace?
- Yes.

415
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,530
You slept on my dragon bed for so long.

416
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,540
A man and a woman all alone together, having a good time.

417
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,350
What else can you do if you don't come into the palace to keep me company?

418
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,950
I didn't do it on purpose.

419
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,800
I was forced into it.

420
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,100
Since this has happened,

421
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,790
whether you are willing or not, you can only comply with me.

422
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,200
Since I'm the king of Deep Water,

423
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,800
I will surely give you a rightful title you deserve.

424
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,700
Do you really want me to come into the palace?

425
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,290
Aren't you worried that I may turn your harem upside down?

426
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,600
That is exactly what I wish for.

427
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Don't even think about it.

428
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:11,990
Don't you want to know the relationship between your dreams and the stone on you?

429
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,200
You have to break the seals.

430
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,600
The answer to the riddle is in the Deep Water Palace.

431
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,800
You can help me?

432
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,100
If you help me, I'll help you.

433
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,830
By the way,

434
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:37,000
did you gang up with that annoying doctor tonight to fool me into coming into the palace?

435
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,800
Is that right?

436
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,000
If I really deliberately seek all means to make you come to me,

437
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,400
what do you think it's for?

438
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,800
How do I know what it's for?

439
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,400
After all, whatever you say or think, and the things you do are all so elusive.

440
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,800
- Just tell me if it's true or not.
- You want to know?

441
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,520
It doesn't matter whether it's true or not.

442
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,500
I don't want to get involved, either.

443
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,740
What if I tell you that I can help you break the seals?

444
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,200
If I have to beg a favor in such a way, I'd rather solve the problem by myself.

445
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,840
You're ambitious and righteous!

446
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,000
But if you want to break the seals in Deep Water Palace,

447
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
it may not be a simple matter.

448
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Just for the guards everywhere in this palace, you won't be able to handle them.

449
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
Why don't we make a bet?

450
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,900
Make a bet?

451
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,400
The seals in your body can only be broken in this palace.

452
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,000
And it just so happens that I am the one who can help.

453
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,000
When you were born, you already had Five Seals on you.

454
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,400
If these Five Seals were never activated,

455
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,600
you could initially live peacefully for your whole life.

456
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,100
But, unfortunately, you mastered Breaking Ninth Cloud.

457
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,800
These Five Seals were then activated.

458
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,900
This is the Five-Colored Stone.

459
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,500
When I saw you that year, it was hanging on your neck.

460
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,600
Now, I return it to its rightful owner.

461
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,200
Wear it and go to all the nations of the Five Regions.

462
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,100
There will always be a place with a condensation of spiritual influence.

463
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,600
Five-Colored Stone will help you to reach there,

464
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,000
- and break the seals for you.
- Uncle Zhou!

465
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,100
What do we bet on?

466
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,800
Find the girl with the Five-Colored Stone.

467
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Or else, the Five Regions will once again be doomed eternally because of her.

468
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,800
This Mystic Spirit Leaf is with me all the time.

469
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,300
If you can take this away from me, I'll help you break the seals.

470
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,800
I don't want or ask anything in return.

471
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,000
If you can't obtain it this same day of next month,

472
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,700
you will have to obey me and work for me.

473
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,350
I won't work for you obediently.

474
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,400
I can accept reasonable requests.

475
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,300
I don't have the faintest idea how to deal with you. Just do it.

476
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,100
Whoever tries to back out is a bastard.

477
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,900
Good Yuan Bao, show me the way out.

478
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,640
Yuan Bao, escort her out.

479
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,600
I never thought that the person I've been searching for was Fuyao.

480
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,100
This girl,

481
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,600
can she really awaken Di Feitian

482
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,300
and cause the Five Regions to be doomed eternally?

483
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,400
Should I complete the mission by taking her back

484
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,300
or find the Dragon Scale Armor to help her break the seals?

485
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
Little Tail!

486
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,000
Little Tail!

487
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,800
Older Sister Fuyao.

488
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,600
You are finally back.

489
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,400
Don't tell anyone that I'm back.

490
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,150
Why you don't want them to know?

491
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,700
Fifth Elder Brother and Xiaoqi—

492
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,600
are really worried about you.

493
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,270
I still have to get back to the Prime Minister's Manor.

494
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,800
I can't really tell you all the details why I'm back,

495
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,000
I will tell them later.

496
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But your face—

497
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,400
That's exactly what I want to ask you if there's a way to maintain it like this.

498
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,400
To maintain it? Yes, there is a way!

499
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
My mother told me that this holy charm of Qiongye is the super instrument for face changing.

500
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,820
As long as you're operating it with supernatural power during the face changing period,

501
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,800
then your new face can be maintained for a very long time.

502
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Older Sister, let me enlighten you by showing you how awesome this treasure is.

503
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,600
Look carefully.

504
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,300
Done!

505
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,400
So how is it?

506
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,400
It must be because I kept thinking about Fifth Older Brother and got distracted!

507
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,600
What? You transformed me into Zhan Beiye?

508
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,040
It's okay, okay, okay.

509
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,600
Don't panic. Let's do it again. Let's do it again.

510
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,490
This is not right. Let's do it again. Let's do it again.

511
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,800
Give me another chance. I can definitely do it.

512
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,380
This is not right.

513
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,970
It's a great success.

514
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,450
That's right. There is something else.

515
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,470
Wait for me.

516
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,260
Same old rule, don't get close to a mirror or water.

517
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,860
Don't worry!

518
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,800
Older Master, the rooms in North Park were damaged the most in the fire.

519
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,400
I've sent servants there to examine it.

520
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm afraid that Miss Yuwen—

521
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,300
Bring her to me, dead or alive.

522
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,000
Even if there are only ashes, you have to bring it to me.

523
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Yes, Sir.

524
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,400
Such a nice hall and it got all burned down.

525
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,300
Miss Yuwen... Miss Yuwen.

526
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,000
Old Master, Old Master, it's Miss Yuwen.

527
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,600
Godfather.

528
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,200
- Godfather.
- Don't cry, don't cry.

529
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Godfather.

530
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
You've scared me to death.

531
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,490
The fire was huge last night.

532
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,200
Did you-you just hide there all the time?

533
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,200
Godfather, last night...

534
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,960
last night a big fire suddenly started.

535
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,400
I was all alone.

536
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,700
I was really scared. I was really scared.

537
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,700
So I... So I... kept running... and running.

538
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,300
I don't know when... don't know when I passed out.

♫ What do you know? ♫

541
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,600
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

542
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,400
♫ If there were no three poisons, if there were no worries, ♫

543
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,700
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

544
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,200
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

545
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

546
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,300
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

547
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,700
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

548
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:42,700
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

549
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,800
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness  ♫

550
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,800
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

551
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,400
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

552
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,400
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

553
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,400
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

554
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,900
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

555
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

556
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,200
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

557
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

559
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime  ♫

560
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,300
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

561
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,000
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

562
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫
