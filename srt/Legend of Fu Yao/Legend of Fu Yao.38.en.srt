00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,500
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,000
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,700
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,500
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,300
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:21,400
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,800
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,300
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,200
~ Episode 38 ~

22
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,830
What about Megrez Crown Prince?

23
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,070
Is the Megrez Crown Prince that great?

24
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,910
I would be with you regardless of who you are.

25
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,190
Then why?

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,600
I need an explanation.

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,050
The wine is out. I'm going to get some.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Tell me! What are you afraid of?

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,300
What are you really afraid of?

30
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,730
Because every single day that we spent together is just temporary.

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
This is all temporary. Don't you understand?

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,900
This is temporary.

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,580
Do you think I don't know just because you don't want to talk about it.

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,900
The toxin inside me is actually incurable.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Passion Lockup Toxin.

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,700
Passion Lockup Toxin is actually incurable.

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,100
Do you think I want to be like this?

38
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,400
I like you

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,800
but I have to push you away.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Do you think I want to be like this?

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Do I want it like this?

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,160
I don't want you to be sad.

43
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,050
I don't want you to stay with a dying person.

44
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Don't.

45
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,670
Don't talk about the future.

46
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,970
I will not let you die.

47
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,770
This is not something you can decide.

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,300
Trust me.

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,600
Trust me.

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,940
Trust me.

51
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,100
I won't let you die.

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,600
Definitely not.

53
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,000
The Lantern Festival is your birthday.

54
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,850
I keep telling myself

55
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,090
not to prepare a very touching celebration for your birthday.

56
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,200
I know you have everything.

57
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,800
I don't have enough money to buy you a valuable gift, either.

58
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,400
I thought you might feel lonely,

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,000
that's why, I prepared a lively show for you.

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,500
I hope you like it.

61
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,450
I like it.

62
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,300
Flowing light.

63
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,010
For this, you have to thank that hateful doctor.

64
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,000
He has helped a lot.

65
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,980
It was he who told me that Flowing Light is the mythical bird of South Border.

66
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,600
When the evening star rises, they then soar up into the night sky.

67
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,200
When the morning star lights, they return to their nests in full strength.

68
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,800
They are able to travel thousands of li during the night,

69
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,700
but also get locked up here forever.

70
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,300
Did Zong Yue tell you that Flowing Light only has a month long life?

71
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,440
Really?

72
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,510
But they never fear death.

73
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,800
When they are about to die,

74
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,500
they will always smell fragrantly and are encircled with a purple light.

75
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,960
Each one like a falling petal, returning back to the soil.

76
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,090
This is how a person should live like.

77
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,800
Live brightly when one is alive.

78
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,900
Die honorably when one is dead.

79
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,830
I once met a woman.

80
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,560
She overlapped with a shadow that's deep within my heart.

81
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,740
I wanted to know her so I got close to her.

82
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,270
During the process of getting close to her, I slowly forgot my original goal.

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,200
I wanted nothing and lacked nothing in my life.

84
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,100
I never had to fight for something or knew the concept of respect,

85
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,750
but because of this woman, I had these feelings for the first time.

86
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:38,680
This feeling was so intense to the point that I've forgotten about that shadow.

87
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,300
I just want to see her existence.

88
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,500
Fuyao,

89
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,390
I hope that you can be like this bright and clear moonlight,

90
00:08:50,390 --> 00:09:00,500
staying by my side forever to cross time, life and death until the end of the world.

91
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Being able to be with the person you love,

92
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
what's there to fear about death?

93
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,470
Flowers will always be around.

94
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,900
People will always be around.

95
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,600
A bosom friend, for a lifetime, never betrays.

96
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
Urgent Megrez report!

97
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,050
Lord Emperor is critically ill.

98
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,790
His Majesty, the medicine has been warmed.

99
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
After getting sick for so many days,

100
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,500
the officials in the Imperial court can't hide their intentions now. Right?

101
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,000
From the looks of it now, the majority of the court members are not going beyond their place.

102
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Who is the majority

103
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,800
and who is not in the majority?

104
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
Official Duan accepted Prince Assist's—

105
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,400
Stop. Get to the most important point.

106
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,200
Okay. This is a secret report sent last night.

107
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,400
Is this about Prince Assist Pingrong?

108
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,600
You are wise.

109
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,800
Just tell it to me.

110
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
It's not some urgent matter.

111
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,000
It just says that Prince Assist has been making nonstop movements lately.

112
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,800
First, he had successive secret meetings with the messenger of the Duke of Myriad District.

113
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,200
And then, he sent someone to South Border to deliver some treasures to the dukes there.

114
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
From the looks of it,

115
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,300
Prince Assist is planning to make his move against His Highness Crown Prince.

116
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,400
How is Crown Prince?

117
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
The secret letter from the Imperial city has been sent out.

118
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
I think Crown Prince should have received it now.

119
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,600
- It's just that...
- Continue with what you're saying.

120
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,200
It's just that Prince Assist has set up soldiers on the road back here.

121
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,700
I fear that the journey of Crown Prince back here will be very dangerous.

122
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,460
Since you've decided to return, what route have you planned to take?

123
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,330
The Secret Guard has already sent me news

124
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:19,020
that the east and west roads towards Megrez have soldiers of Prince Assist waiting in ambush.

125
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,500
He has guessed that I will immediately rush back to Megrez and is preparing to ambush me midway.

126
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,100
These are not the only roads back to Megrez.

127
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
There's one more.

128
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,050
It's the most dangerous, but the quickest.

129
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,020
Geya Desert.

130
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,500
Geya Desert is also known as the death desert.

131
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,840
It's the most dangerous and most mysterious place in the Five Regions.

132
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,390
Legend says that the gates to the netherworld can be found there.

133
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,040
For so many years, no one was able to come out of Geya Desert alive.

134
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,210
And you are still going.

135
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,280
I'm willing to give it a try.

136
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,450
Two sons fighting, one will surely get hurt.

137
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,970
- Han Lin.
- I'm here.

138
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:16,760
In your opinion, who is more suitable to have my Megrez Empire's emperor position?

139
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,570
Choosing the ruler concerns the nation, I dare not make casual remarks.

140
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,520
Han Lin, you have been with me for so many years.

141
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,130
You can be considered my confidante.

142
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,660
If you don't say it, who else dares to speak the truth in front of me?

143
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,940
Rise.

144
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,630
- Yes.
- Just say it. I won't mind.

145
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,890
Crown Prince is sharp and excels in intelligence.

146
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,140
He is able to hide his thoughts a bit deeper.

147
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,370
But suddenly you'll see that

148
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,390
he seems to lack the ruthlessness in ruling the army compared to Prince Assist.

149
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,330
He's too aloof and disdains to win over anyone's heart.

150
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,670
As for Prince Assist, he has fought in battles for many years.

151
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,360
He has courage, is good in strategies, and has more wild ambition.

152
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,720
It's just that sometimes, he's a bit rash.

153
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,210
What are the court officials thinking?

154
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,430
After all, Your Majesty has conferred Crown Prince his title long before

155
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,560
and he has just learned some abilities from Firmament.

156
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,500
Majority of the court officials are then following your intention.

157
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,480
Following my intention?

158
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,660
It's just as I have guessed.

159
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,100
From the looks of it,

160
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:36,440
Megrez, Five Regions, the whole court thinks that Wuji is the only choice for the Megrez Crown Prince.

161
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,920
Do you know this matter?

162
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,570
The whole Imperial court knows it.

163
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,730
Then Wuji himself must also know it!

164
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,340
Hence, he relied on this public respect and support

165
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,860
to start doing as he wishes and disobeying me without restraint.

166
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,430
Crown Prince is young.

167
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,400
Liking one or two women is understandable.

168
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,170
He most likely is just having a moment of obsession this time.

169
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,970
Just for liking a woman from the commoners

170
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,790
actually led to the destruction of the engagement between my Megrez Empire and Plough Nation.

171
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:16,060
As a crown prince, he should know the importance of the marital alliance between two nations.

172
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,300
How could he not know?

173
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,800
This child has been spoiled too much since he was little.

174
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,380
His path has also been too easy and smooth sailing.

175
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,350
Not experiencing any difficulties and suffering isn't a good thing for him.

176
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,220
It's time.

177
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,170
He should experience some trials and be taught some lessons.

178
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,560
Go and call Prince Assist here for me.

179
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,020
Have you ever thought that maybe he just wants you to choose this path?

180
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,720
He surely had made preparations on all three paths.

181
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,550
It's just that Geya Desert is too dangerous.

182
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,390
He will probably just set up ambushes on the mountain paths towards the desert.

183
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,350
As long as I get rid of these soldiers, the road ahead surely will have no more obstacles.

184
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,050
What if he dispatches a huge army and gambles it all?

185
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,560
Even if that's the case, no need to be overly worried.

186
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,830
I've sent the Secret Guard to return to the capital to mobilize my army.

187
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,530
The Thousand Cavalry of Upper Yang Palace will meet me in Geya Desert.

188
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,030
The environment there is intensely harsh.

189
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,800
It's my best chance to win despite being at a disadvantage in numbers.

190
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,600
Compared to Prince Assist, I'm more worried with those strange things inside the desert.

191
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,970
I keep feeling uneasy.

192
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,200
When have you become such a nag?

193
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,260
I'll go with you.

194
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,480
Emperor Father, it's just been days since I last saw you.

195
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,180
How come you've become like this?

196
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,460
If you're gone,

197
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,190
how can I still live?

198
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,150
Emperor Father, your extraordinary power is matchless.

199
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,460
You're unrivaled in wisdom.

200
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,110
I wasn't able to serve you by your bedside for these past years.

201
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,410
I was so unfilial.

202
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,460
Pingrong.

203
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,890
Emperor Father, earlier... I was just too worried about you.

204
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,760
Look at you.

205
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,150
Who dares to hand the Imperial throne of Megrez to your hands?

206
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,970
For the Five Regions world, boundless land, millions of citizens,

207
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,930
will you be able to take responsibility?

208
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:31,040
Emperor Father, I was a sorry figure earlier all because

209
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,810
I was thinking about you, worried about your health,

210
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:41,090
worried about the Lord Emperor of the Five Regions.

211
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:46,320
It's also because father and son are connected in heart

212
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,870
that I couldn't control myself, Emperor Father.

213
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,130
This illness came too timely.

214
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,970
I initially want to use it to test the intentions of the court officials.

215
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,550
Never expected that I will give you the best opportunity to make a move.

216
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,310
Emperor Father, I-I don't understand what you're saying.

217
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,130
You dare to do it and not dare to admit it?

218
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,890
You've failed my expectation from my teaching.

219
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,230
This royal throne has always been a result of bloodshed!

220
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:49,350
Emperor Father is wise! I understand.

221
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,500
Wuji... I didn't expect that Emperor Father will not help you, either.

222
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,600
This time, you're dead.

223
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,460
Say, which scriptwriter wrote that

224
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,950
when a woman has pledged her love, she had to personally sew a pouch.

225
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:40,230
How come it can't be just cutting off a bundle of logs or forging a blade?

226
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,290
You mustn't mock me.

227
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,000
I already did my best.

228
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,390
Look, a lotus.

229
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,040
Does it look like one?

230
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,320
You're the one who looks like a rice ball!

231
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,340
How is it like one?

232
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:06,270
It does... not look that good.

233
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,780
I'm not sewing it anymore.

234
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,640
Anyway, I won't be able to give it out.

235
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,140
Older Sis Fuyao! Older Sis Fuyao, quickly look at Tie Cheng!

236
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,530
What are you doing?

237
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,350
Crown Prince Wuji took him and doesn't know where they went.

238
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,960
- Quickly go look.
- Wuji?

239
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,980
- Quick.
- Slow down...

240
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,910
I will surely do my best to do the matters that Teacher instructed.

241
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,940
I'm swearing with my life to take care of Teacher's wife.

242
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,700
No, Tie Cheng, are you dumb?

243
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,170
Who is your teacher?

244
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,920
And who is your teacher's wife?

245
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,540
The person who taught me martial arts is my teacher.

246
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,400
Fuyao then naturally becomes my teacher's wife.

247
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,910
What?

248
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,190
Young lad... you're teachable.

249
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,550
I don't want to be his teacher's wife!

250
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,160
Oh?

251
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,700
Really?

252
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,770
Are you unwilling?

253
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,850
What "oh?"

254
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,340
- I tell you.
- Yes?

255
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,880
I don't care if you accept any student.

256
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,220
But don't involve me. We have a very clean relationship.

257
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,210
Really?

258
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,600
You say that our relationship is very clean.

259
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,990
- Why then are they saying that you are my woman?
- You!

260
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,270
And covertly, they are also saying that we are a match made in heaven,

261
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,610
the dragon and phoenix of Yao City.

262
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,000
Bullshit!

263
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,380
I never accepted any student nor plan to accept one.

264
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,230
I made an exception this time for your sake.

265
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,020
For-For my sake?

266
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,690
I... No need.

267
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,110
As a teacher's wife, I still must care about his food, drinks, life and death.

268
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,690
I-I am very poor. I can't afford to care about those. Don't involve me.

269
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,130
Don't worry. When Master is not here, I'll take care of eating, drinking and everything else.

270
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,470
I'll guard your life. I'll take care of you well.

271
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,290
You... shut up!

272
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,460
Wait.

273
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,240
What does that mean you won't be here?

274
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,460
Are you leaving?

275
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,860
I'm leaving now.

276
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,600
So sudden?

277
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,650
Do you hate for me to leave?

278
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,430
My good student.

279
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,630
Take Xiaoqi and leave first.

280
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,380
- Let's go.
- Yes, Teacher.

281
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,810
Hurry, let's go.

282
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,930
All right, I'll return really soon.

283
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,290
Although you have a Xiaoqi by your side who is clever and kind,

284
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,550
he still is too young and has a bit of a poor physique.

285
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,410
I can see that Tie Cheng sincerely respects you and he has some martial arts foundation.

286
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,050
Hence, I taught him a little.

287
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,460
Hope he can guard by your side and ensure your safety.

288
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,790
With my murderous aura and I'm an expert in turning an ill-fate into a good one, who would dare to offend me?

289
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,830
Don't push yourself too hard.

290
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,790
Protect yourself well.

291
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:17,250
In case-In case something goes wrong, what will I do?

292
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,300
I received a message from the Imperial city to return immediately because my father is ill.

293
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,570
It won't be easy to see him face-to-face.

294
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,550
The poison in your body hasn't been completely removed and you still have to guard the whole Yao City.

295
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,790
Girl, you must not—

296
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,700
Don't worry.

297
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,850
I still have a lot of good food and good wine to enjoy.

298
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,950
I'm not ready to get hurt.

299
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,230
Just be at ease and handle your matter.

300
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,530
I will defend Yao City well for you and wait for your return.

301
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,940
Wuji has to leave because his father is ill.

302
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,900
Why are you leaving in a hurry?

303
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,210
Someone is using death to threaten me, that if I'm able to find an antidote for your poison and you die,

304
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,920
he won't make my life easy, either.

305
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,730
How much favor do you owe him?

306
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,820
You work so hard for him.

307
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,200
Actually, you two owe me much more.

308
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,840
[Yao City Magistrate Office]

309
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm leaving then.

310
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,040
Okay, leave.

311
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,990
Are you not trying to keep me here?

312
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,790
I can't keep you.

313
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,260
For me, you broke the marital alliance with Plough.

314
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,670
The situation in the Megrez Imperial City currently is very delicate to begin with.

315
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,470
You are supposed to stay there, yet you rushed towards here.

316
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,690
I'm with you, but I don't want to burden you.

317
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,800
All right, I'll leave Yuan Bao with you.

318
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,960
He can be useful in an emergency.

319
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,170
Also, Yao City is where three nations meet, an important thoroughfare for the six vassal states.

320
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,530
It's a critically important area.

321
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,520
I'm entrusting the city to you.

322
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,760
Guard it well.

323
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,220
Don't worry.

324
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,210
I surely will guard Yao City well.

325
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,370
While the city exists, I exist. Once the city falls, I—

326
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,600
I want you all to exist.

327
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,080
An important guest has come!

328
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,770
It's Official Xu!

329
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,610
He is the VIP today.

330
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,810
Today's Prince Assist. Tomorrow's Lord Emperor of the Five Regions!

331
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,420
Greetings, Your Highness Prince Assist!

332
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,850
You just drink and enjoy.

333
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,170
- Xiao Hong, you must serve them well.
- Old Master!

334
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,650
- You are finally here.
- I got it.

335
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,410
Old Master, come, let me offer you a toast.

336
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:32,070
I have good food and wine in my room waiting for you.

337
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,550
How long has it been since you visited me last time?

338
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,520
I really missed you.

339
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,760
Enough.

340
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,750
Greetings, Your Highness.

341
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,130
I, Hong Ying, have fulfilled my mission.

342
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,470
Prince Assist stole the dispatch tally of the Thousand Cavalry of Upper Yang Palace.

343
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,270
His men have set out now.

344
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:19,000
An official road and the water route from South Border to Megrez are now being heavily guarded by his soldiers.

345
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,280
He now has sent out a batch of his most elite men towards Geya Desert.

346
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,800
I don't know who they plan to assassinate.

347
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:35,500
Who do you think they want to assassinate, Prince?

348
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,990
Hong Ying, you are so smart.

349
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,410
This is so clear.

350
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,890
Why ask me?

351
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,480
These past years, Prince Assist has been spending huge money to cultivate his power.

352
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,450
His Highness Crown Prince has also been vigilant.

353
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,380
Now that the two princes are fighting each other, you can grab the opportunity.

354
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,220
I don't understand why Your Highness doesn't seem to care.

355
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,500
Why should I get involved in their sibling rivalry?

356
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,270
If you're really as broad-minded as I think you are,

357
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,210
why would you care about the survival of the Crown Prince Wuji in Geya Desert?

358
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,890
Prince Assist has wild ambitions but is lacking in intelligence and tactics.

359
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:37,920
Crown Prince is intelligent and sensible, popular with the public.

360
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,650
If Megrez is given to a rash person,

361
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,180
and he pushes the world into turmoil,

362
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,650
then as a royal prince, I can't just watch and do nothing.

363
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:55,150
Could there be something else in this world other than extreme power that will win a man's heart?

364
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,130
Twenty-seven years ago, in my Zhangsun clan,

365
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,300
I was the most favorite and powerful prince.

366
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,790
This Megrez royal throne was surely mine.

367
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,800
But I didn't put too much importance on these things that I can easily obtain.

368
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,210
Life is hard and short.

369
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,120
You can bring anything with you in birth or death.

370
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,690
If you're unable to find a person that knows your heart,

371
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,410
what's the use of giving you the world?

372
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,660
I have found it.

373
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,450
I have found that person.

374
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,750
For me,

375
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,710
she's more important than the world.

376
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,870
Once a person falls in love, he would become hesitant.

377
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:04,090
I lost the royal throne and also lost the drive to fight.

378
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,400
And more so, I lost my greatest love.

379
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,710
I fear... that in the end,

380
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,820
I might even lose the chance to guard by her side.

381
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,870
The hardest trial to pass in this world is the trial of love.

382
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,000
How am I different?

383
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:39,920
Zhangsun Jiong arranged you here to win my trust, to be a pawn to monitor me.

384
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,630
You have worked hard.

385
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,570
Your Highness...

386
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,550
My heart-My life has been yours.

387
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:56,060
Because of that, I don't want to let you continue jumping into this fiery pit.

388
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:01,550
Once I get dragged into this heir battle, I might not have the time to care about your safety anymore.

389
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,450
Tonight, I will send someone to escort you out of here.

390
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,490
From now on, live a peaceful life.

391
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,970
Gently.

392
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,740
- These were the ones I previously promised you.
- There are more here.

393
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:30,110
10,000 liang of gold and 30,000 of armors, I will never break my promise.

394
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,270
Today, I'm giving them double the amount.

395
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,470
I sincerely want to make friends with you.

396
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:46,520
Being able to serve Prince Assist is an honor for my Black Tribe Gang.

397
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,180
Your Highness, just instruct me of your plans.

398
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,520
I want you to attack Yao City.

399
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,740
Even if Your Highness didn't give the instructions, I can't allow Yao City to exist anymore!

400
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,050
Once you've successfully conquered Yao City, head east to meet with my men.

401
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,420
We will then directly charge into the imperial city together.

402
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,790
After this is over, won't the whole South Border be yours?

403
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:21,940
With just a measly Yao City, it's too easy for my Black Tribe Gang to conquer it.

404
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,760
May Your Highness just wait for my victory report on Yao City.

405
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,010
If we count the dates, Wuji has been gone for four days.

406
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,140
I know you miss him very much.

407
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,740
I miss him, too.

408
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,240
What is happening with that rascal now?

409
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,410
Giddy up.

410
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,030
Giddy up.

411
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:38,020
Giddy up!

412
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,600
[Black Tribe Gang]

413
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,550
[Black Tribe Gang]

414
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,620
What?

415
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,530
The magistrate of Yao City is called Fuyao?

416
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,000
That bitch is actually not dead.

417
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,250
Zhangsun Wuji, you dare to trick me?

418
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,730
The battle is about to begin.

419
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,420
That woman won't be alive for long.

420
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,820
Not only her, Zhangsun Wuji's life is also in peril.

421
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,500
Spread my command that whoever is able to get the head of the magistrate of Yao City, I'll reward him with 10,000 liang gold!

422
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,940
Yes!

423
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,530
We should have taken our arms and annihilated those cruel and evil bandits long ago.

424
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,810
Why did we drag it out until now?

425
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:41,040
Now, their number has increased to several times.

426
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,280
Yao City is an important political fortress, a territorial meeting point of three nations.

427
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,110
Clutching Yao City is like clutching the whole western part of the Five Regions.

428
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,870
For a critical area like that, bandits have long been coveting it.

429
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,620
Before they colluded with the magistrate, so Yao City was already in the bag for them.

430
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:59,330
Now, with a just magistrate serving, how could they endure it?

431
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,560
I fear that this disaster—

432
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,280
When I saw them mobilizing their army in the middle of the night in Mt. Vast Yang before,

433
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,320
I already knew that trouble would be coming.

434
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,770
I just thought that after they were severely beaten last time,

435
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,050
it wouldn't happen that fast.

436
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,540
Never thought—

437
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,360
So what do we do now?

438
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,450
We have to fight regardless.

439
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,200
It's just that the whole Yao City has only 3,000 soldiers.

440
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,340
The Black Tribe Gang has at least 20,000 to 30,000 men, plus the reinforcements brought by that idiot....

441
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,580
probably 50,000 men in total.

442
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,440
3,000 against 50,000?

443
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,090
How are we going to win this battle?

444
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,040
More importantly, the reserved rations of Yao City is only enough for five days.

445
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,080
It's not enough for fighting a war.

446
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,680
If our strength isn't on par, let's first avoid a blunt confrontation.

447
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,360
If the stocks are not enough, let's think of all possible ways to stock up on food.

448
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,370
If the food can only last for five days,

449
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,790
let's try our best to end the fight in five days.

450
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,440
In front is the Geya Desert.

451
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,900
Logically speaking, your Thousand Cavalry of Upper Yang Palace should have arrived.

452
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,970
Thousand Cavalry of Upper Yang Palace have never failed their mission.

453
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:36,500
If they are not here on the agreed time, then there is only one possibility.

454
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,890
I fear that a change has already happened in Megrez.

455
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,400
The chasing army is here.

456
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,260
We have no more retreat path.

457
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,580
We can only fight to the death.

458
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,320
There's more and less in army strength.

459
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,670
There's good and bad armor quality.

460
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,890
But a person mustn't lose his moral courage.

461
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,540
This land is still our Yao City.

462
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,280
Long swords are made to suck blood.

463
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,020
I, Fuyao, will exist together with Yao City!

464
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,370
Exist together with Yao City!

465
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,160
The army of Black Tribe Gang is very close to us now.

466
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,930
But our rations can only last for less than three days.

467
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,080
Adopt measures appropriate to the actual situation.

468
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,620
Everyone, defend this Yao City with me.

469
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,630
Looks like Zhangsun Pingrong has bet everything on this.

470
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,050
Let us keep him company until the end then.

471
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,070
Killing can happen in just an instant.

472
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,410
What's scary isn't the greatness of the fighting skills, but delaying things to deplete the enemy's strength.

473
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,580
If this continues, I fear that we both can't get out of this alive.

474
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,330
Tell me then, what should we do?

475
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,160
Let's divide and conquer.

476
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:16,270
You take the official road and bring the news of my return to the Secret Guard in Megrez Imperial City.

477
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,860
I will continue with this path.

478
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,800
Only by that can you have the chance to survive.

479
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,000
This is... they've all escaped?

480
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,800
The empty city tactic.

481
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,140
Are we going in or not?

482
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,670
Archers!

483
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,680
Shoot your arrows!

485
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,960
See? There should be no problem.

486
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,670
Tell your men to enter first to confirm the situation.

487
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,690
Move slowly.

488
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,740
How come our men get to enter first?

489
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,580
Based on Prince Assist's military order!

490
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,810
Go!

491
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,120
Giddy up.

Withdraw! Withdraw!

"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

498
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,530
♫ What do you know? ♫

499
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,530
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

500
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:09,320
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

501
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,510
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

502
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,160
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

503
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,060
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

504
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,240
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

505
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,670
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

506
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:33,540
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

507
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,400
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

508
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,690
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

509
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,180
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

510
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,260
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

511
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,350
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

512
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:57,440
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

513
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,370
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

514
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:08,040
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

515
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,940
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

516
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,030
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

517
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,980
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

518
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,220
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

519
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,280
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

520
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,880
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

521
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,720
♫ Have someone's company♫

522
