00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,350
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,480
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,610
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,950
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,950
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:39,860
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,540
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,010
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,700
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,850
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,890
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,330
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,430
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:21,550
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,840
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,910
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

~ Episode 17 ~

22
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,510
Miss!

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,240
Godfather! Godfather!

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,320
- Don’t cry. Don’t cry.
- Godfather!

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,270
You've scared me to death.

26
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,530
The fire was huge last night.

27
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,030
Did you-you just hide there all the time?

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,990
Godfather, last night... last night a big fire suddenly started.

29
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,540
I was all alone.

30
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,700
I was really scared. I was really scared.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,760
So I... So I... kept running... and running.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,360
I don't know when... don't know when I passed out.

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,520
When I woke up... When I woke up, I was already here.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,530
Luckily, I still can see you, Godfather.

35
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,940
You don’t have to be scared. Don’t have to be scared.

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,500
It’s good that you’re alive.

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,230
Take some good rest.

38
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,160
In a few days, you still need to go to the Serene Lateral Courts to verify your identity.

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,360
This is a serious matter.

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,020
Both of you, bring Miss back to take a bath and change her clothes.

41
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,620
Yes.

42
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,450
Hurry up.

43
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,910
Does it still hurt?

44
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,200
Do you know why I slapped you in front of everyone?

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,840
I didn’t do my jobs properly and caused Godfather to be in danger.

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,470
I deserve the slap.

47
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,470
This fire started strangely.

48
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,080
Assassins are also unusual people.

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,840
How did he dare to enter Prime Minister’s Manor

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,820
and was able to avoid all the traps?

51
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,060
Obviously, you can’t find him easily.

52
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,620
Yun Hen,

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,680
you grew up with me since you were young.

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,840
All my subordinates all see you as my son.

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,380
Slapping you in front of everyone today was more effective than punishing ten men.

56
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,220
Do you understand?

57
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,270
Once I let go of catching the assassin, they may not do their best.

58
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,350
But because I slapped you in front of everyone,

59
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,530
they will know how serious this is and not procrastinate.

60
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,220
Those in power should control the weak with warnings and lures.

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,120
About the teaching of being soft when you're strong and being smooth when walking in danger,

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,150
I already said this to you.

63
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,760
Godfather.

64
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,440
Today, I did lose my temper.

65
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,690
This is a life-and-death matter.

66
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,680
I can't be careless with it.

67
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,500
My age is already half of hundred.

68
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,830
I’m afraid of dying, too.

69
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,920
Godfather! Godfather!

70
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,190
This—

71
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,430
Who is it?

72
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,810
Mister, are you awake? Prime Minister has an urgent matter.

73
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,150
Mister, please go there immediately.

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,250
All right. I’ll go after I change my clothes.

75
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,500
Mister, do you think this wound is serious?

76
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,900
Prime Minister’s wound isn’t as minor as it seems.

77
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,400
It may take ten days to half a month to heal if you use normal medicine.

78
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,630
Luckily, I have an effective prescription to aid Prime Minister to have a speedy recovery.

79
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,180
He only needs to take them for five days.

80
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,830
Then, Mr. Zong please pass us your effective prescription.

81
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,650
I’m always particular with using medicines.

82
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,100
This prescription must be made by me personally.

83
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,160
If you need any herbs, you can tell us anytime.

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,630
If there is a shortage in our storage, I’ll order people to get it immediately.

85
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,490
I’ll go and prepare now.

86
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,520
Then, thank you very much, Mr. Zong.

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,900
Shouldn’t Mister Yun stay with Prime Minister?

88
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,970
Why did you come here?

89
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,130
I’m afraid that you may be too busy.

90
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,430
I’m here to help you.

91
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,690
Is the Prime Minister scared that I may harm him?

92
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,310
How can you say that, Mister?

93
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,820
My apologies for bothering you early in the morning.

94
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,950
Yun Hen just wanted to help.

95
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,840
How about me helping you to cut the herbs, Mister?

96
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,400
Do as you please.

97
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,530
Older Brother, I want to play, too.

98
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,220
Are you okay? How do you feel?

99
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,020
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s all my fault.

100
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,810
Mr. Zong.

101
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,720
Mr. Zong!

102
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,440
I saw there’s such a big scar on your hand.

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
It looks like it’s been quite long.

104
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,550
A scar I got since youth. I can’t remember, either.

105
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,000
I have some ointments here which are good for removing scars.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,380
Three times a day.

107
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,200
No more than one month, the scar will be removed.

108
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,540
Thank you for your worries.

109
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,490
I’m a person who learns martial arts.

110
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,660
Scars like this aren’t anything.

111
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,920
I heard that you'd lost your parents

112
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,200
and were adopted into Prime Minister’s Manor since youth.

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,660
I wonder if you are trying to find your lost family by this scar.

114
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,070
Godfather raised me like his own son.

115
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,180
I owe him for knowing and raising me.

116
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,360
I can’t even repay him for my whole life.

117
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,990
If you want to talk about being loyal to the Prime Minister,

118
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,110
my conscience is clear and guiltless.

119
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,250
I’ll do it.

120
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,990
This knife is sharper than what you expected.

121
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,130
Helping me grind the medicine will be nice.

122
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,980
Look. Although I've used this knife for so many years,

123
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,570
it still has no mercy.

124
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,150
It's heartless in hurting others.

125
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,430
Mister, be more careful.

126
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,650
What? The Prime Minister’s Manor caught fire?

127
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,160
Yes.

128
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,380
I should have made Older Sis Fuyao stay last night if I had known this would happen.

129
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,070
What? You saw her yesterday.

130
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,160
Why didn’t you tell us this earlier?

131
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,430
I went to find both of you early this morning.

132
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,980
But both of you were out.

133
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,540
Why did she leave after coming back?

134
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,020
Older Sister said she wants to pretend as Yuwen Zi and stays in the Prime Minister’s Manor,

135
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,290
but she didn’t tell me in detail why.

136
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,270
It’s all my fault. No. I need to go and save her.

137
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,590
Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t be so rushed.

138
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,400
That Fuyao is very safe now. She’s okay.

139
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,690
Everyone said First Miss of Yuwen's family has a super lucky fate.

140
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,800
You see, she only hurt her face in such a big fire.

141
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,850
She isn’t hurt anywhere else. Don’t worry.

142
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,250
- Really?
- Yes.

143
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,160
She scared me.

144
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,560
But I still think it’s unsafe to let Fuyao stay there alone.

145
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,780
You’re right, too.

146
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,410
Why don’t we secretly bring Fuyao out?

147
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,130
- No way.
- Why?

148
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,590
Prime Minister’s Manor is not a usual place.

149
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,860
It’s too dangerous.

150
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,370
Because we know that it’s dangerous, we need to go and save Fuyao.

151
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,850
There is no need.

152
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,820
If she’s not skillful,

153
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,070
she wouldn’t be able to hide in Prime Minister’s Manor for so long.

154
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,840
Fuyao entered Prime Minister’s Manor because of you.

155
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,700
She also took the Earth Absorbing Bell because of you.

156
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,050
Now, everything is done.

157
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,600
You got your thing and you don’t care about her?

158
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,170
This has nothing to do with you.

159
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,510
How can this have nothing to do with me?

160
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,800
Fuyao is my good friend. You’re my—

161
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,620
My-My-My-My Fifth Older Brother.

162
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,090
I just wish that both of you are okay.

163
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,380
Looking at both of your skills,

164
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,310
I’m afraid that you won’t be able to save her if you go there,

165
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,740
but will harm her instead.

166
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,790
- What do you mean? I’m—
- Stop nagging.

167
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,590
I’m repeating this once more.

168
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,420
Both of you can’t go.

169
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,690
I don’t want to bring two corpses back.

170
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,450
You’re not my... not my Fifth Older Brother.

171
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,050
My Fifth Older Brother wouldn’t be like you,

172
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,050
so cruel and heartless.

173
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,950
You don’t let me go, right?

174
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,970
I’ll go by my own. Let’s go, Xiaoqi.

175
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,780
Let’s go.

176
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,810
The grain and oil store across the street, the clothing store on the East,

177
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,590
even the men of the night-watch working at midnight,

178
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,660
are all Qi Zhen’s men.

179
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,130
Once both of you get near the Prime Minister’s Manor, their people will find out immediately.

180
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,120
You tell me. You’re so careless.

181
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,380
Are you saving or harming Fuyao now?

182
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,770
Prince Zhan, we're sorry.

183
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,220
We didn’t know things would be like this.

184
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,590
F-Fifth Older Brother.

185
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,050
Fifth Older Brother!

186
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,270
He looks really angry.

187
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,720
Do you think I was too rude just now?

188
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,920
I don’t know.

189
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,870
It’s okay, Zhuzhu. Don't think too much.

190
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,160
Maybe Prince Zhan is worrying about Ji Yu and his men now.

191
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,660
Look, they haven’t been back for so long.

192
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,140
We don't know how they are now.

193
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,830
- Right?
- Right.

194
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,320
But-But just now—

195
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,250
It’s okay. That was nothing. Be happy. Be happy.

196
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,960
He won’t think too much. Don’t worry.

197
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,070
Hawk Feather Letter?

198
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,490
Hurry.

199
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,810
He’s definitely a medical sage.

200
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,970
Just taking a dose of medicine, and there is a feeling of detoxification.

201
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,830
I admire him.

202
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,480
Godfather, you still need to take care of your health.

203
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,450
There’re so many things happening these days.

204
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,940
How can I have the heart to rest peacefully?

205
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,400
Godfather, you don’t have to be worried.

206
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,340
I have ordered them to seal off the whole city.

207
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,090
I had also asked people to search every clinic.

208
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,790
That person was pierced by my Sun Shooting Arrow.

209
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,880
He would definitely be injured badly.

210
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,500
After searching through every house,

211
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,230
never let go of anyone who is suspicious.

212
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,830
Yes.

213
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,710
Look. Although I've used this knife for so many years,

214
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,480
it still has no mercy.

215
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,990
It's heartless in hurting others.

216
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,170
Mister, be more careful.

217
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,240
What's wrong with you?

218
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,470
Nothing.

219
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,830
I’m just worrying about Godfather’s health.

220
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,160
Leave now.

221
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,170
Mr. Zong.

222
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,330
It’s so late now. Does Mr. Yun have something for me?

223
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,330
Can we have a talk in the room?

224
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,440
- General.
- Why are you here?

225
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,260
It's the Hawk Feather Letter.

226
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,890
- Does Ju Yu send some news?
- The news is from...

227
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,930
It's from the border of the Goya desert and Ice Land.

228
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,050
Although I don't know what happened to Commander Ji,

229
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,620
he used the Hawk Feather Seal.

230
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,880
It must be an emergency.

Fifth Older Brother, what are you thinking?

240
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,110
Fifth Older Brother, I’m sorry.

241
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,470
The words I spoke this morning were a little harsh.

242
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,750
Don’t take it seriously.

243
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,750
Fifth Older Brother, are you missing your home?

244
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,870
Missing your home is nothing.

245
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,240
Plus, Fifth Older Brother, you care about relationships and loyalty.

246
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,510
It’s normal to miss home.

247
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,850
Home.

248
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,380
My home is in Heaven Fiend Nation, in Rock City.

249
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,650
But, now, I can’t return to my home even if I have one.

250
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,190
Being born in a royal family, I only have the nation, not a home.

251
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,920
Who says so?

252
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,230
Imperial Concubine Jing still lives alone in the Limbo Palace of Rock City, Fifth Older Brother.

253
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,810
Is she your mother?

254
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,040
And those who live and die with you,

255
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,690
and those brothers who killed with you, are they your best buddies?

256
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,500
And also I, Ya Lanzhu, am I your—

257
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,760
We’re all your family members.

258
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,820
Where there are family members, there is home.

259
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,130
You’re right.

260
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,070
Relatives and brothers are all my family.

261
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:25,440
A man doesn’t deserve to live in this world if he can't protect his family.

262
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,590
I won’t abandon any of you.

263
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,220
I won’t give up on any of you, including you.

264
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,860
And even Fuyao.

265
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,940
I knew Fifth Older Brother cared about relationships and loyalty.

266
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,020
After we save Fuyao, I’ll follow you to Heaven Fiend.

267
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,530
I won’t let you lose your home.

268
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,070
There is a saying in Heaven Fiend that states, "A mother's heart is in her son.

269
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,290
Whereas her son's heart is in Ice Land and running with the horse."

270
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,890
Men in Heaven Fiend know how to ride a horse when they know how to walk.

271
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,130
If they can stand, they must not lie down.

272
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,660
We have Ice Land and Gobi.

273
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,630
We have Ice Land Eagle which can fly through the Five Regions

274
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,820
and Heaven Fiend Horse which can travel the Five Regions.

275
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:18,900
We have the most intoxicating alcohol and the hottest girls.

276
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,860
But all these in my heart

277
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,140
can’t beat the song which my mother sang to me.

My respect to Your Majesty.

309
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,500
What’s the matter?

310
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,020
Speak up.

311
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,180
Reporting to Your Majesty. With continuous heavy rains over Turbid River in Western Regions,

312
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,440
many tributaries have reached their emergency water level.

313
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,590
I have pushed and urged for adding reinforcements on the embankment.

314
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,940
I ask Your Majesty for the funds.

315
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,840
How much do you need?

316
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,780
Ask Prime Minister for his permission.

317
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,450
Yes.

318
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:09,250
Reporting to Your Majesty. We've signed trade agreements with other nations in Five Regions at the beginning of the year.

319
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,040
It includes 100,000 bolts of Qilin Silk,

320
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,430
300,000 bolts of Wild Silk,

321
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:20,470
and 500,000 bolts each of raw silk and satin.

322
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,990
It's almost winter now.

323
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,360
Our production doesn't even reach 60% of the order.

324
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,400
- Mister! Mister!
- Merely relying on the capability of the king's weaver alone,

325
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,990
I'm afraid it'd be too difficult to answer the fulfillment of these purchase orders.

326
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,090
I humbly request Your Majesty

327
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,360
- to dispatch professional officials to the south
- Take this a bit more seriously!

328
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,820
to acquire enough textiles from private weavers by paying higher prices

329
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,520
so we can scrape together at least enough of an amount to fulfill the purchase orders as soon as possible.

330
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,130
Your Majesty, I don’t agree with this.

331
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,270
Our Deep Water's weaving industry is prevalent.

332
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,240
Our produced goods are renowned far and wide throughout the Five Regions.

333
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,310
It is thanks to our insistence on only using the King's official weaver

334
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,960
that we have garnered and earned today's renowned excellent reputation in our textiles.

335
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,020
If we purchase sub-par textiles from private weavers just to fulfill the orders and make money,

336
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,200
although we would have fulfilled this year's purchase orders,

337
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,870
we would have thrown away our renowned excellent reputation.

338
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,520
Well, well, Master Ji seems to be a man of clear flowing stream.
(T/N: uncorrupted official)

339
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,440
If we don't produce enough textiles this year

340
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,180
and are not able to fulfill our end of the business contract,

341
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,270
it is not only money we'd be losing,

342
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,370
but even the ruin of Deep Water's reputation.

343
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,740
Who will be able to bear the responsibility for these consequences?

344
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,450
The remaining orders that we owe them can be made up for next year.

345
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,070
But if we were found out to have used products from private suppliers to fill up the capacity,

346
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,860
this will really ruin Deep Water's reputation.

347
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,460
Furthermore, since your Weaving Department can't fulfill this year's purchase orders,

348
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,360
why did you wait until now in the winter months to report it?

349
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,740
Is someone attempting to embezzle

350
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,850
Or serve some other self-interest by acquisition?

351
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,600
Your Majesty, the Weaving Department has been slacking.

352
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,590
There's not enough supervision and it reeks of corruption.

353
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,630
Your Majesty, please investigate this.

354
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,770
You-You’re slandering me!

355
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,840
The Weaving Department is closely regulated monthly by the Royal Court.

356
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,730
What corruption is there?

357
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,330
Your Majesty, I would like to ask for your judgement, please.

358
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,440
Mister! Mister! Mister!

359
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,830
Judge.

360
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,400
I judge?

361
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,810
Prime Minister, what do you think?

362
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,250
Your Majesty, this will affect the royal family’s finance and reputation.

363
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,600
I do not dare to simply judge.

364
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,110
It’s related to the royal family’s finance and reputation,

365
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,780
that’s why I’m asking for your suggestion.

366
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,390
Deep Water's exports all come from the royal Weaving Department.

367
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,260
We can't damage the royal brand.

368
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,980
Neither can we break our trade contracts signed early this year.

369
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,800
At the moment, the progress of the Weaving Department is slow.

370
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,230
It's not due to a lack of raw material but man power.

371
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,280
However,

372
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,000
if the royal court hires private workers to work in the department,

373
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,360
the production demand would surely be met with the help from the private parties.

374
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,180
The royal court will still maintain its income.

375
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:37,280
Everyone, did you hear it?

376
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,410
What the Prime Minister said is what I meant.

377
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,360
Do what Prime Minister said.

378
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,270
Yes.

379
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,500
Prime Minister, you're so wise and sharp.

380
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,680
Your Majesty also greatly values your opinion.

381
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,690
This is definitely our Deep Water's fortune.

382
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,730
His Majesty was brought out from Quan City and enthroned by the Prime Minister.

383
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,520
Of course, His Majesty values him.

384
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,380
Now that there's a new king in the court with a new look.

385
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,050
Prime Minister is looking after the majority of Deep Water.

386
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,990
These are all our duties as an official.

387
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,780
Goodbye.

388
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,900
- Please.
- Please.

389
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,490
Prime Minister. Prime Minister.

390
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,520
Butler Cao.

391
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,320
I heard that your manor caught fire a few days ago.

392
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,160
Is your family in you manor okay?

393
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,720
Thank you for your worries.

394
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,640
Not sure which stupid slave flipped a candle.

395
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,840
Luckily, the place which was burned was a side room which stored some junk. Nothing serious.

396
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,660
That’s great. That’s great.

397
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,150
Prime Minister, do you know?

398
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:58,870
The fire in your manor has made so many people worried.

399
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,860
When Marquis Zhang came to memorial to the throne before the break of dawn,

400
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,850
he purposely mentioned this incident to His Majesty.

401
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,500
A memorial to the throne?

402
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
What memorial to the throne?

403
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,430
What I saw written there,

404
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,670
something about the eight garrisons want to have an expansion.

405
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,530
Marquis Zhang wanted to ask the court for military expenditure.

406
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,440
I only had a look on it. Didn’t see it clearly.

407
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,820
Aren't all military memorials to the throne required to go through Wenchang Court for approval?

408
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,710
Why didn't I see that memorial?

409
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,240
You can’t see it already.

410
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,570
His Majesty had permitted it in front of Marquis Zhang.

411
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,190
- Permitted?
- Yes.

412
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,940
I still have some tasks to do in the palace.

413
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,110
Prime Minister, I’ll leave first.

414
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,600
Thank you, Butler Cao.

415
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,590
Hey, did you hear?

416
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,990
There were assassins in the Prime Minister's residence.

417
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,610
I heard several people went in.

418
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,630
There were many, highly skilled at martial arts.

419
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,790
They didn't steal or hurt anyone.

420
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,270
They just lit a fire.

421
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,350
Light a fire at the Prime Minister's residence and no stealing of silver.

422
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,240
Must be a revenge attack.

423
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,950
Though these assassins must be brave, there's soldiers everywhere.

424
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,970
If they were caught, it'd definitely be a death penalty.

425
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,770
Both customers, there are two many strange incidents here.

426
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,850
Just talking about the Prime Minister's new goddaughter,

427
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,380
her family used to be very poor.

428
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,600
But the Prime Minister greatly favors her. Even gave her a title of Prefecture Princess.

429
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,710
I also heard, he's going to send her into the Palace to become a Elegant Miss.

430
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,040
Isn't that strange?

431
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,150
- There was all this to it?
- Yeah.

432
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,190
Your noodles are ready!

433
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,230
- This whole situation is strange.
- That's right.

434
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,950
- Anything can happen. 
- Where did he go?

435
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,000
I think it's true.

436
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,480
The palace has a lot of rules for choosing an Elegant Miss.

437
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,850
There will be a total of thirty-six different screening processes, big and small.

438
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,460
Just follow the palace attendants' instructions.

439
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,040
You must not act rashly on your impulses.

440
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,290
Don't create troubles.

441
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,390
Others might find out you're an imposter.

442
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,820
What's happening now? Are we lining up to enter the palace?

443
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,170
Of course not, it's still too early for that.

444
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,060
We are going to Serene Lateral Court today.

445
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,740
You need to be examined before being allowed to enter the palace.

446
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,130
What will they examine?

447
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,120
They will examine... if each miss is still...

448
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,410
a virgin.

449
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,580
It's a tradition that has been passed on.

450
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,550
What tradition is that?

451
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,330
Am I-I a cattle or what?

452
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,250
I won't let them examine me. I'm leaving.

453
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,890
Don't! Don't! Stop messing around! This is the capital city!

454
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,970
If you run, how many other people will get involved?

455
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,680
What's wrong?

456
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,420
Your Majesty, please go back to the palace.

457
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,490
Why?

458
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,670
Why?

459
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,050
Today is the day for Serene Lateral Court to exam the girls.

460
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,440
It will be lively inside and outside of palace.

461
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,950
I only wanted to have a look at my future queen.

462
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,240
What's wrong with that?

463
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,720
Serene Lateral Court is an important place in Deep Water.

464
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,090
Without the consent from the harem, no one is allowed to enter.

465
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:51,150
If Your Majesty goes there now and sees the future queen before the wedding, that will infringe on the rules.

466
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:55,400
This harem is my harem.

467
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,570
Whatever I do, do I still need the permission from the harem?

468
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:05,620
About the rules, the rules are Deep Water's rules

469
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,950
and this Deep Water is mine.

470
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,740
Say, are the rules greater or I am greater?

471
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,410
I wouldn't dare.

472
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,560
What other reasons do you have for stopping me from going to Serene Lateral Court?

473
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,760
Come.

474
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,470
Tell me about it.

475
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,060
Your Majesty, today is the screening day at Serene Lateral Court.

476
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,720
There are many people coming and going there. Accidents will be difficult to avert.

477
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,650
Your Majesty, your life is precious.

478
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,250
You should stay away from the crowd.

479
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,920
That way, we officials will be able to be at ease.

480
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,390
What you mean is... someone who isn't afraid of dying wants to hurt me?

481
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,100
Don't I have you guys?

482
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:08,340
Or did you want to say, the imperial guards that the palace is feeding are nothing more but decorations?

483
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,160
Naturally not.

484
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,660
Lift up your head.

485
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,540
What are you hiding from me?

486
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,380
Tell me the truth.

487
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,890
You won't be charged of any crime.

488
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:32,600
Your Majesty, just now... just now, outside the palace doors,

489
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,370
someone has abducted an Elegant Miss waiting to be examined in broad daylight.

490
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,040
- Who?
- I am unsure.

491
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,400
I only know that she is from the Prime Minister's Manor.

492
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,280
Prime Minister's Manor?

493
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,030
Zhan Beiye, are you crazy?

494
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,390
Aren't you afraid of being caught for abducting me at the city gate?

495
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,260
Those trash can't do anything to me.

496
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,000
You didn't need to do that.

497
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,500
I did it to save you.

498
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,100
- Did I tell you to save me?
- I...

499
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,900
If Xiaoqi wasn't in danger at the hunting ground that day, I should have taken you away with me.

500
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,000
I originally thought that Deep Water King would help you and definitely escort you to safety.

501
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,050
I didn't think he actually asked Qi Zhen to bring you to the palace!

502
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:41,730
If there's something I don't want to do, I won't do it even if someone holds a knife to my neck.

503
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,780
I have my own reasons for entering the palace.

504
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,540
But I've got your sentiment. Thanks.

505
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,680
Are you really going to enter the palace?

506
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,360
It's a bit complicated.

507
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,680
I can't explain it fully in such a short period of time.

508
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,540
But don't worry.

509
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,130
I'm fine.

510
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,360
Since you are determined, I won't stop you then.

511
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,160
But remember this. When you are in the palace, you must be extremely careful.

512
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,570
You, too. Let's go.

513
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,570
Wait.

514
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:27,860
I... still have a favor to ask from you.

515
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,370
Do you feel unusual or ill by coming in contact with the Earth Absorbing Bell?

516
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:46,030
Although you've always said that this Earth Absorbing Bell is an item that emits intense coldness,

517
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,460
this doesn't leave any impression on me.

518
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,360
When ordinary people come into contact with the Earth Absorbing Bell, they will become like Xiaoqi.

519
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,560
The extreme coldness enters their body and deteriorates the bones.

520
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,360
Their lives will be in danger over time.

521
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:09,940
But you seem to be in harmony with it naturally.

522
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,740
It's as though you're one from our Zhan clan bloodline.

523
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,890
So what?

524
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:22,390
What you mean is... you're going to give this treasure of yours to me?

525
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,760
I was only joking.

526
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,400
I'm returning this to you.

527
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,620
I wasn't.

528
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,910
I really can't.

529
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,590
You were locked in Deep Water for this bell before,

530
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,830
even angered Qi Zhen and almost got killed.

531
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,730
It's such an important item.

532
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,360
I can't take it.

533
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,030
I have something really important to do.

534
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,320
I will leave the Deep Water Nation in the next few days.

535
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,250
The Earth Absorbing Bell has brought on too many weaponized fights recently.

536
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:11,530
If I bring it back to Heaven Fiend, it will bring on another bloodshed.

537
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:17,060
So, I think the best decision is to leave the Earth Absorbing Bell here.

538
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,900
So, you're going to leave this for Yuwen Zi.

539
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,640
When will you be able to return once you leave this time?

540
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,300
Maybe ten days, maybe over a month, maybe never.

541
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,460
Do you really trust me that much? Aren't you afraid that if–

542
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,200
I have never been wrong in judging anyone.

543
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,090
Fuyao, I trust you.

544
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,130
I believe that you will remain tenacious and steadfast.

545
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:01,730
My home country is the safest if the Earth Absorbing Bell is left with you.

546
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,760
If that's the case, I'll take the Earth Absorbing Bell.

547
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,840
I'll accept the Earth Absorbing Bell and also remember your sentiment.

548
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,520
But you're not allowed to not return.

549
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,270
You must return and buy me wine.

550
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:29,210
Sure. We must definitely have that wine.

551
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,770
I am guilty.

552
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,260
Capital Kun has always flourished and been safe.

553
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,110
A terrible crime like this has happened outside the palace.

554
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,480
Not only has it startled the people, it has also affected the administration of the internal palace.

555
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,730
I ask for punishment.

556
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,110
An Elegant Miss was abducted, an oversight of supervision from the palace.

557
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,210
Altogether, that's a crime worthy of death.

558
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,130
Prime Minister, you've acted carelessly.

559
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,070
Your Majesty, please give your advice.

560
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,150
I heard that the abducted Elegant Miss is from the Prime Minister's Manor.

561
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,950
She's even your newly named goddaughter.

562
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,600
Prime Minister, you have a soft heart.

563
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,320
When she was sent and had arrived at the palace gates,

564
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,320
did you suddenly feel regretful and come up with this idea?

565
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,950
Of course not.

566
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,360
Not mentioning a goddaughter,

567
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,610
people in the whole Deep Water are Your Majesty’s people.

568
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,180
I did indeed oversight the supervision,

569
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,670
but I don't intend to shield myself.

570
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,300
Your Majesty, please give me a few days.

571
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,680
I'll surely catch the culprit to calm your fury.
