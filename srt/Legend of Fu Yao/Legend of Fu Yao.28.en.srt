♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,960
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

~ Episode 28 ~

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,440
The grand wedding day.

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,540
Please explain.

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,800
Based on Deep Water's rules,

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,640
after Xuanyuan Min decides who the queen will be,

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,500
there will be a grand wedding ceremony.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:55,660
60% of my garrison and Zhang Henian's Garrison Eight must be given to form the Deep Water King's own royal army.

28
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,610
That's a total of 150,000 soldiers.

29
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,980
We can't neglect it.

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,990
The date is at will.

31
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,750
You can pick any day you like.

32
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,010
It's just that you're already a person planning to rebel.

33
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,860
Do you still worry about that puppet Deep Water King coming to take your power away?

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,960
First Royal Son, on the day of the grand wedding, all the officials will be in the palace.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,950
I'm thinking for those who support me. I will keep them all.

36
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,080
For those who oppose me, I'll get rid of them all.

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,420
Eliminate all the future troubles.

38
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,760
Isn't that better?

39
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,190
You sure are sinister and ruthless.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,070
I like it.

41
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,640
Then it's confirmed.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,890
After three days, on the 19th of this month,

43
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,970
on the day of the grand wedding when the new Deep Water King marries his queen,

44
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,560
I, Zhangsun Pinrong, will definitely come congratulate him.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,470
Then it's settled, First Royal Son.

46
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,410
I eagerly await.

[Moon Embrace Spa]

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,960
These petals that we are using today were freshly picked this morning.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,620
With this treatment,

50
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,820
His Majesty will surely be enchanted by Our Ladyship in tomorrow's Queen Coronation.

51
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,530
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,620
Even without these petals,

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,080
there has always been only our Ladyship in His Majesty's eyes.

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,120
Get out, you both.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,880
My Ladyship.

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,150
Get lost!

57
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,830
Leave!

58
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,770
Father,

59
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,490
your daughter is unfilial.

60
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,560
But the future glory of the Tang family

61
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,840
can only be on me.

62
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,590
I will surely be a good queen.

63
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,080
I want to put those who have bullied me,

64
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,440
betrayed our Tang's family...

65
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,980
Once I'm in power,

66
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,640
I will surely—

67
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,020
Your Majesty, the inner court has delivered the robes and items for tomorrow.

68
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,930
There are nine items in total.

69
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,230
Mister, although the position of Deep Water Queen isn't that important,

70
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,720
is it really appropriate to give it to such an unscrupulous woman?

71
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,290
It's not up to you or me to say whether it's appropriate.

72
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,820
How does one consider all the things arranged on earth?

73
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,760
What it should and what it should not be?

74
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,520
If Tang Zhirong is willing to betray everything for it,

75
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,810
then I'll just give the position of Queen to her.

76
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,070
Whether she deserves it or not,

77
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,140
it will all depend on her fate.

78
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
What is happening?

79
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,830
Why am I here?

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,700
Lady Fair.

81

Greetings, Lady Fair.

82
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,800
His Majesty gave a decree to summon you in.

83
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,040
His Majesty?

84

Isn't he—

85
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,170
Godfather.

86
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,690
Child. Quickly rise. Quickly rise.

87
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,420
Quickly rise.

88
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,690
You've been startled, haven't you?

89
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,180
Godfather, if you have anything, you could have just asked me to come.

90
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,370
Why did you need to do this?

91
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,510
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

92
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,560
Oh, that's right. You were looking at this before.

93
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,900
Do you know what it is? Yes?

94
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,130
Take a look.

95
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,630
Sparkling and golden.

96
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,540
This is the Nine Phoenix Coronet.

97
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,850
This is the ceremonial crown of the Deep Water Queen.

98
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,800
Deep-Deep Water Queen's ceremonial crown?

99
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,480
Shouldn't it be with Tang Zhirong?

100
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,440
Who did it?

101
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,610
We're looking into it.

102
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,960
Keep an eye on it.

103
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,880
Find a good spot to bury her.

104
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,600
I understand.

105
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,450
Who else is missing?

106
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,400
Tell me.

107
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,740
Miss Fuyao.

108
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,610
Mister, there is also the possibility that Miss Fuyao has left the palace earlier than planned.

109
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,740
It's hard to say.

110
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,730
She wouldn't have gone so quickly.

111
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,110
Neither would it be this coincidentally.

112
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,700
Qi Zhen must have set his plan in motion.

113
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,940
What does Qi Zhen want with Miss Fuyao?

114
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,840
I want you to be the Queen of Deep Water.

115
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,470
Godfather.

116
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,550
The Nine Phoenix Coronet, Scarlet Cloud Gown,

117
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,830
Golden Threaded Green Shoes, and Six Colored Big Ribbons are prepared for the Deep Water Queen.

118
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:14,500
In my heart, the Queen of Deep Water can only be you, my goddaughter.

119
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,540
Godfather, do you want me to pretend to be Tang Zhirong?

120
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,130
No. No. No.

121
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,120
You've misunderstood.

122
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,480
I'll let you be next to Xuanyuan Min as an official Deep Water Queen.

123
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,330
Listen, tomorrow's grand wedding will be held as planned.

124
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:40,670
Before the grand wedding ceremony begins, the inner court will send a new decree to pick a new candidate for the Queen.

125
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:46,360
That person can only be you.

126
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,410
But... it's not a marriage personally decreed by His Majesty after all.

127
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,140
Do you really think I'll let you two actually get married?

128
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,360
No. No. You're a dagger.

129
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,750
A dagger I've placed by Xuanyuan Min's side.

130
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,000
For the grand wedding tomorrow, according to Deep Water's rituals,

131
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
half the nation's troops will be reorganized

132
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
to be imperial guards commanded by the king.

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,600
And the marshal's seal that commands the imperial guards

134
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,800
will be personally handed over by the Queen as part of the wedding ceremony.

135
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,800
The marshal's seal has never been given to a woman from the harem before.

136
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,600
I fear the people will revolt if they knew the harem meddles with state affairs.

137
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,770
Of course, the imperial guards are assigned by the King.

138
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,800
It's only a handover ceremony.

139
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,700
But if someone has an errant intention,

140
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,000
the time during the grand wedding tomorrow is the best slot to steal the marshal's seal.

141
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,300
I understand.

142
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,400
Godfather wants me to steal the marshal's seal for you?

143
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,800
Yes. As long as I have the marshal's seal,

144
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,200
all 150,000 of the Imperial guards will be under my commands.

145
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,400
Then no matter how incredible Xuanyuan Min is, he won't stand a chance.

146
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,000
Godfather, you're giving me such an important mission. I'm afraid—

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,900
You're only allowed to succeed!

148
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,200
Failure is not an option!

149
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Child, don't forget.

150
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,300
All the lives in your Yuwen family are in your hands.

151
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,000
I will definitely not hesitate to lay down my life if need be.

152
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,300
Good daughter.

153
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,400
You will be the closest to Xuanyuan Min at the grand wedding tomorrow.

154
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,600
Your position has the least attention from all defenses.

155
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,000
Remember, you must watch me.

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,700
Upon receiving my signal,

157
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,800
help me kill him with no hesitation.

158
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
Kill him.

159
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
Assassinate the King and seize the throne.

160
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,700
Yes. Assassinate the King and seize the throne.

161
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,500
I've been waiting too long for this day.

162
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Your Majesty.

163
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
What is it?

164
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,400
The news of Lady Precious' tragic death has spread.

165
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,800
With such good servants,

166
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,200
how can the palace keep any secrets?

167
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,900
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

168
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm utterly devoted to you.

169
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,420
Cut the cackle!

170
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,970
I know where your loyalty lies.

171
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,030
What's the matter?

172
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Your Majesty,

173
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,700
the officials say although Lady Precious is dead accidentally,

174
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,800
the grand wedding ceremony tomorrow is related to the fate of the nation.

175
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
It's not suitable to change the date.

176
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,100
How about asking the King to choose another candidate to be the Queen?

177
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,200
What suggestions do those geezers have now?

178
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,500
Please have a look, Your Majesty.

179
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,200
[...Lady Fair, Yuwen Zi, will be a good candidate...]

180
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,400
Yuwen Zi?

181
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,400
The ugly girl locked in the Limbo Palace?

182
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,300
Based on what she is, and she deserves to be the Queen of Deep Water?

183
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,600
Your Majesty, the officials say—

184
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,700
Officials say! Officials say!

185
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,400
This is clearly Prime Minister Qi Zhen's own idea.

186
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,700
He's never been happy I chose Rong'er to be Queen.

187
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,000
He definitely has something to do with Rong'er's death!

188
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Your Majesty, you don't have evidence.

189
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,830
I don't have evidence?

190
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,000
My Queen was murdered.

191
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Now my words as King are unsubstantiated?

192
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,930
Fine.

193
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,000
Go back and tell them.

194
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,400
For the Queen position, they can pick whoever they like. I don't care anymore.

195
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,200
Get lost! All of you!

196
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,000
Your Majesty, what about the candidate for Queen?

197
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,200
Do you want me to repeat myself?

198
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

199
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,100
I'll leave now.

200
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,620
Your Majesty, don't get bent out of shape.

201
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,000
I can breathe easier knowing that girl is fine.

202
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,710
Are you worried about her, too?

203
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
That's right.

204
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,170
I originally had her leave.

205
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,800
Who knows the fate that makes fools of the people.

206
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,530
If the heavens destined her to be my Queen,

207
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,700
then let it be so.

208
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,510
You're scared of Qi Zhen, that sly fox?

209
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
It's fine.

210
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,900
He'd never suspect I'd have the courage to make things difficult for him on the date of the grand wedding.

211
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,800
He just thinks he's got ambushers everywhere.

212
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,500
But he forgets that there is one trick called catching a trapped prey.

213
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,610
You say, you fear that he'll resist till the end?

214
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,600
That's true.

215
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,200
He's bribed and colluded with everyone.

216
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,500
It took some effort.

217
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,400
Now when all his supporters come together,

218
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
it'll be almost 400,000 army forces.

219
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,600
If you're scared, go back first.

220
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,560
Your Majesty, the Prime Minister seeks an audience.

221
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Shi Lan, what are you doing here?

222
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,980
My Ladyship, the Prime Minister fears that the servants from his manor don't serve you well,

223
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,800
so he allowed me to serve you.

224
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,840
- Shi Lan, get me a cup of tea.
- Yes.

225
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,190
Hurry and pass a message for me.

226
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,200
Tell Xuanyuan Min that Qi Zhen wants to kill him.

227
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,780
Tell him to escape, now.

228
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,300
Escape?

229
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,800
My Ladyship, how is he supposed to escape?

230
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,500
It's heavily-guarded outside right now.

231
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,800
It's incredibly dangerous.

232
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,800
If I run out now, not only will I be dead, but you also will be dragged in.

233
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,000
It isn't worth it.

234
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,200
This is something I painstainkingly made for over three months.

235
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,800
Prepared especially for your grand wedding.

236
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
This is the land of Deep Water Nation.

237
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,900
This is with a dragon and phoenix of Deep Water.

238
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,000
Please accept my amateur skills as a token.

239
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,200
There's no water in the tea pot. I'll go get some water for Miss.

240
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,100
The water will be here soon.

241
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,650
Here.

242
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,200
Thanks.

243
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Guys, I'm really hungry.

244
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,200
- May I—
- Your meal has been prepared.

245
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
My Ladyship.

246
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,000
Guys, I feel really bad.

247
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,700
Can I please use the bathroom?

248
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,700
No. Bring it here.

249
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,200
The Prime Minister has everything organized,

250
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,700
but it's hard for me to do it with you guys here.

251
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,800
Then please hurry, My Ladyship.

252
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,870
What should I do? I don't care now.

253
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,900
I'll just do this last attempt to save this hopeless situation.

254
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,900
Yuan Bao!

255
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,030
Yuan Bao!

256
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,560
Yuan Bao!

257
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,690
Yuan Bao!

258
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,100
I really don't know how to thank you for your thoughtful gift.

259
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,660
After tomorrow, you'll be my father-in-law.

260
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,610
It's the fortune of Deep Water that we'll be doubly related.

261
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,450
You're emphatic, Your Majesty.

262
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,250
I ordered a plaque especially for you.

263
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,930
You've worried about Deep Water all these years. You've worked hard.

264
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,010
[Sacrifice Oneself for the Nation]

265
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,960
Sacrifice oneself?

266
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,990
For the nation?

267
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,620
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

268
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,380
Please rise, Prime Minister.

269
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,970
Yuan Bao truly understands me.

270
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,490
For the Queen Coronation tomorrow, it's so excited that it almost forgets to behave itself.

271
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,340
Bad hamster, you're stupid.

272
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,550
Who told you to be lazy at this time.

273
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,260
Your owner is going to have bad luck.

274
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,740
Godfather.

275
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,090
- Is everything prepared?
- Yes.

276
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,680
Where is my Yun'er?

277
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,070
Did you forget?

278
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,850
You already organized for Miss and Madam to leave Capital Kun.

279
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,350
They should arrive in Sweet District within 2 or 3 days.

280
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,920
Reporting!

281
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,290
Prime Minister, the person whom we were looking for earlier is ready.

282
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,600
- Watch him closely.
- Yes.

283
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,500
You may leave.

284
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,220
I just had my fortune told.

285
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,930
Everything is fine even if you take dangerous moves.

286
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,120
Everything is perfect in the army.

287
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,850
If you're a commander in the army, you'll have a very auspicious outlook.

288
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:37,480
It seems even Heaven is looking after me.

289
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,790
Remember, bring this person tomorrow.

290
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,420
I want to let that Xuanyuan Min have a look. See what he says.

291
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,190
Yes, Godfather. Heaven helps good people.

292
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,690
Of course, Heaven will look after you.

293
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:57,610
But Godfather, why do you choose to revolt on the day of the grand wedding of the new king?

294
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,210
If it's just to kiil Xuanyuan Min, I wouldn't need to be so meticulous.

295
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,070
But besides him, there's also that crowd of old officials.

296
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,050
As long as they're around, my heart can't be at ease.

297
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,490
Zhang Henian.

298
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,050
Marquis Sea Hut, Chen Yi.

299
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,780
General Ethics, Zhao Shuo.

300
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,080
Capture Barbarian Department Head, Wang Deshan.

301
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,610
All these people have never been happy with me.

302
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,450
It's just the time.

303
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,340
We'll use this opportunity tomorrow.

304
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,180
Get rid of them all.

305
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:49,060
But Godfather, I had a look at the guest list for tomorrow.

306
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,590
There's thousands of people going in and out of the palace.

307
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,820
When the two armies fight, merciless swords will definitely hurt—

308
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,570
I've been waiting for this moment for so many years.

309
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:11,940
Kill anybody who puts up resistance tomorrow.

310
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,650
If our own people stand in my way,

311
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,130
they also have to be killed. Okay?

312
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,500
Godfather, rest easy.

313
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,590
This is the last time.

314
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,980
Good dagger.

315
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,610
Take Miss Yuwen to be the Queen.

316
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:17,110
Order the officials to have a festival for her coronation ceremony.

317
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,000
Why have we stopped again?

318
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,790
Answering My Ladyship, this is the rules.

319
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,380
When the Queen enters into the palace for her coronation,

320
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,260
I have to kneel down every ten steps to thank the blessing from the gods of seven nations.

321
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,200
It also thanks God of Mercury for giving Deep Water

322
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,060
a pretty, elegant, agile, always intelligent, pure, virtuous,

323
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,030
- respectful, capable and moral Queen.
- Enough. Enough. Enough.

324
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,570
How many more rituals are there for us to worship?

325
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,510
Reporting to My Ladyship. The wedding ceremony today has three sections: the Coronation, the Receiving, and the Nuptials.

326
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,870
We've only just started the Coronation.

327
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,140
Once we've arrived at the Queen's residence, Forever Excellent Palace Hall, we'll have to read the edict.

328
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,820
Then we'll guide the new Queen to worship the throne.

329
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,410
- Then read coronation scripture and accept coronation gifts.
- Just go.

330
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,690
Prefect helps the Prime Minster to achieve his great goal.

331
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,160
This is the top merit for opening a new era.

332
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,570
I'll return to report to the Prime Minister now that

333
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,920
the Prefect's army is heading to the city immediately.

334
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:05,400
Stinky hamster. It's my wedding day yet you're the one all dressed up.

335
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,530
I called you for ages yesterday and you didn't come.

336
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,490
You're actually smart today.

337
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,330
You know it's me in this palanquin.

338
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,910
But, of course, there's nothing your owner doesn't know.

339
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,250
If that's the case, then that is good.

340
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,440
I've worried for nothing yesterday.

341
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,010
Do you have something for me?

342
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,200
The day of the Grand Wedding will be the time of great chaos.

343
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,700
Quickly finish the wedding rites.

344
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,370
Once I call you "bitch," you'll leave with Yuan Bao.

345
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,200
The faster, the better.

346
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,510
Was this written by your master?

347
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,710
Okay. I got it.

348
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,700
Quickly hide.

349
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,400
When will we arrive?

350
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,800
My Ladyship, you must not rush.

351
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,730
You are the queen of Deep Water.

352
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,600
You mustn't fret.

353
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
How many more rituals must we still worship?

354
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,600
Look, for kneeling and bowing throughout this journey,

355
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,700
we still must spend a few more hours.

356
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,400
I can't wait anymore.

357
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,000
My Ladyship, you mustn't! You mustn't!

358
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,600
Spread my decree. Skip all unnecessary and elaborate etiquette today!

359
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,480
Rush towards the main palace hall with full speed.

360
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,000
Whoever dares to delay me, I'll punish him!

361
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,800
Run!

362
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,300
My Ladyship!

363
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,400
My Ladyship, this is against the rituals! My Ladyship!

364
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,800
Quickly chase her! Quickly chase her!

365
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
Quickly prepare. Queen is here.

366
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Queen is here?

367
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,000
Greetings, Queen.

368
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,700
Don't bother with it. Don't bother with it.

369
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,000
Quickly read your customary scripture.

370
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,570
Use just once incense time.

371
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,800
If you're unable to finish reading it, I'll punish you.

372
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Now there is Miss Yuwen from Changning, the goddaughter of Prime Minister Qi Zhen,

373
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,800
an aristocratic family of the Zhongxiang County, a famous family with many talents,

374
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,400
innately gentle and composed, refined and follows etiquette,

375
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,000
respectful and with wonderful demeanor, amicable and with high morals,

376
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,100
tender and kindness is her nature, endowed with virtuous disposition.

377
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,700
One incense time is about to end!

378
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,400
Miss Yuwen from Changning is being bestowed as the lord of the six palaces.

379
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
That's all!

380
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,600
Accept the decree!

381
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,100
What's going on?

382
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,700
What's going on here?

383
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,500
So preposterous... This is so absurd!

384
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,500
It's not yet the auspicious time.

385
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,200
Why were we all asked to come to the main palace hall already?

386
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,800
Based on usual rituals, they should first make an offering to the heavens in Sacred Royal Gates

387
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,200
and then go to Public Reception Palace Hall to receive the congratulations of different nations' envoys.

388
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,800
- That's right.
- Lastly, they will come to this main palace hall to have the Coronation.

389
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,200
How come they just directly went to the third step?

390
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,000
It's messed up. It's messed up. This is all messed up.

391
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
His Majesty is here!

392
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,100
Greetings, Your Majesty!

393
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,000
Let's start.

394
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,800
But Your Majesty... Queen is—

395
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,000
When I say start, you start.

396
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
How about you do this wedding ceremony then?

397
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,500
Yes.

398
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,600
The Coronation will now start! Start the music!

399
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Stop!

400
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,820
The auspicious time hasn't arrived yet.

401
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,900
Why start the music?

402
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,600
Are you trying to change the ancestral rules, too?

403
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,800
Prime Minister, I gave the decree.

404
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,520
Your Majesty, aren't you being too impatient?

405
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,800
Today is the Coronation.

406
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,810
Queen hasn't arrived.

407
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,700
Who are you conferring a title to?

408
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,800
Queen will be here soon.

409
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,200
Queen's carriage is proceeding in a poised manner and has to make several offertory bows along the way.

410
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,000
I fear that she'll need an hour more to reach this place.

411
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,500
The Queen is here!

412
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,800
This... How come the Queen came out on her own?

413
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,100
For several hundreds of years, Deep Water has never seen such an absurd matter.

414
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,400
Your Majesty, I was late.

415
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,100
Have I missed the auspicious time?

416
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,640
Whatever time Queen comes is the auspicious time.

417
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,800
Sprinkle the sacred water!

418
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,000
- Godfather.
- What time is it?

419
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,500
It's still 2 hours before 11:45 a.m., the time of the revolt.

420
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,800
They more or less should have arrived.

421
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,560
But since this wedding proceeded ahead of time,

422
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,200
I fear that the reinforcement army from Heaven Fiend hasn't arrived yet.

423
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
This—

424
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,700
Delay it.

425
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,000
Delay everyone here to stay until 11:45 a.m.

426
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,600
Immediately call that person over.

427
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,000
Yes.

428
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,300
Bow!

429
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,500
Your Majesty!

430
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,600
Prime Minister, what is it now?

431
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,100
I fear that we cannot proceed with the wedding yet.

432
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,000
Prime Minister, how bold of you to say that?

433
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,600
His Majesty is the ruler of Deep Water Nation.

434
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:23,000
Other than the previous emperor, who dares to stop his wedding?

435
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,600
Could it be that Prime Minister is claiming to have been possessed by the previous emperor?

436
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,300
General Ethics is right.

437
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,870
The king has power bestowed by the gods.

438
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,600
How can an ordinary folk assume to be superior than him?

439
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,870
What if...

440
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,010
the person up there isn't of Xuanyuan blood?

441
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,560
What's going on?

442
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,020
- How is it possible?
- He just made irresponsible remarks as he wishes.

443
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,000
Those words are punishable by beheading!

444
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,700
I'm loyal to the Xuanyuan royal clan.

445
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,300
Heaven and Earth can prove it!

446
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,370
Since I started to work for the government,

447
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,000
I've always put Deep Water's interest as priority in everything I did.

448
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,300
But today...

449
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,600
if I clearly know that person up there is fake

450
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,600
and I will still offer him the customary bows of respect;

451
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,200
hence, trampling this official court uniform of Deep Water,

452
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,900
that is what is punishable by beheading!

453
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,000

♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

482
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,000
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

483
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

484
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,200
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

485
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,800
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

486
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,400
♫ Have someone's company♫
