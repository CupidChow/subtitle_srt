♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,300
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:23,500
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

♫ True love won't run short ♫

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

~ Episode 43 ~

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,660
Where have you been exactly these past days?

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,200
They...

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
It's fine now...

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,900
They all said that you were dead.

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,800
I even saw your corpse.

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
All these were beyond my expectations.

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
In Geya Desert, I encountered an ambush from Zhangsun Pingrong's men.

29
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,800
He was sure that I wouldn't be able to walk out of that death place.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,600
I also never thought that I wouldn't be able to handle it.

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,300
Luckily, it was Yuan Bao who saved me.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,600
Afterwards, Yuan Bao brought me a Herding Spirit Fruit that saved my life.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,610
Little rascal, it was you who told Yuan Bao to find me. Am I right?

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
Enough. Stop crying.

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
Seeing you come back is so great.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
I...

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,500
I saw those before.

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,300
I saw those people taking you away.

39
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,710
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you again.

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Never leave me, okay?

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,890
Enough.

42
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,400
I promise you.

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Don't ever leave me again, okay?

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,300
I promise you, okay?

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,100
Stop crying. Enough.

46
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,800
Stop crying.

47
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,900
Oh, right.

48
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,100
Where is Zhan Beiye?

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,060
Fifth Older Brother.

50
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,900
Fifth Older Brother?

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,500
How is my Fifth Older Brother?

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
How is he?

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
- Why do you all come here?
- Fuyao.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,700
Aren't you... Aren't you two in Yao City?

55
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,260
Xiaoqi told us that you'd arrived in Rock City.

56
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,400
He said General Zhan has been unconscious.

57
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,000
We immediately rushed here.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,300
How is Zhan Beiye?

59
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,300
That's right. How is my Fifth Older Brother doing?

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,100
He won't die.

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,000
What do you mean?

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,710
The thing that hurt him isn't an ordinary power.

63
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,800
He is gravely injured to his core. I've already tried my best.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Unless you find the Earth Absorbing Bell of the Zhan family.

65
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You didn't treat him properly at all!

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,200
You always talk in half and deliberately pretend to be very wise.

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
You think that everyone gives a damn?

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,290
- Zhuzhu.
- You must feel that Fifth Older Brother isn't close to you

69
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,000
so you're unwilling to treat him at all!

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,600
What Medical Sage? You'e completely just a hoax!

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
Zhuzhu...

72
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,010
I take my leave.

73
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,900
Fifth Older Brother, it will be all right. Okay?

74
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm here. Okay?

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,770
I'm here...

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,400
I'm here.

77
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,620
Why are you locking yourself up?

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,400
An evil doctor who refuses to save people should be reflecting.

79
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
How are you refusing to save people?

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,200
If not because you distracted the soldiers and found us a place to settle in,

81
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,900
everyone wouldn't even know where we are at now.

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,330
You're acting very weird.

83
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,200
What is it?

84
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,100
I'm fine.

85
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,300
Don't move!

86
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,300
You...

87
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,190
Don't worry.

88
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,000
I won't still be dying.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,500
It's just that I fear my medical skills are waning.

90
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,900
I told you before that

91
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,600
my medical skills are half-techniques, half-internal energy.

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Now, it's been harder to control my internal energy.

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,400
I fear that very soon, I'll really be like Fuyao said;

94
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,900
become a jianghu doctor.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,100
Your half-internal energy came from Fei Yan.

96
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,750
After the major political change in Deep Water, the bloodline of Heir Apparent Wenyi returned to the throne.

97
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,180
Hence, she's asking them back. Is that it?

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,000
But... the person who should die hasn't died yet.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,660
My great revenge hasn't been sought yet.

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,300
If I lose these medical skills,

101
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,500
what's the difference between me and a useless person?

102
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,200
Since it's a deal, then you must pay the price.

103
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,610
I'll accompany you in facing it.

[Chill Palace Hall]

105
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,430
Our Heaven Fiend is a bitter cold place.

106
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,500
Sorry for making Your Highness Prince Assist suffer.

107
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,800
I've long heard that in Heaven Fiend, it is mysteriously and mystically chilly.

108
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,000
They also say that on this ice land, the greatest weapon is this bitter cold air.

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Coming here, it indeed opened my eyes.

110
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,800
The travel from Megrez to Rock City is very far and extremely dangerous.

111
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,400
Hence, I traveled lightly,

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,400
and my gifts of gold and weapons are still on their way here.

113
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,500
Okay. That's good, too.

114
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,400
But since I traveled far to visit you, it's improper to come empty-handed.

115
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,800
I've prepared a little thing for you.

116
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,020
A little token.

117
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,800
It isn't enough to show my respect.

118
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,970
There are a lot of people outside.

119
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,000
Your Highness Prince Assist, let's talk inside.

120
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,200
Where did Your Highness get this?

121
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,400
I've long heard that the Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend

122
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,600
had stolen the Earth Absorbing Bell from your palace and then escaped to Deep Water.

123
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
My immediate thoughts were that this is the precious treasure of Heaven Fiend.

124
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
It mustn't fall into the hands of evil people.

125
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,770
I then sent men to search for it.

126
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,200
It wasn't easy.

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,300
There were numerous elite guards that left and never returned.

128
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,050
But Heaven doesn't fail a persistent person.

129
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,800
I finally found it in Mt. Great Vast

130
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,400
and I immediately delivered it to you.

131
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,700
Your Highness Prince Assist, there's something that you don't know.

132
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,200
Since Fifth Younger Brother took the Earth Absorbing Bell and left Heaven Fiend,

133
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know how the citizens heard about it and rumors started spreading,

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
saying that the Earth Absorbing Bell has the mystical power to choose its master.

135
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,600
Once it has chosen the person it will serve, it will then stay by his side.

136
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,000
Royal Older Brother got a great headache about that.

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,300
Then it means that this Earth Absorbing Bell

138
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,600
is very important to the king of Heaven Fiend.

139
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,540
Of course.

140
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,100
The treasures of Heaven Fiend are all my treasures.

141
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,400
This is great.

142
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,900
The treasure is back.

143
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,700
I surely will stand out and nominate you to be the crown prince.

144
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,300
Thank you then.

145
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,700
I must organize a grand "treasure returning" ceremony.

146
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,600
I must let them all see

147
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,300
that my Earth Absorbing Bell is back.

148
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,640
Girl.

149
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,510
The weather is very cold.

150
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,330
With you hiding here alone, be careful that you'll catch a cold.

151
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,700
It's good that it's a bit cold.

152
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,910
A person stays more awake.

153
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,460
Sorry.

154
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,090
This is all my fault.

155
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,540
I like that bright and cheerful you.

156
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,820
I didn't want the difficulties of this world

157
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,190
to wipe away that brightness and cheerfulness.

158
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,470
But now, you've still changed.

159
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,050
It's my fault.

160
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,740
I wasn't able to protect you.

161
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,810
I wasn't able to block away the foul wind and blood rain of this world.

162
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,980
Do you know that

163
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,790
while in Mt. Great Vast, I also met another Zhangsun Wuji?

164
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,270
That person told me

165
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,100
that he doesn't want the Five Regions and his friends anymore.

166
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,190
He only wants to stay by my side.

167
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,090
That time, I already knew that he was fake.

168
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,610
Zhangsun Wuji is a person that believes he's infallible.

169
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,160
Hence, stop assessing others in your infallible manner.

170
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,540
I didn't change and will never change.

171
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,180
But I will change.

172
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,170
Since you appeared, I keep changing.

173
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,340
Are you?

174
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,740
Every time I'm with you, it would seem like I have the upperhand.

175
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,700
But actually, I lost every time.

176
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,950
Girl,

177
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,650
I want to give you the world.

178
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,280
I want to give you Five Regions.

179
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,090
I want you to become the happiest woman in this world.

180
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,890
If you want to fly, I'll give you the sky.

181
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,150
If you want to run, I'll give you the grasslands.

182
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,040
As long as you're willing, I will take you there.

183
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,170
How I hope that everyone around me

184
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,320
could be like me and be this fortunate.

185
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,190
Okay, already.

186
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,740
I know that you're worried about Zhan Beiye.

187
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,340
Zong Yue and I already linked up all his vital channels.

188
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,540
He temporarily won't be in danger.

189
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,220
Oh, right.

190
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,220
Look at this.

191
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,550
- This... didn't I pick this up in Mt. Great Vast?
- Yes.

192
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,820
Earth Gathering Bell.

193
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,950
After the Five Regions Sacred War, Heaven Fiend left two bells.

194
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,900
They were called "Heaven Fiend's Double Sound."

195
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,870
One is the Earth Absorbing Bell.

196
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,130
The other one is this Earth Gathering Bell.

197
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,060
For thousands of years, no one has seen that Earth Gathering Bell.

198
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,280
They all treated it to be just a legend.

199
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,550
I never thought that you'd find it in Mt. Great Vast.

200
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,970
Too bad we were able to find this but lost the other one.

201
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,560
With the Earth Absorbing Bell being lost, I don't know if we'll be able to find it again.

202
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,200
My scout already told me

203
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,070
that Zhangsun Pingrong has obtained the Earth Absorbing Bell

204
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,380
and that he already handed it to Zhan Nancheng.

205
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,070
That villain actually found it?

206
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,880
Looks like we must make a visit to the palace of Heaven Fiend.

207
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,590
Your Highness Prince Assist.

208
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,050
- Please.
- Please.

209
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,990
Please.

210
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,600
Now that Crown Prince Wuji is gone,

211
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,900
First Royal Son is the most suitable heir to the throne.

212
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,220
Don't you only lack a person that will stand out and say it?

213
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,360
I'll go then.

214
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,670
That's right. In a few days, it's Royal Older Brother's birthday.

215
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,630
All the kings of Five Regions will gather here in Rock City.

216
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,800
If at that time, my Heaven Fiend will mention the matter about choosing a new crown prince, everyone will surely support it.

217
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,370
Come, Prince Assist. Let me offer you a toast.

218
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,890
Please.

219
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,930
How come Your Highness doesn't seem to be happy?

220
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,800
Tell me then, how should I help you?

221
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,390
With Heaven Fiend standing out to support me, of course, that is great.

222
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,190
It's just that—

223
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,390
The empire is currently in mourning.

224
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,020
Why discuss about the choice for the crown prince now?

225
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,460
It's really not a suitable time.

226
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,430
Moreover, who would be the crown prince

227
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,290
is not something that can easily be decided upon.

228
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,350
Your Highness is wise.

229
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,150
To tell you honestly, I also heard things from Lord Emperor

230
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,580
regarding the appointment of the crown prince.

231
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,470
What Lord Emperor's stand is

232
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,050
it's not him who determines who the crown prince of Megrez is.

233
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,250
What the Imperial court officials suggest don't matter, either.

234
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,400
Because this crown prince must achieve the recognition of the whole Five Regions.

235
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,500
What do you mean?

236
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,850
In the past, when Crown Prince Wuji walked out of the Sky Gate Ruin,

237
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,730
he already was the destined heir.

238
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,050
Everyone in the Five Regions knows that.

239
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,020
Anyone now that seeks to replace him

240
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,400
must walk into that Sky Gate Ruin, too.

241
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,930
Are you talking about the Sky Gate Ruin?

242
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,170
Indeed.

243
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,520
Leave now!

244
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,820
It's not that I'm self-praising,

245
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,570
but our Heaven Fiend's Sky Gate Ruin is where the Heaven Eye Yellow Spring that can penetrate through both yin and yang realms is located.

246
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,720
Inside it is a frightening Heart Demon Illusion that can kill you!

247
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,000
In the past, Wuji was able to enter the Sky Gate Ruin by himself and come out unscathed.

248
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,670
Hence, the citizens of Five Regions worshiped him as the fated son of god.

249
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,180
Now, if I want to obtain the crown prince position,

250
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,900
I fear that I must go through such a trial, too.

251
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,380
Are you sure?

252
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,940
If you really go in,

253
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,170
we're not sure what things you'll encounter inside.

254
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,790
I've long heard that the king of Heaven Fiend has a collection of rare treasures of this world.

255
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,540
Since it is a mysterious and mystical place,

256
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,690
there then must be a mysterious and mystical way to go through it.

257
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,960
I earnestly ask Big Bro to help me.

258
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,070
Younger Brother Heng knows about these paintings more than I do.

259
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,630
Take them away. Take them all away.

260
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,030
Thank you, Royal Older Brother.

261
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,260
This Zhangsun Pingrong is quite sensible.

262
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,730
He didn't act as some arrogant prince.

263
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,800
His courtesy is quite thorough.

264
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,840
There's one thing that I don't understand.

265
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Crown Prince Wuji is dead.

266
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,520
Technically speaking, Prince Assist is the remaining descendant of Lord Emperor.

267
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,790
The crown prince position will be his sooner or later.

268
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,700
Why still risk one's life to go through the Sky Gate Ruin?

269
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,590
Say, isn't this Zhangsun Pingrong quite stupid?

270
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,750
Not that smart, right?

271
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,510
A mediocre talent with ordinary intelligence,

272
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,020
Lord Emperor might not be that willing to hand the Five Regions to him.

273
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
Isn't that so?

274
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,740
What Royal Older Brother means is... ?

275
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,700
Nothing really.

276
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,610
Their matter is actually not my business.

277
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,340
But I do hope that Prince Assist will succeed the throne.

278
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,780
It's better for the Megrez emperor to be a bit dumb.

279
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,130
This way, we'll be able take more advantages.

280
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,030
If he's willing to torment himself, just let him.

281
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,400
The more chaotic, the better.

282
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,720
Royal Older Brother is wise.

283
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,840
This way, even if Prince Assist loses and was unable to obtain the royal throne,

284
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,180
Heaven Fiend will still be Heaven Fiend.

285
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,100
Royal Brother is still the king of Heaven Fiend!

286
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,180
That's right.

287
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,790
Just let him borrow the Earth Absorbing Bell for now.

288
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,990
We're not at a disadvantage.

289
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,910
You've gotten better. Learned how to act on your own now?

290
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,860
I'm going to save my Fifth Older Brother.

291
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,540
I'm with you.

292
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,000
Come over here.

293
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,180
Just to borrow the Earth Absorbing Bell,

294
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,410
Your Highness gave Zhan Nancheng such a huge territory.

295
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,670
How come I think that this Heaven Fiend king is too greedy?

296
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,770
He might never get fed satisfactorily.

297
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,920
Once I safely come out of the Sky Gate Ruin

298
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,460
and ascend to the crown prince position,

299
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,840
this giving or not giving, how much should be given,

300
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,090
won't be his call anymore.

301
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,100
Zhan Nancheng collects all the unique treasures in this world and treats them as his most precious possessions.

302
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,750
In the palace of Heaven Fiend, Chant Frost Watchtower where the treasures are kept is the most guarded area.

303
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,170
I'm sure that the Earth Absorbing Bell is just inside it.

304
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,390
Zhangsun Pingrong will be borrowing the Earth Absorbing Bell tonight.

305
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,950
This is a great opportunity for us.

306
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,750
Let's divide into two teams. Fuyao, find Yalan Zhu and distract the guards.

307
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,590
Wuji will use that chance to steal the bell. Be careful.

308
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,280
I've traveled all Five Regions and also seen a lot of unique treasures for these past years.

309
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,960
Your Majesty instead claimed that adding them all up is still incomparable to your private collection.

310
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,230
Aren't those words too exaggerated?

311
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,860
Is Your Highness touring my Chant Frost Watchtower then or not?

312
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:48,130
How about this? I'll double the rice and wheat that I've promised to deliver to Heaven Fiend.

313
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,700
That would be great.

314
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,390
Your Highness, this way please.

315
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,810
Please.

316
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,590
Let's go.

317
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,820
Let's go.

318
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,610
Zhan Nancheng has set up different trap mechanisms.

319
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,110
It might be very dangerous tonight.

320
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,290
Follow me and don't be walking around.

321
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,170
What does Your Highness think?

322
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,550
Inside Chant Frost Watchtower, you'll see the whole world.

323
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,220
The chilly palace in the northern border caps the whole Five Regions.

324
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,740
From the looks of it, what this poem talked about isn't even half of what I'm seeing now.

325
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,160
Those words are so pleasing to hear.

326
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,840
The Earth Absorbing Bell you want to borrow is right here.

327
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,370
Wait a minute.

328
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,330
Your Majesty has indeed placed thorough thoughts into this.

329
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,590
Please.

330
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,850
Older Sister, the defense here is weak.

331
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,990
Let's enter through here.

332
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,950
There's an assassin! Hurry!

333
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,470
We've been found. Quickly leave.

334
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,610
This-This is... ?

335
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,740
There is another suicidal thing that trespassed my place.

336
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,410
Quickly leave!

337
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,970
There! Hurry! Stop!

338
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,590
Stop right there!

339
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,990
Don't run!

340
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,730
With just your measly tricks, you dared to trespass into Chant Frost Watchtower?

341
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,620
It was you who sneakily attacked my Fifth Older Brother!

342
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,140
Zhuzhu!

343
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,720
Zhuzhu!

344
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,630
- General!
- General!

345
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,310
- After them!
- After them!

346
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,250
Over there!

347
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,140
We can't go back. We mustn't let them find out where Fifth Older Brother is.

348
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,160
This way.

349
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,170
Never thought that even if this Zhan Nancheng looked like a useless person,

350
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,730
this Chant Frost Watchtower is so hard to infiltrate.

351
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,550
That's right. I have belittled him.

352
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,520
Hope they can all safely return.

353
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,870
Here.

354
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,250
You two?

355
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,970
Hence, you accompanying me to Chant Frost Watchtower today was just a decoy?

356
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,350
With just us two,

357
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,790
we might not be able to see the shadow of this Earth Absorbing Bell at all.

358
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,260
Let's go.

359
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,010
Fifth Older Brother, quickly look.

360
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,140
I-I... have grabbed the Earth Absorbing Bell back for you.

361
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,180
Quickly wake up.

362
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,200
- You must be careful. Don't get harmed by the cold spirit of this Earth Absorbing Bell.
- Okay.

363
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,680
Put it nearer to Zhan Beiye.

364
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,170
Shake it thrice. Then when there is light, shake it thrice again.

365
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,660
Okay.

366
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,110
Don't rush. Let me do it.

367
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,400
Be careful, Older Sis Fuyao.

368
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,420
Older Sis Fuyao.

369
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,460
This Earth Absorbing Bell seems to be fake.

370
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,840
Let me see.

371
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,960
I had carried it for a long time while we were in Deep Water before.

372
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,450
This is not right.

373
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,440
Zhuzhu!

374
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,850
Girl, where are you going?

375
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,810
We got tricked by Zhan Nancheng.

376
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,300
That Earth Absorbing Bell is fake.

377
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,140
It must be Zhangsun Pingrong.

378
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,180
Zhangsun Pingrong?

379
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,490
I can't forgive him.

380
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,590
- What are you trying to do?
- Let go!

381
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,170
Do you still plan to go back to Chant Frost Watchtower?

382
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,410
I want to take the Earth Absorbing Bell back.

383
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,670
We spent so much effort to get it tonight, but ended up getting a fake one.

384
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,590
This means that Zhangsun Pingrong isn't stupid. He already guessed that we'd be going tonight.

385
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,350
Hence, he colluded with Zhan Nancheng to set this act up.

386
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,140
If you return now, you're just going to your death.

387
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,390
What about Zhan Beiye?

388
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,170
We've gone through so much.

389
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,740
Are we just going to watch him die like this?

390
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,390
No matter what, I must get the Earth Absorbing Bell back tonight.

391
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,640
- You! You let go!
- Come over here!

392
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,740
You don't want Zhan Beiye to die. What about me?

393
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,350
Do you want me to watch you go get killed?

394
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,420
You—

395
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,640
What you and Zhan Beiye went through together

396
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,370
is indeed making me have these unfamiliar feelings.

397
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,680
Zhan Beiye indeed can easily make a woman's heart flutter.

398
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,240
He is more passionate, more frank, and more cheerful than me.

399
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,590
Every time I see you having no appetite and worrying about him,

400
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,760
I then hope that the person who accompanied you to risk your life and bear all the pain is me.

401
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,440
I even wished...

402
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,310
wished that the person lying in there was me.

403
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,380
If the person lying in there was really you,

404
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,730
I fear that I wouldn't be able to do anything anymore.

405
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,420
I really can't go through being uncertain if you'll survive or not again.

406
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,020
Don't.

407
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,030
Then the real one?

408
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,210
Don't worry.

409
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,400
I've properly hidden the real one.

410
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:12,540
No one will be able to get it until the day you enter the Sky Gate Ruin.

411
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,070
I initially thought that with Wuji entering Geya Desert alone, he would surely die.

412
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,700
Hence, I used the petrifying disease to create a fake Wuji

413
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,270
and announced to the world that the Crown Prince of Megrez had died.

414
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,070
Who would have known that reality is so hard to predict.

415
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,990
That lad is so fortunate and was able to survive it.

416
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,800
He didn't return to Megrez immediately and instead came here to Rock City.

417
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,730
I then know that he is harboring evil intentions.

418
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,080
Prince Assist has good foresight.

419
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,390
You have told me about it in time.

420
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:51,730
Hence, I got the chance to switch it to a fake one.

421
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,770
Or else—

422
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,530
This Wuji is indeed a bit clever,

423
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,340
but he still is very conceited.

424
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,010
He has belittled his enemy too much.

425
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,500
For so many years, I've battled him so many times.

426
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,960
I've long guessed his manner of thinking.

427
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,090
Why then did you not use this chance today to kill him?

428
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:20,400
If he dies, then no one will be competing with you for the Megrez crown prince position.

429
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,690
Once he learns that the Earth Absorbing Bell he stole is fake,

430
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,070
what will he do?

431
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,630
He is your younger brother.

432
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,340
Of course, I won't be able to guess it.

433
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,980
What if his only chance to take the Earth Absorbing Bell back

434
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,110
is the Sky Gate Ruin event happening three days from now?

435
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,600
Will he go?

436
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,930
Let me think of a way again.

437
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,050
I'll go investigate if the Earth Absorbing Bell is really with Zhangsun Pingrong.

438
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,130
Wuji, I just learned that Zhangsun Pingrong plans to enter the Sky Gate Ruin.

439
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,990
Sky Gate Ruin?

440
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,850
Heavenly Fiend's Sky Gate Ruin can pass through both yin and yang realms.

441
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,560
It is an extremely mysterious and mystical place.

442
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,330
The night of the full moon is when the gates to the Illusion Realm open.

443
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,500
At that moment, it becomes strange and treacherous in Sky Gate Ruin.

444
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,130
Phantoms and darkness are everywhere.

445
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,860
It is really frightening.

446
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,890
When you successfully went through Sky Gate Ruin by yourself that year,

447
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,320
the citizens of Five Regions worshipped you as the fated son of god because of it.

448
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,450
Looks like your older brother is also making his move for this reputation.

449
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,830
Is he rushing to die?

450
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:29,350
Although my older brother is reckless, for him to be so determined to enter Sky Gate Ruin,

451
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,350
he then must be very confident that he'll succeed.

452
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,230
There are indeed ways to make it through the Sky Gate Ruin.

453
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,780
Only the Earth Absorbing Bell can break the mysterious and mystical yin-yang power inside it.

454
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,640
Hence, the Earth Absorbing Bell must be in Zhangsun Pingrong's hands.

455
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,470
Zhangsun Pingrong is inside the Sky Gate Ruin.

456
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,180
Are you sure you want to enter the Sky Gate Ruin?

457
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,760
This is the only chance to save Zhan Beiye.

458
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,140
Do you know how strange the danger is inside the Sky Gate Ruin?

459
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,940
But compared to Zhan Beiye's life, these dangers are nothing.

460
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,960
Okay. I'll accompany you.

461
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,240
You want to borrow Crown Prince Wuji's hands

462
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,330
in helping you deal with the Mind Illusion Realm inside Sky Gate Ruin?

463
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,320
That move is quite sinister.

464
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,520
You are really quite evil.

465
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,820
I don't deserve your praise.

466
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,710
I have never believed in a heavenly chosen heir.

467
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,890
Just right, using this chance,

468
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:51,790
I want to see... see how capable Zhangsun Wuji really is.

469
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,440
Fifth Older Brother, I will surely save you even without some Earth Absorbing Bell.

470
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,710
Don't worry.

471
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,590
You will surely be all right.

472
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,890
Look, do you feel comfortable if I massage you like this?

473
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,180
It must be very comfortable, right?

474
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,420
Sleep well then.

475
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,370
Rest well.

476
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,660
Look at the way you're sleeping.

477
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,480
So adorable.

478
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,590
Let me relax your muscles more.

479
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:45,210
I was ordered by Lord Emperor to cheer you on today.

480
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,740
Thank you for Emperor Father's care.

481
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,880
Once I succeed today, I will immediately return to the city to visit him.

482
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,760
That will be great.

483
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,800
For Your Highness to be able to obey His Majesty's decree and bravely enter the Sky Gate Ruin,

484
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,270
Lord Emperor felt very comforted.

485
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,040
Before I left the capital, he even especially instructed

486
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,260
that if you're able to be like Crown Prince Wuji and safely exit the Sky Gate Ruin,

487
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,070
then it must be heaven's will.

488
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:13,160
If it's heaven who has appointed the heir, no one can stop it then.

489
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,570
I understand.

490
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,590
I wish Your Highness Prince Assist a victorious return.

491
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,590
Fifth Older Brother, don't scare me.

492
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,450
Medical Sage Zong said that you must take this medicine.

493
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,640
You must take it in.

494
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:15,620
Older Sister Fuyao! Older Sister Fuyao! Older Sister Fuyao!

495
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,640
Older Sister Fuyao! Older Sister Fuyao!

496
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,120
Medical Sage Zong! Medical Sage Zong!

497
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,260
Zhuzhu! What's wrong?

498
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,460
They-They all went out. What is it?

499
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,050
Where did they all go?

500
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,080
Did anything happen to General Zhan? Yes?

501
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,410
He is fine. He is fine.

502
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,880
Really? I can help you.

503
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,280
- I can be of help, Zhuzhu.
- Don't meddle anymore.

504
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,780
If there's anything, just tell me or let me keep you company.

505
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,810
- No need for you to accompany me!
- Really?

506
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,540
Royal Older Brother.

507
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,060
Sun and moon eclipses are inauspicious signs, not following the usual course of things.

508
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,910
Now that a solar eclipse is happening, how can you not sigh for an impending death?

509
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,210
Royal Older Brother, for a strange phenomenon to happen in the 15th of this month,

510
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:36,230
looks like a weird phenomenon will indeed be happening inside this Sky Gate Ruin today.

511
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,740
Young Brother Heng is well versed in astrology.

512
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,890
His words have always been true.

513
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,150
When does Prince Assist plan to enter and take a look?

514
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,940
Let's wait for a while more.

515
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,470
Let's wait for a while more.

516
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,230
How come that idiot isn't here yet?

517
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,680
It's not yet the right time.

518
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,170
Of course, he won't appear yet.

519
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,310
Timing?

520
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,220
You're not telling me that he wants you to eliminate the dangers inside the Sky Gate Ruin first

521
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,520
and then he'll just take advantage of it, are you?

522
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,540
- You're right.
- Shameless.

523
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,090
What's most important now is to get the Zhan Beiye's Earth Absorbing Bell back.

524
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,420
That's his life.

525
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,920
Inside this Sky Gate Ruin, there are just stones.

526
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,900
Where's the danger?

527
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,070
Actually, I don't know, either.

528
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,910
When I came here before,

529
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,630
it was exactly the same as what we're seeing now.

530
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,540
I didn't meet any danger then either and safely returned.

531
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,690
Could all these just be a bluff?

532
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,020
I fear that it's not that simple.

533
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,060
Wuji!

534
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,890
Wuji!

535
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,200
Who are you?

536
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,930
Why are you disguising as me?

537
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,300
I should be the one asking you that.

538
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,390
Fuyao!

539
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:12,080
This is indeed the Sky Gate Ruin.

540
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,280
What must come will eventually come.

541
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,510
- Come.
- I already knew that I wouldn't need to waste too much talk when I saw you.

542
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,400
We are of the same root originally.

543
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,040
Why must you be this heartless?

544
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,390
Who really are you?

545
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,790
What do you want?

546
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,320
I am you.

547
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,130
You are me.

548
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,600
