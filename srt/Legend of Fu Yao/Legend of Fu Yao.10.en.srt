♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,490
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:23,640
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,910
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,020
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:40,080
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,530
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,110
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10

♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14

~ Episode 10 ~

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,780
Official, a man came to see you.

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,130
Who is it?

24
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,540
He refuses to say.

25
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,560
What kind of butler are you?

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,250
Do you let any random stranger come in and see me?

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,110
He said he is...

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,170
Where is he?

29
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,440
- Go! Bite it!
- Go!

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,380
Hurry, hurry. Bite it!

31
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,610
Bite! Hurry!

32
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,920
- Bite it!
- Right! Bite it!

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,610
- Go!
- Hurry!

34
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,720
That's right! Bite it!

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,400
Leave now.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

37
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,470
So are you the Imperial Censor Official, Zhang Henian?

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,950
That's right.

39
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,000
And you? What's your last name?

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My last name is Xuanyuan.

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,350
Your last name is Xuanyuan?

42
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,090
Is it the Xuanyuan as in the royal clan Xuanyuan?

43
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,540
That's right.

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,680
Do you know what it means to be in the royal clan Xuanyuan?

45
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,360
I can be the king.

46
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,310
You can really talk big.

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,130
Tell me. How would you persuade others to recognize you as the king?

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,350
I know the Water Manipulation Technique.

49
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,000
Is what you said real?

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,620
It's real.

51
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,700
Someone!

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,490
Hurry to find someone to bring some water!

53
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,010
Official, it's not necessary to bring some water.

54
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,270
The Capital Kun now is raining everywhere.

55
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,610
If Official doesn't believe me, why don't I demonstrate in public

56
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,270
the Water Manipulation Technique of our Xuanyuan clan?

57
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,670
Even if it is the royal clan Xuanyuan that wants to master the Water Manipulation Technique,

58
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,380
it's not something easy, either.

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,430
You are still young.

60
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,760
Aren't you afraid that you might embarrass yourself in public?

61
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,390
I am not afraid.

62
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,750
[Prime Minister's Manor]

63
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,690
Old Master, these are business cards of all the officials who wanted to see you since early morning today.

64
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,770
I just returned.

65
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,020
Are these people already so impatient to wait?

66
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,000
Tell me who is there.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Director of the Secretariat, Prince Heir, and so forth

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,320
have all appointed people to come.

69
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,720
Minister of Ceremonies, Lieutenant Colonel, and Major General have all come personally.

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,290
And the rest are all minor, unimportant people.

71
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
Is there nothing from people on Zhang Henian's side?

72
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,720
General Heavenly Might, Liu He, did come.

73
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,540
But I heard that Zhang Henian reproved him for sacrificing principle for profit and had broken off with him long ago.

74
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,150
I fear that he came this time to side with you.

75
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,810
Someone that Zhang Henian disdains,

76
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,990
how would I consider them?

77
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,410
Find someone to file a complain about him.

78
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,980
Although General Mighty position is just a Class 4 rank,

79
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,930
it is actually suitable to be given to Yan Jingchen.

80
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,030
Yes.

81
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,120
Help me up.

82
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,350
Zhang Henian can really keep his equanimity.

83
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,890
The current Capital Kun could be at risk for a water disaster at any moment,

84
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,970
and yet he still doesn't come to discuss it with me.

85
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,180
What is he thinking?

86
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,970
Official Yun.

87
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,000
[A youngster came to Zhang Henian's manor and claimed to be of the Xuanyuan bloodline. I personally saw this person manipulating water.]

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,490
[I am afraid there will be changes in the Zhang manor so I write this to notify you.]

89
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,740
Godfather, I know why.

90
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,290
Tell me.

91
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,830
He has found the Xuanyuan bloodline.

92
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,440
Your Highness,

93
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,800
have you sent the person there?

94
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,860
Zhang Henian is already bringing him into the palace to meet the king.

95
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,330
He is quite impatient.

96
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,800
It's understandable.

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,390
He should already know that there are quite a few spies from Qi Zhen in his manor.

98
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,810
Rather than letting Qi Zhen find an opportunity to take him on,

99
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,550
it's better for him to take on Qi Zhen first instead.

100
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,330
He is quite smart.

101
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,040
I actually don't really understand.

102
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,010
Why does Your Highness have to use such a risky tactic?

103
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,270
He is just a youngster after all. You say, what if—

104
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,780
I just need you guys to protect his life.

105
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,980
About the other what-ifs, I will handle them.

106
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,960
You say, if Your Highness tells him your true identity

107
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,680
and lets Zhang Henian support you to get the throne, isn't that better?

108
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,790
I have been saying too much.

109
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,850
Your Highness, please forgive me.

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,850
You have been following me for so many years.

111
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,330
Do you still not understand the benefits and harms of doing that?

112
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,390
It must be Qi Zhen who personally helps me to this throne.

113
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,950
I'll get rid of his people then. Wouldn't that be as easy as pie?

114
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,190
We clearly already terminated the Xuanyuan bloodline.

115
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,800
How did this person appear?

116
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,380
Can it be that Zhang Henian had this planned long ago?

117
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,950
It's not impossible.

118
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,460
Godfather, think about it. That day on Mt. Mystic Soul,

119
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,270
when the Heir Apparent disappeared, it was really suspicious.

120
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,570
Although we were tracking all along, in the end, no one personally saw

121
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,750
how the Heir Apparent got the information and how he escaped.

122
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,910
If he really didn't escape himself, but was kidnapped by someone—

123
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,350
What you mean is that

124
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:48,690
there are spies by my side who are giving Zhang Henian information.

125
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,590
We must guard against it.

126
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,760
I already knew that Xuanyuan Min was not as simple as he seems and has ulterior motives.

127
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,130
Your conjectures are not unreasonable.

128
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:11,860
If everything was planned by Zhang Henian long ago,

129
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,360
can it be that what he wants is

130
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,400
the same as what I want?

131
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,580
This is interesting, then.

132
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,100
Whose child are you?

133
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,780
My father is the Prince Xingnan, Xuanyuan Shi.

134
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,220
Prince Xingnan?

135
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,940
[Xuanyuan Ce]

136
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,080
[Prince Xinnan, Xuanyuan Shi]

137
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,220
King, I've found it. I've found it.

138
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,110
He is in the past king Xuanyuan Ce's bloodline.

139
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,760
Xuan-Xuanyuan Ce?

140
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,300
Seventy or eighty years have passed.

141
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,790
I didn't expect that this bloodline still had surviving descendants.

142
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,810
It wasn't easy...

143
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,020
- King, that's strange.
- What's wrong?

144
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,710
According to the genealogy book of the royal bloodline,

145
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,660
Prince Xingnan's bloodline shouldn't have any descendants.

146
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,500
Favored subject, this?

147
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,120
About that, I—

148
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,560
My mother is not the woman that was married to my father.

149
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,890
She is the maidservant of the manor.

150
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,410
She passed away after giving birth to me.

151
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,270
No wonder. According to the rules of Deep Water,

152
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,920
only the offspring of a wedded spouse will be recorded in the genealogy book.

153
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,220
Like...

154
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,780
Like the background of Little Prince, it's not unusual for him to not be in the genealogy book.

155
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,720
Official Zhang, what you said is not right.

156
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,970
The royal bloodline genealogy book is the proof of the King of Deep Water that is passed on from a generation to the next.

157
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,960
If this person is not listed in the book,

158
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,200
how can we prove that he is a real descendant of the Xuanyuan bloodline?

159
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,870
I heard that the King went to the imperial court again, right?

160
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,030
Prime Minister, Official Zhang brought in a youngster.

161
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,820
He said that he is a descendant of the Xuanyuan royal bloodline and wants to see the king.

162
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,000
Zhang Henian is totally being willful!

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,790
The king has been lying in his dragon bed for a long time and his body is weak.

164
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,090
How can he force himself just to meet an imposter who lies to the public?

165
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,770
That's right.

166
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,040
The king was also in a lethargic sleep for the entire day yesterday.

167
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,950
Even his mind is not lucid.

168
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,510
But as soon as he heard that the Xuanyuan royal bloodline had not been completely terminated yet,

169
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,510
he summoned to see Official Zhang today.

170
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,000
And he also summoned a lot of other officials to meet him as well.

171
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,220
Official Nian, what you said was indeed reasonable in the past.

172
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,850
But now, our Xuanyuan royal bloodline is in danger.

173
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,380
If we're going to follow this genealogy book, you try finding me a royal bloodline then.

174
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,000
Currently, Capital Kun has been experiencing torrential rains nonstop for days.

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,930
The royal capital is about to be drowned.

176
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,040
As long as we find a Xuanyuan descendant now,

177
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,840
who is able to share the burden of manipulating the water with His Majesty,

178
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,030
who is able to save the citizens from this misery,

179
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,000
and who is able to preserve the thousand years old government of our Deep Water,

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,340
that is already the world's greatest fortunate event.

181
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,580
Are you still bothered if his name is on the genealogy book?

182
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,610
Even though that's the case, we can't just acknowledge him

183
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,200
just because he says he is of the Xuanyuan bloodline.

184
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,840
If everyone were do that, where are the patriarchal laws and discipline rites?

185
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,030
I've heard all your discussions.

186
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,350
- Prime Minister.
- Prime Minister.

187
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,460
Prime Minister, it's good that you're here. Prime Minister.

188
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,330
Why put too much fuss on a royal bloodline and the genealogy book?

189
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,870
There's only one way to prove the Xuanyuan royal bloodline.

190
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,400
The Water Manipulation Technique.

191
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,520
Am I right, Your Majesty?

192
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,230
Then... take him to the Imperial Qilin Stage.

193
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,220
We'll just talk about his royal bloodline later.

194
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,420
Imperial Qilin Stage.

195
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,710
Do you all hear it?

196
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,070
Once we pass this bridge, we'll arrive in Capital Kun.

197
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,750
Must we cross it now?

198
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,180
Or else, what?

199
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,580
We're now here; hence, there's no reason to still wait.

200
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,190
The weather in Deep Water Nation is really strange.

201
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,830
In the middle of a hot day, the rain suddenly starts to pour hard.

202
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,230
Why don't we wait for the weather to clear up before crossing?

203
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,720
Shut up, woman.

204
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,210
If you say one more word, I'll throw you down there.

205
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,550
Brothers! Look at the path and follow closely!

206
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,900
General Ji, who are the people chasing us exactly?

207
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,360
Why is your master hurrying too much?

208
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,490
You'll have to go ask the General.

209
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,390
During the battle between the five regions and the Holy Land, the world was divided into five.

210
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,100
Deep Water Nation got to control water.

211
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,670
But this water is so full of life.

212
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,190
It can grant an area to be rich and fertile,

213
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,760
but it can also suddenly turn it into a nation of marsh land and lose everything.

214
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,650
Hence, Deep Water Nation needs to manipulate water for it to govern its nation.

215
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,200
To do a good job, an artisan needs the best tools.

216
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,740
Official Qi, let's see how you're going to play this game.

217
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,510
Xuanyuan descendant,

218
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,910
do you know what to do here and now?

219
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,260
Little Prince, don't be afraid.

220
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,240
Come.

221
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,110
No.

222
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,900
The sky has leaked!

223
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,120
Marquis Zhang, if he fails to manipulate the water, you'll be condemned by history.

224
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,370
Zhan Beiye!

225
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,250
- Stop the rain!
- Stop falling!

226
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,540
There's a leak in the sky!

227
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,890
General doesn't know how to swim!

228
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,110
Quickly save him!

229
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,920
Zhan Beiye!

230
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,110
General! Quickly save General!

231
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,590
Save me! Save me!

232
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,060
Save me!

233
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:34,120
The dome roof has fused... !

234
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,080
The dome roof has fused!

235
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,700
General! General! Hurry!

236
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,000
- Hurry.
- General!

237
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,120
General! General! General!

238
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,230
- General! 
- Hurry!

239
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,350
General!

240
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,310
General...

241
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,770
- General! General! General!

242
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,510
General, wake up! General!

243
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,570
- Hey, I say...
- General!

244
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,510
- Hey! Listen to me!
- Wake up! General!

245
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,150
Your General must have drowned.

246
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,480
Quickly get the water out from his stomach.

247
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,820
- Let me do it! General!
- Let me do it!

248
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,600
- He's quite popular.
- Let me do it!

249
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,610
Don't shout! All of you, stop shouting!

250
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,390
I'll do it!

251
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,340
Let me do it!

252
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,040
- Ya Lanzhu, how come you're everywhere?
- This fake guy is here again.

253
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,140
- Let go!
- Go away!

254
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,320
Why are you... Why are you here again?

255
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,730
Only I can save Fifth Older Brother.

256
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,370
Let me do it.

257
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,560
Quickly run!

258
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,710
Fifth Older Brother, you will never escape the palm of my hand!

259
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,300
Congratulations, Heir Apparent, for successfully manipulating the water!

260
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,690
Congratulations, Heir Apparent, for successfully manipulating the water!

261
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,720
If Prime Minister can agree to my three rules,

262
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,530
I can go with you to Capital Kun.

263
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,930
First, I usually don't like clamor or making friends.

264
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:34,880
When I arrive at Capital Kun, I politely decline any useless social event.

265
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,500
Second, I usually am very picky in the people I use.

266
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,980
I must personally choose my servants and attendants.

267
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,220
If Prime Minister has doubts about that, let's just end this here.

268
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,690
Third, I cure people, but also kill people.

269
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,890
If Prime Minister is going to use the excuse of doctors having a benevolent heart

270
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,060
and ask me to become a hypocrite, a fake kind man,

271
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,120
forgive me for I can't obey.

272
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,170
Don't. Don't come near!

273
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,430
[Cool Breeze Bamboo Park]

274
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,410
Miss, please wait!

275
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,800
Miss!

276
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,390
General asks me to give this to you.

277
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,720
Your General is quite funny.

278
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,330
Didn't he say that I was a thief a few days ago?

279
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,820
What does he mean by giving me a pouch of gold today?

280
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,450
Catching both the thief and evidence, and dragging me to the local court?

281
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,750
Miss, you're joking.

282
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,640
General is sincerely grateful to you for saving him.

283
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,650
For a lady to be travelling,

284
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,680
having more money with you will be good.

285
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,620
What you said is reasonable.

286
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,210
I'll accept this gold then.

287
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,640
Don't disturb me in continuing to find Xiaoqi. I'll take my leave.

288
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,520
Hey, Miss, don't rush.

289
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,460
What else?

290
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,940
There's nothing, but you can't leave.

291
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,130
General said that he would never forget your chivalrous act for saving him.

292
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,680
It's just that the real culprit in the stealing of the Earth Absorbing Bell hasn't been found yet;

293
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,260
hence, you are still a suspect.

294
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,590
I fear that you still must continue to travel with us.

295
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,290
What do you mean?

296
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,080
I saved him.

297
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,160
Does he still feel that I'm the bell thief?

298
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,360
Yes, but also no.

299
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,670
General said that everything must be clear.

300
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,440
Miss saving him is his private matter.

301
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,290
As for the Earth Absorbing Bell getting stolen, it concerns official matters and the law.

302
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,550
General can't disregard the law just because of private sentiments.

303
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,360
Fine, stop saying it.

304
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,570
After saying so much, it means that as long as that bell isn't found,

305
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,650
I will forever be a suspect.

306
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,430
That is indeed what he meant.

307
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,380
If I were really that thief,

308
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,420
I should have let your General drown and shouldn't have saved him.

309
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,110
My good heart just got eaten by a dog.

310
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,470
Hey, how could General be a dog?

311
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,780
Your General is even worse than a dog. I'll go argue with him.

312
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,560
Hey. Miss, General will not see you.

313
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,320
Zhan Beiye, what are you so ashamed to show anyone?

314
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,620
Zhan Beiye, come out!

315
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,480
Zhan Beiye!

316
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,290
Zhan Beiye, come out!

317
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,140
Zhan Beiye!

318
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,590
Zhan Beiye!

319
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,380
Zhan Beiye!

320
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,810
Zhan Beiye, come out!

Come out! Zhan Beiye!

323

Don't think of escaping now!

General isn't here.

Why don't you go someplace else?

You think I'm a three-year old child?

It wasn't easy for me to finally catch up to you all.

328
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,580
If I'll easily get tricked by you to leave, my name isn't Ya Lanzhu. Move aside.

- I'm not lying to you.

Come out! Zhan Beiye!

Who is this lady?

Come out! Zhan Beiye!

333

- Look at her outfit. She's from the Qiongye Tribe.
- Zhan Beiye, come out here!

Are you coming out or not? Come out!

Who are you?

How come you're with my Fifth Older Brother?

337

Fifth Older Brother?

338
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,200
Are you his younger sister?

339

I don't want to be his younger sister.

I... want to be... his woman.

- Come out!
- Hey, stop knocking!

- I don't want to. I just have to knock.
- Stop knocking.

- Quickly move aside!
- Stop knocking, okay?

I was finally able to sneak out.

Where will I find Xiaoqi?

- Owner, I want to buy a bun.
- Hot buns!

Okay.

If ever we encounter dangers and get separated later,

Next one. Hey, passport?

362
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,380
What passport?

363
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,130
Why don't you look clearly? This is the capital of Deep Water.

364
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,540
Without a passport, you can't enter.

365
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,460
How come that carriage got to enter?

366
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,580
That is the carriage of Prime Minister's Manor.

- Prime Minister, this concerns the survival of our Deep Water after all.

Do you know what that group of old men said?

They want us to harmoniously coexist with Zhang Henian.

It was also these people who supported you before to usurp the throne.

They keep saying that they are loyally serving you.

385
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,960
They are just a group of opportunists.

Look out for yourself, or Heaven and Earth will combine to destroy you.

387

They are just trying to preserve the greatest amount of self-interest.

Yunhen, you've seen it all.

Only when one encounters a problem can a person show his true colors.

Remember that. Okay?

I'll remember it.

Has the envoy from Heaven Fiend Nation arrived?

393
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,980
He has secretly arrived in Capital Kun.

- Was it Prince Fierce, Zhan Beiye?
- Indeed.

This person is well-decorated in military achievements.

00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:17,310
Although he has been stripped of power, we mustn't belittle him.

Remember to be careful in answering him.

398
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,600
I'll choose a day to meet him.

You must not leak this out.

Godfather, don't worry.

401
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,700
Zhang Henian thinks that he has found a Xuanyuan descendant

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,910
and is now holding a trump card in his hand.

I didn't blame you for treating me as a thief before.

486
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,800
Do you all know that I saved your great general's life?

487
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,640
Is a great general this ungrateful?

488
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,060
Woman, don't push it too much.

489
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,650
I already am very generous in treating you.

490
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,650
What else do you want?

491
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,410
Why don't... we make a bet?

492
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,320
Whoever wins, we'll listen to him. How about it?

493
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,140
Why must I make a bet with you?

494
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,100
Do you not dare to make a bet with me?

495
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,360
A great general can't dare to make a bet with me?

496
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,080
You won't, right?

497
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,120
He couldn't be afraid of losing, right?

498
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,710
Why won't he make a bet with me?

499
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,820
He probably wouldn't, right? A great general.

500
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,790
Oh... Fifth Older Brother has too much pride.

501
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,910
If you let him lose in front of his men, how embarrassing will that be?

502
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,970
It is indeed embarrassing to lose to a girl in front of so many people.

503
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,180
Let's just forget it then.

504
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,050
Forget it. It's fine. We won't make any bets anymore.

505
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,490
- Forget it.
- Stop with your nonsense!

506
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,720
How do you want us to bet?

507
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,780
Look. In front of us are two jars.

508
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,470
Each of us will throw 3 stones in them.

509
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,110
Whoever's jar has the most stones wins.

510
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,050
How about it?

511
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,790
Aren't you afraid to lose?

512
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,910
I'm afraid.

513
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,610
But a man must have indomitable spirit. He must do as he said.

514
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,630
- Fifth Older Brother is a marksman.
- No problem.

515
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,370
- Oh, my!
- You!

516
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,070
Oh, my god!

517
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,960
How come it shattered?

518
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,900
"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

519
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,410
♫ What do you know? ♫

520
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,390
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

521
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,210
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

522
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,420
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

523
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,060
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

524
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,890
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

525
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:18,130
♫ The one who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

526
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,350
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

527
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:28,510
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

528
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:32,440
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

529
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,630
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

530
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,140
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

531
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,090
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

532
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,330
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

533
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:51,960
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

534
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,690
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

535
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:03,050
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

536
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,770
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

537
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,920
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

538
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,840
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

539
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:17,100
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

540
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,150
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

541
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,830
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

542
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,740
♫ Have someone's company ♫

543
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,570
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

544
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:34,750
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

545
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,590
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

546
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,520
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

547

♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫
