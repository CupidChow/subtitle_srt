00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,320
♫ I start to dance nimble and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,500
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,320
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,950
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,900
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,880
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,460
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,040
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,680
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,780
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,880
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,030
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,580
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful ♫

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,420
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,470
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,790
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,610
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,550
~ Episode 54 ~

22
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,120
What's going on here?

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,500
- Help!
- Your Highness, that girl is the palace maid working in Young Phoenix Lake.

24
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,570
- Kill her.
- Help!

25
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,010
Is there any member left in their family?

26
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,610
The Li family is a rich family in this area.

27
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,160
Today is his son's wedding day.

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,640
There should be two more people in this manor.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,230
Then don't leave anyone alive.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,540
Move! Hurry up!

31
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,970
You are indeed beautiful.

32
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,660
This trip was not in vain.

33
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,910
I've long heard that the new daughter-in-law of Li Manor was beautiful all over.

34
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,740
Today, let us brothers have some fun.

35
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,850
I beg you...

36
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,040
I beg you, don't. I beg you.

37
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,130
Husband!

38
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,080
Husband! Husband!

39
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,800
Come, pretty lady.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,900
Even if you destroy your throat from shouting, it won't help!

41
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,450
Good.

42
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,120
If you take this pill, your energy will indeed increase rapidly.

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,390
But its drug effect is too overbearing.

44
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,090
Once you take it, you can only slowly operate your nascent Qi and mustn't use it for fights.

45
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,170
Hurry.

46
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,440
Help me!

47
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,540
Older Sis Fuyao.

48
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,010
Don't!

49
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,760
Older Sis Fuyao.

50
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,750
Don't come near!

51
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,060
Don't come near!

52
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,110
Dirty blood.

53
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,030
With such great fighting skills, why did you just sit like a turtle

54
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,720
and watch my Li family suffer this catastrophe?

55
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:19,550
We invited you to sit in our house as an important guest, served you good wines,

56
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,020
but in the end, we actually fed an ingrate dog!

57
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,310
With such great fighting skills, why did you just sit like a turtle

58
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,430
and watch my Li family suffer this catastrophe?

59
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,300
We invited you to sit in our house as an important guest, served you good wines,

60
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,340
but in the end, we actually fed an ingrate dog!

61
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,800
Abandoning a stranger for your loved one is just a normal thing.

62
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,980
What mistake did you make?

63
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:52,040
You risked your life to save someone, doing a chivalrous act.

64
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,060
What mistake did you make?

65
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,910
What do you want me to use to cherish you?

66
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,410
I always feel that I am inadequate.

67
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,550
Forever inadequate.

68
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,370
Is this your fate?

69
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:08,300
Must you bear more pain than normal people and torment to get this momentary peace?

70
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,070
In this world, how many people come for profits and

71
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,270
die for profits?

72
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:26,710
And only you will feel disgust for this kind of thing and even blame yourself.

73
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,140
This isn't your fault.

74
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,780
You shouldn't have to bear such pain.

75
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,710
This is unfair.

76
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,510
Girl, are you awake?

77
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,370
Are you awake?

78
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,820
Here.

79
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,100
Older Sis Fuyao! You finally woke up.

80
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,830
You scared me to death last night.

81
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,780
Are you okay?

82
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,170
I have...

83
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,740
missed opportunities...

84
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,100
lost...

85
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,520
and been defeated my whole life.

86
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,330
But I have never done anything I regretted.

87
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,420
Now that I think of it,

88
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:41,000
what difference do I have from those despicable cold-hearted people?

89
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,920
So-called justice,

90
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,380
before making decisions,

91
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,910
won't withstand even a single blow because of one's selfishness.

92
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,670
The whole house died because of me.

93
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,780
It was because of me.

94
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,810
It was all because of me.

95
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,530
It's okay.

96
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,100
Everything is fine.

97
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,170
Girl,

98
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,750
we aren't afraid of mentioning it.

99
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,520
Nor do we fear to bear the consequences.

100
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:30,100
But there is no need for us to bear all these sorrows and not let go continuously.

101
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Okay?

102
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:40,460
There are some things that are just like this.

103
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,830
It's hard to distinguish the significant from the insignificant.

104
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,910
One can only make a decision between pain and even more pain.

105
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,060
I am very fortunate to have met you in this life.

106
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,830
Same for me.

107
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,830
It's okay. It's okay.

108
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,070
I will always think that yesterday's events were a bit strange.

109
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,620
Plough's royal clan is being unscrupulous in hiding a large secret.

110
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,660
What really has happened in Young Phoenix Lake?

111
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,640
We don't have any clue now.

112
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,300
Since ancient times, Plough has been like the North Star.

113
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,830
It sets the peace of the world.

114
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,400
No matter what, Plough cannot succumb to chaos.

115
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,480
And it is time to visit the Lord of Plough.

116
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,810
In just a few days, there are already that many urgent reports?

117
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,710
The state affairs of Plough have always been divided into three levels.

118
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,430
Divided according to urgency and importance.

119
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,750
It's already rare if there are two to three urgent reports in a day.

120
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,340
But now, you did well that you have gotten me such annoyances.

121
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,830
Why is there no one answering?

122
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,250
Don't you all usually have many opinions?

123
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,690
Well?

124
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,380
Why are you sealing yourselves away in silence?

125
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,000
The Queen is severely ill.

126
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,550
I am to manage all state affairs on her behalf.

127
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,280
Am I not qualified enough?

128
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,600
Or are you dissatisfied with the Queen's decree?

129
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,070
I do not dare.

130
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,850
Retreat now.

131
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,050
Crown Prince Wuji sent someone to deliver his visiting tally.

132
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,340
Crown Prince Wuji?

133
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,620
In the past ten years, Plough and Megrez have only communicated through letters.

134
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,800
There is no war now and we didn't invite him.

135
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,630
Why would he personally come?

136
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,990
The messenger said that he's here to especially visit Her Majesty.

137
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,890
And he brought the medical sage Zong Yue to look at the Queen.

138
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,890
Really?

139
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,580
Your Highness, I also have a secret message.

140
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,600
Crown Prince Wuji said that you must personally open it.

141
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,650
Your Highness.

142
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,240
We seemed to have met Crown Prince Wuji on the streets the other day.

143
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,570
That fair-skinned scholar that you mistakenly tried to arrest is the Medical Sage Zong Yue.

144
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,860
And his helper is Crown Prince Wuji.

145
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,690
Could it be that they are coming here to seek justice?

146
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,480
You now know to be nervous?

147
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,160
When I told you to arrest people before, didn't you know to open your eyes better?

148
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,620
Can the people of Crown Prince Wuji even look like a minter?

149
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,950
I didn't use my eyes well!

150
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,940
Your Highness can punish me!

151
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,170
How come I still find this matter fishy?

152
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,790
Could it be that they have heard of some rumors?

153
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,260
Could it be...

154
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,610
the incident in Young Phoenix Lake!

155
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,420
Since things have come to this, we can only take things one step at a time.

156
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,670
Spread my order.

157
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,230
He is after all the Crown Prince.

158
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,690
He should be given the proper etiquette and respect.

159
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,080
But at the same time,

160
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,390
things that should be kept secret mustn't be leaked at all.

161
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,170
Yes.

162
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,480
Okay then. I'll take them to meet Queen Mother now.

163
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,980
I want to see what tricks those two are plotting.

164
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,860
Informing Your Highness,

165
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,230
Her Majesty has become weaker today.

166
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,210
She wouldn't even take her medicine now.

167
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,820
Who was here earlier?

168
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,520
It's... Second Queen Heir was here.

169
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,390
Didn't I say that she isn't allowed to go anywhere without my order?

170
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,540
Especially, she's not allowed to get near Astute Time Palace.

171
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,080
How dare you!

172
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
You even let her in?

173
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,030
I think you don't want to live anymore.

174
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,650
It's me who asked her to come.

175
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,760
Is Medical Sage here?

176
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,160
Crown Prince Wuij is also here.

177
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,320
Your Highness Crown Prince has come here to Plough.

178
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,130
I should have gone out to welcome you.

179
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,520
However, I am currently severely ill and am looking quite haggard.

180
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,420
I really couldn't get up and move around.

181
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,960
Hope Your Highness Crown Prince can understand.

182
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,630
Your Majesty, I came uninvited.

183
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,380
Sorry to worry you.

184
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:46,510
Right now, all the state affairs of my nation are being managed by my first queen heir, Feng Jingzhi.

185
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,080
If you have any instructions, just order her to do it.

186
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,220
Zhi'er.

187
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,080
I'm here.

188
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,120
His Highness Crown Prince is the most precious guest of our Plough.

189
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,070
You must entertain him with the highest level of etiquette.

190
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,300
There mustn't be any negligence.

191
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,460
Queen Mother, don't worry.

192
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,540
Thank you, Your Majesty, for treating me with utmost cordiality.

193
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,510
Since this is the case, I'll then leave Zong Yue here to focus on curing you.

194
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,720
I'll take my leave first.

195
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,820
Why didn't you kneel when you saw me?

196
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,310
Your Majesty, I'm not from Plough,

197
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,310
but a guest that you invited.

198
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:49,240
I never heard of any rule in Five Regions where a guest is asked to kneel.

199
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,550
Come forward.

200
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,860
The palace already prepared a lodging for you and Mister Zong.

201
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,250
But because the inner palace is mostly made up of women,

202
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,100
letting Your Highness and Mister stay here might be a bit inconvenient;

203
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,790
hence, we especially emptied a palace hall in the east for you two.

204
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:25,630
We've renovated it, but it's a bit far.

205
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,490
Hope Your Highness Crown Prince won't mind it.

206
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,770
Thank you.

207
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:37,310
May I ask if the second queen heir you've mentioned is Folian who once had an engagement with me?

208
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,020
She didn't want to be called the second queen heir and insisted on being called a princess.

209
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,080
Isn't it announcing to the world that she doesn't want to be an heir and is rushing to be married off?

210
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:55,710
Good thing, Crown Prince has sharp eyes. One look, and you discovered that Folian wasn't that easy to deal with.

211
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:02,590
Your breaking the engagement early on is a extremely great thing for you and the Megrez Imperial City.

212
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,700
Looks like your sibling relationship... ?

213
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,510
If not because I considered the opinion of other people, she would have died long ago.

214
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,720
That girl was harboring evil intentions since we were little.

215
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,100
Letting her stay alive would just bring trouble to everyone.

216
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,900
Now that she lost a backer like Megrez, she's worth nothing.

217
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,620
Which means that once you inherit the royal throne, Folian will surely die.

218
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,710
Your Highness Crown Prince, are you feeling pity towards her?

219
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,070
Feeling pity?

220
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,280
Why do you think she was rushing to marry you?

221
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
She likes you.

222
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Someone that she met only once, more than ten years ago, she already like him?

223
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,250
I don't believe it.

224
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,000
There is a rule here in Plough royal clan.

225
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,950
Once the new queen ascends to the throne,

226
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:05,190
all her unmarried biological sisters must be executed to ensure a stable hold on the royal power.

227
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,310
Folian was rushing to marry you.

228
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,180
One: it's because she wants to be married off.

229
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,730
Two: it's for your Megrez crown prince position.

230
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,600
Who doesn't know that girl as being proud and arrogant?

231
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,230
Always wanting to get on top of me.

232
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,990
Don't you understand such kind of reasoning?

233
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,570
I don't.

234
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,830
I don't believe you.

235
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,790
But all these are not important anymore.

236
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,210
I have another idea.

237
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,840
In the marital alliance between Megrez and Plough, Folian wasn't the only choice.

238
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,960
I can also be a candidate, can I not?

239
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,930
You promised to have an engagement with Folian before just to strengthen the alliance between Megrez and Plough.

240
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:57,580
Based on that, am I, the First Queen Heir, not more suitable?

241
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,090
If you say that you didn't have any such thoughts on rushing to Plough at this time,

242
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,070
I still don't believe you.

243
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,500
They all say that the first queen heir is very intelligent.

244
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,310
I've seen it with my own eyes today.

245
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,340
Give me time to think about it.

246
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:21,910
There are a lot of royalty and nobility coming to my nation to ask for my hand in marriage.

247
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,180
Don't miss out on the opportunity.

248
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,260
Mistress, the person who is picking up the scriptures has arrived.

249
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,280
This is the scripture that I've just copied today.

250
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,850
Take it to the temple and offer it to the altar.

251
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:08,410
Hope it can earn Queen Mother some blessings.

252
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,620
Wait!

253
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,760
The order, direction, and sequence of these scriptures require great attention.

254
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,000
I think you won't know how to place them.

255
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,550
It's better that I personally go.

256
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,230
What are you doing?

257
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:43,430
Mistress, Servant A'Mei was ordered to be flogged to death first thing this morning by First Queen Heir for letting you leave the palace.

258
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,620
This time, none of them will dare to let you out again.

259
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,530
A'Mei is a person with a hard life.

260
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,030
But for her to be released from the suffering of this world this early,

261
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,410
it was worth it for me to have cared for her.

262
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,330
I was able to do a good deed.

263
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,650
I beg you, Princess, leave me a chance to survive.

264
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,280
I don't want to die!

265
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,290
You're begging me.

266
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:11,040
How can I then bare to see you suffer?

267
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,030
Since you won't let me out,

268
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,700
tell me about the happenings outside then.

269
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,560
What novel things are there in the palace lately?

270
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,690
Where is that Crown Prince Wuji of Megrez now?

271
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,690
In my opinion, although Your Majesty's illness is grave,

272
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,790
it is still curable.

273
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,980
Oh?

274
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,290
Does Mister have a medicine for it?

275
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,250
Of course.

276
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,920
I have a medicine here that can drive away filth and open up your channels.

277
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,120
Your Majesty can take it first.

278
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,570
Afterwards, we can slowly nurse your health back.

279
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,650
They're from the Phoenix Lead Pavilion.

280
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:24,270
They are my most trusted personal bodyguards.

281
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,140
I'm a queen that's severely sick and powerless to defend myself.

282
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,890
The more I should treasure my life.

283
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,690
Am I right?

284
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,480
Commander Tang! Commander Tang!

285
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,330
Commander Tang! Commander Tang, what's wrong with you?

286
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,380
Commander Tang!

287
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,800
Mister Zong, what is the meaning of this?

288
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,810
Your Highness Crown Prince.

289
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,020
From now on, I'll be in charge of your daily needs here in the palace.

290
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,070
If you have any instructions, just tell me.

291
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,650
I surely will do my best to do them.

292
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,770
Are you Nanny Hui who served by Folian's side before?

293
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,740
When I was nine and followed Royal Father to come here, it was also you who welcomed and served us. Am I right?

294
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,300
It was me, indeed.

295
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,960
I never thought that Your Highness Crown Prince still recognized me after more than ten years.

296
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,550
I'm so pleasantly surprised.

297
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,190
How could I forget the Plough then?

298
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,820
Crown Prince hasn't returned to visit us for so many years.

299
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,520
I don't know if you have any place you want to go to; I can accompany you to go there.

300
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,590
I remember that there was a lotus pond here in the royal palace that looked like paradise.

301
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,640
I don't know if it's still around.

302
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,880
To tell you the truth, that lotus pond has been sealed off for several years.

303
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,380
It's now dilapidated.

304
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,900
Really?

305
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,640
If there's a chance, I still want to take a look.

306
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,330
Crown Prince cherishing old memories is a sign of a benevolent heart.

307
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,170
I'll take you there then.

308
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,230
Please.

309
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,320
Your Majesty, don't rush.

310
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,740
Just slowly observe first.

311
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,290
Your Majesty, I've said before Your Majesty's illness is beyond the surface.

312
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,880
Usual medicines won't work.

313
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,620
Hence, the medicine I used is a bit stronger.

314
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,020
Your Majesty, you can now be at ease. Right?

315
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,670
How is it?

316
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,260
The vital channels inside me are free flowing, my blood and Qi are all normal.

317
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,760
This medicine is poison-free.

318
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm Tang Yizhong from Plough!

319
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,660
Not bad.

320
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,770
Your Tang family is indeed my most trusted guards among the Phoenix Lead Pavilion.

321
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,210
Go and get your reward.

322
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

323
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,890
Mr. Medical Sage, your medical skills are exquisite and you have such kind healing hands.

324
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,570
You should be heavily rewarded by our Plough.

325
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

326
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,300
Who are you?

327
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,590
Who are you?

328
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,490
Who are you?

329
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:39,030
Mister, the badge given to you is a royal grace that will allow you to move around in the palace.

330
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,690
From now on, in this Plough Royal Palace, except for some forbidden areas,

331
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,810
you can go wherever you want.

332
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,720
Little Wuji, come! Come here quickly!

333
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,210
What's wrong?

334
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,740
I seemed to have been here.

335
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,870
Mister, please stop.

336
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,340
In front is a forbidden palace area.

337
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,150
Trespassers will be executed.

338
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,870
What place is in front?

339
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,710
I don't know, either.

340
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,380
Mister, please don't make it hard for us!

341
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,170
I'm here! I'm here!

342
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,320
I'm here!

343
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,780
I'm here!

344
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:52,050
Are you saying that Feng Xuan got bedridden not because she was infected by a severe illness,

345
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,140
but because of being poisoned?

346
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,510
The drug I gave her today was actually an emergency antidote that Zong Yue gave me.

347
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,630
I wanted to let her take it first and fool her in the meantime.

348
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,190
Who would have known that medicine actually worked?

349
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,520
It shows that she indeed was poisoned.

350
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,170
Poisoned?

351
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,550
Say, who could have poisoned her?

352
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,550
We still don't know.

353
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,780
What sound is that?

354
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,080
Plough is located within War Bath Mountains.

355
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Around it are thousand year-old karst caves.

356
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,270
This sound is formed by wind passing through the karst caves.

357
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,150
In here, it's also considered the call of the phoenixes in Young Phoenix Lake.

358
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,900
Will this sound be present daily, from day to night?

359
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,870
Legend says that it only happens when the Fire Phoenix appears.

360
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:01,630
Since I arrived here in Plough, a lot of things looked familiar

361
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,880
including this phoenix call sound.

362
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:12,590
It's like I've heard of it in my dreams.

363
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,310
Let me tell you this.

364
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,680
Someone was following me today.

365
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,410
I fought with him and what he used was a sword technique from Firmament.

366
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,500
- Firmament's sword technique?
- Yes.

367
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,580
I'm sure of it.

368
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,060
This person's attack has a thick mark of Firmament in it.

369
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,750
Also, he must be an alcoholic,

370
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,180
because I could smell his alcoholic breath even before his sword reached me.

371
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:02,150
I'm guessing that this person must have been sent by Feng Xuan to investigate our real intention in coming here.

372
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,320
You tell me. What exactly are they hiding?

373
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,360
A black-clothed man with marks of Firmament.

374
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,320
A Feng Xuan showing signs of being poisoned.

375
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,060
A Young Phoenix Lake that's slowly drying up.

376
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,420
I fear that Plough is indeed in trouble.

377
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,900
[Luan Bamboo Terrace]

378
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,220
That must be Luan Bamboo Terrace.

379
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,300
Yes. In Luan Bamboo Terrace are documents from generations of Plough.

380
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,410
It collects all the documents about the achievements of the different politicians and generals.

381
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,800
There are also records of major events in there.

382
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,120
You can say that anything that happened here in Plough,

383
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,360
whether big or small, you can find a record in there.

384
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,430
Then it means that this Luan Bamboo Terrace is one of the most important places here in Plough.

385
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,790
Of course!

386
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,560
The Luan Bamboo Terrace will only be opened twice a year for editing and recording of new information.

387
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,240
During usual days, they will only do maintenance in there.

388
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,660
Not anyone can go in.

389
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,050
If ever I want to go in and look, can you help me?

390
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,490
There are only very old scrolls in there.

391
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,090
There's nothing interesting.

392
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:33,060
Why do you want to go in there?

393
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,780
I'm not afraid to get laughed at by you.

394
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,500
I'm a boring person and just love reading old scrolls.

395
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,060
This Luan Bamboo Terrace is quite famous outside.

396
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,520
Now, I'm finally in front of it.

397
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,470
If I'm unable to get in, it's quite a regret.

398
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,740
Technically speaking, to enter Luan Bamboo Terrace, you must have Queen Mother's personally written permit.

399
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,420
I just knew it.

400
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,310
I'm just a commoner.

401
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,780
This is just my wishful thinking.

402
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,930
Mister!

403
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,220
If you want to go in, there's no big deal.

404
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,120
Miss, isn't it that you can't help me, either?

405
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,830
Mister, no need to have regrets.

406
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,690
I'll take you inside.

407
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,320
Really?

408
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,440
What unauthorized person are not allowed?

409
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,930
It's just some rotten rule.

410
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,940
When I become the queen, I'll remove all these things.

411
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,120
Since the Luan Bamboo Terrace is a place were books are stored,

412
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,950
everyone should be allowed to enter it.

413
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,430
Let them read whatever book they want.

414
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,560
It also won't be a waste for the time and effort spent by those past writers.

415
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,490
You... why are you looking at me like that?

416
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,460
You're pretty.

417
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,030
This Luan Bamboo Terrace should be cleaned.

418
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,310
The whole place has a moldy stench.

419
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,300
If this continues, all the books here will rot.

420
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,560
What is that up front?

421
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,080
That is the forbidden area here in Luan Bamboo Terrace.

422
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,630
I also have never entered it.

423
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,920
The old people here in the palace say that the Fire Phoenix is guarding inside.

424
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,460
The root of the bloodline of Plough's royal clan is also hidden in there.

425
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,630
Who is it?

426
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,130
It turns out to be a petal.

427
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,020
It's actually as beautiful as you.

428
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,960
Let us?

429
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,980
