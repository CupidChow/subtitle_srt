♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

We don't see common magpies.

The phoenix darkens and covers the whole sky.

It's been so many years since these black crows symbolizing a disaster have appeared.

Now,

31
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,930
this sky is almost fully covered by their dark shadows.

I don't know.

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,100
Empress, it's better that you go back inside to rest.

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,910
No.

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,780
I followed your order and went to Baiting to ask for the Yao City Defense Army to reinforce us.

53
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,050
But those 20,000 Defense Army have all been deployed elsewhere.

54
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,870
There aren't any persons or even weapons there.

55
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,910
But our civilian army and weapons couldn't even compare to those of the Black Tribe Gang.

56
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,470
Are we still fighting?

57
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,460
- Give me some.
- Everyone will get one.

58
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,900
- Everyone will get one.
- Don't rush...

- Thanks.
- Thanks.

- The situation is very bad.
- Everyone, please fall in line!

- The food is just enough until today.

Don't push.

74

We only have these left in the whole village.

75
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,680
I even picked this one by one from the ground.

- Go and distribute it to everyone.
- No!

You haven't eaten in so many days.

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,170
I'm already full from drinking water. I'm not hungry.

00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,910
- Quickly go!
- Everyone will get one. Don't push.

- Give me a bowl.
- Give me a bowl, too.

- Everyone get in a line.
- Thank you.

Since there isn't any food stock anymore, let's just think of another way.

83
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,260
This is a barren desert to begin with. Even fish can't survive here.

00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,170
If there is nothing swimming in the water, then look for those flying in the sky.

86
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:19,300
Something like bark, wild plants, anything that can fill the stomach, don't spare it.

87
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,570
Everyone, fall in line!

88
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,200
I really fell uneasy to leave you alone here in Yao City.

89
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,750
I'm leaving this pouch to you.

We've been surrounding the city for so many days.

97
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,990
What Your Highness means is we continue to wait or to directly charge into it?

00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,020
You are the First Boss of this Black Tribe Gang.

What is your plan?

100
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,060
I think that Yao City is a good place,

101
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,960
but we can opt to not spare those unruly citizens.

102
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,420
You want to massacre the city?

103
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,850
These are all your matters.

104
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,050
I only look at the result.

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,580
May Your Highness wait for a few more days.

107
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,450
By then, let's choose a good day to go together and have a pleasant kill.

108
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:21,160
With my precious body, asking me to fight in the front line...

109
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,280
isn't that unsuitable, right?

110
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,740
Why don't I just prepare the gold and silver

111
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,320
and quietly wait for you to return victorious?

112
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,210
May Your Highness be at ease.

113
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,260
Just quietly wait for the victory report of the Black Tribe Gang.

114
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,800
That will be the best then.

115
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,770
Just do what you want to do.

116
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,740
No need to be lenient.

117
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,670
I only want the head of that Yao City Magistrate.

118
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,040
Okay then.

119
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,490
I'm going to get the head of another person,

120
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,650
so that the two of them can become good things coming in a pair.

Why didn't you listen to me?

Older Sis Fuyao, something happened!

135
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,610
This morning, Black Tribe Gang shot a lot of arrows with flyers on them into the city.

136
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,210
It says that they will stop any supply of water or food into the city after 3 days.

137
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,400
Those that will abandon the city and surrender will be allowed to survive.

138
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,450
Those clearly are their underhanded tricks because they still couldn't conquer us after so many days.

139
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,900
How could the citizens care about that much?

140
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,150
They have been starving for a long time.

141
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,320
If they also cut off our water supply, then we completely have no way to survive!

00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,150
Official, the city gates were opened!

You scared us to death.

156
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,520
When Tie Cheng carried you back, you had an arrow in your back.

157
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,060
Good thing those idiots are not that good at archery.

158
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,840
Or else, you would have died.

159
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,210
You carried me back?

160
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,380
I... will go pour the water.

161
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,630
Older Sis Fuyao, let's hurry and go.

162
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,640
- Go where?
- Who cares? Anyway, we're not staying here anymore.

163
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,490
This Yao City people are so disloyal.

164
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,590
Also, so disobedient. Say, if you had lost your life for them, you would've regret it a lot!

165
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,720
Let's go. Let's quickly leave!

166
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,050
Come over here.

167
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,500
What is it?

168
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,210
What are you doing?

169
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,000
I already said it to stop asking me to leave.

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,850
Whoever asks me to leave Yao City again, I'll break his neck.

171
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,700
Look at what you look like now! You're still not leaving?

172
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,640
Even if you want to leave, you must be able to get out.

173
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,130
Look at your small and thin physique.

174
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,720
If you go out, you'll just get shot at and turned into a honeycomb. In the end,

175
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,090
won't it be Older Sis Fuyao and I who will save you?

176
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,600
Who says so?

177
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,160
I'm from the Camouflage Dragon Clan.

178
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,930
Just casually boring into an underground hole, I can already escape.

179
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,730
Also, in terms of the craft of making underground tunnels,

180
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,930
there wouldn't be that many who are better than me in the whole Five Regions.

181
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,290
If you don't believe, I'll make you one now.

182
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,420
- You!
- Enough.

183
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,640
Anyway, I won't leave.

184
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,210
You shouldn't blame them, either.

185
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,380
Who isn't afraid of death?

186
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,150
Also, after starving for so many days,

187
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,370
whoever will give me food, I will also want to surrender.

188
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,570
But I promised Wuji that I will guard the citizens of Yao City.

189
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,460
I can't abandon them.

190
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,990
But... But I don't want you to die.

191
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,800
Even if I really die, will the God of Death dare accept me?

192
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,020
I just knew that you had an idea. Am I right?

193
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,560
Quickly say it.

194
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,030
That will depend on our Camouflage Dragon Clan member.

195
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,960
If there is still no reinforcement that will come,

196
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,660
our Yao City will fall soon.

197
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,780
Hence, we must divide the work.

198
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,440
Xiaoqi, I'm counting on your underground tunnel.

199
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,870
You two leave through the underground tunnel.

200
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,770
One goes east to Megrez.

201
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,330
The other goes north to Heaven Fiend.

202
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,980
You must bring the news of the situation here out.

203
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,510
- Yes.
- Yes.

204
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:45,520
The 2,000 lives in Yao City plus me are depending on you two.

205
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,970
You two take care.

206
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll wait for you here in Yao City.

207
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,610
- Be careful.
- You be careful, too.

208
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,430
Your Highness! Your Highness!

209
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,740
Your Highness, Crown Prince already entered Geya Desert towards the inner part.

210
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,380
Wuji, oh Wuji. He just has to go to his death.

211
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,560
Of course, I should send him off.

212
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,420
Without the assistance of the Thousand Cavalry of the Upper Yang Palace,

213
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,970
killing Wuji is like catching a turtle within a jar.

214
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,280
Since we were little, we've dueled so many times.

215
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,990
You just have to choose to die in Geya Desert.

216
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,340
I didn't expect that, either.

217
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,970
Kill!

218
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,340
Prince Assist wants to kill the Crown Prince.

219
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,920
Zhangsun Jiong covertly allowed it.

220
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,490
You can't just sit and watch.

221
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,980
I fear that even if I want to interfere, Crown Prince will not give me that chance.

222
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,020
Wuji is indeed aloof.

223
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,990
Usually being disrespectful to you is indeed his fault.

224
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,360
But today isn't the same as before.

225
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,870
No matter how bad he is, how can you bear to...

226
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,970
What if something bad really happens to him? Then I—

227
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm just saying some angry words.

228
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,870
How could I truly make a fuss with a younger generation?

229
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,880
Then, do you have any plan?

230
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,620
Actually, I already secretly sent elite guards to protect the Crown Prince.

231
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,650
It's just that—

232
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,260
It's just that what?

233
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,110
Hurry and say it!

234
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,810
Crown Prince has fallen into quicksand.

235
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,620
It's still unknown if he is alive or not.

236
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,470
No, Wuji will be all right. You must have gotten it wrong!

237
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,960
Yi'er, don't get agitated.

238
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,460
No news coming from Prince Assist is the best news for us.

239
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,080
Prince Assist's wild ambition is very obvious and he has long been unable to hold it back.

240
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,390
If I falsely express goodwill towards him,

241
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,520
maybe... we can get some information from him.

242
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,590
On the other hand, I will continue sending men to Geya Desert to look for Wuji.

243
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,890
Don't lose your cool inside the palace.

244
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,830
Just be at ease and wait for my news.

245
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,760
Okay.

246
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,340
- What should we do now?
- Fellow villagers, don't panic first.

247
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,580
- There will be a solution. Let's not be in a panic.
- That's right.

248
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,920
- She's here. Official Fu is here!
- Magistrate Fu is here.

249
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,090
- Give us a speech.
- The magistrate is here!

250
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,290
Find her.

251
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,010
- What do we do?
- What to do with this?

252
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,700
There's nothing to eat here.

253
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,290
- How can we still survive?
- Hurry up and think of a solution.

254
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,390
Official, we don't have anything else here.

255
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,150
We don't have any rations or water.

256
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,600
Please think of a way. Our Yao City now has no water at all.

257
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,040
Without food, we can still reluctantly survive for a few days.

258
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,090
But without water, we-we won't be able to last even for a day!

259
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,160
- That's right!
- We beg you.

260
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,000
- Think of a solution.
- Yes, Official.

261
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,570
- What do we do now?
- That's right.

262
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,120
From now on, we can't even drink a sip of porridge.

263
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,770
This is the heaven completely severing our Yao City's path!

264
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,620
What should we do? This...

265
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,010
Fellow villagers!

266
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,060
Yao City is currently in a very dangerous state.

267
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,990
They can break into the city any time.

268
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,820
As they say, a wise man submits to the circumstances.

269
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,120
If we continue to obstinately resist,

270
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,050
the day they break into the city will be the day that lives are plunged into misery and suffering.

271
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:37,430
I can't let you all lose your lives at the hands of that Black Tribe Gang just because of persisting to have things my way.

272
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,660
Hence...

273
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,710
this city... we're not guarding it anymore.

274
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,280
Why are we not guarding it anymore?

275
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,450
You! You selfish and shameless despicable and evil woman!

276
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,260
You're selling our Yao City! You're killing us!

277
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,630
Crazy! You've gone crazy!

278
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,470
You are using the lives of the citizens of Yao City to preserve your own!

279
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,090
You're going to have us killed!

280
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,560
You are selfish and shameless!

281
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,180
You sinister woman!

282
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,990
Even you are blaming me now, is that it?

283
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,430
Xiaoqi and Zhuzhu have been gone for four to five days already.

284
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,440
Until now, there is no news at all.

285
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,960
You can help me find Wuji, am I right?

286
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,930
You have a way, right?

287
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,830
If we continue to guard this city, everyone will have to die.

288
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,360
I can only rely on you now.

289
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,470
Go and help me look for Wuji, okay?

290
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,060
Stop hesitating. Just treat it as doing me a favor.

291
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,450
You must get Wuji back for me.

292
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,810
Teacher's wife!

293
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,260
Teacher's wife!

294
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,540
- You evil woman!
- It's you!

295
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,060
You're going to get us killed!

296
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,120
You didn't care about our lives!

297
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,810
That's right! You are going to cause trouble to us.

298
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,440
Beat her to death! Evil woman!

299
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,530
Stop!

300
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,060
We were so loyal to you!

301
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,020
- Leave!
- Stop!

302
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,900
Stop throwing! Stop throwing!

303
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,350
- You've misunderstood her. Stop throwing!
-  Evil woman! We're so blind to believe you!

304
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,610
- She's not that kind of person! She's not!
- Her beauty has confused you!

305
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,830
Didn't you say that you want to marry her?

306
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,930
- Stop!
- You shameless woman!

307
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,940
You lied to us! You are not a good thing!

308
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,990
- You all have misunderstood her! She's not!
- You evil woman!

309
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,420
Put that down! She's not!

310
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,280
She's not!

311
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,130
The Yao City Magistrate is here to surrender the city!

312
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,950
Since you're surrendering the city,

313
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,460
why didn't you just open the city gates and instead personally come here?

314
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,540
If I open the city gates, may I ask who among you dare to go in?

315
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,600
Are you not afraid that I have set up a trap?

316
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,290
What else is more sincere than me coming here alone?

317
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,820
Please go in.

318
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,670
I am here to especially surrender our city.

319
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,230
With my seal, I've smoothed your way into Yao City

320
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,830
and even the way into the Megrez Imperial City.

321
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,570
Such bold words. Yao City is just a small city.

322
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,510
If I, Chigui, want to have it, it's just like picking an item in my bag.

323
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,680
Do I still need you to give it to me?

324
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm stating bold words?

325
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,060
Indeed. Yao City is just a small city.

326
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,930
It doesn't have high walls or canons, nor a well-trained army.

327
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,520
But it was able to keep you all out of the city for half a month.

328
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,660
Aren't you taking so much time in picking this item from your bag?

329
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,070
You!

330
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,540
You were unable to conquer it quickly.

331
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,240
Let me ask you. How can you explain that to Zhangsun Pingrong?

332
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,830
How are you going to redeem the lost morale of your army and make them continue fighting for you?

333
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,530
I came this time to help you.

334
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,760
But I really am very disappointed with your attitude.

335
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,600
Fine then.

336
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,960
I should look for another wise ruler and get my citizens a better outcome.

337
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,360
Farewell.

338
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,730
Wait!

339
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,880
Official Fu, calm down.

340
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,610
I was a poor host earlier.

341
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,400
I believe you!

342
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:28,000
Since First Boss believes me, do you want to inspect this official seal first?

343
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,930
So that you won't blame me for a fake one in the future.

344
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:43,090
How could you do that, Official Fu? You blind people,

345
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,940
look well on the sincerity that the Yao City Magistrate brought to us.

346
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:53,660
Since that's the case, First Boss, shouldn't you express your sincerity, too?

347
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,130
Okay, of course!

348
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,860
Men! Prepare the materials for an oath of alliance.

349
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,410
Yes!

350
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,030
First Boss, I heard that the oath of alliance of Black Tribe Gang

351
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:17,360
is obtaining one's heart's blood to express one's resoluteness.

352
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,580
Are you afraid, First Boss?

353
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,230
Please.

354
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,950
All of you, listen!

355
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,070
You won't be able to guard that rotten city anymore!

356
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,040
Even your magistrate has run away.

357
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,310
She has used all of your lives in exchange for hers!

358
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,620
- What are you all still wasting time for?
- What should we do?

359
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,930
Quickly open the door!

360
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,670
Maybe you might be able preserve your lives if you do!

361
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:14,200
Hurry up! If there is anyone who is skilled and willing to serve Black Tribe Gang,

362
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,700
I might spare his life.

363
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,360
Or else, we will kill everyone!

364
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,940
Kill her!

365
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,880
- What happened?
- What happened?

366
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,360
[Black Tribe Gang]

367
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,710
Damn you! You've got balls!

368
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,170
Today, I will kill you!

369
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,800
Listen well.

370
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,290
Whoever lets her escape, then I'll take their life!

371
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,930
Yes!

372
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,140
Miss Fuyao, we were ordered to protect you.

373
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,400
Please trust us.

374
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,110
Let's go. Hurry.

375
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,420
- Chase after them!
- Chase!

376
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,050
Chase!

377
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,070
Stone Inscription Poison.

378
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,190
Gir... Girl.

379
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,470
It's me! Quickly open the city gates!

380
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,270
I'm back!

381
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,490
Archers!

382
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,490
I faked my surrender!

383
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,490
I've killed their leader!

384
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,610
Within three days, they surely will retreat!

385
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,950
The army chasing us will be here soon! Quickly open the gates!

386
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,360
Open the gates?

387
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,610
You think I will let a traitor like you come in here and have us all killed?

388
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,980
Release!

389
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,780
Hurry and open the door!

390
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,560
You're about to die and you still claim that she's innocent, that she's not a traitor?

391
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,000
Do you hear it now? Go and open the door!

392
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,180
Go and open the door for your master then!

393
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,590
She's not a traitor! If I say that she isn't then she isn't!

394
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,600
I beg you to believe me!

395
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,890
I can guarantee with my own life that Fuyao isn't a traitor!

396
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,390
- I beg you all! Let Fuyao in!
- She's a traitor!

397
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,350
Let her in!

398
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,940
You won't be able to break that!

399
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,570
This iron chain was created by my father using a thousand year old black iron.

400
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,220
Just give up.

401
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,760
Tell me. Why?

402
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,390
Because she deserves to die!

403
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,160
She deserves to die!

404
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,200
Open the door!

405
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,390
Hurry and open the door! Hurry and open the door!

406
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,290
Don't release the arrows!

407
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,090
I want her to die slowly.

408
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,400
Let her in. I beg you all!

409
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:38,730
The people I sacrificed my life for are actually shutting the doors on me.

410
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,460
People who have not accepted my kindness were the ones sacrificing their lives for me!

411
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,670
What kind of logic is there in the debts of this world?

412
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,910
Open the door!

413
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,040
I beg you guys, save her!

414
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,930
I'm willing to use my life to exchange for hers.

415
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,420
Don't!

416
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,820
Just kill me!

417
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,480
This is the ending that a traitor should have!

418
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,250
Kill her!

419
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,700
