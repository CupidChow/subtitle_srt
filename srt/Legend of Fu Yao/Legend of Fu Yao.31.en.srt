00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,480
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,490
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:23,850
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,980
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,940
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,820
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,590
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,090
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,830
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,860
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,930
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,110
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,660
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,380
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,570
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:21,460
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,810
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,400
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,280
~ Episode 31 ~

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,600
To tell you the truth,

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,060
a good friend of mine is falsely accused.

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,380
I needed to take this man to the Megrez Imperial City to see the Emperor

25
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,680
so that he can clear the charges for my friend. Who knows—

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,720
Forget it.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,120
I'll go to the Megrez Imperial City and have an audience with the emperor first.

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,960
Are you saying that you want to go to Megrez Imperial City

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,880
and even want to enter the palace to have an audience with the emperor?

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,220
Is there anything wrong about that?

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,840
It's easy to enter the Imperial city, but hard to enter the Imperial palace.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,490
Don't even talk about having an audience with the Lord Emperor.

33
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,780
Megrez commands the Five Regions and has tight security to begin with.

34
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,360
Now that Crown Prince has returned from his training, the whole city is rejoicing.

35
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,430
The more it will be hard for an outsider to go in.

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,310
Who really is that Crown Prince Wuji?

37
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,930
Recently, I keep hearing you all talk about him.

38
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,690
I only know that at the age of ten,

39
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,280
he already produced world renowned literary works and his arrows can travel thousands of li.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,960
At age 12, he charged into the south border by himself alone,

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,870
fixed the conflict between the northern and southern tribes,

42
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,250
and resolved a great calamity that almost exterminated the Qiongye Tribe.

43
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,480
By age 15, the heavens sent down an auspicious sign that preserved the harvest of the whole Five Regions.

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,990
There is even such a person?

45
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,780
Even the story tellers won't dare write things like that.

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,870
Wuji isn't human.

47
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,730
What?

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,140
He's a god.

49
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,670
Sorry...

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,410
Then, can we stop talking about your god?

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,710
Can you... tell me how to enter the city?

52
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,230
I just happen to be going to Megrez Imperial City in a few days.

53
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,140
- Really?
- One is that the leaves of Winged Tree in Mt. Herding Spirit

54
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,060
can stop the epidemic.

55
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,920
Second, I have an important matter to do, too.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,980
Seeing how you're of the same age as me,

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,860
and that we're fated to meet,

58
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,400
why don't you stay for a few more days?

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,650
After I finish the matters at hand,

60
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,330
I'll take you with me when I seek an audience in the palace.

61
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,760
- Really?
- Yes.

62
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,680
Wuji, you're finally back.

63
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,330
Older Sister Fuyao, my Miss has fallen ill.

64
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,350
This way.

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,410
Miss! Miss!

66
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,260
- Miss...
- Let me pass.

67
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,140
Older Sister.

68
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,000
Fuyao.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,730
I'm here.

70
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,920
You all just go back to your work.

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,520
Miss Fuyao and I will just privately say a few words.

72
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,310
No matter how well one can predict, they can't really predict their own life.

73
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,370
I really feel embarrassed for asking you to come here today,

74
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,020
but I have a very important matter that I must ask you to do.

75
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,760
Sister, just give the instructions.

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,480
To tell you honestly,

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,480
my going to the Imperial city this time is originally for the official matters of the Five Regions.

78
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,260
But now, I fear that I won't be able to rush there anymore.

79
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,870
- Miss, don't say such things.
- I won't be able to rush there.

80
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,780
Miss.

81
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,920
Do you still remember the Crown Prince Wuji that I told you before?

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,770
I remember.

83
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,240
He is my fiancé.

84
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,840
Miss is the second princess of Plough Nation.

85
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,430
Since she was little, she was already engaged to Crown Prince Wuji.

86
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,720
My purpose for going to the Imperial city this time is both for state affairs

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,400
and to discuss my marriage matters with him.

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,070
Although he and I are thousand of miles apart,

89
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,460
we would exchange letters through swan geese these past years.

90
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,330
This yearning has never lessened all these years.

91
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,440
I also have decided to not marry anyone except him in this lifetime.

92
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,980
He also said that he will never marry anyone except me.

93
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,050
Since he's such a faithful man,

94
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,080
you will surely get better

95
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,110
and then get reunited with him.

96
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,320
I treated so many people.

97
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,070
I know this illness very well. I fear that...

98
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,130
Miss, you will surely get better!

99
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,530
Even if I'm able to survive it,

100
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,300
we mustn't cause any delay on the official matters.

101
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,020
Qiaoling, go get my badge.

102
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,550
Miss.

103
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,790
Hurry up.

104
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,030
Miss.

105
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,200
This—

106
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,830
This is the Purple Phoenix Badge that can represent my status.

107
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,950
I beg you to go to Megrez Imperial City using my name.

108
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,670
Go see Crown Prince Wuji and Lord Emperor for me.

109
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,160
- You... want me to disguise as you?
- Right.

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,710
This... We mustn't do this.

111
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,060
I can't disguise as you.

112
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,420
- I beg you.
- Miss...

113
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,570
Older Sis Fuyao, I really can't understand it.

114
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,320
Why did that Older Sister Folian want you to disguise as her?

115
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,250
She said that the Megrez Imperial City is currently facing a huge crisis.

116
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,030
She is also a representative of Plough Nation.

117
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,600
The Megrez Imperial City called for envoys from different nations to discuss this matter.

118
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,660
If she didn't go there on time, the Megrez Imperial City will surely blame Plough for it.

119
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,160
Her engagement with Crown Prince Wuji might also get canceled.

120
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,290
But is it really right to do this?

121
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,420
What's wrong about it?

122
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,860
We are not going there to harm anyone.

123
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,300
We just need to explain it clearly once we see the emperor.

124
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,110
Maybe, we can even clear Zhan Beiye's name in passing.

125
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,460
Isn't that good?

126
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,940
Hope so.

127
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,820
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

128
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,360
Let's go.

129
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,750
Let's go.

130
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,150
Older Sis Fuyao. Older Sis Fuyao, I can't believe that I'm inside the Imperial City!

131
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,410
After we left Mt. Mystic Soul, we went to Deep Water.

132
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,340
And now, we're actually in Megrez!

133
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,480
If you don't go out to travel the world, you really won't realize how huge it is!

134
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,390
Indeed.

135
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,390
Maybe, this will be lead to another adventure!

136
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,790
Megrez Imperial Palace...

137
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,830
It's really... so imposing.

138
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,580
It's really better to see it than just hearing of it.

139
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,280
Look. There are so many people over there. Let's go there.

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,260
I beg you...

141
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,650
- I beg you...
- Thanks...

142
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,610
- So pitiful.
 - I just want to cure my younger brother's illness.

143
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,120
- This uncle, what's happening here?
- Please spare me.

144
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,570
- I won't do it again.
- It's all because of the noxious illness.

145
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,480
This miss and her younger brother rely on each other for survival.

146
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,900
Who would have known that when her younger brother went out to find work a few days ago,

147
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,170
he was found to be sick with the epidemic disease upon returning.

148
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,700
This miss heard that the leaves of the winged tree in Mt. Herding Spirit can cure this illness,

149
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,240
so she secretly went there to pick some.

150
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,280
But the winged tree is the symbol of the royal family.

151
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,320
It's not something that a commoner can casually pick.

152
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,610
Who did that?

153
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,030
Several men bullying one woman, don't you find that embarrassing?

154
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,570
Who are you?

155
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,560
Don't bother asking who I am. I can't stand men like you.

156
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,200
Move aside! Move aside!

157
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,690
Oh, it's a heroine.

158
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,500
Attack.

159
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,500
Kill her!

160
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,600
Stop!

161
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,300
Greetings, Prince Virtue.

162
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,080
Greetings, Royal Uncle.

163
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,890
First Royal Son, pick up your belt first.

164
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:58,720
Don't embarrass yourself in front of the saintess of the Five Regions.

165
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,260
You must be careful of a very important item like that.

166
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,520
Royal Uncle, you're saying that she's... ?

167
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,250
If she's not from the royal family of Plough,

168
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,460
who would have a Purple Phoenix Badge like this?

169
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
I was disrespectful...

170
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,580
So, you're the First Royal Son.

171
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,200
Sorry for offending you earlier.

172
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,560
But can I ask First Royal Son to let this miss go?

173
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,190
She went to pick the leaves for her family.

174
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,290
Since Megrez is the Imperial City of the Five Regions,

175
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,990
the more you should empathize with the citizens.

176
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,040
Saintess must have misunderstood things.

177
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,000
First Royal Son was also just worried that the epidemic might spread to the citizens here.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,430
Hence, he's making intensive investigations.

179
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,300
As for these leaves of the winged tree,

180
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,820
the palace has planned to distribute them to the citizens and refugees.

181
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,730
I happen to have brought some today.

182
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,020
First Royal Son...

183
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,230
His Highness Crown Prince will be back in the city soon.

184
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,240
Lord Emperor also hopes that his citizens will be healthy.

185
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,450
Immediately practice good deeds for His Majesty.

186
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,040
Thank you, First Royal Son! Thank you, First Royal Son!

187
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,090
Good! Good!

188
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,670
- Thank you, saviors.
- You're welcome.

189
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,850
Quickly take these leaves home.

190
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,970
- Thank you, saviors.
- Go back now.

191
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,680
Saintess indeed has a heart of Bodhisattva.

192
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,530
You are so benevolent.

193
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,470
I thank you two on behalf of the citizens.

194
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,090
I already knew that the Princess of Plough would be coming to Megrez.

195
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,520
I've made the preparations. Why don't we—

196
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,710
No need to make such troubles.

197
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,230
I'll take my leave.

198
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,360
Where are we going?

199
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,190
I don't know.

200
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,740
[Wuba City Gather]

201
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,610
Isn't that the peculiar shop in Deep Water?

202
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,460
- That's right. This is also—
- Indeed.

203
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,750
Our Wuba City Gather is distributed all over Five Regions.

204
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,200
Our branches can be found everywhere.

205
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,270
We especially provide convenience for the citizens of different areas.

206
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,370
Good timing. We've just arrived in Megrez Imperial City today.

207
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,220
We happen to be looking for an inn to settle down.

208
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,490
Do you have any suggestion?

209
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,710
Wait a minute. Let me check.

210
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,620
[A miss carrying a Purple Phoenix Badge is a special guest from the royal family of Plough...]

211
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,960
Miss, are you a special guest from Plough?

212
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,770
Do you also know that?

213
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,550
I already knew that Miss would come.

214
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,800
A few days ago, someone came here and reserved the most unique courtyard in Megrez.

215
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,190
He said that it's for an important guest from Plough.

216
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,460
He even reserved a carriage.

217
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,490
- Who made the reservations?
- Who else?

218
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,290
You are First Royal Son's important guest.

219
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,960
Of course, it was he who made the reservations.

220
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,010
No need...

221
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,600
No... this...

222
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,280
This First Royal Son is something.

223
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,880
He really knows to set the helm according to the wind.

224
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,710
One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions.

225
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,730
- We mustn't accept such favors.
- Right.

226
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,130
But what should we do now?

227
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,920
He already bribed the whole street. How are we going to continue?

228
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,930
We will find a way.

229
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,560
Hateful doctor?

230
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,060
What? You lost them?!

231
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,460
She didn't stay in the hotels or inns that we'd arranged beforehand.

232
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,500
Useless. You are all useless!

233
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,520
Your Highness, what should we do now?

234
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,990
What did I tell you before?

235
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,340
I must be informed immediately once the Saintess Folian enters the city.

236
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,940
She's the second princess of Plough Nation.

237
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,960
The silver and gold mountains are all in their Plough.

238
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,310
If I'm able to get the support of Plough,

239
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,830
will I still fear not getting the Crown Prince position?

240
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,240
Look at these great things that you all have done.

241
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,480
She is already inside the city, but you all didn't even know.

242
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,730
Good!

243
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,220
I completely offended her now.

244
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,510
Useless! You all are useless!

245
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,310
Your Highness, I know now.

246
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,690
I'll go ask around for her whereabouts now, so it will be convenient for you to approach her.

247
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,690
Quickly go!

248
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,750
That chicken was not bad.

249
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,760
- Hateful doctor.
- Medical Sage Zong.

250
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,690
- Had enough wine and food?
- Yes.

251
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,440
Let's discuss the bill then.

252
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,850
12 jars of Single Joy wine, 40 liang each jar, at a total of 480 liang.

253
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,730
Four orders of deer ears in soy sauce and green jade cakes from Flower Filled Restaurant, a total of 120 liang.

254
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,870
No...

255
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,230
Also, 8 little plates of precious fruits with immortal dew—

256
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,920
Medical Sage Zong,

257
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,220
are you some unscrupulous businessman?

258
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,700
- Didn't we just eat some food?
- That's right.

259
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,840
- Don't we have a friendly relationship?
- Good friends.

260
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,970
That wasn't a normal kind of eating.

261
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,500
You—

262
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,700
Tell us how we should settle this then.

263
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,930
Anyway, we don't have any money, but we have our lives.

264
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,130
Let's do this then.

265
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,340
Sign a contract of selling yourself to me.

266
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,730
What? What are you trying to do?

267
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,450
What are you planning?

268
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,960
I'm just lacking some subordinates here in Megrez and will reluctantly take you two in.

269
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,070
You're telling me to become an underling?

270
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,420
If Medical Sage Zong is willing to take us in, we'll have a place to stay in.

271
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,190
- Let me think about it.
- Right.

272
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,810
Hey! I'm done thinking!

273
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,080
Isn't being an underling just doing labor?

274
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,220
It's fine.

275
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,920
We at least get to have free lodging and food, right?

276
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,260
There is meat for three meals, right?

277
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,670
- A room with a huge bed.
- Work for one day and rest for five days.

278
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,300
- That works.
- Passable, right?

279
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,660
- That works.
- No problem.

280
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,920
Go and get these medicines.

281
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,560
The last two medicines can only be found in Upper Yang Palace at the city's southern side.
(T/N: Yang- a positive force against yin.)

282
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,460
Remember, not one less.

283
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,760
Okay.

284
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,510

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,520
It looks like we can't enter this Upper Yang Palace through the main entrance.

287
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,290
How are we going to enter it then?

288
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,430
Just follow this prescription and gather the other medicines.

289
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,620
Leave this place to me.

290

No... I can't leave you to do this alone.

No way.

292
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,610
- No, it's too dangerous for you to go alone.
- I can do it. Just go.

293
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,810
Fine. Be careful. Don't get caught. Okay?

294
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,360
Be careful.

295
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,160
This tune... sounds so familiar.

Your Highness, Saintess Folian has entered the Imperial City.

It's just that presently, no one knows where she settled in.

298
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,640
Got it.

299
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,950
Don't let anyone disturb me.

300

Yes.

Let go!

How did you know that I've been thinking about you day and night?

308

I never stopped.

309

You are a liar.

- Where's my mystic spirit leaf?

Wait.

Do you have anything you want to say to me?

318

What do I have to say to you?

319
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,350
You speak no truth anyway.

320
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,410
I'm sure you also have no good intentions in being here, right?

321
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,590
I didn't tell you this, but I am the Crown Prince of Megrez.

322
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,740
You are the Crown Prince? You—

323
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,140
His aide. I'm Yuan Zhaoxu.

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,010
- You are the Crown Prince's aide?
- Yes.

325
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,400
You must be lying, right?

326
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,190
If it's true, then take me to see the Crown Prince.

327
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,720
Why?

328
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,670
In coming here to Megrez Imperial City, there were a lot of people on the way that're saying

329
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:52,520
the Crown Prince Wuji of Megrez excels in wisdom, is highly intelligent, and is matchless in the world.

330
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,200
How can there be such a person who really exists in this world?

331
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,340
There is.

332
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,530
What I did in Deep Water before was an order from the Crown Prince.

333
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,860
It shows that Crown Prince isn't some good person, either.

334
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,350
Let me tell you. Do not talk badly about the Crown Prince in Megrez

335
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,510
or you will have bad luck.

336
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,100
Okay already. Stop being angry with me.

337
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,310
As apology, I'll take you to a fun place.

338
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,990
Why don't you take me to the Royal Palace?

339
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,510
Why do you want to go there?

340
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,720
I can't tell you that.

341
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,150
Then be good and listen to me first.

342
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,620
Selling steaming bun.

343
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,700
What bad scheme are you brewing?

344
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,750
How did you feel when you saw me again?

345
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,570
If not because I can't beat you, I would have attacked you long time ago.

346
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,790
Fine then.

347
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,980
I surely won't fight back this time.

348
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,860
Liar, nothing you say is ever true.

349
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,130
I will never believe you again.

350
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,850
Why did you bring me here?

351
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,460
It must be because you're a frequent guest in this brothel.

352
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,480
Are you jealous?

353
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,560
You wish.

354
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,260
I've drunk a lot.

355
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,750
Am I also drinking?

356
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,250
Why did you steal my five-colored stone?

357
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,820
Isn't it to let you find me?

358
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,200
You're a great liar!

359
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,570
I won't talk to you anymore. Great liar...

360
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,400
- Liar.
- Hey...

361
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,060
Let me tell you. You are not allowed to...

362
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,300
leave again next time without saying anything.

363
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,230
Do you hear me?

364
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,990
I promise you.

365
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,070
- You liar!
- I—

366
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,830
Enough.

367
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,230
Prince.

368
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,200
Royal Uncle.

369
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,150
Enough.

370
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,880
Leave.

371
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,150
Yes.

372
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,480
Royal Uncle, Crown Prince left for so many years.

373
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,380
Emperor Father's health is also weak.

374
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,130
For most of the court affairs,

375
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,610
it's you and me who has handled them.

376
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,410
Now, we're being asked to just hand them to that guy.

377
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,280
Royal Uncle, are you able to put them down?

378
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,080
First Royal Son has achieved numerous military merits and has such illustrious prestige in the imperial court.

379
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:31,940
Not being happy with suddenly handing over your power is expected.

380
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,930
Am I not asking about your feelings, Royal Uncle?

381
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,530
I didn't catch what you said.

382
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,340
Okay.

383
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,600
I won't beat around the bush then.

384
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,560
Because a person suddenly appeared,

385
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,840
I'm now being asked to hand over the affairs that I've been managing for so many years.

386
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,130
Royal Uncle, I really couldn't accept it.

387
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,210
If there comes a day that this matter won't be ending well,

388
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,860
I hope that Royal Uncle will stand on my side.

389
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,370
I surely will not treat you unfairly.

390
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You shouldn't tell me about your complaints.

391
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,140
I don't meddle with state affairs anymore.

392
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,900
Even if you tell me, I will just treat it as if I never heard anything.

393
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:43,420
Royal Uncle, could it be that you've forgotten that matter in the hunting grounds back then?

394
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,850
Royal Uncle, forgive me for wearing my heart on my sleeve.

395
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:03,090
But you do know that Wuji has always disliked you.

396
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,920
If he became the emperor, do you think he'll be able to accommodate you?

397
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,960
Look. I didn't know that you were coming.

398
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,510
This... I didn't prepare any good tea.

399
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,200
It's really such poor service.

400
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,450
How about I return to my manor and get some good tea?

401
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,160
I can't let Prince Assist suffer, right?

402
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,090
Jeez, Royal Uncle, I won't trouble you now.

403
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,160
I'm done talking.

404
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,570
I'll take my leave.

405
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,790
The person who is unable to tolerate my existence isn't Wuji.

406
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,100
It's him.

407
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,980
Since His Highness Crown Prince didn't return to court as scheduled,

408
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,300
I fear that we must still let Prince Assist approve the matters for today.

409
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,700
I fear this... is inappropriate.

410
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,700
Everyone knows that when His Highness Prince Assist led his army to South Wilderness,

411
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,200
he already promised the whole army

412
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
that he would reward them based on their merits when they victoriously returned.

413
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,000
Now, the army has returned to the city for several days.

414
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,400
The military inspection officer has also submitted a request to rush it twice.

415
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,900
We kept delaying it until the Crown Prince returned, so he can personally make the appropriations.

416
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,200
We mustn't delay this matter anymore.

417
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,300
Be that as it may,

418
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,000
but the commanding officer for this expedition was His Highness Zhangsun Pingrong.

419
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,200
If we allow His Highness to personally sign the rewards,

420
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,800
won't that easily invite suspicion?

421
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,440
Defeating the enemy is a meritorious contribution and should be rewarded.

422
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,400
This is just proper and right.

423
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,600
How could that invite suspicions?

424
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,600
But if this matter continued to be delayed,

425
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,400
the more we won't be able to control other people's suspicious mouths.

426
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,380
My army bathed in blood on the battlefield.

427
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,600
They used their lives to exchange for a temporary halt from South Wilderness.

428
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,500
They deserve to have these rewards.

429
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:07,500
If Crown Prince is against it, let him talk to Lord Emperor.

430
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
- You've heard all of it?
- Yes.

431
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The whole city is looking for you,

432
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,820
while you are instead with a beautiful woman.

433
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,400
You didn't delay being romantic at all.

434
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,800
Emperor Father, so you have known everything.

435
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,400
I instead want to listen more to your explanation.

436
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,300
Emperor Father, you are wise.

437
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,000
You clearly knew that today was the day that the inner court would approve the funding for Pingrong's army;

438
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
a good day to win people's hearts.

439
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,600
But you instead deliberately moved away and let PIngrong be this good man.

440
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Why?

441
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,600
♪ We played together when we were young

442
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:38,000
♪ We talked merrily as much as we liked

443
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,500
♪ You made a pledge seriously

444
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,600
♪ I don't know why you broke your pledge to me

445
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,100
Is the song Prince Virtue is singing "Water Yu Tune?"

446
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,820
I didn't know that Empress was here.

447
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,800
I was disrespectful.

448
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,200
"Water Yu Tune" sings about a man gone to visit his childhood sweetheart in their declining years

449
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,000
and they reminisce about the days they were together in their childhood.

450
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,600
Singing an old tune like that by yourself,

451
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,600
it does make it gloomier.

452
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,270
Wuji is back.

453
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,800
I know.

454
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Pingrong is a petty person.

455
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,800
I fear that he can't accept others to steal the limelight from him.

456
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,000
But Wuji is after all my biological son.

457
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
If Prince Virtue cares, then try to teach him more.

458
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,900
Crown Prince is an especially gifted leader.

459
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,800
Him inheriting the throne is what everyone wishes.

460
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,060
I'm not that great.

461
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,400
I'm willing to render him my services.

462
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:18,720
I thank you on behalf of Wuji.

463
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,920
I still have things to do in my manor.

464
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,800
I'll take my leave now.

465
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,200
Prince Virtue, you're not in your declining years yet.

466
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,400
It's better to sing less of "Water Yu Tune."

467
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,900
Oldest brother made a meritorious deed by leading his army.

468
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,100
It's most suitable for him to be the one to reward the army.

469
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,800
Is it because you don't want to steal this job from him

470
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,200
or you're unwilling to get involved in this muddled water?

471
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:06,000
Or that you felt this army as being trusted aides that Pingrong trained himself,

472
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,200
so you're unwilling to use them in the future?

473
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,600
All are correct.

474
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,530
It's good that you have your own stand.

475
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,200
Tell me about the incidents in Deep Water.

476
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,400
Emperor Father asked me to weaken Deep Water with the least cost and the most covert method.

477
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,600
I'm sure that Emperor Father already knows that I used some tricks to become the King of Deep Water.

478
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,300
Now that a big war in Deep Water has just ended, their threatening strength has diminished,

479
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,600
they surely must rest for some time.

480
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,300
Good.

481
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,600
Very good.

482
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
You trained in the Firmament for ten years.

483
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,400
Now, without spending one soldier, you were able to weaken a vassal nation.

484
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,000
It's time to share the burden of governing the world with me.

485
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,300
Yes.

486
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,300
Your Majesty, Her Highness Empress especially set up a family dinner.

487
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,400
She's inviting Your Majesty and Crown Prince to go there.

488
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,200
Emperor Father, you think—

489
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,500
Crown Prince will soon be there.

490
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,900
I'm already old and my strength is diminishing.

491
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,700
I let the important ministers handle the important state affairs.

492
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:32,000
Among all, Pingrong and Prince Virtue also shared a few of the burdens.

493
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,600
Although you're the crown prince,

494
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,800
you don't have much foundation within the Imperial court.

495
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,400
Do you know that... regardless of which nation or empire...

496
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,300
the fight for royal power has always been a life-or-death struggle?

497
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,220
Child,

498
00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:00,180
you are still young. Always be vigilant.

499
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,600
Emperor Father, take care of your health.

500
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Just let me do the rest.

501
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,300
Go now.

502
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,900
Yes.

503
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,270
Doctor,

504
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:52,910
you're saying that this Yuan Zhaoxu has been with Crown Prince Wuji since he was little, right?

505
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,320
Yes.

506
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,600
- Then he... is 25 to 26 years old?
- Yes.

507
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,600
- Doctor.
- Yes.

508
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Will you die if you talk more?

509
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,800
Do you want to hear about Crown Prince Wuji or Yuan Zhaoxu?

510
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,400
Your Highness Crown Prince.

"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

512
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,000
♫ What do you know? ♫

513
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,800
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

514
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,780
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

515
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,000
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

516
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,600
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

517
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,400
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

518
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,500
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

519
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,000
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

520
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,000
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

521
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

522
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,200
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

523
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,600
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

524
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,700
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

525
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,800
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

526
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,010
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

527
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,400
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

528
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,600
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

529
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,400
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

530
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,200
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

531
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,400
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

532
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,700
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

533
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,600
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

534
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,500
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

535
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,200
♫ Have someone's company♫

536
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,000
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫
