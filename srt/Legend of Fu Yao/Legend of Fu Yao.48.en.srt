00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,360
~ Episode 48 ~

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,370
Tell me. Why are you here?

21
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,580
- You should know this.
- Do you want revenge?

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,010
Revenge? Why would I take revenge on you?

23
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,370
Do you still not know how I feel about you?

24
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,830
Since you are not thinking about revenge,

25
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,550
then please leave; the farther the better.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,520
If you don't leave, then I will.

27
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,150
- Older Brother Yue!
- Listen up.

28
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,700
I didn't kill you because the crimes of the parents should not be put on their children.

29
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,820
The one who deserves death is Qi Zhen but that doesn't mean I will go lightly on him,

30
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,840
nor does it mean I will accept you.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,400
But you saved me in Chill Palace Hall that day.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,570
Older Brother Yue, I know you care about me in your heart.

33
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,160
Before, we would fly a kite on the mountain at the back of our house.

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,340
When you didn't want me to follow you,

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,410
you would lie to me and say that you were going to review your homework.

36
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,620
When you couldn't stop me from crying anymore,

37
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,440
you would beg Mr. Qiu to make me a lot of sugar people.

38
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,690
I know you remember them all.

39
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,070
Older Brother Yue,

40
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,940
my father committed a mistake.

41
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,910
Rather than bearing a grudge against him, why don't you just let me make up for his mistakes?

42
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,570
I can't bear to let you live in revenge every day.

43
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,640
I want to do something for you.

44
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,180
♫ Jump and hide in this mundane world once ♫

45

♫ There is always no escape from fate ♫

46
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,710
♫ You're looking at my face ♫

47
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,540
♫ So I've removed the sound from a sea of people ♫

48
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,350
♫ Leave a kind of unruly heartbeat ♫

49
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,820
I've belittled you too much.

50
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,260
You confused Yun Hen and made him forget the revenge that he should be seeking.

51
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,340
Now... you want to confuse me, too.

52
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,500
To make me forget everything, and just let Qi Zhen do anything he wants with me. Is that it?

53
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,970
Old Brother Yue, it's not like that.

54
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,120
Leave.

55
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,780
♫ An isolated island ♫

56
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:21,840
♫ Changing mind and fluctuating only takes one second ♫

57
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,230
I'm not like that.

58
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,470
I'm not like that!

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,870
♫ Is the remedy for heart ♫

60
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,490
These are all of my treasures throughout my life.

61
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,980
They are all more valuable than the palace right here.

62
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,730
One look and you'll live two hours longer.

63
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,470
You are already lucky since you get to see these.

64
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,120
I used to see all kinds of treasures when I used to serve the Crown Prince,

65
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,610
but now that I've seen these treasures today, I feel what I saw before cannot even compare to your least valuable one.

66
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,020
My treasures are not only valuable, but they are also rare and authentic.

67
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,780
But these are not the only ones I have.

68
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,600
Your Majesty, I assume that there is a treasure here;

69
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
or else, why would it be empty?

70
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,470
You are right. Of course, this spot can't be empty.

71
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,650
I just had my eyes on a big treasure and it will arrive in a few days.

72
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,230
Big treasure?

73
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:49,180
So is it more valuable than the other ones here?

74
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,670
You can't compare it like that.

75
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,480
The treasures here inside Chant Frost Watchtower are each rare precious treasures in their own right.

76
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,730
Not one is better than the other.

77
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,760
Reporting!

78
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,300
Your Majesty, Prince Eternal is here.

79
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,480
Quickly let him in.

80
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,200
Yes.

81
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,940
His Majesty, since Prince Eternal has urgent matters to report,

82
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,190
I will take my leave.

83
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,350
No need to be so cautious.

84
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,130
- Royal Older Brother.
- Your Highness Prince Eternal.

85
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,970
How was it?

86
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,080
His Majesty, I saw there are more rare treasures over there.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,230
May I go have a look with your permission?

88
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,010
Go ahead. Go ahead.

89
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,740
Be a little careful.

90
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,150
Why are you cowering to say it?

91
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,480
I asked you to purchase a treasure. How did it go?

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,940
I couldn't get my hands on that treasure.

93
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,480
What?

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,320
We still lack some money.

95
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,720
Just get it from the inner court.

96
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,960
What? Did they not approve it?

97
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,500
Of course they will.

98
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,040
it is just that there might not be enough money in the nation's treasury.

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,390
There's no money in the nation's treasury?

100
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,950
The money we have collected last year and the year before is definitely enough.

101
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,310
But since we expanded the Gold of Heaven Fiend,

102
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,350
increased the defense of the Ice City Walls on the northern borders,

103
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,940
and we also spent some additional time in renovating the royal palace,

104
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,740
adding all these up, the nation's treasury has long been depleted.

105
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,930
We even used up some urgent funds.

106
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,820
If we still have too many expenditures, I fear that we might—

107
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,590
I don't want to hear these depressing words!

108
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,710
Are you guys just waiting around when the nation's treasury has no money?

109
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,440
- We just wait until next year—
- Next year? I can't wait until next year.

110
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,730
I remember that the field taxes in Heaven Fiend are divided into north and south.

111
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,060
The north is 25:1, while in the south, it's 15:1.

112
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,350
Am I right?

113
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,130
Change it.

114
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,940
Starting today, the north is 15:1, the south is 10:1.

115
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,450
What?

116
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,420
The northern territories experiences extremely cold weather and sunlight is too short.

117
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,120
If we set such huge field taxes, they won't be able to afford it!

118
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,360
The south has usually favored trading than agriculture. 10:1 tax is too heavy for them.

119
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
I've already expressed it very clearly.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,330
As for the details on how to implement it, that's not my problem.

121
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,630
Go discuss it with the inner court.

122
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,260
Whoever is unable to do it well...

123
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,870
- I'll punish him.
- But—

124
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,730
There's another way.

125
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,190
Your Majesty, I think

126
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,660
the citizens don't have that much money to begin with.

127
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,530
They plant some crops just to make a living to feed their families.

128
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,000
If we still extort money from them,

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,350
I fear it will incite public discontent.

130
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,050
By then, we must spend more money to pacify them.

131
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,540
I feel that... why don't we just arrest some corrupt officials?

132
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,340
We will surely obtain some money and it will also raise His Majesty's reputation by doing so.

133
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,150
Since commander has just been appointed,

134
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,370
you naturally don't understand yet internal government connections and affairs.

135
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,340
You said it too simply.

136
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,200
Just randomly catching people will surely involve a relative and bring endless troubles.

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,700
I don't care how you do it

138
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,800
whether it's increasing the taxes or arresting people.

139
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,080
What I want is gold in our nation's treasury.

140
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,600
Look. You all keep telling me these depressing words.

141
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,460
Not one is pleasing to my ears.

142
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,610
Good thing there's a new officer here in the palace that didn't get infected with that stinky habit of yours.

143
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,450
Look, so clean and pleasing to the eye.

144
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,990
I then feel a bit more relaxed.

145
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,150
Commander!

146
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,940
Your Highness Prince Eternal,

147
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,750
Commander is currently His Majesty's most favorite person.

148
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,050
No need to be that courteous.

149
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,320
Prince Eternal, you're being too polite.

150
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,460
Do you need anything from me?

151
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,280
It's not really something important.

152
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,510
I just feel that we seemed to have met while in Megrez Imperial City.

153
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,810
When I was still in Megrez Imperial City,

154
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,580
I was always by Crown Prince Wuji's side.

155
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,560
It's not strange for you to have seen me.

156
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,320
It's just that I was busy with official affairs then.

157
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,910
Hence, I didn't notice Prince Eternal.

158
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,780
I actually remember a person that looked the same as you.

159
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,710
It's just that she was a girl.

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,810
Girl?

161
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,960
Does Prince Heng mean that I'm too effeminate

162
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,750
and unable to bear the responsibility of a commander?

163
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,220
I dare not...

164
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,200
I just want to clarify this matter;

165
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,870
hence, I especially came to ask you about it.

166
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,550
No need for that.

167
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,930
Maybe there are indeed such coincidences in this world.

168
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,270
Prince Eternal, you have gotten it wrong.

169
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,530
When I see His Highness Crown Prince Wuji next time, I can ask him on your behalf.

170
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,330
Thank you then, Mister Jiang.

171
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,910
I take my leave.

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,400
If we continue like this, someone might die.

173
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,600
We've been traveling nonstop for several days, braving the wind and dew.

174
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,180
There are a few households here.

175
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,700
Let's go in and eat some meat.

176
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,600
Have some good rest.

177
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,800
We're able to endure it, but Yalan Zhu's body can't anymore.

178
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,200
But General, it's easy to get exposed like this.

179
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,070
I don't care anymore.

180
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,300
Resting is more important.

181
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,200
Here. Everyone, have some rice.

182
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Excuse me. The cured meat is here.

183
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
Come. Eat. Here, drink some wine.

184
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,300
The cured meat is here.

185
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
I heard that you haven't eaten well for a few days.

186
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
My wife especially cooked some cured meat.

187
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,720
- Ji Yu.
- Generals, please try it.

188
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,700
It's very delicious.

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,180
Mister, we didn't bring much money with us.

190
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,600
You must accept this.

191
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,900
- You mustn't...
- Please accept it.

192
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,300
You mustn't do this. Anyone who arrives is a guest.

193
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,700
We'll serve you whatever we have, as long as General doesn't mind it.

194
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,370
Our place might be poor, but we have good values.

195
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,900
If I take your money and it gets out,

196
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,000
my co-villagers will surely laugh at me.

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,900
Just eat them while they're hot.

198
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,540
Brothers, eat more!

199
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,400
We have enough for everyone!

200
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,300
Thank you, Mister.

201
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,700
Commander,

202
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,800
this house was ordered to be built by a tea merchant from Lingdong.

203
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,540
He used the best materials and hired the best craftsmen.

204
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,200
Talking about solely earning the favor of His Majesty,

205
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,600
Commander, you are the first one in the past ten years.

206
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,700
His Majesty ordered that we must arrange a residence for you.

207
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,900
He especially ordered that the location must be good, well-ventilated and spacious,

208
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,600
that you are able to comfortably live in it.

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,900
I will remember the good graces of the royal court.

210
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Hope Eunuch can put in more good words about me from now on.

211
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Then, thank you for your reward.

212
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Going back to it, Commander has earned the great favor of His Majesty.

213
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,700
You'll surely enjoy rapid success in your career very soon.

214
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,000
I still have to rely on you to promote me more in the future.

215
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,500
Come out.

216
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,520
Commander now is the most favorite person of Zhan Nancheng.

217
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,060
You're always by the king's side.

218
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
It's getting harder to get a chance to see you.

219
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,200
But this secretly meeting by candlelight and thin silk curtains in your room

220
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,700
is quite interesting, too.

221
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,710
Why didn't you just hide under the bed?

222
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,830
I feel that is more suitable.

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,600
Really?

224
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,670
Why don't we do it together?

225
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,530
You—

226
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,500
Let me tell you this.

227
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,700
Today, Zhan Beiheng saw me.

228
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,100
I feel that he might foil our plan.

229
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,200
Zhan Beiheng indeed has seen you.

230
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,900
But if he's smart, he should just keep it to himself.

231
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,900
It looks like that Your Highness Crown Prince has made plans.

232
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,500
Presently, this seemingly dangerous situation is our best chance.

233
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I've once said that Zhan Nancheng is a petty person and very suspicious.

234
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,600
He thinks that everyone wants to harm him.

235
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,800
But this Zhan Beiheng kept staying by his side.

236
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,400
I heard from Zhuzhu before that

237
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,600
Zhan Nancheng is very afraid of someone usurping his throne,

238
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,200
so he has killed most of his brothers.

239
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,800
This Zhan Beiheng being able to stand by his side must be a very cautious person.

240
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,800
These past years, the state affairs of the royal court of Heaven Fiend was all being managed by Zhan Beiheng.

241
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Being able to stay in such a high position and remain safe,

242
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,200
this Prince Eternal is similarly hard to deal with like Zhan Nancheng.

243
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,000
But this time, he is already most likely on the edge of his seat.

244
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Fifth Older Brother, do you have something on your mind?

245
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
None.

246
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,800
A person's heart has a definite size.

247
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,600
After hiding too many things in it, it surely will feel tired.

248
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,800
Hence, you should release some of these things out every once in a while.

249
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,000
This way, you will feel more relaxed, too.

250
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,700
You won't keep tossing and turning, unable to sleep, either.

251
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,900
You're overthinking.

252
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,200
Before, when I still could see,

253
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,500
I always felt that I was unable to understand a lot of things and people in this world.

254
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,400
It's actually better now.

255
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,600
There's just darkness in front of me, but I actually am able to see more clearly.

256
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,000
Everything now just goes past these eyes and gets imprinted in my brain.

257
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,200
Like wind and fog, I can see them very clearly.

258
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,110
But on this trip, I can also see how sad you are.

259
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,800
Just like... a dark night where the sun never rises.

260
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,600
The more I approach you, the sadder you become.

261
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,200
You can really see it very clearly.

262
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
But I can't see what's making you sad.

263
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,200
Is it the danger up ahead?

264
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I don't care how dangerous it is,

265
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,900
but to bring trouble to everyone because of me.

266
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,400
We all rose from military ranks.

267
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,300
It's just normal to go out and battle.

268
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,200
But I never liked fighting.

269
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Because once you start fighting, there will be people dying.

270
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,700
Now, just to go against my oldest brother,

271
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,700
Heaven Fiend will suffer the flames of war again.

272
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,000
Just for my selfish reasons,

273
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,800
I have to exchange the lives of so many people.

274
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:01,200
I can't bear to, but I can't just sit and wait for death

275
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,990
and watch Zhan Nancheng kill those innocent people.

276
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,100
When the north and south tribes of Qiongye went to war, my father was also reluctant to fight.

277
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,000
He then led our tribesmen into the mountains to hide.

278
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,200
He told me then

279
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,100
that doing that is to preserve the lives of more people.

280
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,300
But a lot of people then were saying that he didn't dare to send out an army,

281
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,700
that he was a coward behind his back.

282
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,000
But my father never cared about what others said.

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,200
He told me that a person should be himself.

284
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,500
You must have your own soul and persistence.

285
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,800
As long as you're conscience is clear, then you can stand upright and be dauntless.

286
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,800
Fifth Older Brother, you have your own choice and circumstances.

287
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,000
Just for a grand undertaking, it can't be helped for a lot of people to be sacrificed,

288
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,900
but there will never be anyone who will die in vain.

289
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,700
Isn't that so?

290
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,400
Since that's the case, why don't we use this opportunity to eliminate Zhan Beiheng?

291
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,570
That's right.

292
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,300
For a person like Zhan Nancheng,

293
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,200
as long as you place a seed of doubt in his heart, it surely will bloom and bear fruit.

294
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,680
Indeed. It was he who delivered himself to us.

295
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,600
He can't blame us.

296
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,040
What are you worried about?

297
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,680
Huh?

298
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,630
You can't be worried about me, right?

299
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,560
I'm already adept with the ability to win Zhan Nancheng's favor since I was still in Mt. Mystic Soul.

300
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,360
There is no need to worry.

301
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,510
With me by your side, there is indeed nothing much to worry about.

302
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm just thinking about Zhan Beiye's matter.

303
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,500
But in this journey, he still will face a lot of difficulties.

304
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,600
I don't know if he'll be able to endure them.

305
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,800
He indeed will meet a lot of difficulties,

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,800
but I don't think he'll be at a loss at what to do.

307
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,900
What I'm worried about is if he's unable to get past that obstacle in his heart.

308
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,610
Zhan Beiye is kind by nature to start with.

309
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,070
He indeed isn't suitable to bear scheming and manipulative matters.

310
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,030
He has no choice.

311
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,200
If he were just a general, he would surely defeat all his nation's enemies and be remembered for a lifetime.

312
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
But he was born into the royal family.

313
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,200
No matter what your nature is or if you're willing or not,

314
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,890
there are certain personal problems that only you can resolve.

315
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,420
I don't know whether or not I should rebel.

316
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,670
Nor do I know if these matters that will affect other people

317
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,400
can be considered great righteousness to me.

318
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,680
You don't need to think clearly about and understand everything.

319
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,790
As long as you believe it is right,

320
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,690
there definitely won't be a mistake.

321
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,860
Fifth Older Brother, thank you.

322
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,630
I really thank you.

323
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:23,030
Thank you for saying so much to me today.

324
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,360
I'm really happy and fulfilled.

325
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:35,970
If you could say this much to me from now on,

326
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,930
how great would that be?

327
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,410
Quickly! Over here! Water!

328
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,530
Come, quickly!

329
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,090
You wait here. Don't go out.

330
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,400
My grains. Those were all my grains.

331
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,050
They're gone just like that.

332
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,150
Villagers, we meet again.

333
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,950
Official, please just leave.

334
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,100
We have explained that the mountain has only those few acres.

335
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,670
The whole village is depending on them to eat.

336
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,250
We can't sell them to you.

337
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,790
That's right. We can't sell them.

338
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,350
We did not come here to buy land this time.

339
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,510
What? This—

340
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,580
A few days ago, we came with money to buy land.

341
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,490
You refused.

342
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:04,350
But the mulberry wood that His Majesty wants can only be found here.

343
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,770
You tell me. If we can't complete our tasks,

344
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,570
what good result can you get from that?

345
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,240
But we must eat.

346
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,250
It's such a large fire.

347
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,700
Someone must have intentionally done it.

348
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,670
Unruly citizens committing arson, what punishment must he be given?

349
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,420
We are here to put out the fire!

350
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,680
Unreasonable excuses.

351
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,550
Men, these unruly citizens set fire on the mountain and have committed a grave crime.

352
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,610
- Arrest them!
- Official, please have mercy!

353
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,650
An oppressive tyrant.

354
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,990
Take Yalan Zhu.

355
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,020
Quickly leave.

356
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,160
Prince Fierce.

357
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,670
General, once we cross that depression in front, we'll be in the Great Ice Land.

358
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,050
General, you leave first. I'll lead some men to kill them!

359
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,240
Let's go together.

360
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,100
How come it's like this?

361
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,490
Your Highness, there is no road ahead.

362
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,660
There's just a few of you.

363
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,440
It's better that you surrender now.

364
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,950
Protect Yalan Zhu.

365
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,260
Don't worry.

366
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,510
Fifth Older Brother!

367
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,760
Why?

368
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,010
Why did you come protect me like this?

369
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,130
I won't let you be in danger,

370
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,970
and I won't let you get hurt.

371
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:21,590
Promise me that you won't do this again.

372
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,460
I must be the one to protect you from now on.

373
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,990
Promise me.

374
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,830
Okay.

375
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,150
Your Majesty!

376
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,040
Your Majesty, the Ice Land Tiger has appeared.

377
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,010
You can go hunting.

378
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,810
Good.

379
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,180
Listen well.

380
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,840
The Ice Land Tiger is my prey.

381
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,240
No one can steal it from me.

382
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,020
I've never seen a real Ice Land Tiger.

383
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,000
Thanks to Your Majesty, I'm able to see one now.

384
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,630
I heard that if you get the chance to catch a real Ice Land Tiger,

385
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,200
it's an auspicious sign given by the heavens.

386
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,620
Of course.

387
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,700
This Ice Land Tiger is very rare.

388
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,860
That fur is worth a lot.

389
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,980
Turning it into an overcoat is a lot warmer than wearing numerous cotton-padded clothes.

390
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,420
Your Majesty, the Ice Land Tiger!

391
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,990
Let's go and hunt the Ice Land Tiger!

392
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,370
Charge!

393
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,400
Your Majesty!

394
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,740
We're here for him.

395
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,770
We don't intend to harm anyone else.

396
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,420
Move aside and we'll spare your life!

397
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,340
Don't kill me. I'm open to any deal.

398
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,150
I'm the commander of the king's bodyguards.

399
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,630
If you want to kill him,

400
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,080
get my permission first.

401
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,080
Your Majesty!

402
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,430
Withdraw!

403
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,670
Favored subject, you're hurt.

404
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,960
This is just a minor wound.

405
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,360
It won't be a hindrance.

406
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,410
Your Majesty, are you all right?

407
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,520
I'm fine.

408
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,940
Your Highness.

409
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,560
Get up and talk.

410
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,690
We've completed our mission.

411
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,750
How is Fuyao?

412
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,390
Your Highness, don't worry. We just left some superficial wounds between Shaohai and Tongli acupoints on Ms. Fuyao's left arm.

413
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,670
It won't be a harm.

414
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:16,000
Also, we've received news just earlier that the Heaven Fiend King has decreed to confer Miss Fuyao as Heaven Fiend Generalissimo Black Tortoise.

415
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,890
She's allowed to move around and serve by the king's side.

416
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,990
Okay. Protect her well, for sure.

417
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,680
Yes.

418
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,170
Commander, this Ice Honey of Heaven Fiend is a rare object.

419
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,300
Even for our king, only a small box gets delivered in the palace every year.

420
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,530
His Majesty was afraid that you'll find this medicine bitter so he asked me to put some ice honey in it.

421
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,520
Hurry.

422
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,630
I'm serving Official your medicine.

423
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,440
I won't drink it anymore.

424
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,640
I never loved drinking medicine since I was little.

425
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,860
You mustn't.

426
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,440
If you don't drink your medicine, how can your wound heal?

427
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,600
Let me just die then.

428
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
How can I bear that?

429
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,000
- Your Majesty!
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

430
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,220
You have a wound.

431
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,270
No need to kneel down.

432
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,550
Come.

433
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,180
Leave now.

434
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,610
My heart aches for your wound.

435
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,900
Come. I'll personally feed you.

436
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,650
Your Majesty...

437
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,920
It's my duty to serve you.

438
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,080
Favored subject, just drink it.

439
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,130
Once you drink the medicine, your wound will heal.

440
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,690
Your Majesty, there was never anyone who treated me like this.

441
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,770
How can I bear to accept such treatment?

442
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,600
If not because you risked your life today to save me, I fear that I would have been in a grave state now.

443
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,240
Those useless people!

444
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,630
Everyone seeks favor in front of me every day.

445
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,610
But when I'm in danger, I don't know where they all have gone to.

446
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:48,470
I finally understood who is sincere and who is just faking it.

447
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,000
This time, you achieved merit for saving my life.

448
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,530
If you want any reward, just say it.

449
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,920
Your Majesty, you already conferred me the title of Generalissimo Black Tortoise.

450
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,870
I'm already content.

451
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,370
It's just a an empty title.

452
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,520
I can casually give you 7 to 8 general titles,

453
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,820
but these don't count as a heavy reward.

454
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,630
Think about it. What else do you like?

455
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,620
I...

456
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:21,700
I indeed have something that I like, but—

457
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,990
Just say it.

458
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,370
Your Majesty, I have been training in martial arts since I was little.

459
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,450
I only want to loyally serve the government.

460
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,380
While on the horse, I want to defeat all the state's enemies.

461
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,150
While off the horse, I want to do my utmost duty for the government.

462
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,320
Now, Your Majesty has hired me to be a part of the Gold of Heaven Fiend.

463
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,020
It's a blessing that I've cultivated for several reincarnations.

464
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,830
It's just that even though this general position only by name is comfortable,

465
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,930
I keep feeling that I'm disappointing this armor of mine.

466
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:54,970
Hence, if Your Majesty thinks highly of me,

467
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,220
I want the power to command the Gold of Heaven Fiend

468
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,020
so I can serve you with my utmost best.

469
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:09,230
You saved me, so you want the military power to command Gold of Heaven Fiend?

470
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,300
I just want to accomplish merits on your behalf.

471
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,090
Is that true?

472
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,160
Your Majesty, don't you trust me?

473
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,620
Of course, you are not to be trusted.

474
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,600
Your Highness Prince Eternal.

475
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,710
Royal Older Brother,

476
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,530
I already told you.

477
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,360
This person is very suspicious.

478
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,610
Look. He indeed wasn't able to hide his fox tail.

479
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,770
Prince Eternal, what do you mean?

480
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,520
You are not some secret guard of the Crown Prince.

481
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,320
You are not here to seek for some official position, either.

482
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,000
You are a spy that Zhangsun Wuji sent.

483
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,600
Your Majesty, Prince Eternal is making slanderous accusations against me.

484
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,000
Royal Younger Brother, you have always been cautious in your actions and speech.

485
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,660
To say such things, do you have any evidence?

486
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,720
Royal Older Brother is wise.

487
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,910
This is a letter that the messenger of Prince Assist has just sent.

488
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,210
Please read it.

489
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,320
A few months ago, I was ordered by you to go to the Imperial City.

490
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,460
It was initially just a secret meeting between the royal clans of the nations within the Five Regions.

491
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,320
Who would have thought that I would witness a farce between a true and fake Plough Princess?

492
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,010
Zhangsun Pingrong wrote this?

493
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,740
Indeed.

494
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,790
The first time I saw this commander, I just felt that she looked familiar.

495
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,170
Only until that day in Chant Frost Watchtower that I suddenly realized

496
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,220
that I've seen her before in Megrez Imperial City.

497
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,930
You are not Jiang Feng.

498
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,970
You are a wanted criminal of the Imperial City,

499
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,800
Fuyao, am I right?

500
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,330
Your Highness Prince Eternal, you really made such painstaking effort.

501
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,810
You even fabricated a letter from Prince Assist.

502
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,560
I'm just a nameless person.

503
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,630
Why must you give me so much attention?

504
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,380
What he said was all true?

505
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,710
Of course not.

506
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,130
It's already at this time, why try so hard to still struggle?

507
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,360
Just admit it now.

508
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,880
Maybe Royal Older Brother will still spare your life.

509
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,810
Prince Eternal, if you want to kill me, why must you resort to this?

510
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,140
For the crime of lying to the king, I won't be the only one who will want you executed.

511
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,100
Prince Eternal, you racked your brains and kept laying schemes on me,

512
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,510
wasn't it all just for those military weapons?

513
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,960
Now, do you want to kill me to silence me?

514
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,820
What nonsense are you saying? What weapons?

515
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,540
I don't understand what you're saying.

516
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,010
Oh? What do you mean?

517
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:07,950
Your Majesty, in terms of committing a mistake, I indeed committed one.

518
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,970
My mistake was knowing too much and stepping on Prince Eternal's painful secret.

519
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,570
You!

520
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,660
Continue saying it.

521
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,050
His Highness Prince Eternal kept saying that he once saw me.

522
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,830
That is indeed true.

523
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,070
Before, I had always been by Crown Prince Wuji's side.

524
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:36,320
Including that night, when Prince Eternal came to meet Crown Prince, I was also by his side.

525
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,600
Bullshit! Full of lies!

526
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,910
When did I privately meet with Crown Prince?

527
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,090
Why are you getting agitated?

528
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,530
Don't I know to discern if it's true or fake?

529
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,070
Royal Older Brother, I never left the royal palace by even a step during those days that I was in Megrez.

530
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,760
The more I didn't privately meet with anyone.

531
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,830
All these are slanders!

532
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,460
Younger Brother Heng, don't get mad.

533
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,790
Let him finish first.

534
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,520
That night, Prince Eternal suddenly visited.

535
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,140
Crown Prince didn't know why he came, so he was very surprised.

536
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,630
It was that time that Prince Eternal expressed his loyalty towards Crown Prince.

537
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,970
He said he was willing to provide information to Upper Yang Palace in exchange for just one request.

538
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,830
You... You are lying!

539
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,980
Younger Brother Heng, if you're upright, there's no need to fear if your shadow is bent.

540
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,560
Why are you getting agitated?

541
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,750
That time, Prince Eternal...

542
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,110
What Prince Eternal wanted that time was the royal throne of Heaven Fiend.

543
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,990
Bullshit!

544
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,860
I'm innocent.

545
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,510
Younger Brother Heng has served me for so many years.

546
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,250
He is a trusted aide of my government.

547
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:50,430
To say that he is disloyal, how can I easily believe it just based on your words?

548
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,260
Do you know what crime it is to slander a member of the royal family?

549
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,160
Whether it's just slander, you will know in the future.

550
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,940
If my memory serves me right, not long ago, did Prince Eternal marry a Madam Jiu?

551
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,860
Yes. I know that.

552
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,330
This Madam Jiu was originally from a brothel.

553
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:16,190
Because she was able to earn Prince Eternal's love, hence, she was able to leave that troublesome place.

554
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,470
It's just that coincidentally, the day that he married this Madam Jiu,

555
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:25,690
was just one day before Crown Prince Wuji arrived.

556
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,460
How could there be such a coincidence in this world?

557
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,400
That's right.

558
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,480
The person who was passing the information was this Madam Jiu.

559
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,300
She was just a singer.

560
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,400
She has never met any crown prince.

561
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,950
I found her very beautiful, that's why I married her.

562
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,430
How could she be implicated with a crime like that?

563
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,480
It's easy to clear this matter.

564
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,620
Just call that Madam Jiu of yours here and interrogate her.

565
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:55,730
Your Majesty, from what I know, this Madam Jiu suddenly died three days ago in Prince Eternal's Manor.

566
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,970
Her cause of death is very strange.

567
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:01,570
My guess is that it must be because she knew too much and got silenced.

568
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,500
You're full of lies! I killed her. I killed her because...

569
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,400
because she was having an affair with my servant.

570
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,550
I couldn't endure it so I had her beaten to death.

571
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,100
Now, the person has died.

572
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,340
A dead person can't be a witness.

573
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,510
Of course, Prince Eternal can say whatever you like.

574
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,600
Royal Older Brother, everything I said was true.

575
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,550
If I said any lie, I'll have a tragic death.

576
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,000
May Royal Older Brother give me justice.

577
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,520
But in this matter, there are indeed no more witnesses.

578
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,740
It's indeed hard for me to resolve it.

579
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:39,080
But before this Madam Jiu died, she left some very important evidence.

580
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,640
Say it.

581
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,990
Madam Jiu once revealed to Crown Prince

582
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:51,330
that Prince Eternal had been hiring soldiers these past years using the money of the nation's treasury.

583
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:56,400
Before, Prince Eternal expressed to Your Majesty that the nation's treasury was in deficit.

584
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,660
Your Majesty even ordered for him to investigate some corrupt officials.

585
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,350
That was already some time ago.

586
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,830
Your Majesty, have you seen any money?

587
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:12,080
Royal Older Brother, I indeed went to search those people, but I never found any gold or silver.

588
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,240
They claim that bandits infiltrated their house and took away all valuable objects—

589
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,510
Bandits have infiltrated?

590
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,340
How could such a coincidence happen?

591
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,300
Happening before the search, these bandits are really well-informed.

592
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,720
Your Majesty, it must be just a coincidence.

593
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,740
Royal Older Brother, I'm innocent!

594
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,400
Whether you're innocent or not, we can just go to your manor and look.
