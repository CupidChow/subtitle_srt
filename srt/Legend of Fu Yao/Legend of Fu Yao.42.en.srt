00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,300
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,530
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,550
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,900
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,060
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,020
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,550
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,070
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,770
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,910
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,080
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,680
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,330
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,440
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:21,610
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,860
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,970
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,270
~ Episode 42 ~

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,780
His Highness has great foresight and knew that you two would surely come to assassinate him.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,160
He set up a trap like this.

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,150
Sorry to disappoint you two.

25
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,410
Where on earth is Zhangsun Pingrong?

26
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,480
It's fine to just tell you about it.

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,630
The fifteenth of next month is the birthday of the King of Heaven Fiend.

28
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,300
He is in Rock City!

29
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,780
Guys, if you want to escape, I'm afraid that it won't be that easy.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,110
But too bad,

31
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,970
a distinguished Prince of Heaven Fiend gave up on glory and splendor

32
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,720
and instead chose to be with a wanted female criminal of Five Regions.

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,790
But His Highness has said

34
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,530
to let Heaven Fiend arrest their own prince.

35
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,330
We'll just keep watch here and mustn't harm Prince Fierce.

36
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,970
Be careful of the sedative.

37
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,030
- Hurry and go.
-  Everyone be careful!

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,740
Chase after them! Chase!

39
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,460
A few days ago, Lord Emperor from the Imperial City sent a decree

40
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,090
asking our royal court why we are pursuing Prince Fierce.

41
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,220
He also said that if we have no evidence of Prince Fierce colluding with Qi Zhen,

42
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,150
it can only count as suspicion.

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,160
Lord Emperor said that he'll give Prince Fierce justice.

44
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,040
What Lord Emperor said is right.

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,220
Zhan Beiye indeed didn't collude with Qi Zhen.

46
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,450
We only fabricated everything to frame him, didn't we?

47
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,270
Then... are we really going to announce in the whole Heaven Fiend that Prince Fierce is innocent?!

48
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,230
No, not the whole Heaven Fiend.

49
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,960
It's the whole Five Regions.

50
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,550
Are we going to call back the Gold of Heaven Fiend that we sent out then?

51
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you crazy?

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,140
The Gold of Heaven Fiend set out to capture Zhan Beiye.

53
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,800
How could you call them back?

54
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,230
Having no evidence about the collusion between Prince Fierce and the traitor of Deep Water, just drop it then.

55
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,210
After all, he is my biological brother.

56
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,590
How could I bear to really punish him?

57
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,580
But since Zhan Beiye suddenly got himself a Dark Storm Cavalry,

58
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,050
and even won a battle in Yao City,

59
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,660
privately owning an army is a crime punishable by beheading.

60
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,090
For this matter, I cannot tolerate it.

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,410
If this continues then we won't be able to run far.

62
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,530
- Leave first. I'll cover you.
- If we're escaping, we'll escape together.

63
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,050
Kill!

64
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,470
Dark Storm Cavalry.

65
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,000
Dark Storm Cavalry have arrived.

66
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,540
The past Dark Storm Cavalry was one of the most elite squads of our army.

67
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,830
Even if their unit got dissolved and the members got dispersed,

68
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,140
for Zhan Beiye to dare to use their unit's name,

69
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,950
he then must have found the descendants of these covertly hiding rebels.

70
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,530
That is great trouble.

71
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,130
Although Your Majesty's Gold of Heaven Fiend are valiant,

72
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,390
but, I'm still worried.

73
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,050
What did you say you were worried about?

74
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,920
I was worried that Your Majesty's Gold of Heaven Fiend won't be able to resist the Dark Storm Cavalry.

75
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,460
It's fine if they can't defeat them.

76
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,690
Isn't it so long since we saw our fifth younger brother?

77
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,310
I miss him a lot.

78
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,600
But he isn't willing to come back to visit me.

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,480
Hence, I could only think of a way to make him return to Rock City.

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,950
I came late. I caused General to experience shock.

81
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,850
Okay.

82
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,740
How come the Gold of Heaven Fiend are pursuing me now?

83
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,380
What does Zhan Nancheng want?

84
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,890
General, I fear that you must rush back to Rock City.

85
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,700
What has happened?

86
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,240
She's our own people. Say it.

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,150
I got news from Rock City

88
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,970
that Prince Fierce has privately set up an army and has intentions to rebel.

89
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,390
Within Rock City, General's old men and friends all got implicated.

90
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,160
Those in high positions were imprisoned.

91
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,500
For those of ordinary position,

92
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,540
some of them have been directly executed.

93
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,050
General, there's something even more important.

94
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,640
Say it.

95
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,310
Imperial Concubine Jing has been placed under house arrest.

96
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,360
The King said that if he didn't see you within 15 days,

97
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,350
he would then have Imperial Concubine Jing be buried with the past emperor.

98
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,140
Zhan Beiye! Zhan Beiye.

99
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,680
General.

100
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,310
Older Sis Fuyao.

101
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,690
There are too many of them.

102
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,030
It won't work if we continue like this.

103
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,840
Prince Zhan, lend me some people so I can distract the pursuing army.

104
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,290
Thanks.

105
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,030
You all take care.

106
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,820
- Mr. Zong.
- It's too easy for us to be exposed in this place.

107
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,940
Let's lose them first.

108
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,590
Drink some water.

109
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,000
Have you come up with an escape route?

110
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,650
Since the age of seven, my maternal grandfather taught me to read the topography of Heaven Fiend.

111
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:23,050
I know the position of every mountain and river here very clearly.

112
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,310
There are two paths now.

113
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,540
One path is to take a detour around Mt. Great Vast.

114
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,760
The other path is to cross the mountains and directly leads to Rock City.

115
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,030
Of course, we should take the second path.

116
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,750
I'll let Ji Yu take some people to protect you and the others to take the first path.

117
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,300
What about you?

118
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,540
Sorry, Fuyao.

119
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,160
I should be protecting you but my Consort Mother is in danger right now.

120
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,070
I must rush to Rock City as soon as possible which is why I can't come with you all.

121
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,350
I will go from another route.

122
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,570
The route you have picked is very dangerous, is it not?

123
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,030
Zhan Beiye, we've gone through so many things together.

124
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,800
How can I let you face the danger alone?

125
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,190
Fuyao!

126
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,300
Fifth Older Brother, I know that you don't want us to get endangered because of you,

127
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,220
but we definitely won't abandon you.

128
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,490
That's right. There's also me.

129
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,000
Let our brothers return to Geya and preserve their strength.

130
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,730
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

131
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,330
- Are you afraid?
- Who's afraid?

132
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,520
You don't know but this isn't your usual woods.

133
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,920
How do you know?

134
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,410
Xiaoqi is from the Camouflage Dragon Clan.

135
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,730
He must be familiar with this jungle.

136
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,170
Our Camouflage Dragon Clan has this tradition.

137
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,880
Males who have turned twelve must come to Mt.Great Vast.

138
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,490
Those who comes back alive will be seen as an adult

139
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,160
and not seen as a joke.

140
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,520
- Twelve years old?
- Yes.

141
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,150
Weren't you already at Mt. Mystic Soul?

142
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,090
When I was six years old, my grandpa brought me here once.

143
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,930
Your grandpa will protect you from the Heavens.

144
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,590
Do you remember the route when you came here last time?

145
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,890
That time, Grandfather was the one that led the path and found the exit.

146
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,560
Right now—

147
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,820
Be careful.

148
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,080
Everyone, be careful! Follow closely.

149
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,790
Long time no see, General Gu Lingfeng.

150
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,500
By the King's decree,

151
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,300
capture the treacherous Zhan Beiye!

152
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,000
Disperse!

153
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Let's go.

154
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,800
Retreat!

155
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,600
Older Sis Fuyao, come here!

156
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
Let's go.

157
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
After them!

158
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,300
Yalan Zhu!

159
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,010
Don't be afraid.

160
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,000
I won't let go.

161
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,900
Zhan Beiye,

162
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,800
your death day has come!

163
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
General!

164
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,700
Yalan Zhu.

165
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,800
Yalan Zhu.

166
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,530
Do not worry.

167
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,400
It's safe now.

168
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,100
Don't worry.

169
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,600
Zhan Beiye!

170
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,800
- Zhan Beiye!
- General Zhan!

171
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,200
- Zhuzhu.
- Zhuzhu.

172
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,400
How is Zhuzhu? Zhuzhu!

173
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,920
She is fine.

174
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,600
She only fainted.

175
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,800
Zhuzhu.

176
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
General, what about your Earth Absorbing Bell?

177
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
As long as people are safe.

178
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,000
No, I will go search for it right now.

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,400
No need.

180
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,600
We have more important things to do.

181
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,170
I'll take some people to look for water.

182
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll leave this to you, Fuyao.

183
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,700
Please do not leave.

184
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
General, we just leave like this. We should at least tell them.

185
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,660
If we tell them, they would follow us.

186
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,700
We can't let them risk their lives with us anymore.

187
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,270
Originally, this was my personal matter.

188
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,600
I can't drag in so many people.

189
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,700
Zhan Beiye!

190
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,020
Why did you guys follow us here?

191
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,200
That water? I was looking for water.

192
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,100
I drank it all.

193
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,030
Don't think we can't tell.

194
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,200
You want to drop us.

195
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,400
That's because I think you are a burden.

196
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,800
You are usually so brave when you kill enemies.

197
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,200
Why do you blush when you lie?

198
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,200
Older Sis Fuyao said that she couldn't let you run off by yourself.

199
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,400
She also will take the Mt. Great Vast path.

200
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,600
Then what about the others?

201
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,200
Zhuzhu is injured, so I asked Tie Cheng to bring her back first.

202
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,600
You wouldn't leave no matter what. Is that it?

203
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,200
If you don't take me, I'll go by myself.

204
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,900
Do you really think no one in this world can stop you?

205
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,600
That... General, we should get going.

206
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
Let's go.

207
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,600
This fish is a specialty of Heaven Fiend, lots of meat and little bones.

208
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,800
You guys are lucky.

209
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,020
General Zhan, you are a prince.

210
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,440
How do you know how to fish?

211
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,590
Earlier when I was fighting in the army, food was scarce.

212
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,300
If we caught a snake,

213
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,800
we brothers could have even eaten the snake skin.

214
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,400
Things like finding berries, gathering eggs,

215
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,000
catching and cooking fish, I've done them all.

216
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,550
Our brothers are tired, too.

217
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,400
No need for them to still serve me.

218
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,300
Look at how clean this fish bone was gnawed on, not one bit of meat was left.

219
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,460
So full of murderous spirit.

220
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,400
What good teeth.

221
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,300
I'll treat this as our love token.

222
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,350
General Zhan,

223
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,400
- your sword looks—
- Don't touch it.

224
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,600
Here.

225
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,800
On the hilt, the totem of Blue Dragon Wildness is carved.

226
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,200
These blood crystal eyes are the supremely noble eyes of Sword God.

227
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Heaven Fiend has a legend that

228
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,000
the Sword God transformed into a dragon and subdued my Zhan royal clan.

229
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
Hence, each of us royal descendants of Heaven Fiend

230
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,800
will have our own eyes of Sword God that isn't allowed to be touched by anyone else.

231
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,500
Pressing one's middle finger pulp on here and no one can replace it.

232
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,180
Maybe someday in the future, I—

233
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,800
The fish is done cooking, right?

234
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,700
Right, right, right.

235
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,500
- Let's eat the fish.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

236
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
Eat the fish. Eat the fish.

237
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,300
Xiaoqi.

238
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Where's Xiaoqi and Ji Yu?

239
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,070
Where are they?

240
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,800
- I'll go look for them.
- Stay.

241
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,770
Wait.

242
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,900
No one leave.

243
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,560
The fog is so strong right now.

244
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,600
Everybody stay here.

245
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,900
We'll go look for them once the fog clears.

246
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,300
General, look.

247
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,500
Li Hong?

248
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,200
Zhan Beiye!

249
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Zhan Beiye? Zhan Beiye!

250
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,990
Stay away!

251
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,650
The land around here is very soft.

252
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,800
We don't really know how deep it is.

253
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
Zhan Beiye!

254
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,670
Don't move casually, brother.

255
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,200
Hold on.

256
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Save him first. I can hold it.

257
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,600
General, with these words,

258
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,300
I can die in peace.

259
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,800
In the next life...

260
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,300
What are you doing?

261
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,400
I'll be your soldier again.

262
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
Wang Hu!

263
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,490
I order you to come out! Wang Hu!

264
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,350
Wang Hu!

265
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,170
I order you to come out!

266
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,660
Come out!

267
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,750
- Hold on, Zhan Beiye!
- Let go.

268
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,210
I will not leave you.

269
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,170
I must help you get up from there.

270
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,610
Fuyao, quickly leave!

271
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,940
Cannibal ants, Fuyao! Quickly leave!

272
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,520
I won't leave you. It doesn't work.

273
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,950
Older Sis Fuyao!

274
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,360
General!

275
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,410
Don't come near!

276
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,690
Fuyao, take them away from here.

277
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,060
Remember.

278
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,700
You must safely take them out of this woods.

279
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,240
- No.
- Quickly leave!

280
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,840
I can't leave you behind.

281
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,660
General Zhan.

282
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,330
Quickly leave!

283
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,770
Fuyao.

284
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,320
Zhan Beiye, what are you doing?

285
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,590
I'm handing this sword to you.

286
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,780
Hold on, General Zhan.

287
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,670
From now on, other than me,

288
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:22,030
only you can lay a finger in these most sacred eyes of the Sword God.

289
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,550
That includes my everything.

290
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,460
General!

291
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,970
There must be another way!

292
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,390
Cannibal ants?

293
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,840
Cannibal ants eat blood.

294
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,100
There must be another way!

295
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,870
General Ji.

296
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,920
General Ji! General Ji!

297
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,700
General Ji! What are you doing?

298
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,180
General Ji!

299
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,560
- Ji Yu!
- What are you doing, Ji Yu?

300
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,640
- General Ji! Don't!
- Don't!

301
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,130
Ji Yu!

302
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,630
Ji Yu!

303
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,750
Older Sis Fuyao, I'll take care of General Ji.

304
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,830
You go check on General Zhan.

305
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,700
You are the main backbone of this team.

306
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,450
You must continue living well

307
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,510
to earn them a greater chance of survival.

308
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,360
I brought them harm.

309
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,750
We've only just arrived here

310
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,110
and so many lives have already been lost.

311
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,590
Don't forget.

312
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,220
You are still going to save Imperial Concubine Jing

313
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,500
and seek justice for those old subordinates of yours.

314
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,940
You can't let so many brothers die in vain.

315
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,870
Zhan Beiye, you must promise me that you will continue persisting.

316
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,090
I promise you, Fuyao.

317
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,800
I surely will take you all out of these woods.

318
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,650
But you must promise me too that you will continue living well.

319
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,500
I promise you.

320
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,070
Throughout this journey, you kept gambling with your life.

321
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,570
But no matter what,

322
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,260
you must not disappoint your body of flesh and blood.

323
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,650
If Wuji in heaven were to know about this,

324
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,120
he also wouldn't be willing to see you disregarding your life like that.

325
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,650
I don't believe it.

326
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,590
Wuji isn't dead.

327
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,760
Life and death...

328
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,600
isn't up to us.

329
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,970
Unless I personally see it, I will never believe that Wuji is dead.

330
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,330
Just have a good rest here.

331
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,360
I'll go get you some water.

332
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,960
Fuyao.

333
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,590
Fuyao!

334
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,180
Wuji...

335
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,460
Wuji...

336
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,550
It's really you.

337
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,240
It's me...

338
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,940
You're not dead.

339
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,300
You're not dead.

340
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,480
How could I die?

341
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,260
I've been waiting for you.

342
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,360
But where exactly did you go?

343
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,050
Why are you here?

344
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,700
I can't die.

345
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,660
Hence, I hid here.

346
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,310
I don't know how many days and nights I have spent waiting for you.

347
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,800
I've waited for so long.

348
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,290
I feared that... you had forgotten about me.

349
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,790
How could I forget you?

350
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,180
How could I forget you?

351
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,220
It's great now.

352
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,570
You're just here.

353
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,500
All my sufferings and waiting are worth it.

354
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,870
Let's never separate anymore.

355
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,720
Since you're here, let's quickly tell everyone.

356
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,550
Let's go look for Zhan Beiye and Xiaoqi.

357
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,570
Let's tell them the news.

358
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,270
Wuji?

359
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,900
Forgive my selfishness.

360
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,190
I've waited for you for a long time.

361
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,000
You've finally appeared.

362
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,700
Now, I don't want anything.

363
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,530
I don't want to care about others or worldly affairs.

364
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,900
I just want you.

365
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,400
What Five Regions?

366
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,160
What world?

367
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,460
I don't want them all anymore.

368
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,670
I just want to hug you like this.

369
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:14,590
Be with you for a lifetime and that's enough.

370
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,750
But... we can't leave them trapped there.

371
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,230
No, they are not important.

372
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,980
The two of us being together is what's most important.

373
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,710
Isn't that so?

374
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,590
What's wrong with you?

375
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,600
You're not Wuji.

376
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,090
I'm Wuji.

377
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,200
- I'm your Wuji.
- You're not Wuji.

378
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,960
You're not Wuji. You're not Wuji!

379
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,640
Wuji... would never ignore his friends.

380
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,770
Wuji would never disregard the life of others.

381
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,900
And more importantly, Wuji would never give his Five Regions up!

382
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,700
Fuyao, it's me, Wuji.

383
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,400
Wuji is already dead!

384
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,240
Be careful, Fuyao!

385
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,370
Zhan Beiye!

386
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,580
Zhan Beiye...

387
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,140
Zhan Beiye! Zhan Beiye!

388
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,680
Help! Zhan Beiye...

389
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,850
Zhan Beiye...

390
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,750
Yi'er, you mustn't stay in this place any longer.

391
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,180
- Quickly come with me.
- No.

392
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,900
Take this. This is the Earth Top Token of the Imperial City.

393
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,640
As long as you have it, there won't be anyone in Five Regions who will block your way.

394
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,940
Why are you doing this?

395
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,490
Hurry and keep it.

396
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,080
Didn't we agree to leave together?

397
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,280
There's no more time.

398
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,820
What has really happened?

399
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,910
I'm telling you to leave. Leave Megrez.

400
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,140
He won't let you off.

401
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,380
Could it be that he isn't able to wait anymore?

402
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,360
Catch the assassin!

403
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,510
I will not leave you here alone.

404
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,280
If I'm going to leave, we'll leave together.

405
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,130
Open your eyes and look closely!

406
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,680
How is there an assassin here?

407
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,700
This is Prince Virtue. Aren't you still stopping?

408
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,840
Empress, please forgive me. I'm just following orders.

409
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,610
Sorry to offend you!

410
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,480
With your skills, you can still escape.

411
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,750
Once he arrives, you won't be able to leave anymore!

412
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,170
I already missed out on you once.

413
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,700
No matter what, I mustn't commit a mistake again this time!

414
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,990
All of you, stop!

415
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,340
Or else, I will die in front of you!

416
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,760
- Empress!
- Put the sword down!

417
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,530
Don't come near me!

418
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,720
Let me tell you... as long as Zhangsun Jiong still cares about his reputation,

419
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,680
I then still am the supreme empress of the Five Regions.

420
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,740
But if you still don't go, you will never escape death.

421
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,230
Even if I die, I'm willing to give it a try!

422
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,840
Dying is so easy.

423
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,710
It's just a matter of slashing one's neck.

424
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:25,440
But I've waited for so many years... not just for this short moment of pleasure.

425
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,620
I want to see your army charge into the Imperial City

426
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,030
and save me from this prison in an open and aboveboard manner.

427
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:40,390
Only through that can the hatred in our hearts be resolved.

428
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,450
Yi'er...

429
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,280
Leave!

430
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,460
Quickly leave!

431
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,730
Okay!

432
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,390
Wait for me.

433
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,190
After him!

434
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,110
Such a sincere and deep love.

435
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,630
Just do it.

436
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:22,220
I will obey whatever punishment you give.

437
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,740
You have such a noble status.

438
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:34,850
Empress, even in death, you must die honorably.

439
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,550
Earlier, you clearly could have killed him.

440
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:47,450
But why did you let him off?

441
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:52,020
Because the good show has just started.

442
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,000
Your Highness!

443
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,630
Your Highness, you really have great foresight.

444
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,400
Not long after you left, Prince Fierce brought that female criminal and infiltrated the camp.

445
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,410
However, they got surrounded by the Gold of Heaven Fiend.

446
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,880
Our scouts reported that they've now been forced deep into the jungle of Mt. Great Vast.

447
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
That jungle is full of danger.

448
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,170
They will surely die now.

449
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,630
That's great then.

450
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:51,700
The king of Heaven Fiend has expressed his stand of taking the lead in welcoming you in ascending to the crown prince's throne.

451
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,460
Those assassins that you detest will be dying soon, too.

452
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,650
The day that you will be conferred as crown prince is happening soon.

453
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,850
Your Highness, why are you still worried?

454
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,330
I had to stake my whole life just to get that crown prince position.

455
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,800
How then could it happen so easily?

456
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,920
Let's go. Let's go meet that Zhan Nancheng.

457
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,930
Girl.

458
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,500
Girl!

459
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,940
Girl.

460
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,300
Wuji...

461
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,130
Girl.

462
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,430
Wuji—

463
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,880
- What's wrong?
- You're that fake one.

464
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,030
You're fake.

465
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,190
It's me.

466
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,350
- You are fake!
- It's me! It's me, Wuji.

467
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,150
- You're fake!
- It's me, Wuji.

468
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,770
It's me.

469
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,440
It's me.

470
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,220
It's you. You're Wuji?

471
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,440
It's me.

472
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,930
You are Wuji?

473
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,640
It's me.

I'm okay.

491
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,460
I never thought that I'd fall into Zhangsun Pingrong's tricks.

492
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,160
I also never thought that I caused you to almost die in battle here in Yao City.

493
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:44,400
Even more I never thought that just to seek revenge for me, you actually went to Mt. Great Vast.

494
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,010
Sorry. Sorry.

495
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,830
These past days, I was extremely anxious.

496
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,040
I hated myself.

497
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,160
I hated myself for not being by your side.

498
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,020
It's enough that you're alive.

499
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,900
Seriously, these past days...

500
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,890
where have you been these past days exactly?

501
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,360
They...

502
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,580
It's all right now...

503
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,370
They all said that you were dead.

504
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,030
I even saw your corpse.

505
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,570
All these were beyond my expectations.

506
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,980
In Geya Desert, I encountered an ambush from Zhangsun Pingrong's men.

507
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,940
He was sure that I wouldn't be able to walk out of that death place.
