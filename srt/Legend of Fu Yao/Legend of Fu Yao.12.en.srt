What is over there?

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,740
- Let’s go and check it out.
- Okay.

26
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,400
- What is this?
- This is Thread of Predestined Marriage.

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,540
- Thread of Predestined Marriage?
- Yes.

28
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,040
You just have to bring the man you love here and tie a red knot together.

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,250
Then, both of you will be together for your whole life.

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,540
Really?

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,940
If you really want to tie this thread, you'll have to bring Zhan Beiye here.

32
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,670
Who wants to bring him here?

33
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,660
Can you help me to tie and bring Fifth Older Brother here?

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,860
You'll get your own Fifth Older Brother here by yourself.

35
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,660
What if he isn’t willing to come here?

36
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,190
Then, you knock him out and carry him here.

37
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,140
Sure. I’ll do that then.

38

- Okay.

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,150
What about you?

40
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,050
I’ll wander around here. Quickly go.

41
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,750
- All right. Be careful, Older Sister Fuyao.
- Okay.

No! No!

Master God, I’m not praying for marriage.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,860
I only beg you to bless and protect my younger brother, Xiaoqi, to be safe and sound.

46
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,260
Let me find him as soon as possible..

47

Miss, are you not waiting for Mister to make a wish together?

48
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,200
I’m afraid he would not like to listen to what I wish for.

49
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:42,780
Master God, I only hope that I can find that lowly slave who ruined my life.

50

I'll pay for whatever cost you ask me.

Miss, look!

52
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,530
It seems that my wish has come true.

- Okay.

65
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,040
The closer I am to my hometown, the more timid I am.

66
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,090
I'm afraid to ask the passerby about the situation in my hometown.

67
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,360
Why did you attract me here?

68

It’s been fifteen years.

69
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,730
Today’s their death anniversary.

70
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,420
I've told you that as long as this injustice is unredressed

71
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,880
and the revenge isn't taken, I don’t want to meet the ancestors.

72
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,920
Then, can you bear to see them being buried in this abandoned place

73
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,110
with no one to commemorate their death for the past fifteen years and being lonely ghosts in a deserted place?

74
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,140
I had secretly ordered people to collect your ancestors’ corpses.

75
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:29,530
But fifteen years has passed, you should know that something can’t be forced.

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,990
[Yun Hen]
(One's birthday for astrological purposes.)

165
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,130
[Year: Xinwei, Month: Yimo]

166
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,950
[Date: Dingmao, Time: Renyin]

167
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,600
[Xinwei Yimo]
[Yun Hen]

168
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,430
I only know that Zhan Nancheng is greedy for fun.

169
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,610
Unexpectedly, he is actually very thoughtful.

170
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,400
He even hid a secret message in this letter.

171
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,300
Yun Hen, never look down on anyone who got the throne.

172
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,840
Yes.

173
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,730
What we've discussed previously,

174
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,020
for me to give you our Heaven Fiend’s Earth Absorbing Bell in exchange of the land of Mt. Great Vast.

175
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,630
Maybe Prime Minister may not be willing to cooperate with me.

176
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,470
After my evaluation,

177
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,920
I think there is another plan which can help us with our alliance.

178
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,150
The throne of Deep Water Nation is shaky and Xuanyuan Ren is old and careless.

179
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,890
He has not much time left but does not have an heir.

180
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,450
Prime Minister is strong, smart and hardworking.

181
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,580
You’re the best one who can protect your Deep Water Nation’s royal blood.

182
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,170
And our Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend disobeyed and is not deeply happy with our royal family.

183
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,810
But, because our brotherhood, we are not willing to kill each other.

184
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,970
I was thinking that if I can take the Earth Absorbing Bell back with the help of Prime Minister

185
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,670
and blame it on Prince Fierce,

186
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,720
arguments about the land of Mt. Great Vast can be temporarily ignored then.

187
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,130
If you accidentally got a different result and hid the reason of the death of Prince Fierce,

188
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,070
it will help me with stabling my power in Heaven Fiend.

189
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,960
This will be a good connection of Heaven Fiend Nation and Deep Water Nation.

190
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,600
Prime Minister, you are so mighty.

191
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,920
If you want to snatch Deep Water Nation’s royal blood in the future,

192
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,830
I will definitely help you to win the battle.

193
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,370
Lin Yi told me before he died that

194
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,730
Zhan Nancheng is the one behind the loss of the Earth Absorbing Bell,

195
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,560
but Qi Zhen’s men conducted it.

196
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,530
The king is working with Qi Zhen.

197
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,860
I’m not sure how many conspiracies there are behind the loss of Earth Absorbing Bell,

198
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,770
but I understand

199
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,900
that Zhan Nancheng wanting to kill me with Qi Zhen’s hand is already set.

200
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,310
So, I can’t leave Deep Water Nation now.

201
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,750
Only if I find Earth Absorbing Bell, Zhan Nancheng will not have any excuse to kill me.

202
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,740
Then, I will have more time to set a trap.

203
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,840
The badge is here and General is here, Ji Yu doesn’t dare to take it.

204
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,370
I order you to enter Heaven Fiend Nation secretly.

205
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,940
Contacting the old troops is a dangerous move.

206
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,940
Once it's known by Zhan Nancheng,

207
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,730
it’s okay if I die but it will drag Imperial Concubine Jing in as well.

208
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,530
This is the worst situation,

209
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,580
but I have to plan for it.

210
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,660
General, what is your arrangement?

211
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,720
I want to use this seal to protect Imperial Concubine Jing.

212
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,030
- General!
- You only need to know

213
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,640
there’s a hidden power which is protecting Imperial Concubine Jing secretly.

214
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,160
Once Zhan Nanchen knows my move and uses Imperial Concubine Jing as a threat,

215
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,760
you immediately surrender to Zhan Nancheng and give him this seal.

216
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,780
By then, there will be someone who will save Imperial Concubine Jing.

217
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,770
What about you, General?

218
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,320
You don’t have to care about me.

219
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,910
You can only mobilize the soldiers with this seal.

220
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,310
What you're doing means you are giving up your life to Zhan Nancheng.

221
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,170
Ji Yu can’t do this.

222
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,070
That’s why you can't make any mistake.

223
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:54,010
Ji Yu, I’m putting my Consort Mother and my own life

224
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,730
in your hand.

225
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,000
General, I—

226
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,710
Ji Yu will surely—

227
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,540
Men from Heaven Fiend only bleed and don't cry.

228
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,640
I’ll wait for you to return.

229
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,740
I’m not interested in being involved in the inner fight of Heaven Fiend royal clan.

230
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,010
Since Zhan Nancheng wants to form an alliance with me,

231
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,010
making a choice which benefits me the most is the best plan.

232
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,530
Today is the Double Third Festival.

233
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,680
This is the best choice.

234
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,870
We just have to push all the blame

235
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,700
to a lantern which fell from the sky.

236
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,740
Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend died because of an accident.

237
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,930
No one can find any trace.

238
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,760
Fifth Older Brother didn’t go out, right?

239
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,530
I’m asking you.

240
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,880
Stay there!

241
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,000
Hey, are you okay?

242
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,080
Hurry and chase her! Hurry!

243
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,580
Don’t run!

244
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,860
Why can’t you live like a girl even when you’re in Capital Kun?

245
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,000
Why do I see you everywhere?

246
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,360
I should be the one asking you this question. Why are you causing troubles everywhere?

247
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,090
I didn’t cause trouble. The trouble finds me.

248
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,330
I've saved you again.

249
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,950
How will you thank me?

250
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,090
I... Thank you?

251
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,860
Let’s go.

252
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,930
- Hurry up!
- Chase her.

253
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,170
Fifth Older Brother!

254
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,810
Fifth Older Brother, that’s great.

255
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,610
You’re still alive.

256
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,460
Fifth Older Brother is okay.

257
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,880
Let go of my hand.

258
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,480
Let go of my hand!

259
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,360
Fifth Older Brother, are you okay?

260
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,510
Fifth Older Brother, do you know where these killers are from?

261
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,760
But it’s not difficult to find out who the mastermind behind this is.

262
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,520
How do you dare to plot against my Fifth Older Brother?

263
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,560
I’ll definitely find and get even with them.

264
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,750
And this silly old king of Deep Water,

265
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,290
does he even care when these kinds of things happen in his capital?

266
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,380
I will definitely get even with him if I see him one day.

267
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,000
Let’s go.

268
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,410
The fire is getting bigger.

269
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,500
Then, what about these corpses?

270
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,030
Burn them.

271
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,540
Are you letting go of this thing like this?

272
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,770
I can’t let go of it.

273
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,750
Go in.

274
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,800
Here—

275
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,790
Stay here first.

276
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,060
Why are we running?

277
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,080
You’re so good. Why don’t you go and fight against them?

278
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,680
You don’t understand. Hide here first.

279
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,650
I’ll lead them away.

280
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,890
Come out after they leave.

281
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,640
Remember, don't stray around.

282
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,310
Where are you going?

283
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,820
I have my plan.

284
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,300
Go in!

285
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,130
Here. Chase!

286
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,350
Hurry up!

287
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,520
Hurry up and chase him!

288
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,060
This Xuanyuan Min.

289
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,820
Master, never imagined that there would be such a big slave market in Capital Kun.

290
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,970
Collecting slaves is Capital Kun’s royal family’s habit.

291
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,950
That’s why there are so many slaves in Deep Water.

292
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,180
Compared to Mt. Mystic Soul, the slaves here are even worse.

293
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,850
“Human are worthless,” this is what they meant.

294
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,610
Let’s go.

295
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,230
- We have an important task to finish.
- Yes.

296
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,270
Here.

297
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,480
Let me out!

298
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,960
Let us out!

299
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,130
Let me out!

300
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,240
Let me out!

301
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,170
Let us out!

302
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,200
Let us out!

303
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,490
Let me out!

304
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,900
Let me out!

305
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,870
Let me out!

306
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,740
Let me out!

307
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,510
Let me out!

308
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,530
Let me out!

309
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,790
Let us out!

310
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,140
Let us out!

311
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,000
Let us out!

312
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,130
You’re not a man from here.

313
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,260
What are you here to see me for?

314
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,750
I’m here on behalf of someone else to ask you about the incident of Heir Apparent Wenyi that year.

315
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,320
You've found the wrong person.

316
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,880
I’m just a slave.

317
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,240
I don’t know Heir Apparent Wenyi.

318
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,580
Before you became a slave, you used to be close with Heir Apparent Wenyi.

319
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,990
Am I right, Mr. Qiu?

320
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,420
You can't atone for your crime of betraying your master for the sake of glory even if you stay a slave for your whole life.

321
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:04,400
Had you ever thought that you'd become like this today when the Heir Apparent’s family was exterminated?

322
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,200
What can a person who betrayed his master for the sake of glory do?

323
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:25,580
If you are here to insult me, go away. Go away!

324
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,550
What if I tell you I’m here because the person you saved that year asked me to?

325
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,540
Who?

326
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,160
He wanted me to ask you about Dragon Scale Armor.

327
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,750
That’s his family’s treasure.

328
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,270
Don’t be scared!

329
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,660
Dragon Scale Armor?

330
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,200
Dragon Scale Armor.

331
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,770
Dragon Scale Armor!

332
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,260
Over hundreds and thousands of years, there were so many people who died because of this sacred treasure of Five Regions.

333
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,480
If it’s not because of the Dragon Scale Armor, Deep Water wouldn’t be in such a mess now.

334
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,420
But without this Dragon Scale Armor, there would be no Deep Water.

335
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,000
God is playing with us.

336
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,770
God is really playing with us.

337
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:50,050
Because of this, he wants to take it back.

338
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,520
Where is he?

339
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,600
Where?

340
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,590
Who are you?

341
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,980
Where is this place? Where is Xiaoqi?

342
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,800
This is the biggest slave market in Capital Kun.

343
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,090
What do you think?

344
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,720
- Where is Xiaoqi?
- Stop wasting your energy.

345
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,430
Not many can leave here alive.

346
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:43,120
I won’t forgive you if you touch a single hair of his.

347
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,730
- Just you?
- You try then.

348
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,960
Good. I’ll give you a chance then.

349
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,980
I’ll see how you hurt me.

350
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,640
- Come here. Bring her out.
- Yes.

351
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,590
You... Don’t go!

352
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,240
Hurry up and go!

353
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,980
Let me out!

354
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,610
Let me out!

355
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:37,320
You three! Whoever is able to kill her can leave here alive.

356
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,610
Let me out!

357
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,200
We are all born as slaves.

358
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,600
Why do we need to follow others’ orders and kill each other?

359
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,850
Rubbish!

360
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:59,830
Once entering this slavefighting ring, either you die or I die.

361
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,260
[Yijun Street]

362
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,100
Let’s go somewhere else to look.

363
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,590
Where will Older Sis Fuyao go?

364
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,050
She was there just now.

365
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,000
Stop fighting!

366
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,710
I’ll not fight with you because of Xiaoqi.

367
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,290
You go ahead and leave.

368
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,320
Hurry up and leave!

369
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,520
If I didn’t use Xiaoqi’s mark to lure you here,

370
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,270
I would not have such a good drama to watch today.

371
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,480
It’s you, indeed.

372
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,520
I knew you’re ashamed,

373
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,960
that’s why you’re hiding behind someone else and doing such evil things.

374
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,270
Talking about evil, I'm far behind you, slut.

375
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,240
Are you resenting that your face is not “nice” enough?

376
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,490
You ruined my life.

377
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,110
I’ll definitely take your life.

378
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,790
I don’t care how you want to kill me.

379
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,750
Our grudge has nothing to do with Xiaoqi.

380
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,300
It’s just a lowly life.

381
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,660
If I want him to die at midnight, he will definitely not be able to live till the morning.

382
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,710
I’ll let you handle me if you let Xiaoqi go.

383
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:13,290
Sluts like you have no rights to negotiate with me.

384
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,560
Today, you can’t run away from me.

385
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,880
Whoever can kill her,

386
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,180
I can guarantee that he will leave here safely.

387
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,170
Plus 100 tael of gold as reward.

388
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,310
Kill her!

389
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,890
Kill her!

390
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,510
You're not allowed to back off. Get on her, you all.

391
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,490
I promised to whatever you said.

392
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,530
You can finally see the sun in the sky again.

393
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:01,190
The sun on top of me isn’t my sun in the sky.

394
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,500
Only here...

395
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,200
Only if I can wait till this day,

396
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,640
can I only see the light again.

397
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,470
I am satisfied now.

398
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,700
Jiang Feng.

399
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,160
- I’m satisfied now.
- Mister.

400
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,490
Bring Mr. Qiu out first.

401
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,840
But, Master... Yes.

402
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,230
Retreat.

403
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,130
Let me out!

404
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,390
It's dangerous here. Leave with me.

405
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,270
Xiaoqi got caught by Pei Yuan. I need to save him.

406
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,790
- To save Xiaoqi, we need to take time to plan.
- That time is now and you're still talking about taking time?

407
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,180
You tell me who Fuyao is exactly.

408
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,730
We’ve been searching for the whole night.

409
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,750
Hurry up! If we can’t find her, we will be killed.

410
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,700
Oh no. Older Sis Fuyao is in danger.

411
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,280
Let’s go.
