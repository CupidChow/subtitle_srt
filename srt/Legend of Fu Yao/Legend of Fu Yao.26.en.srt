00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,350
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,510
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:23,360
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,960
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,980
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,700
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,470
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,650
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,790
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,680
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,950
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,100
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,570
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,390
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,330
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:21,480
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,640
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,190
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,090
~ Episode 26 ~

22
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,770
You!

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,860
It's you.

24
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,500
It's really you.

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,940
What? We haven't seen each other for a day.

26
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,900
Don't you recognize me anymore?

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
You...

28
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,910
Aren't you supposed to be in Forever Water?

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,940
Why are you back?

30
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,880
I heard that Qi Zhen took you away.

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,370
I was afraid that you'd get in trouble, so I rushed back.

32
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,300
I've been following you from the Prime Minister's Manor.

33
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,560
If Qi Zhen really harmed you, then today would have been his day of death.

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,570
I've killed you once today.

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,590
Being able to see you again is great.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,940
I let you leave because I didn't want you to experience such kinds of things.

37
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,270
Never thought that in the end, there was still an oversight.

38
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,420
At this time, you must be feeling how great it is to have a unbridled lady like me.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,330
An unbridled...

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,140
and petty lady.

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,830
If I'm really petty, I won't return.

42
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,680
But after this incident, Qi Zhen's doubts on you have decreased greatly for sure.

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
This is a good thing.

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,160
But I want to ask

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,590
how you were able to discern that man to be a fake me?

46
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,450
That person indeed looked so much like you.

47
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,540
His voice even sounded better than yours.

48
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,910
But in that short moment,

49
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,640
I just knew that he was not you.

50
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,370
How sure are you then that the me now is the real me?

51
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,500
I tell you.

52
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,230
Even if there is a very skilled man in this world who's able to imitate your face,

53
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,690
he won't be able to imitate your slutty look.

54
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,030
Look at you.

55
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,310
Really?

56
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,190
I've always wanted to ask.

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,630
Ask what?

58
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,940
Why did you come back?

59
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,840
Because Jiang Feng told me—

60
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,340
Not those.

61
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,690
Lian'er!

62
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,160
Mother, I'm coming!

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,330
When did you have a mother?

64
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,060
Isn't it all because of that purse that Jiang Feng gave me? I won't talk about it anymore.

65
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,300
- She almost killed you before. I was the one who saved you.
- Don't let her see you.

66
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,230
Are you driving me away now?

67
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,430
She... She's now... She's also a pitiful person. Don't make things difficult for her.

68
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,990
- No...
 - Lian'er!
 - I'm going out now.

69
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,340
Coming! Coming!

70
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,480
Hey! Take good care of yourself.

71
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,010
Special decree from the King!

72
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,800
Lady Precious, Tang Zhirong has a gentle and kind natural disposition.

73
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,550
She is polite, virtuous and careful on everything.

74
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,400
Does her best to perform her palace duties.

75
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,350
Does her best to be respectful.

76
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,890
Respects her seniors sincerely.

77
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,020
Treats those inferior to her with grace and harmony.

78
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,780
She was taught and was able to skillfully maintain the proper palace etiquette.

79
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,300
She is considered to be a model of the Deep Nation harem.

80
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,310
Especially announcing this to the public so that her name can be spread all over Deep Water.

81
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,930
- Older Sister, drink some water.
- Thanks.

82
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,870
- Be careful for it's hot.
- Older Sister,

83
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,300
you're now being envied by all women of Deep Nation.

84
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,400
With His Majesty favoring you this much, the Queen position will surely be yours later.

85
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,530
I heard from my father that there has never been a woman that has been solely favored by a king like you.

86
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,030
We still have to rely on you to promote and care for us from now on.

87
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,610
- That's right. That's right.
- Take good care of us.

88
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,170
Of course.

89
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,170
I can see that Older Sister's usual clothing is simple yet elegant, not decreasing your composure.

90
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,590
I especially picked out a jade bracelet from VIP Shop for you.

91
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,270
This jade bracelet is clear and exquisite, of high-grade.

92
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,890
It really fits Older Sister well.

93
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,470
Older Sister, please try it on.

94
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,970
Younger Sister, you've exerted quite an effort.

95
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,910
But these graces I enjoy are all dependent on His Majesty's whim.

96
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,340
We all are in the palce to serve him.

97
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,160
Why bother with those empty reputations?

98
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,380
- Right. Right. Right.
- What Older Sister said is right.

99
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,410
Older Sister, then keep this first.

100
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,970
Older Sister, just accept it. Just accept it.

101
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,750
The inner court earlier sent over some high grade bird's nest and vitality energy bars.

102
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,340
All are exquisite items in Five Regions.

103
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,070
Even rich families won't commonly see these.

104
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,230
Enjoying such love from His Majesty, Lady is really fortunate.

105
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,810
Rong'er, do what I said.

106
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,710
Don't scream.

107
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,600
Don't shout.

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,330
Okay?

109
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,870
Okay.

110
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,000
What did Qi Zhen promise you

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,470
that you are so willing to delay your future like this?

112
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,010
There were some words that I only told you,

113
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,470
but how come he also knew?

114
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,050
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

115
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,040
I don't know about those before.

116
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,530
You saying that you're innocent has no bearing.

117
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,530
You've become a victim of your own ingenuity.

118
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,040
Do you think that I wouldn't find out that you repeatedly stole memorials from me and gave them to Qi Zhen?

119
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,920
Do you think that when Qi Zhen mentioned you to me,

120
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,430
he only has good words?

121
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,800
It was him.

122
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,830
Our Tang family all must listen to him.

123
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,530
I couldn't dare to disobey my father. I—

124
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,810
The more I couldn't dare to disobey Prime Minister.

125
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,680
Your Majesty!

126
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,230
Of course, I know that your family is under Qi Zhen's control.

127
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,380
But how come you didn't think for yourself?

128
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,870
This was written by your father.

129
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,490
Read it.

130
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,100
Tang Bonian was loyal and considerate of his nation.

131
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,670
He already sent you into the palace, but was still afraid that he hadn't given enough service.

132
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,570
He's now planning to send your younger sister, Tang Yiguang, into the palace, too.

133
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,360
He wants you two sisters to alternately take care of me.

134
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,380
It's also relaxing for me.

135
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,470
I never heard my father talk about this.

136
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,560
Of course.

137
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,940
Although you've always prioritized your clan's interest,

138
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,500
you still are just a concubine's daughter.

139
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,460
Now that you're highly favored by me,

140
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,040
the main lord of the Tang family might be getting uneasy now.

141
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,170
Tang Yiguang is of a higher status than you.

142
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,510
Her entering the palace needs not be discussed with you, of course.

143
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,320
Sit.

144
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,850
Okay.

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,070
Your filial piety is admirable.

146
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,270
Everything you did was for your father,

147
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,420
for General Border Security's manor.

148
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,820
But you helping Qi Zhen like this will only end in two ways.

149
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,040
One, the matter will get exposed and you'll die.

150
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,900
Second, Qi Zhen succeeds and I'll die.

151
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,730
But if I die,

152
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,170
you can only stay in the Limbo Palace for ten to twenty years.

153
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,100
And become a zombie.

154
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,080
I-I don't want to.

155
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,510
I don't want to.

156
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,640
If a chess game is set,

157
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,630
what purpose does a pawn still have?

158
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,500
Ever since I was born,

159
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,200
I've never planned anything for myself.

160
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,220
But now, I should also live for myself at least once.

161
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,170
I ask for Your Majesty's guidance, please.

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,990
That is easy.

163
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,730
As long as you listen to my order to say and act,

164
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,080
all the special favor and wealth will be yours.

165
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,010
Rong'er is willing as long as Your Majesty can trust me.

166
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,610
Since I can say these things to you,

167
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,990
of course, I know your level of loyalty.

168
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,400
Lady Precious, His Majesty has summoned you to go over there.

169
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,250
Let's go.

170
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,500
His Majesty is really fond of Lady.

171
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,610
Just not seeing you for one day is like three autumns have passed.

172
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,230
- I don't want to live anymore! I don't want to live anymore!
- My Ladyship, please come down quickly!

173
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,780
- That slut, Tang Zhirong!
- Come down. Come down.

174
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,380
- always enjoys His Majesty's favor every night!
- My Ladyship, please get down!

175
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,400
- Her limelight has overshadowed the whole harem!
- My Ladyship, please get down!

176
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,240
- Don't think that I don't know that you all discuss behind my back that she's the definite choice for the Queen.
- Come down!

177
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,100
Then, why don't you go find her? Ask her to be your new master.

178
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,150
I won't take this defeat. I won't take this defeat.

179
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,540
How come I lost to a vixen from the province?

180
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,730
This is an embarrassment to the Prefect Xiping's House.

181
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,460
Go away! You all go away!

182
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,090
I don't want to live. I don't want to live anymore!

183
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,690
Do you know that Tang Zhirong has been hanging onto His Majesty every day into the night?

184
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,010
He kept being disturbed by this vixen that he almost was late for the water ritual of Forever Water.

185
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,130
Deliver these to the Inner Court.

186
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,320
Prefect, I've also heard about that.

187
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,780
When I was returning from the palace,

188
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,030
I saw His Majesty rushing to see Lady Precious.

189
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,730
He's young and vigorous.

190
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,940
We cannot compare with that.

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,590
- Prime Minister.
- Yes?

192
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,630
Tell me your mind.

193
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,890
Has the Queen been set to be Tang's daughter?

194
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,570
Prefect, you're putting too much importance on me.

195
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,490
How can I decide who becomes the Queen of Deep Water?

196
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,170
The wheel of fortune really turns.

197
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,280
He was a hoodlum who only knew how to wave a sword twenty years ago.

198
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,390
Didn't he only follow you in exterminating Heir Apparent Wenyi's family?

199
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,460
This Tang Bonian really thinks that he's somebody now.

200
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,120
He didn't follow me.

201
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,820
That was Shenzong's decree.

202
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,060
He committed treason, a crime with no pardons.

203
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,270
Yes, that's right.

204
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,320
After that, this Tang Bonian became an important strength in the government.

205
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,370
Prime Minister, how many soldiers does Tang Bonian have now?

206
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,180
100,000 or 150,000?

207
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,230
This is an army force that will make great movements.

208
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,840
We cannot be careless.

209
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,150
But Prime Minister, have you ever thought

210
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:32,200
if you can be certain that these soldiers are for you to use?

211
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,080
The Tang Bonian of the past followed you because he had nothing.

212
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,720
He only had his life.

213
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,360
But now, he is different.

214
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,610
My Ruo'er is fated to be a queen.

215
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,480
If these plans are ruined because of a mistake on your part, Prime Minister,

216
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,910
then Prime Minister's Manor and I will no longer have any emotional connection.

217
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,330
Prefect,

218
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,600
you are thinking too highly of me.

219
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,810
I dare not step into a matter as important as appointing the Queen.

220
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,490
Prime Minister, you must be confused!

221
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,800
What benefit is there for you in letting Tang Zhirong become Queen?

222
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,060
Do you still think that Tang Bonian is an underdog?

223
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,070
How foolish!

224
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,660
Tang Zhirong, this girl deliberately provoked Yuwen Zi.

225
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,640
She's not so simple.

226
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,230
Could it be that this was arranged by Tang Bonian?

227
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,010
Does he want to get rid of my people and replace them with his?

228
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,850
Immediately rush to General Border Security's Manor in South Departure.

229
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,320
You must personally hand this letter to Tang Bonian.

230
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,720
Mister.

231
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,690
Mister, Qi Zhen has sent a messenger to see Tang Bonian in the south.

232
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,420
It's said that he asked General Border Security to enter the capital by himself through the waterways.

233
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,610
Enter the capital by himself?

234
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,850
Through the waterways?

235
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,670
This is a test.

236
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,030
A trap is set up for Tang Bonian.

237
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,830
Jiang Feng, do you suspect that this

238
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,650
is extremely hard to uproot once it sets in the heart?

239
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,480
What we have to do is to let this suspicion grow bigger and bigger.

240
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,350
Go find Zong Yue. He'll know what to do.

241
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,920
Yes.

242
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,940
Where is Miss?

243
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,580
I do not know, either.

244
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,380
You're dismissed!

245
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,880
Mister Zong.

246
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,620
It looks like Miss is well, so I will take my leave.

247
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,640
You can't leave. I invited you to eat with me because I wanted to personally thank you.

248
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,270
You always refused, so I had no option but to trick you.

249
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,770
If you want someone to blame, blame it on yourself for not showing respect.

250
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,990
Curing illnesses and saving people are the responsibilities of a doctor.

251
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,030
As for showing your gratitude, you do not have to.

252
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,760
I will leave now.

253
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,540
You can't go. Leave after eating.

254
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,500
Yun'er, look.

255
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,530
You came just in time. Help me stop him.

256
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,980
I just wanted to invite him to eat for showing my gratitude. He won't give me the honor regardless.

257
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,550
Prefecture Princess, Mister Zong does not like excitement.

258
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,070
Why should we force him?

259
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,410
Are you going to help me or not?

260
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,360
Mister, Prefecture Princess has shown such deep feelings.

261
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,290
Mister should give her the honor.

262
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,730
Why give a young girl a hard time?

263
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,790
All right.

264
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,920
Hey, where are you going?

265
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,530
Isn't it lunch time?

266
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,460
What? Do you not like my cooking?

267
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,350
Of course not.

268
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,870
I don't have enough fingers to count how many doctors I've seen growing up.

269
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,700
The good, the bad, the strong, the liars: I've seen them all.

270
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,240
So I understand when you say that it is a doctor's responsibility to save people.

271
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,090
It's only right that you cured me.

272
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,930
But to be honest, I didn't insist on thanking you because of your medical skills.

273
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,720
It's because you reminded me of an old friend of mine.

274
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,350
Prefecture Princess is giving me much care.

275
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,590
I can't bear to accept it.

276
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,990
When I was very young, there was an older brother from my neighbor's family.

277
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,380
I always liked to follow him.

278
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,980
No one could expel me no matter what.

279
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,210
He always thought I was annoying and looked for ways to get rid of me.

280
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,260
But he never succeeded. I just loved to stick to him.

281
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,100
One day, that older brother took me to a cave.

282
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,050
He told me we were playing hide and seek and instructed me to hide.

283
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,030
I waited until the night, but he didn't return.

284
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,490
It was all dark in there and I got lost.

285
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,760
Then what happened?

286
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,040
Afterwards, it was Butler Wei who led some men and found me.

287
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,850
My father was furious.

288
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,160
I had never seen him so mad.

289
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,990
But I never told him

290
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,750
that it was because that older brother tricked me into going there.

291
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,600
Your attachments to the older brother next door are truly deep.

292
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,750
It was not like that.

293
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,010
He made fun of me, so how could I forgive him?

294
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,840
But I know that our families were very close,

295
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,170
so even if I told on him, my father wouldn't punish him too hard.

296
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,860
So I thought, why don't I accept the situation,

297
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,000
and wait for a good opportunity to get back at him?

298
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,970
How did you get back at him?

299
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,680
Let's eat first.

300
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,610
I cooked this soup for four hours.

301
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,150
You cannot not give me the honor.

302
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,720
Eat the soup.

303
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll tell the story once you eat.

304
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,170
This older brother was very weird ever since he was little.

305
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,630
He wasn't able to eat paris polyphylla.

306
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,990
Just taking a bit of it and he'd develop rashes all over his body, so red and itchy.

307
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,700
His face would even swell like a pig.

308
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,380
Hence, I especially gathered some paris polyphylla.

309
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,940
I especially went to the kitchen and cooked my first ever chicken soup.

310
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,110
That night, that older brother was rolling all over the floor painfully.

311
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,890
And I was so happy, so happy that I didn't sleep all night.

312
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,920
The next day, I intentionally woke up very early.

313
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,430
I wanted to go to their house and watch him swell like a pig.

314
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,590
But—

315
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,600
But what?

316
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,310
He moved away.

317
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:53,210
In one night, his whole family was gone.

318
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,720
Thank you, Prefecture Princess, for your hospitality.

319
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,860
I'll take my leave.

320
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,790
Wait!

321
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,470
Are you not asking me what I've put in that soup?

322
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,120
Three year-old silkie and you've put some red lingzhi mushroom,

323
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,880
dried tangerine peel, longan, monk fruit, and red dates.

324
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,760
Lastly, you've put some paris polyphylla.

325
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,540
Am I right?

326
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,400
I feel that you look a lot like that older brother, but you won't admit it.

327
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,620
I can only test you like that.

328
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,870
When I examined you for illness last time, I only felt that you were naturally born with a deficient qi.

329
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,850
Your mental state is normal.

330
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,760
But looking at you now, I might have not checked thoroughly.

331
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,670
I'll take my leave.

332
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,670
You're not allowed to leave! I must look!

333
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,820
Prefecture Princess, you're still unmarried. It's not appropriate for you to do this.

334
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,680
I don't care! I must look!

335
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,600
Prefecture Princess! Prefecture Princess! Prefecture Princess!

336
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,990
Mister is our manor's important guest.

337
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,220
Don't intervene!

338
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,720
If Prime Minister learns about this, it won't be nice.

339
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,790
Okay! Fine!

340
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,600
I'll let you look.

341
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,510
I'm just a doctor.

342
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,770
I'm not the old friend that you've talked about.

343
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,330
May Prefecture Princess conduct yourself with dignity.

344
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,770
Okay already, Yun'er.

345
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,980
You just recognized the wrong person.

346
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,060
Mr. Zong will surely not mind.

347
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,910
You don't understand...

348
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,550
They didn't move away.

349
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,680
Their whole family died.

350
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,470
All are dead!

351
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:29,590
♫ A solitary sailboat is drifting everywhere with no boundary ♫

352
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,080
♫ Travel alone with no support ♫

353
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,700
♫ My heart isn't an isolated island ♫

354
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,730
♫ Changing mind and fluctuating only takes one second ♫

355
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,110
♫ The world is the embrace ♫

356
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:54,100
♫ Only love is the remedy for heart ♫

357
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:01,190
♫ A solitary sailboat is drifting everywhere with no boundary ♫

358
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,360
♫ Travel alone with no support ♫

359
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,730
Meow!

360
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,300
♫ My heart isn't an isolated island ♫

361
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,940
♫ Changing mind and fluctuating only takes one second ♫

362
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,630
Meow!

363
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,430
- Don't come near!
- Who told you to bully me, Older Brother Yue!

364
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,640
♫ The world is the embrace ♫

365
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,210

367
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:33,400
- Older Brother Yue, don't run.
- Don't come close.

368
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,910
It's me.

369
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,450
Mister Yun, why do you want to see me?

370
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,810
I have some matters that I want to ask you.

371
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,380
Weren't we just together earlier?

372
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,900
I have some things to ask you.

373
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,380
In this manor, it's better that we don't have private interactions.

374
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,950
If Qi Zhen notices, it will foil our great plan.

375
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,530
What are you doing?

376
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:20,360
I know... I know that I've acknowledged the enemy as my father.

377
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,840
I know that the 78 lives inside the Heir Apparent's Manor are still not resting in peace.

378
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,600
I also know that a deep family grudge like that must be avenged.

379
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,000
For all of these, I'm willing to follow your arrangements.

380
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,310
I just want to beg you—

381
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,150
Beg what?

382
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,300
Don't make it difficult for her.

383
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,400
Who is "her?"

384
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,730
Qi Yun.

385
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,070
We grew up together.

386
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:57,650
Although she's willful, she's very kind.

387
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,250
I've always known that there was someone in her heart.

388
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,690
Today, I finally learned

389
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,430
that it was actually you.

390
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,530
Older brother,

391
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,250
I only ask that you don't use her to take revenge.

392
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,990
She has nothing to do with this.

393
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,490
This is the first time you call me "older brother," but it's to beg for mercy for the enemy's daughter.

394
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,790
In your eyes, is she more important than anything else?

395
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,800
I've never told anyone how I survived that day.

396
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,210
Don't be afraid. Here. Here.

397
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,110
In one night, everyone in the Heir Apparent's Manor got massacred.

398
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,800
Good thing, Mister Qiu bribed the assassin beforehand;

399
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,480
hence, our lives were saved.

400
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,080
You were still very small then.

401
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,930
You were kept inside a winter gown and taken away.

402
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,200
While I can only lie down among the pile of corpses.

403
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,290
Qi Zhen was afraid for any lapses,

404
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:44,810
so he had all the corpses buried in the unmarked burial grounds overnight.

405
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,200
And I got buried with the pile of corpses.

406
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,760
I felt that I wouldn't survive.

407
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,420
But in that dark deep abyss,

408
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,840
I heard father and mother.

409
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,760
They were calling for justice.

410
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,870
I heard uncles and cousins.

411
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,110
They were all crying.

412
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,020
Until now, I couldn't forget the stench of blood that night.

413
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,990
They were all just by my side.

414
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,440
Gazing at me. Watching me.

415
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,610
Repeatedly reminding me to not forget to give them justice,

416
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:53,370
to not forget to seek revenge for their grievances.

417
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:06,620
Sometimes, I really envy you for not knowing

418
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:12,750
how it feels to watch your loved ones dying right in front of you.

419
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,620
You don't understand how it feels

420
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,420
to feed on your loved ones' corpses just to survive.

421
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,640
Just for those 78 lives that died from injustice,

422
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,130
I can do anything.

423
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,880
Even to the point of betraying myself.

424
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,460
Hence, don't beg me for those unimportant hypocrisies.

425
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,420
It's no use. I haven't believed in those since a long time ago.

426
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,570
Even if you're my biological younger brother,

427
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,190
even if I have painstakingly searched for you for fifteen years, so what?

428
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,250
On this road to revenge, if you hinder me,

429
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,270
I will also eliminate you.

430
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,180
I didn't know.

431
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,920
I didn't know.

432
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,210
I didn't know. I didn't know anything!

433
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,820
I didn't know.

434
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,710
I didn't know. I didn't know anything.

435
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,050
It's better that you end your feelings for Qi Yun as soon as possible.

436
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,290
Even without the grudge between our two families,

437
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,140
- you are just a bodyguard raised inside the Prime Minister's Manor.
- I didn't know.

438
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,940
Taking you in as a godson is just a method of Qi Zhen to make you work for him loyally.

439
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,240
How is it possible for him to marry off his only daughter to you?

440
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,020
Leave Qi Zhen.

441
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,150
Coincidentally, there are things that we must quickly handle.

442
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,030
Today, I've checked Prefecture Princess' pulse again.

443
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,620
Although her life isn't in danger, she's still ill.

444
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,070
Although these medicinal ingredients aren't rare and precious ones,

445
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,070
they only grow in the mountains.

446
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,030
To get them will require a huge effort.

447
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,610
If that's the case, we should just send someone appropriate to gather or buy them.

448
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,680
These medicines must be personally gathered by me.

449
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,840
If others go, I fear that they might choose the wrong ones.

450
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,860
It's just that there are a lot of bandits in the woods.

451
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,460
Hope that Prime Minister can arrange for a highly skilled fighter that is trustworthy to escort me.

452
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,840
I'll be at ease too this way.

453
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,570
Let Yun Heng go with you.

454
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,860
He's reliable.

455
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,840
Okay. I'll set out tomorrow morning.

456
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,240
This doesn't seem to be the path to Tongchuan.

457
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,760
Of course not.

458
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,590
Going to Tongchuan to gather herbs is just an excuse I gave Qi Zhen.

459
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,300
The place that you're really going to is South Departure.

460
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,280
South Departure? That's Tang Bonian's encampment.

461
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,510
What are you thinking exactly?

462
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,570
Qi Zhen secretly wrote Tang Bonian a letter asking him to go to the capital alone.

463
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,700
Do you know about this?

464
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,890
So what?

465
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,320
I want you to intercept the letter.

466
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,220
What?

467
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,570
I'm already weary from waiting for you.

468
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:57,170
It's so late. If you still didn't come, I was going to do a night visit to Dense Beam Palace Hall again.

469
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,660
Got it. You earned merit for fetching her.

470
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Here's your reward.

471
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,030
I heard that you've been sleeping with Tang Zirong every night and are in such good spirits.

472
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,030
It's really hard for you to still see me when you've been having sex every night.

473
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,640
Jealous?

474
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,360
Of course. How come you get to have hugs left and right in this palace every day,

475
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,840
while I have to guard that cold palace daily and be up all night

476
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,750
for I fear that you might call me anytime?

477
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,560
Why is that so?

478
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,160
If not because the First Princess is good to me, I would have left long ago and not played with you anymore.

479
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,540
I don't believe everything that you said.

480
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,160
If you were going to leave, you would have done so.

481
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,120
If I really leave, don't come looking for me.

482
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,170
A person shouldn't be over confident.

483
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,460
But I am just this kind of person.

484
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,600
Say it. Why did you call me here?

485
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,500
Is First Princess treating you very well?

486
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,560
Yes. Why?

487
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,330
I want you to help me ask her a few questions.

488
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,760
What questions?

489
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,010
Take this.

490
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,250
This Mystic Spirit Leaf can absorb a human's thoughts.

491
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:28,000
As long as there is a memory, you can project them through this leaf.

492
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,090
I want you to help me ask her a few questions.

493
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,130
What do you want to know?

494
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:41,820
I want you to ask her why her Princess Virtue status in Megrez Empire got taken away back then.

495
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,930
What was the reason that she severed her ties with Prince Virtue that night?

496
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,900
What other secrets has she not said?

497
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,890
Do you want to use First Princess' trust towards me to help you get this information?

498
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,700
Yes.

499
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,380
I can't help you.

500
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,330
Why?

501
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,500
That's right. She indeed looked crazy,

502
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,670
but she is sincere towards me.

503
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,070
Since I was little, I didn't have a mother.

504
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:21,960
Although it was just a few days, she also has made me feel how it was to be doted on by a mother.

505
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,490
Hence, you asking me to use this trust to fool her into telling me this information, I'm unable to do it.

506
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,880
Even if it's for me.

507
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:38,490
You've helped and saved me.

508
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,790
But I stayed here not because of our bet

509
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,220
nor to break my seal.

510
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,460
I will repay my gratitude, but not through this manner.

511
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,070
You only met her for a short time.

512
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,530
Yes, she and I have only met for a short time,

513
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,300
but I already understand how pitiful and sad she is.

514
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,550
If I destroy even her last thoughts, that's being too cruel.

515
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:13,530
What if the seal in your body won't get removed because of this?

516
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,660
Are you sure of your decision?

517
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:25,290
If there are things that can only be obtained by exchanging other people's trust,

518
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,280
I'd rather not want it.

519

[Secure Borders Always]

520
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,640
Did Prime Minister give any instructions?

521
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,090
None.

522
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:57,070
He only said that General must immediately set out after receiving the letter.

523
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,100
Since it is Prime Minister's order, I will surely obey it.

524
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,550
Official, please go rest first.

525
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,360
Allow me to change my clothing and I will immediately set out to the capital to fulfill the order.

526
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,000
Yes.

527
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,430
You also know that Qi Zhen is a paranoid person.

528
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,240
Now that Tang Zhirong is solely receiving His Majesty's favor,

529
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,910
Qi Zhen instead is growing suspicious.

530
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,530
He is worried that Tang Bonian is holding military power and is receiving abundant royal graces.

531
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,100
He might be having second thoughts.

532
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,460
Hence, letting Tang Bonian enter into the capital is a trap.

533
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,940
One, this is a way to test his loyalty.

534
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,880
Second, Qi Zhen has several pawns in the South Departure Army?

535
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,400
Are these people making a move?

536
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,330
Correct. Once he leaves his camp,

537
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:52,140
these people will take the opportunity to steal the power over his army of 150,000.

538
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,530
Could you guys have palmed off the letter?

539
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,300
The letter that Tang Bonian saw

540
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,970
was Qi Zhen asking him to bring an army of 50,000 northwards back to the capital.

541
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:15,790
When you go back, stay by Qi Zhen's side like how you used to.

542
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:20,860
What Qi Zhen must pay us back is not only his own life.

543

[Secure Borders Always]

544
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,460
This is illogical.

545
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,600
Technically speaking, there is no war nor disaster right now.

546
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,100
Why would Prime Minister ask me to bring an army of 50,000 northwards to enter the capital?

547
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,890
This matter is very fishy.

548
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,630
General, you must be careful.

549
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,460
Rashly take an army northwards.

550
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,890
If I don't handle it well, it's a capital crime.

551
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,070
But if it's really an order from the Prime Minister

552
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,370
and I disobeyed it...

553
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,930
I will also end up dead.

554
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,370
No. We can't just waste time here.

555
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,040
- Immediately write a secret letter to the capital to verify this matter.
- Yes.

Reporting!

557
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,070
General, a person from Capital Kun is here asking to see you.

558
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,080
He said that his name is Yun Hen.

559
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,540
Yun Hen? Mister Yun! Quickly let him in!

560
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,060
Yes.

561
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,550
Tang Bonian was born as a commoner.

562
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,000
He is a very cautious person.

563
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,400
To let him lead an army of 50,000 back to the capital just based on a letter from Capital Kun,

564
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,900
my guess is he won't easily set out and will try to verify it.

565
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,590
If we want to remove these doubts from him,

566
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:46,400
then we need a trusted aide of the Prime Minister to personally tell him that everything is true.

567
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,240
And that person is you.
