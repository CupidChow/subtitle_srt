00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,370
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,550
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:23,560
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,850
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,970
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,510
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,500
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,040
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,720
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,710
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,900
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,610
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,350
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,420
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,450
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,810
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,740
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,490
~ Episode 58 ~

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,340
- Give that to me.
- I won't.

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,620
Are you going to give it to me or not?

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,550
I have a way to make you hand it to me.

25
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,400
Don't come out. Remember that.

26
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,430
Where did you hide that child?

27
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,500
Not saying?

28
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,040
Okay then. Men, drag her out.

29
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,620
Do the Combing Death Penalty.

30
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,770
Yes!

31
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,080
Auntie Wan! Auntie Wan!

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,260
Why did you come out?

33
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,960
Your Majesty, I beg you. She's still a chlid.

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,420
I beg you to spare her life! I beg you!

35
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,990
- I'll give this to you!
- Spare her life!

36
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,460
I'll give this to you.

37
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,860
- I beg you to stop bullying Auntie Wan!
- I beg you.

38
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,110
I beg you. Stop hurting Auntie Wan!

39
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,090
- She's still little! I beg you!
- I beg you.

40
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,750
I beg you...

41
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,280
- Drag them all out!
- Yes!

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,330
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Wuming!

43
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,590
- Your Majesty!
- Auntie Wan!

44
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,740
Don't!

45
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,020
She ordered them to beat Auntie Wan to death and said that she was going to have me beaten to death, too.

46
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,260
There was a guard that couldn't stand by idly watching so he secretly left me one last breath.

47
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,440
- That day, I had died once. 
- Stop crying...

48
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,560
- That day, I got revived. 
- Stop crying... Come, stop crying...

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,760
I was able to live again without any memories, without any past.

50
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,160
Blame me.

51
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,970
Blame all on me.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,030
Blame all on me.

53
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,690
All these were my fault.

54
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,430
If not because of me, how could you have suffered so much?

55
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,830
Blame me.

56
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,220
Blame it all on me.

57
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,300
I heard that it was exactly like this on the night that you were born.

58
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,380
There was a flowery scent that diffused throughout the palace.

59
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,220
It was like paradise.

60
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,980
I even heard that you were able to smile upon birth.

61
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,220
When you smiled, the flowers blossomed more.

62
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,720
Too bad... I never saw all of those.

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,570
But who can I blame?

64
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,370
If not because I yearned for an empty fame and left mother and daughter behind,

65
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,290
how would you both have suffered so much torment?

66
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,910
What citizens?

67
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,170
What world?

68
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,660
If a man couldn't even protect his own wife and child,

69
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,310
so what if he becomes a hero?

70
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,460
I... failed as a husband!

71
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:16,150
I... failed as a father!

72
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,310
You must be blaming me.

73
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,500
Actually, even I have looked down on myself.

74
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,220
This hand once made it its duty to protect the world.

75
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,710
But now, it's drenched with blood.

76
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,630
It has cruelly killed numerous lives.

77
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,320
I know that I'm utterly devoid of conscience, and willingly helped a tyrant.

78
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,950
Do you know why I did all those?

79
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,080
Because I wanted to find you and your mother.

80
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,070
You wanted to find me?

81
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,560
You wanted to find me and mother?

82
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,570
Do you know what I find the most regretful thing in this life of mine?

83
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,070
That I have never seen my parents.

84
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,870
And I didn't know why they didn't want me.

85
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,740
I've numerously imagined my true identity.

86
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:48,610
I've imagined... standing in front of them and telling them,

87
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,130
"Your daughter has grown up.

88
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,650
I didn't bring you shame."

89
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,040
But I never imagined that the scenario would be like how it is today.

90
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:24,060
All the eternal separation (due to death), breaking up of families,

91
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,150
was all because of that royal throne.

92
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,140
Royal throne.

93
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,990
I know that I'm not qualified to ask you to acknowledge me as your father.

94
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,220
Just for those obsessions, just for that great world justice,

95
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,590
how many people have given up their loved ones?

96
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,520
But I can't care about that much anymore.

97
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,370
I'm standing here today.

98
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,760
I just want you to look at me.

99
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm telling you that your daughter has grown up.

100
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,060
You...

101
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,100
You see if I look a lot like Mother.

102
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,800
Father.

103
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,050
Daughter.

104
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,230
Father!

105
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,530
My daughter.

106
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,930
Arrest this witch!

107
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,140
This witch is confusing people.

108
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,230
Even Crown Prince Wuji got bewitched by her!

109
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,200
Arrest her!

110
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,900
Why are you all not moving?

111
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,150
Disobeying the royal command is punishable by death!

112
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,330
Everyone knows the legend of the Plough Queen and the phoenix bathing in fire.

113
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,670
Only the legitimate ruler of Plough bearing the phoenix spirituality

114
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,440
can reopen the offering altar and call out the fire phoenix from the Young Phoenix Lake.

115
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,810
This phenomenon today can only prove one thing.

116
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,890
She is the true legitimate ruler of Plough.

117
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,030
I, Tang Yizhong, am willing to loyally serve Your Majesty.

118
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm willing to loyally serve Your Majesty!

119
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,730
Liar! Liar!

120
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,740
All of you are liars!

121
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,860
You... just wanted to steal my royal throne

122
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,030
that you didn't mind fabricating all these schemes.

123
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,580
Crown Prince Wuji are you trying to destroy my Plough?

124
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,860
You are an elder.

125
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,320
I initially didn't want to announce your crimes.

126
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,830
But this time, you just have to force me.

127
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,090
Everyone, listen!

128
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,970
For these past years, Feng Xuan has committed all kinds of evil and is not worthy of any pardon.

129
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,370
I'll just enumerate the three most important crimes among them.

130
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,200
First: Murdering Feng Qi and attempting to kill her daughter.

131
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,750
Through an illegitimate bloodline, she usurped the throne.

132
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,210
Second: Using the whereabouts of Feng Qi and her daughter to force General Alioth to kill and serve you.

133
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,460
Doing all kinds of unbearable acts.

134
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,850
Third: Just to cover up the truth about Young Phoenix Lake, you have killed numerous people.

135
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,570
Your crimes are so atrocious and are unpardonable.

136
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,270
Where is your evidence?

137
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,940
You are making irresponsible remarks.

138
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,290
For all these that you said, do you have any evidence?

139
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,980
Evidence? Of course, there is!

140
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,790
Second Older Sister, do you still remember me?

141
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,060
Feng Wu?

142
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,150
Aren't you long dead?

143
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,640
Do you want me to prove the words that Crown Prince Wuji said earlier

144
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,750
or do you want me to help you truthfully narrate your other crimes?

145
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,990
It was you who was supposed to kill him then.

146
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,540
He's now standing in front of you. Aren't you still going to make your move?

147
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,510
Do you want him to kill you in revenge?

148
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,390
Shut up!

149
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,790
It was you who blackmailed me to work for you and kill people.

150
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,520
You forced me to be utterly devoid of conscience.

151
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,370
This pair of hands of mine have committed great sins and are unforgivable.

152
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,440
But today,

153
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,750
I've found my daughter.

154
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,500
For everything, we can now make a closure!

155
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,260
Dear Shuo?

156
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,730
Dear Shuo, let me tell you.

157
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,130
When Feng Qi died, she was like a useless ant.

158
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,030
She just fell without making any sound.

159
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,400
It was me who seized the throne and I even got to have you.

160
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,910
I am the true victor, dear Shuo.

161
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,790
Dear Shuo.

162
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,670
You want to reunite with your daughter?

163
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,800
You first have to ask for my permission.

164
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,270
Isn't it just dying?

165
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,860
Just take this life if you like it!

166
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,320
Father...

167
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,180
Just to force me to serve her and kill people back then,

168
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,450
I didn't know where she got this method

169
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,960
of using the lives of two people as a guide in making an oath.

170
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,230
From then on, as long as I'm alive,

171
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,200
I mustn't disobey her command.

172
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,070
I want you...

173
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,950
to kill her.

174
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,340
- Father!
- This kind of oath came from Firmament. It has a strong restricting power.

175
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,670
If you unilaterally break the oath, you will suffer a rebound effect and your life will be in danger.

176
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,620
I know.

177
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,300
Father, since it's an agreement, if it can be made then it can be dissolved.

178
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,780
Fuyao and I will help you. With the three of us working together, we might be able to break it.

179
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,080
It's just that your lifetime of martial arts skills might be gone forever.

180
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,970
There must be another way, Father.

181
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,470
Don't.

182
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,190
No need.

183
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:22,240
I finally learned of the truth of the past and found you today.

184
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm already content.

185
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,180
Child, I'd rather die

186
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,330
than get controlled by our enemy and live neither like human nor a ghost!

187
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,950
- You must not!
- Father, don't!

188
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,320
Dear Shuo!

189
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,070
Just for a dead person, is it worth it?

190
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,000
She has always been in my heart! Always been!

191
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,460
Looks like... I'm the one who lost.

192
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,340
Heaven gave rise to the Big Dipper.

193
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,150
Its second star is Megrez.

194
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,290
It's fifth star is Alioth.

195
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,270
Alioth is the most seductive but most faithful of them all,

196
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,190
able to turn the atmosphere into a love prison.

197
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,620
Since time immemorial, it's hardest to discern a person's incorruptibility and chastity.

198
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:57,520
I... finally believed it earlier.

199
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,390
Dear Shuo.

200
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,300
[Illusion Palace]

201
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,820
Have you seen it?

202
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,260
The day that the fire phoenix gallops in the sky

203
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,450
will be the time when the evil fire ignites once again.

204
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,380
Very soon...

205
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,690
this whole Five Regions will again become your Five Regions.

206
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,640
All of them will become Di Feitian's believers and servants!

207
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,520
All of them will become Di Feitian's believers and servants!

208
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,960
Older Sis Fuyao finally found her real father and she's even a princess.

209
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,010
What is this exactly?

210
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,780
We then have to start the story with Young Phoenix Lake.

211
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,060
Rumors say that there is an auspicious fire phoenix guarding inside there that's suppressing an evil item.

212
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,290
Huh? An evil item?

213
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,710
It can't be a man-eating monster or ghost, right?

214
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,710
Have you heard of evil fire of Di Feitian?

215
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,600
Are you talking about that man who caused great destruction in Firmament thousands of years ago?

216
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,520
I heard my grandfather talk about that.

217
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,860
He said that during the Firmament Great War, citizens were plunged into calamity and great chaos that people had no way of making a living.

218
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,030
But in the end, good defeated evil.

219
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,630
Everyone united and eliminated him.

220
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,080
Hence, we have the present Five Regions. Am I right?

221
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,790
These official document versions like that have been edited to avoid the important details.

222
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,930
When the evil fire of Di Feitian was at its peak, he had a huge rebel army.

223
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,220
The Five Regions then was powerless to resist him.

224
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,410
How then was the war situation reversed?

225
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,660
As an evil fire that futilely attempted to purge with blood all the living things in this world,

226
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,950
even if he lost his body, as long as there is still a remnant of his sense,

227
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,700
he can then endanger Five Regions anytime.

228
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,920
That powerful?

229
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:58,520
At that year, Chang Qingzi divided it into two and used all his strength to seal them just to completely destroy the evil sense.

230
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,800
Divided into two.

231
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,840
Then doesn't that mean that the remnant sense is still around?

232
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,250
Is there no way to completely destroy it?

233
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,790
No way.

234
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,760
There is nothing in this world that can completely destroy a remnant sense.

235
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,200
But as long as we can stop those two parts into uniting as one,

236
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,140
this Di Feitian will then have no chance to bring harm to the mortal world.

237
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,090
Right. That's quite true.

238
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,250
Say, just putting these two parts of the remnant sense far apart and never coming together, then won't everything be fine?

239
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,870
Hence, Chang Qingzhi sealed them

240
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,690
in Firmament's Mt. Emotionless and Plough's Young Phoenix Lake,

241
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,380
which are also the highest and deepest areas in the Five Regions.

242
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,560
What you then mean is that the item that the huge phoenix in Young Phoenix Lake is guarding,

243
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,360
is that remnant sense of Di Feitian?

244
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,690
Half of it.

245
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,350
Usually, after the fire phoenix flies up to the sky, it quickly returns to the Young Phoenix Lake.

246
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,760
As long as the remnant sense is around, no one must lower down their guard.

247
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,330
But this time—

248
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,170
What about this time?

249
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,400
Not only did the strange changes in Young Phoenix Lake not stop, but it's getting worse.

250
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:17,220
But Older Sis Fuyao indeed is the legitimate royal heiress of Plough that can suppress the phoenix.

251
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,660
This matter probably has nothing to do with her, right?

252
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,730
I'm worried that all these strange occurrences

253
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,590
are because the power of the remnant sense couldn't be contained anymore.

254
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,290
I fear that the other half remnant sense in Mt. Emotionless is already making some movements now.

255
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,760
Actually, I feel that you shouldn't be overly worried, Crown Prince.

256
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,510
Think about it. There are still so many great masters in the Holy Land Firmament.

257
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,440
And each of them are very powerful.

258
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,760
Even if it's able to escape, they surely will be able to put it down.

259
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,040
Okay.

260
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,660
I'll go in and check on Fuyao then.

261
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,400
Okay.

268
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,260
When I was young, I understood a principle.

269
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,080
For children that are unloved,

270
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,830
they can't cry, feel hurt, or even be sad

271
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,430
because they aren't qualified for it and have no path to retreat.

272
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,660
Tears will only exchange for more troubles.

273
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,360
There are so many injustices in this world.

274
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,540
Once born, you are separated into classes

275
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,560
and I just happened to be of the lowest class.

276
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,800
I can blame, I can hate,

277
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,620
but I accept misfortunes as decreed by fate.

278
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,820
I always clenched my teeth and told myself that I will become strong.

279
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,910
I will become stronger than all of them so I can survive.

I'm really very tired.

283
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,430

With me, no matter who, they can't steal from you or bully you,

287
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,490

Feng Xuan didn't kill my mother,

I don't blame you.

306

That year,

307
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,380
it was you who made me believe that there are beautiful things in the world.

308
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,900
It was you who gave me the hope to continue living.

Now,

310
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,030
you made me trust in the human heart again,

311
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
believe that Heaven didn't abandon me.

312
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,900
I used to complain,

313
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,390
"Why is it so unfair that I have a suffering fate?"

314
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,730
But now I thank those hardships.

315
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,490
They made me who I am today.

316
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,800
It was to meet you.

317
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:47,400
So all that I have been through, they're worth it.

318
00:27:54,370 --> 00:28:00,340
I am willing to use this lifetime to grow old with you.

319
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,040
No matter when, where,

320
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,960
in Heaven or on Earth,

321
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,860
we will never separate.

322
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,300
Are you really leaving?

323
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,320
I'm just going to look for a quiet place to meditate and pray Buddhist scriptures.

324
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,890
In the future, we surely will meet again.

325
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,890
I'm an evil person whose hands are full of dirty blood.

326
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,960
If I'm able to pray for a chance to repent for my sins in front of Buddha,

327
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,620
then that will be my greatest luck in this lifetime.

328
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,500
Are you sure that you can't stay for a few more days?

329
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:13,300
As long as it's in your heart, what's the difference between one day or thousands of days?

330
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,670
Child, remember,

331
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,400
no matter how hard your future path will be, there will always be an end.

332
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:29,060
Being able to be with the man you truly love, any degree of difficulty won't be too much.

333
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,460
Being able to find an intimate lover in this lifetime, you must treasure it well.

334
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,580
Don't disappoint his love.

335
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,270
Don't be like me.

336
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,530
When I returned, I missed out on your mother.

337
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,120
Now, I can only live with regrets.

338
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,200
"The northern winds intermittently blow in a faint aroma.

339
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,250
The heavy snow has increased in the early morning and makes everything look white.

340
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,610
The position of Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid shows us that it's the early winter season.

341
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,170
Those twinkling stars shine and make the night sky bright."

342
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:14,450
That was... a letter she wrote to me before.

343
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,550
How did you know?

344
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:22,070
Mother kept this letter.

345
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,110
Afterwards, Auntie Wan gave it to me.

346
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,430
When Wuji entered the palace that year, he taught me the words written on them.

347
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,590
Mother did that because she wished

348
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:41,230
that one day, I could tell this to you when I see you.

349
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,250
A man should prioritize the world.

350
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:51,430
She didn't bear any grudge against you nor hated you.

351
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,430
Treat her well.

352
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,210
Father...

353
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,330
For your father, the only things left in this royal palace are pain and guilt.

354
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:46,550
He has his own wishes, things to part with, and things that he couldn't bear.

355
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,140
Leaving, for him, might be the best ending.

356
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,360
Slow down.

357
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,330
Be careful not to slip.

358
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,230
Fifth Older Brother.

359
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,190
For you.

360
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,460
Stop sewing from now on.

361
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,380
Don't you like it?

362
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,570
Or did you think that I've sewn so poorly?

363
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,080
Or that the design isn't good?

364
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,570
I'll take it back then.

365
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,410
I didn't say that it's ugly.

366
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,250
I like it.

367
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,650
Look.

368
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,290
You are not good in doing sewing crafts like this.

369
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,730
Why then must you torment yourself just for me?

370
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,290
Look at these hands, so many needle marks.

371
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,770
- Are they painful?
- No.

372
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,660
Stop sewing from now on.

373
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,740
I'll listen to your words.

374
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,210
Your Majesty!

375
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,130
A letter from Plough.

376
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,980
Fuyao has found out about her true identity

377
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,860
and will be ascending to the throne of Plough soon.

378
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,260
- Here. Your medicines.
- Thanks.

379
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,870
- Go get your medicine.
- Thanks.

380
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,310
Teacher, there's no more gastrodia.

381
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,590
Then use the same amount of uncaria stem to mix in the medicine

382
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,330
or go look if there are any mountain goat horns.

383
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,020
- Okay.
- Take this prescription for a few days.

384
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,090
[Poisonous-tongued Doctor, it's been a long time since we've exchanged letters. Hope you're doing fine]

385
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,730
[In this Plough trip, I was able to find out about my identity and have reunited with my father.]

386
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,330
[Soon, I will be ascending to the throne. For such a joyous occasion, ]

387
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,930
[I've invited Zhan Beiye and Yalan Zhu to celebrate with me.]

388
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,710
[Hope those two can come soon. I'll wait for your arrival. ~ Fuyao]

389
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,800
Thanks, Medical Sage. Thank you, little Medical Sage.

390
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,270
If not because of you two, our whole village would have died in this disastrous illness.

391
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,440
Thank you, our saviors.

392
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,670
Yun'er, I have to leave for a while and go to Plough.

393
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,090
When will you be leaving?

394
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,560
When will you return?

395
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,490
I must set out immediately.

396
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,150
As for when I'll be back, I still am not sure.

397
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,590
At present, your stubborn illness has been controlled.

398
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,670
Even without the Dragon Scale Armor, you'll be fine.

399
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,930
Just be careful not to contract any colds.

400
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,770
Once I leave,

401
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,820
you can also leave this place and go anywhere you want to go.

402
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,380
I don't have any place I want to go and no place to go to.

403
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,700
Staying here is quite good, too.

404
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,990
This place... is a bit too remote.

405
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,210
As time goes by, you'll find it too poor and too boring.

406
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,360
But they need me.

407
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,730
Since I was little, it has always been others who take care of me.

408
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,480
I have never imagined that one day, I will be taking care of others

409
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,220
- until I met them.
- Goodbye!

410
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,840
It's my first time feeling myself this valuable.

411
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:03,390
There are a lot of medicinal ingredients that haven't been stocked and half of the village hasn't fully recovered yet.

412
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,200
Hence, I want to stay.

413
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,160
It's already late. You go back first.

414
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,080
Then...

415
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,510
When you return, the big head shrimps in the river must have grown fatter.

416
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,700
- I—
- Okay.

417
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,450
Sweet and sour shrimp.

418
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,680
Once I'm back, I'll eat as much as you can cook.

419
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,430
Start the coronation.

420
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,590
In this best of years, and most auspicious of months,

421
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,090
we complete the coronation by putting unto you your robe.

422
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,650
Keep guard the virtues of your womanhood.

423
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,890
Guard reverently your demeanor.

424
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,410
Preserve the integrity of your virtue.

425
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,690
May your years be infinite.

426
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,890
May the heavens bless you.

427
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,450
I will now be bearing the wonderful blessings of the heavens until I grow old and will never forget it.

428
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,660
I will always remember Royal Uncle's teachings.

429
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,850
Conferring of the scepter!

430
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,720
Accept the plans of the heavens and activate the fate of the world.

431
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,050
By the grace of Heaven, as the Crown Prince of Megrez

432
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:19,510
confers you this mythical scepter, confers you the title of the Monarch of Plough.

433
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,830
Always consider the sake of the Five Regions and bring blessings to your citizens.

434
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,000
Thank you, Crown Prince Wuji.

435
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,710
I, the Monarch of Plough, dare not forget about the Five Regions.

436
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,730
Megrez is willing to make an eternal alliance with your Plough.

437
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,300
How about it?

438
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,550
Let me think about it.

439
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,130
Promulgation of the decree!

440
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,590
As written on the decree, Plough Nation has been established for thousands of years.

441
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,420
With the queen governing the state affairs, the citizens enjoyed a clear and bright life.

442
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,970
Today, there is a Miss Feng who is mandated by Heaven.

443
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,540
Her splendid virtue meets the requirement of the heavens and reaches nature.

444
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,360
The legitimate family is touched by Heaven's' blessing.

445
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,280
Profoundly purifying and announcing it,

446
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,840
the legitimate royal Feng is now in position, Plough will now have long-lasting auspicious fate.

447
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,060
God of Heaven and God of Earth, may you bless and protect us.

448
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,180
That's all!

449
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,030
God of Heaven and God of Earth, may you bless and protect us!

450
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,400
Monarch of Plough!

451
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,330
Monarch of Plough!

452
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,840
