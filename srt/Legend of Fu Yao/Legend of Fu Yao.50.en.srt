♫ I start to dance nimble and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,490
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:23,730
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,850
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,960
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,820
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,500
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,060
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,670
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,770
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,930
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,630
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful ♫

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,350
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,430
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:21,460
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,790
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,720
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

~ Episode 50 ~

22
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,350
If... you really want to use a life as an offering...

23
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,290
then just take mine.

24
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,560
But you all must fulfill your promise.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,860
I want you to eliminate the muddled king and return peace to Heaven Fiend.

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,430
General!

27
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,110
Zhan Beiye...

28
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,330
I'm fine.

29
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,080
Zhan Beiye...

30
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,610
I'm fine.

31
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,590
Why are you this stupid?

32
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,890
Without you, what will happen to the citizens of Heaven Fiend?

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,050
Without you, what will happen to me?

34
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,330
It's all right.

35
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,210
My life is worth nothing.

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,390
As long as it's for you, I'm willing to do anything.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,700
Go back...

38
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,840
Go back and tell Zhangsun Wuji...

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,050
to watch over Heaven Fiend in my behalf.

40
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,420
I don't want to...

41
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,320
I don't want to. Heaven Fiend is your Heaven Fiend.

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,950
You still are going to personally kill Zhan Nancheng,

43
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,040
personally save your Consort Mother.

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,620
I won't let you die...

45
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,010
Zhuzhu, silly girl,

46
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,860
if I can use my life to bring peace back to Heaven Fiend

47
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,920
and to return Consort Mother's safety,

48
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,070
this life is worth it already.

49
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,680
It's just that at this moment...

50
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,060
only then did I realize that the person I couldn't put down is you.

51
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,360
It's actually you.

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,620
I owe you so much...

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,620
No, you don't.

54
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,830
Promise me.

55
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,630
- No, I don't want to.
- Forget me.

56
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,840
I don't want to! I don't want to!

57
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,730
- Zhan Beiye.
- General!

58
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,510
- General!
- General!

Only I can save Fifth Older Brother. Let me do it.

62
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,950
My father told me. When you are pursuing a man, you must pursue the first!

63
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,680
The ones afterwards will all be of poor quality and repulsive!

64
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,070
Fifth Older Brother.

Fifth Older Brother.

79
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,010
Since you refused to let me follow you,

80
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,500
why then did you come here?

81
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,900
My temple is too small.

82
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,780
May Medical Sage just leave.

83
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,040
You know who I came here for.

84
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,040
I came here today to end all these.

85
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,700
Older Brother Yue!

86
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,640
Father is gravely sick.

87
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,650
He's getting worse every day.

88
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,410
After rushing back here from Capital Kun, he couldn't even get out of bed because of the rough travel.

89
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,900
He's already like this.

90
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,470
Can you stop making things difficult for him?

91
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,930
He's ill?

92
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,920
I came at the right time then.

93
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,870
You still found me.

94
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,830
Yun'er, get out first.

95
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,740
Mister Zong and I have things to discuss.

96
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,890
I knew that you'd come.

97
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,260
Only until today did I understand

98
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,140
that fame and power aren't that important anymore.

99
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,800
I just want to continue living.

100
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,860
Be with my Yun'er.

101
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,940
Letting me live well

102
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,350
and live my days by my Yun'er's side

103
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,910
are more precious than anything else.

104
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,690
Too bad.

105
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:10,450
I've realized all these too late.

106
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,700
What he said is right.

107
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,730
He's gravely ill.

108
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,990
He doesn't have that many days left to live.

109
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,940
I have a medicinal formula here that can save his life.

110
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,640
Go gather them.

111
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,780
If I wanted to kill him now, why must I take this much trouble?

112
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,690
From Capital Kun to Rock City, that's more than 2,000 li.

113
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,240
Did you come here just to tell me these things?

114
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,150
I owe your Xuanyuan family too much.

115
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,280
I painstakingly held on to this last breath

116
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,790
just to see you one last time.

117
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,390
I'm a sinner of Deep Water.

118
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,220
Also, the enemy of your family.

119
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,620
Whether this life should be killed or allowed to live,

120
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,900
you are at liberty to decide.

121
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
You are already a person that's about to die.

122
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,430
Why must I make the extra effort?

123
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,430
You indeed haven't changed.

124
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,670
But don't forget, I'm not Yun Hen.

125
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,750
In coming to see you today, I've put poison all over my clothes.

126
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,680
By exerting energy now, you're just hastening the effect of the poison.

127
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,240
Stop it and you might have a half incense time to live.

128
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,070
Just to see me, you really prepared for it.

129
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,360
Me, too.

130
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,660
Just to see you, don't you find it strange that I have the upperhand?

131
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,830
Smell this house.

132
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,940
Do you find the scent familiar?

133
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,050
You went to her?!

134
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,360
That's right. I've found her.

135
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,430
Palace Leader Fei Yan.

136
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,310
Just to see you, I pawned myself to her.

137
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,770
Do you think that you can hurt me with just that measly poisoned powder?

138
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,680
Young Heir Apparent, you're too naive.

139
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,590
Sleep for a while.

140
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,400
That is our Heaven Fiend's Ice Man Fruit.

141
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,700
I especially had them pick them for you to taste.

142
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,300
Your Majesty, this fruit is indeed novel and delicious.

143
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,300
It's just that... Your Majesty... especially dispatched 50,000 elite soldiers

144
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,400
to travel far just to pick these.

145
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,300
Isn't that... causing too much disturbance?

146
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,200
You don't understand this then.

147
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,700
The Ice Man Fruit only grows in the border between the Ice Land and Grassland.

148
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,400
And every year, it only bears fruit during the Frosting Day.

149
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,500
If you miss out, you won't be able to eat it anymore.

150
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,600
With such a precious and hard to find item,

151
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,000
tell me, is it more valuable or the 50,000 men?

152
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
Moreover,

153
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,400
didn't I especially pick them for you to taste, too?

154
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

155
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,300
It's just that...

156
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,200
there are only 300,000 guards inside and outside the palace right now.

157
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,800
150,000 of them are deployed someplace else.

158
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,200
And now, Your Majesty has dispatched 50,000 of them.

159
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,000
Inside and outside the palace, there are just 100,000 men.

160
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If something bad happens, this—

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's just going to be a few days.

162
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
How can it be so coincidental?

163
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Moreover, 100,000 men are also not that easy to defeat.

164
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
What is there to be afraid of?

165
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Your Majesty!

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,500
Your Majesty, an auspicious sign came from the sky.

167
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,970
This is the auspicious dragon riding the clouds,

168
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,100
a sign of great fortune!

169
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,090
Auspicious dragon riding the clouds?

170
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,200
Favored subject, there's something that you don't know.

171
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,000
The Sky Gate Ruin of Rock City observes the whole yin and yang.

172
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Whenever there is any mysterious or major matter in this world,

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,600
the clouds above the Sky Gate Ruin will show an anomalous image.

174
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,000
That's right. The auspicious dragon riding the wind has appeared.

175
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,600
I'm sure that our Heaven Fiend Nation will be experiencing a great joyous event soon.

176
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,600
It must be Your Majesty has made achievements that will be remembered forever.

177
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Even Heaven is happy for you.

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
What you said is reasonable...

179
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,000
Your Majesty, bad news!

180
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Your Majesty, we're in big trouble!

181
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,400
Your Majesty... big trouble!

182
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
What is it?

183
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,300
Prince Fierce... is fighting back.

184
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,500
Since the day before, Prince Fierce has led a huge army and is rushing towards here from Geya Desert.

185
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,400
Along the way, they were able to destroy all the important defense forts and important bases.

186
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,200
This military report was sent by the guarding general in Lunzhou.

187
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Calculating it,

188
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Prince Lie is already less than 100 li from Rock City.

189
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Useless!

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,890
How come he was able to attack that fast?

191
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,400
From Geya to Lunzhou, there are at least 200,000 soldiers.

192
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,500
How come... Have they all revolted?

193
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,000
Based on rumors, Prince Fierce is leading an army that's like Heaven's army.

194
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,200
They are invincible and no one was able to block them.

195
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,800
Where is everyone?

196
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,400
Spread my decree telling all the members of the inner court to come here!

197
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,700
Yes.

198
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,790
Yun'er.

199
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,760
Listen.

200
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,000
It's because you're my daughter. That's why he won't accept you.

201
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,950
For him, your kindness is not worth even a penny.

202
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,030
From the palace, I secretly escaped to join the competition here in Rock City.

203
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,800
I secretly came here to look for Older Brother Yue.

204
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,500
You knew it all. Am I right?

205
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,600
You kept following me not because you're worried about me,

206
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,400
nor to take me back.

207
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,700
It was to make Older Brother Yue find you, so you could do a sneak attack on him.

208
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,800
It's not a sneak attack.

209
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,200
It's a duel.

210
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,400
So you used me as bait.

211
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,600
Yun'er, do you know that I've been in public office for more than thirty years.

212
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,400
How many bloodbaths and storms have I experienced?

213
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,830
You won't know it.

214
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,200
I've painstakingly served for so many years.

215
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,890
I gave Deep Water a prosperous state.

216
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,400
But in the end, I became a criminal that everyone detests.

217
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,800
All of this was because of him.

218
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,800
Do you think that all of these are fair for me?

219
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,400
Then when you killed his whole family, was that fair?

220
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Father, all these are bad karma that you personally planted yourself.

221
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
The one that I wanted to kill wasn't Heir Apparent Wenyi.

222
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,200
It was my political rival.

223
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,200
The fight between political rivals has always been a life and death struggle.

224
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,300
Moreover, that time...

225
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,600
without the Dragon Scale Armor, you also would have died.

226
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,400
I did all these for you!

227
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,200
Stop using my life as an excuse!

228
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,800
The person who wanted the royal throne of Deep Water is you,

229
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,800
yet it must be me who must bear all your wild ambitions.

230
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,830
Have you asked for my opinion?

231
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,800
Have you asked me?

232
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,000
If I could have made a choice then I'd rather not have this life

233
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,600
than have a Dragon Scale Armor obtained by sacrificing numerous lives!

234
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:09,000
Even if all the people in this world treat me as a sinner,

235
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,300
you...

236
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,000
can't look at me that way.

237
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Zhan Beiye is actually alive?

238
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,600
Good. Let you rebel.

239
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Behead Imperial Concubine Jing now and hang her head on top of the city gates.

240
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,200
Let that Zhan Beiye see it.

241
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,300
Your Majesty, you must not.

242
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,800
Imperial Concubine Jing is the wife of the past king.

243
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,400
I fear just rashly ordering for her execution is unreasonable.

244
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,760
Bullshit! What unreasonable?

245
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,200
I'll have you executed, too.

246
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm loyal to Your Majesty.

247
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,200
Your Majesty, Imperial Concubine Jing indeed mustn't be killed.

248
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,600
Don't think that because I favor you, I won't kill you.

249
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Your Majesty, not only must we not kill Imperial Concubine Jing, we must take good care of her.

250
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,900
Because she's our bargaining chip against Prince Fierce.

251
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,080
What you said is reasonable, too.

252
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
Let her live then, but cut off her hands.

253
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
You must not!

254
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,300
I must not? Why?

255
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,600
What is your relationship with Zhan Beiye?

256
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,400
Just for an Imperial Concubine Jing, you dared to contradict me?

257
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,600
Your Majesty, Prince Fierce's army is now nearing the city.

258
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,100
It's impossible to let him submit to arrest.

259
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,600
Sending out an army now to face him is not a wise move, either.

260
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm thinking...

261
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,600
for us to bring his Consort Mother to his front

262
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,000
and then slowly, one cut at a time,

263
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,500
execute her by dismembering her body.

264
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,400
This way, even if Prince Fierce refuses to surrender, his army's morale will surely be in disarray.

265
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,100
We can use this chance.

266
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hence, we can't kill Imperial Concubine Jing now.

267
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,800
I like that idea.

268
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,600
Kill.

269
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:48,300
Your Majesty, although General's idea is wise, we still have to face them head on.

270
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,900
May I ask if the military power in the Gold of Heaven Fiend now can resist the rebel army?

271
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,200
Your Majesty, we should at least hold on until the reinforcement troops arrive.

272
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,600
Right... How many military soldiers do we have now?

273
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,500
Replying to Your Majesty. Initially, there was enough soldiers stationed here in Rock City.

274
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,300
It's just that Your Majesty earlier dispatched 50,000 elite soldiers to pick fruits in the east.

275
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,200
Calculating the remaining soldiers here in the city,

276
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,000
- I fear that we only have 80,000 elite soldiers.
- What should we do now?

277
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,600
It's just that most of these soldiers are guarding outside the city.

278
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,800
There are only 10,000 Gold of Heaven Fiend inside the palace.

279
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,000
Whether that is enough to resist the attack of Prince Fierce, I can't say.

280
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,200
What should we do?

281
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Your Majesty, we must quickly call for reinforcements.

282
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,400
The nearest army station from Rock City is at least 800 li.

283
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Even if they travel day and night to rush towards here, we still have to wait until tomorrow.

284
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Prince Fierce's army is less than 100 li from us now.

285
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,800
This... I fear that a distant water won't be able to put out a nearby fire.

286
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,800
You are my Generalissimo Black Tortoise.

287
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,300
If you're unable to come up with a countermeasure, I'll punish you!

288
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,600
Your Majesty, I fear that there is only one person now that can save us.

289
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
It's just that—

290
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,100
Who?

291
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,750
Who?

292
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,010
Quickly say it!

293
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,240
This person is... Crown Prince Wuji.

294
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,180
- Where's Zong Yue?
- Mister, you're awake.

295
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,880
He... left early this morning.

296
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,040
He didn't say much, just to not disturb you.

297
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,640
Oh, no. He's in trouble.

298
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,610
Hey, Mister, wait.

299
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,270
No, what's going on? Is he in danger?

300
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,310
Then go look for my teacher. Ask him. He knows everything.

301
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,320
- Your teacher?
- Yes, Mr. Wuji.

302
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,890
Correct. Go take me to him.

303
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,060
Let's go.

304
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,420
Teacher. Teacher!

305
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,110
This... Where is he?

306
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,270
I didn't see him go out.

307
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,470
There's no more time. Listen to me.

308
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,010
When Crown Prince returns, tell him that Zong Yue went to look for Qi Zhen without me.

309
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,010
Tell him to quickly think of a way.

310
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,770
Okay.

311
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,990
Grand Teacher.

312
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,500
Wuji, I've asked for you seven times,

313
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,190
but you kept avoiding me.

314
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,380
I finally used this kind of method to make you come here.

315
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,740
You have disappointed me.

316
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,720
Do you have any news about that girl I've asked you to search?

317
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,040
Your Majesty, don't forget.

318
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,660
Crown Prince Wuji still has an army of 100,000 in his hands.

319
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,690
General, are you talking about that 100,000 Mutual Aid Army?

320
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,660
That's right. That 100,000 strong Mutual Aid Army is 50 li from here.

321
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,660
These 100,000 men don't belong to any nation and were organized to ensure peace.

322
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,890
It's just that being the crown prince of the Five Regions, Crown Prince Wuji has the power to mobilize them.

323
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:47,090
These 100,000 men are also the nearest army from us.

324
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,640
Let me ask you.

325
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,160
Do Crown Prince Wuji and Zhan Beiye have any collusion?

326
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,030
They do.

327
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,840
Crown Prince Wuji has indeed been supporting Prince Fierce to ascend to the throne.

328
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,530
Since that's the case, you even ask me to open my city gates to welcome Crown Prince and his army into my city.

329
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,130
What intentions are you harboring?

330
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,150
I'm trying to help Your Majesty solve your problem.

331
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,460
Tell me about it.

332
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,070
Actually, whether it's you or Prince Fierce,

333
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,680
the two princes of Megrez

334
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,740
are just fighting to gain the political support of Heaven Fiend.

335
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,490
Before, Prince Assist kept fawning on you.

336
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,730
Hence, you chose to support him.

337
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,900
This way, Crown Prince Wuji can only stand by Prince Fierce's side.

338
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,990
To put it bluntly, the two Megrez princes are just fighting to earn the support of Heaven Fiend.

339
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:54,790
Whoever sits on that royal throne is not really that important for them.

340
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,310
Moreover, it's now hard for Prince Assist to make a comeback.

341
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,110
Your Majesty, why don't you use this chance

342
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,640
to clearly stand by Crown Prince Wuji's side?

343
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,430
This way, why would Crown Prince Wuji support

344
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,420
a state traitor who has defied his superior and started a rebellion?

345
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,080
Your Majesty, if you're willing to build your nest of the best wood,

346
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,020
I think that Crown Prince Wuji is our best choice.

347
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,800
He's also your only choice.

348
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,760
But Crown Prince Wuji and I had a past conflict.

349
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,440
How can I make him help me?

350
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,550
I have been serving Crown Prince Wuji since I was little.

351
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,800
I know very well his personality and temper.

352
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,330
I'm willing to go convince Crown Prince Wuji.

353
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,310
Your Majesty.

354
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,320
Your Majesty, this is the only method that we have now.

355
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,780
If Crown Prince is able to mobilize the army,

356
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,390
I'll convince him to hand me the power to command them.

357
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,780
This way, even if Crown Prince still has other intentions,

358
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,510
it will just be futile.

359
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,130
Good!

360
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,260
Immediately look for Crown Prince Wuji and tell him to annihilate Zhan Beiye.

361
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,630
Everything else can be discussed!

362
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,820
I... am still looking.

363
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,210
After leaving Firmament, what have you been doing?

364
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,430
You incessantly schemed and fought openly and covertly.

365
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,290
Just for a measly Megrez crown prince position,

366
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,020
you wasted all your time and effort.

367
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,400
Is that empty fame of the secular world

368
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,210
worthy for you to fight and compete about?

369
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,870
Have you forgotten your identity?

370
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,690
You are the one predestined by the Mystic Spirit Leaf.

371
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,320
You are bearing the survival of the world on your shoulders.

372
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,130
Comparing the survival of the mortal world and the life of a woman, what's more important?

373
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,800
Do you still need me to explain?

374
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,920
I am incompetent.

375
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,050
I just wish to exert my measly effort for the good of Five Regions.

376
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,980
If you want Five Regions to be in peace, then quickly find that woman.

377
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,850
But I don't understand.

378
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,500
She's just a woman.

379
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,600
How could she have such enormous capabilities?

380
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,210
Why must we sacrifice an innocent person to obtain peace for the world?

381
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,240
I have thought that there must be a way that can benefit both parties.

382
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:39,180
No matter what, killing her is the most sound method.

383
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,030
You don't have much time left.

384
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:50,970
Wuji, don't blame me for being ruthless.

385
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,740
Grand Teacher.

386
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,790
Since you have been given an important task, you then have to find that woman on time.

387
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,410
If you're unable to fulfill the task, you then must suffer the punishment.

388
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,140
The laws of Firmament won't spare anyone.

389
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,050
The Six Mortal Flower here in Mt. Divine Evergreen

390
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,100
is where all Firmament disciples got their internal energy from.

391
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,960
At a young age, you were able to cultivate nineteen of them.

392
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,490
It's indeed a very rare feat.

393
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,120
Six Mortal Flower also controls the nascent energy of Firmament disciples.

394
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,070
If anyone disobeys their teacher, the flowers can be pulled out from them

395
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,490
as a punishment to teach him a lesson.

396
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,160
This is the punishment for what you've done.

397
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,570
I'll give you one more chance.

398
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,160
Immediately find that woman.

399
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,220
Or else, Heaven's laws will not be forgiving.

400
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,020
Teacher! Teacher!

401
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,870
Teacher's wife!

402
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,600
Teacher's wife, you're finally back. Go and check on Teacher.

403
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,480
What happened to your teacher?

404
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,300
I don't know, either. He's perspiring all over and his whole body is jerking.

405
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,730
But Mister Zong is currently not around.

406
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,740
- Go and get me some water.
- Okay...

407
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,120
Wuji!

408
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,260
What's wrong with you?

409
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,650
Tie Cheng said that you're ill.

410
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,060
I'm fine.

411
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,420
I got distracted while training.

412
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,570
My internal energy got a bit messed up.

413
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,780
What is it?

414
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,360
- Really?
- Yes.

415
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,460
Let me see.

416
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,570
I've told you that I'm fine.

417
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,230
Oh, right. What's the situation with Zhan Beiye?

418
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,570
Big news. I heard that Zhan Beiye is rushing towards here now with a large Secret Army.

419
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,020
He's now less than 100 li from Rock City.

420
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,640
- That fast?
- Right.

421
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,700
I also never thought that they would be this fast.

422
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,060
Technically speaking, Geya Desert is very far from here.

423
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,330
Removing the time that they had to battle each other, their travel towards here was indeed very fast.

424
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:19,450
Looks like this Heaven Fiend Secret Army is more powerful than I imagined. What about Zhan Nancheng?

425
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,730
He fell into our trick.

426
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,590
But I'm afraid that he might go crazy because of too much pressure.

427
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,190
We must quickly save Imperial Concubine Jing.

428
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,120
Okay. Leave that to me.

429
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,770
Before Zhan Beiye attacks the city, we must safely escort Imperial Concubine Jing out of the city.

430
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,500
Teacher!

431
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,710
Teacher, are you... fine now?

432
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,430
When am I not well?

433
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,990
Reporting false news, you should be punished.

434
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,590
Teacher, go and look for Mister Zong.

435
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,100
Mister Yun said that he must rush in front of Mister Zong to see some...

436
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,670
Qi...

437
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,540
- Is that person's name Qi Zhen?
- Right. It's him!

438
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,500
Qi Zhen has come to Heaven Fiend?

439
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,360
I'll tell you the details next time. I'll go look for them.

440
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,120
I-I'll go with you!

441
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,900
Have you forgotten? You're now Generalissimo Black Tortoise serving by Zhan Nancheng's side.

442
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,730
Before Zhan Beiye attacks the city, you still have to do something more important than looking for people.

443
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,990
Okay. I'll go tell Zhan Nancheng now that Crown Prince Wuji has agreed to lend us his army.

444
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,500
Yes.

445
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,360
Who told you to come here?

446
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,500
Dying with you is also dying as I wished.

447
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,780
Right now, do you still believe him?

448
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:05,100
I just didn't expect that he wouldn't mind using Yun'er just to get back at us.

449
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,000
This is great!

450
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,340
This is great!

451
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,560
All the people that should arrive have come.

452
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,240
It's indeed time to end this.

453
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,230
Hen'er.

454
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,500
I'm not your Hen'er.

455
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,670
You are my Hen'er.

456
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,590
It's been eighteen years.

457
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,090
I've taught you how to read books, make poems, ride horses, and shoot arrows.

458
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,380
I've treated you like my own son.

459
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,580
In my heart, you will always be my Hen'er.

460
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,870
If you still believe his words, you really are beyond redemption.

461
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:08,440
Looks like the grudge between our families can't be resolved.

462
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,870
But Hen'er... you and my Yun'er are engaged to be married.

463
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,330
I know your feelings for her.

464
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,760
I also believe that you won't break her heart.

465
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,290
I don't have much time left.

466
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,460
I want to entrust my Yun'er to you.

467
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,060
I'm at ease.

468
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,360
Don't believe him.

469
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,750
Now that things have come to this, is there still any meaning to say those words?

470
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:04,320
I came today to give you a chance to live.

471
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,200
Kill him.

472
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,070
The grudge between our families will then be written off.

473
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,280
I will let my Yun'er leave with you.

474
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,320
Impossible.

475
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,730
There is nothing impossible in this world.

476
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,970
Think about it.

477
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:33,420
Even if he's your older brother, you two have never lived together even for a day for the past twenty years.

478
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,650
At most, he's just a stranger from the same bloodline as you,

479
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:44,480
while Yun'er and I are your real family.

480
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,060
Kill him and you can stably sit on the royal throne of Deep Water.

481
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,550
You can forever be with my Yun'er.

482
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,580
What a good choice this is.

483
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,820
Hen'er!

484
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,150
What he said is right.

485
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:20,190
If you don't kill me, we will both die.

486
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,740
If you kill me, you can at least live.

487
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,650
Are you forcing me to become a sinner who killed his own brother, too?

488
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,130
You just want to watch us brothers kill each other.

489
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:49,560
If I die, even if he lives, he will forever live in guilt.

490
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,770
At least, he's still alive, right?

491
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,610
That's right.

492
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,560
At least, he's alive.

493
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,050
Okay.

494
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,990
I lost.

495
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:30,360
No matter how much torment you will be enduring from now on,

496
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,120
that is your punishment for easily trusting and being soft-hearted.

497
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,220
But today, you must leave here alive.

498
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,540
No.

499
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,710
Impossible.

500
00:38:53,710 --> 00:39:00,000
Just to seek revenge, I've given up forty years of my lifespan.

501
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,090
Living for me is just an extravagance.

502
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:10,670
Ever since, you never listened to my words.

503
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,230
Please listen to me. Kill me this time.

504
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,470
Kill me. Okay?

505
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,820
Kill me.

506
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,000
Enough. Yun Hen,

507
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,440
stop hesitating.

508
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:47,040
Kill him and everything will end.

509
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,550
Remember, you only have once chance.

510
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,180
Do it.

511
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,640
I already said it... don't force me.

512
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:57,960
But you two... why must you two force me?

513
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,990
Do you think I will just sit and wait for death?

514
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:18,330
A dog that I wasn't able to train well for eighteen years.

515
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,430
Fine, then.

516
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:15,810
I gave my everything to Palace Leader Fei Yan

517
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:20,510
just to have her to give me this power to use at this moment.

518
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,970
If you want to kill someone, kill me first.

519
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,090
Don't rush. I'll do it in order of seniority.

520
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,350
