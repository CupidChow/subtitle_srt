00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,330
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,580
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,670
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,900
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,940
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,140
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,470
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,090
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,670
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,860
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,080
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,570
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,270
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,550
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:21,550
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,710
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,130
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,030
~ Episode 63 ~

22
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,890
Empress Yuan, you are of a very noble status.

23
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,790
But at this moment, you lowered yourself down and came here to send off a treacherous rebel.

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,550
If this gets out, it will bring disgrace to the imperial clan.

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,120
Your Highness, please ask Empress to leave immediately.

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,820
This is too scandalous.

27
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,070
If Emperor Father asks,

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,750
I'll bear the consequences.

29
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,420
Why must you do this?

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,140
I am a person that's about to die.

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,560
How am I worthy for you to exert any more effort?

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,940
Why must you make yourself suffer?

33
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,980
Even if I'm unable to save your life,

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,120
I will never let Zhangsun Jiong get his way.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,540
Our son is very good.

36
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,080
Very good.

37
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,960
You know everything now?

38
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,630
I'll go see Wuji now.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,480
I'll go beg him.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,990
I'll beg him to let you go!

41
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,300
You must not!

42
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,260
Yi'er, you must not!

43
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,120
- Dear Jia.
- You must not!

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,220
We need to let Zhangsun Jiong play this last move.

45
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,650
Only when I die will he stop and let you all live.

46
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,120
I don't want any chance to survive!

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,160
If Wuji makes this wrong move,

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,120
the scheme that Zhangsun Jiong devised for twenty years will be successful!

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,570
But for Wuji,

50
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,190
a sin like this can't be forgiven by the heavens!

51
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,730
Don't say anything then!

52
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,560
Don't say anything!

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,590
Wuji will be the emperor in the future. What he's doing now

54
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,670
is to kill the traitor and rebel of Megrez Empire!

55
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,240
Everything else isn't important! Isn't important!

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,860
- Do you understand?
- Wuji!

57
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,490
Come over here!

58
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,510
- Dear Jia.
- No!

59
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,610
- Dear Jia, listen to me.
- No!

60
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,720
Yi'er, I beg you already. Don't say it.

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,170
- Don't say anything, okay?
- Believe me.

62
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,060
- I won't let you die.
- Yi'er.

63
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,310
Wuji, quickly leave!

64
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,990
- Yi'er! Yi'er! Wuji, quickly proceed with the execution!
- Dear Jia, believe me!

65
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,870
I won't let you die!

66
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,580
Yi'er!

67
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,690
- Wuji, come over here!
- Don't say it!

68
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,550
Yi'er! Don't say it!

69
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,990
- Believe me.
- Quickly leave, you!

70
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,230
- I will never let you die!
- Leave!

71
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,980
Don't say it!

72
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,450
- Dear Jia.
- Yi—

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,110
Dear Jia.

74
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,860
Dear Jia.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,910
Dear Jia!

76
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:36,470
Dear Jia? Dear Jia! Dear Jia.

77
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,750
Dear Jia.

78
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,000
Dear Jia.

79
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,230
Dear Jia.

80
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,090
Dear Jia.

81
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,000
Dear Jia!

82
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,710
Wuji.

83
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,030
Was it him who took you two away?

84
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,310
Did he force you two?

85
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,740
Have you met with Empress Yuan?

86
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,260
These?

87
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,950
Were all these things done by my Emperor Father?

88
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,570
There are some truths...

89
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,460
that shouldn't be said by me.

90
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,160
Your Majesty, you've waited the whole night.

91
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,380
Go back to your room and rest first.

92
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,270
It's here.

93
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,410
Your Majesty, news came from the military camp.

94
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,170
Prince Virtue has been executed.

95
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,330
Good!

96
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,720
He is finally dead.

97
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,260
He's dead.

98
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,780
Prince Virtue is dead.

99
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,560
Zhangsun Jia is dead.

100
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,260
My little brother is dead.

101
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,530
It's good that he's dead.

102
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,590
Good.

103
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,460
Since he's dead, everything is clean now.

104
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,860
Your Majesty!

105
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,780
Your Majesty, what's wrong with you?

106
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,970
Men! Men!

107
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,670
Quickly call for the imperial physician!

108
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,460
Do you know who he was?

109
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,870
You were born during the Lantern Festival on the fifteenth of the first month.

110
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:31,660
That night, the moon was supposed to be at its fullest.

111
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,800
But it just happened to have a lunar eclipse.

112
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,710
It was only the other half of the night when there was a bit of light.

113
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,700
The start of the eclipse...

114
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,500
was very similar to the time we first met.

115
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,430
From then on,

116
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,300
every time I see you,

117
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,270
I will always remember him.

118
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,930
Who... was he?

119
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,710
Wuji, he was your real father.

120
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,900
Zhangsun Jiong set up this scheme for so many years,

121
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,220
just to assist you up the immensely dangerous and difficult supreme imperial throne.

122
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,650
He just wants to watch you and Zhangsun Jia, father and son, kill each other.

123
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,090
He just wants to kill all your loved ones who are by your side.

124
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:10,860
He just wants to see you get deserted by everyone while sitting on the throne of Megrez.

125
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:16,360
This is the empire that he wants to give you.

126
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,290
This is the revenge he wants to give you.

127
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,580
Why? Why?

128
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,050
Why must you tell me now?

129
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,820
No! No!

130
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,460
Father.

131
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,640
When I was little, I didn't know about my true identity.

132
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,370
I kept pestering Uncle Zhou about it. He told me...

133
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,020
He told me, "Your true identity isn't important.

134
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,660
What's important is who you are."

135
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:59,000
But at this moment, I don't know who I am, either.

136
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,930
Am I an illegitimate crown prince

137
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,300
or the disgrace of the Megrez imperial clan?

138
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,970
But so what?

139
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,230
No matter how others brand you,

140
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,930
you are forever you.

141
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:26,180
To those who only cared about your status and power,

142
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,750
why must you care about them?

143
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,420
But even my closet kin was like that.

144
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,310
Maybe, from the start,

145
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:50,290
their lies and plots were all due to unavoidable predicaments.

146
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,990
The imperial palace might look glittering in gold and jade,

147
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,210
but it actually is the largest and most exquisitely made cage.

148
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,880
The imperial power it represents...

149
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,030
is the item that can most easily confuse people in this world

150
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,370
and turn them into ruthless and heartless creatures.

151
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,850
Wuji, anyone who wants to obtain it...

152
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,730
will all change in the end.

153
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,310
They,

154
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,350
your Empress Mother, your Emperor Father,

155
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,630
also, Prince Virtue,

156
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,490
all lost to their desire for power, lost to their selfish reasons.

157
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,230
But you must know that...

158
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,950
Wuji, you're not like them and you mustn't be like them.

159
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,790
Before,

160
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,400
I only wanted to be Emperor Father's most doted person,

161
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,670
the royal son that he gives importance to the most.

162
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:15,740
I wanted to prove that I'm more worthy than anyone to get this throne of Megrez.

163
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,110
I didn't care about any means.

164
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,840
Fuyao,

165
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,890
I'm not as good as you think.

166
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,260
Yes.

167
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,250
But this is the real you.

168
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:41,560
I've seen your fake faces and seen your true heart.

169
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,850
I know about your methods and understand your limits.

170
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,380
Wuji, you are not them.

171
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:57,030
No matter what becomes of you, you will always be that best person in my heart.

172
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,320
We once said...

173
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,720
that we will turn Five Regions into what we want it to look like together.

174
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,930
I want to turn Five Regions into the image that we want;

175
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,360
hence, this is the heavens testing me.

176
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,900
Am I right, Fuyao?

177
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:35,780
I just hope that all this pain will be born by me only.

178
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,300
Look, Wuji.

179
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,330
What is this?

180
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,210
Take a look.

181
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,450
Look.

182
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,400
What is this moving thing?

183
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,520
It's my shadow.

184
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,730
I tell you but don't laugh at me.

185
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,520
When I was little, I was especially scared of shadows.

186
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,320
I always wondered why this black thing followed me.

187
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,230
Will it hurt me?

188
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,230
I used to put on a fierce look and wanted to duel with it.

189
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,400
Because back then, I always thought

190
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,280
it would be so wonderful if this world was filled with only light.

191
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:37,150
Later, Uncle Zhou told me that the reason our shadows follow us without leaving

192
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:42,470
is because where there is light, there is surely darkness.

193
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,780
Wuji, maybe behind all of us, we have darkness that we cannot get rid of,

194
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,510
but that is only because in front of us is luminous light.

195
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:05,280
So, since we cannot shrug off our shadows,

196
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:13,440
then I hope that someone will face this luminous light in front of us together with me.

197
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,610
I hope that this someone is you.

198
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,630
Are you willing to go with me?

199
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,600
Crown Prince has returned. Greetings, Crown Prince. Crown Prince.

200
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,370
Your Highness, His Majesty is waiting urgently to see you.

201
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,090
I'm afraid there is not much time left.

202
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,630
I've arrived late.

203
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,250
You came back.

204
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,540
It's good you're back.

205
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,370
I can still see you once more.

206
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,990
See you once more.

207
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,530
Emperor Father, you are still in your prime years.

208
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,010
Just recuperating for a few days and you will surely get fully cured.

209
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,230
Do you believe it?

210
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,790
The mandate of the heavens must not be disobeyed.

211
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,960
What will come will eventually come.

212
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,040
Come here.

213
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,600
Come here.

214
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,730
Come here.

215
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,600
You've gotten thinner.

216
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,510
War is hard.

217
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,350
Since you were young,

218
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,490
you would carry everything by yourself alone.

219
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,290
For all the pain involved,

220
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,170
no one helped you out.

221
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,290
You could only experience it by yourself.

222
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:54,930
Inside the palace, servants are many,

223
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,350
but those who are close are few,

224
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,970
and the trustworthy are few.

225
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,830
I understand.

226
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,840
Emperor Father—

227
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,010
Let me finish speaking.

228
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,820
I have given you the throne of Megrez of the Five Regions.

229
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,900
This is the highest position in the world.

230
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,680
And it is one that inflicts the greatest hatred.

231
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,530
No matter what you do,

232
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,030
doing right or doing wrong is not important.

233
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,300
Your dignity is the most important.

234
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,380
Do not be afraid of doing it wrong,

235
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,590
but be afraid when the people under you will think that you are wrong.

236
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,030
Remember.

237
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,450
Ask what you want to ask.

238
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,950
Ask now.

239
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,530
Emperor Father,

240
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,010
why?

241
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,770
Why?

242
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,150
You know it all.

243
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,780
Prince Virtue has been executed.

244
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,650
Empress Mother...

245
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,530
Empress Mother told me everything.

246
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,230
That's right.

247
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,890
He is dead.

248
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,460
A treacherous rebel will never be buried inside the royal tomb.

249
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,080
I had his bone crushed and his ashes scattered.

250
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,140
Are you feeling hurt now?

251
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,950
You are his flesh and blood.

252
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,560
So everything Empress Mother said was true?

253
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,550
Prince Virtue rebelled.

254
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,430
Father and son fought each other.

255
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,710
These are all schemes you've laid out.

256
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,340
In my life, this is the thing I wanted to do the most

257
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,360
and I've just accomplished now.

258
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,210
Imperial Doctor! Come!

259
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,130
My time is up.

260
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,040
They cannot save me.

261
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,220
Let me see you again.

262
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,310
Let me say two more things.

263
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,030
I hated two people the most in this lifetime:

264
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:32,350
myself... and

265
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:44,170
my younger brother, Zhuangsun Jia, Prince Virtue, your birth father.

266
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,270
Ever since he was born,

267
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:59,150
he could easily get everything dear to me.

268
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:05,030
Even this throne was a leftover that was left by the previous emperor for him.

269
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,010
So the day of my coronation,

270
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,450
I decided to take away everything he cared about.

271
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,590
It's a lifetime of struggle.

272
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,230
He died, but he won.

273
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,010
I lost everything.

274
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,060
The only one remaining by my side is you.

275
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:56,330
But even you are an illegitimate child of his and the Empress.

276
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,920
When you were little,

277
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,950
you were so smart, quick-witted, and so adorable.

278
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,670
Do you know how many nights

279
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,170
I would look at you while you were sound asleep and

280
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:31,050
I asked myself why I was unable to harm you?

281
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,630
Why was I unable kill you?

282
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,650
I instead taught you literary works and proper etiquette,

283
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,950
the principles and techniques of being a ruler.

284
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,010
I taught you all kinds of strategy.

285
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,030
Why?

286
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,850
Why?

287
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,710
Since that's the case,

288
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,990
Emperor Father,

289
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,710
why must you pass down the throne to me?

290
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,470
It's because I'm your Emperor Father.

291
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:19,010
You called me Emperor Father.

292
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,350
I'm the emperor of the Megrez of Five Regions.

293
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,150
They want a wise king.

294
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,870
I can only become a wise king.

295
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,580
From now on,

296
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,710
you will become me.

297
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,870
You will experience the lack of freedom that I did,

298
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:55,090
become ruthless and heartless like I did.

299
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,310
Slowly...

300
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,290
you will lose love.

301
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,550
You will become lonely.

302
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,530
But you will never hate me,

303
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:19,230
because I've given you all the love I have in this lifetime.

304
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,850
Wuji, tell me.

305
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,290
Why are you not my son?

306
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:47,440
Why are you not—

307
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,640
Emperor Father.

308
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,880
Child, you are still young.

309
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,850
Always be vigilant.

310
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:36,900
Do you know that regardless of which nation or empire,

311
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,230
the fight for royal power has always been a life-or-death struggle?

312
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:44,910
I'll give the imperial seal, the commander's seal, and the decree all to you.

313
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,930
I'll give you all the armed forces and the state affairs of Megrez.

314
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,580
Your father is old now.

315
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:59,110
I'll leave all the honor or disgrace and good health in the later part of my life in your hands, too.

316
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:12,170
You must promise me that you will personally kill him.

317
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,270
Or else, I will not die in peace.

318
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,530
Set out for battle.

319
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,970
Kill Zhangsun Jia on my behalf.

320
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,500
Why...

321
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,540
are you not my son?

322
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,690
Crown Prince has greatly won the favor of Lord Emperor.

323
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,510
He is loyal, filial, benevolent, and of outstanding talent.

324
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,040
He is indeed a genius in managing the affairs of the Five Regions and assisting his generation.

325
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,030
Fulfilling the wishes of both the heavens above and the citizens below,

326
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,630
the throne is being passed on to the crown prince of Megrez, Zhangsun Wuji.

327
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,470
May the royal ancestors silently guard him and may the gods be witnesses.

328
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,180
Hope that everyone in this imperial court will pull together and work hard as a team

329
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,820
in serving the new emperor, to aim for a prosperity in the Five Regions that will last for centuries,

330
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,140
to come up with measures to maintain peace and stability in the empire.

331
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,080
[Libation]

332
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,190
Does Your Majesty still refuse to see us?

333
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,530
How about you all go back first?

334
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,350
If His Majesty will summon you, I will immediately inform you all.

335
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,680
It's been days since the past emperor died.

336
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,850
With the mourning inside the palace and the casket transported out of the palace, everything is already final now.

337
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,560
His Majesty shouldn't immerse himself in grief anymore.

338
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,960
The state affairs should take priority.

339
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,670
The deceased past emperor has left and will never return.

340
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,600
Not only official state affairs,

341
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,450
the inner court has just finished drafting the by-laws and proposed expenses for his inauguration ceremony.

342
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,440
We still need His Majesty to personally approve it.

343
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,710
His Majesty actually knows all this.

344
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,260
It's just that... the former emperor left so suddenly.

345
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,830
His Majesty still misses him.

346
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,430
For the state affairs these next few days, we'll have to trouble you two officials to attend to them for now.

347
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,120
Just give His Majesty some more time.

348
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,210
[Memorial Tablet of deceased Lord Emperor Zhangsun Jiong]

349
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,580
I already personally abolished my status.

350
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,690
I will never return to the palace.

351
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,360
From now on, there won't be an Empress Yuan in this world,

352
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,260
only Yuan Qingyi.

353
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:58,680
I only wish wish that my Ji'er can obtain your happiness,

354
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,830
not suffer from lovesickness anymore or the pain of separation.

355
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:09,280
There is a Winding Mind Nunnery in Mt. Green Bead.

356
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,930
My Ji'er, if you miss me in the future,

357
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,550
just go there to find me.

358
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:58,490
All the envoys from other nations that came to offer their condolences have been properly given a place to stay,

359
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,900
and those elegiac addresses that those scholars wrote for the national mourning,

360
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,620
they've been placed in the inner palace.

361
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,200
I've visited Winding Mind Nunnery.

362
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,350
Although it's a bit shabby,

363
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,030
it has a rare sense of quiet.

364
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,570
Empress Yuan...

365
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,150
is doing quite well.

♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫
