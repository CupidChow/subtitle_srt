2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,400
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,100
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,790
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ Deep love won't hide, true love won't run short ♫

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,500
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,400
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,500
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,500
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,400
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,200
~ Episode 23 ~

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
Ever since I met him,

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,270
it seems that everything is related to him and

22
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,600
has a connection with him.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,800
Slowly, I’m used to his existence.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm used to having him and also used to...

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,200
used to naturally thinking of him.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Then that's love.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,800
- Love?
- Yes.

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,500
Is this love?

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,000
In the past... In the past, there was someone I liked.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,700
Until that person betrayed me,

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,200
I originally thought I would be very sad.

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,100
But in reality, it was more disappointment.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
I asked myself, was this love?

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
I wasn't sure, either.

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,400
So when you asked me if I liked your Mister earlier,

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,030
I didn't know, either.

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,640
Mister.

38
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,900
Jian Xue, you can leave.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,700
You—

40
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,230
Did you hear it all?

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
This is not fair.

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,700
You have her to trick me into telling you the information.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,800
You already know my feelings.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,800
But I don't know what you are thinking.

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,200
Sit.

46
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,000
What do you want to ask?

47
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,350
I—

48
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,460
I want to know—

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,900
I want to know, what feelings do you have towards me?

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Do you want to know the truth?

51
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,900
You... are very smart, very special.

52
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,800
I have never seen a woman like you in all these years.

53
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,800
You're obstinate, unruly, clever and sly, but you have virtue and patriotism.

54
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,400
You would give up your life for your friends.

55
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,800
So from the beginning, I had an interest in you.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Just—

57
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,600
After a while of being with you and seeing most of you,

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
everything will no longer be fresh.

59
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,900
In the end, the kind of woman a man wants by his side

60
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,600
are those lovely, obedient, gentle, timid and lovable little women.

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,500
Do you... understand?

62
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,440
Why do you laugh?

63
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,710
When I was locked in Dense Beam Palace Hall before,

64
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,210
I thought I wouldn't be able to escape.

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,990
But in the end...

66
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,780
But in the end, the first person to appear in my mind was you.

67
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,800
In that moment, I asked myself if I'd fallen in love with you.

68
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,420
In that moment, I asked myself if I'd fallen in love with you.

69
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,980
It is rather funny.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
Thank you for telling me this today.

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Letting me know how stupid my thought was before.

72
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,910
And thank you for your honesty.

73
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
I will take care of things well.

74
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,900
How will you take care of things?

75
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,900
I will definite repay the favor I've received.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
From now on, I won't bother you anymore.

77
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't need you to repay for the favor.

78
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,200
You are in my way right now.

79
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,000
I just wish you... would disappear as soon as possible.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,600
As for the seal in your body—

81
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,520
There's no need.

82
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,700
My business has nothing to do with you anymore.

83
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Look at you! Look at you! How did you mess things up!

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,430
How could you use black color for the lanterns of Winter Clothing Festival?

85
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,500
How could you?

86
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,400
This Winter Clothing Festival is a happy occasion.

87
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,700
It's the day when His Majesty chooses his queen.

88
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,200
Do you know?

89
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,900
You are so inattentive. Watch out or you'll be beaten up.

90
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,600
This is really... go away now!

91
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Yes, yes.

92
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,000
Hurry up! Seriously.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,400
I don't look for a moment and he makes a mess.

94
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
Be careful!

95
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
Miss Yuwen.

96
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
The guards today are all our people.

97
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Wear this dress and this badge, and no one will give you trouble.

98
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,300
As for your identity as Yuwen Zi, don't worry.

99
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,800
Mister will take care of it.

100
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,300
The tenth month begins.

101
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,700
On the first day of the tenth month,

102
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,000
worship ancestors in the Winter Clothing Festival.

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Do not forget our ancestors.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,700
The Winter Clothing Festival of Deep Water begins!

105
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Your Majesty, at such an auspicious occasion,

106
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,400
why do you seem to be unhappy?

107
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,310
Is that so?

108
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,900
Prime Minister, you've worried too much.

109
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,400
♫ What do you know? ♫

110
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,400
♫ What is good about the three realms? ♫

111
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,300
Girl!

112
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,600
I’m late. Are you okay?

113
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,550
I've been nice and saved the beauty heroically.

114
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,200
You should at least thank me.

115
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,000
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

116
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,160
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

117
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,200
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

118
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,700
Girl!

119
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,020
You caused this trouble.

120
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,600
Come help me change my clothing.

121
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,400
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

122
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,600
After parting at the forbidden cliff, we meet again.

123
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,200
Do you want to die?

124
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
I want to stay alive with you.

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,700
Whether I'm a trickster or not, we can't be sure.

126
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,200
But you... surely are a fake.

127
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Jerk!

128
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Do you like me?

129
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,400
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

130
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,600
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

131
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

132
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,400
I want to know, you...

133
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,500
What feelings do you have towards me?

134
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,400
I never thought I'd see you so obedient and nice in my lifetime,

135
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
being so weak like a girl.

136
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,600
This type of weak girl, you have many of them in your harem.

137
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,000
Why do you think it's rare to have one?

138
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,650
But I only think you're rare.

139
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,700
In the beginning, I used all my efforts to come in here.

140
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,200
Now, it's so easy to leave.

141
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,190
Miss, please wait.

142
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,040
There are too many people here.

143
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,740
Please follow me this way, Miss.

144
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,920
- Let's drink.
- You're too courteous. You're too courteous.

145
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,900
- Come, come.
- Have a drink.

146
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,440
- Here.
- Bottoms up.

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,400
We'll have to enjoy ourselves today, okay? Let's cheers.

148
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,830
Come on, come on, Official Gu.

149
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,930
Okay. Let's drink.

150
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,580
- Here, let me pour you a glass.
- Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

151
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,450
First Senior Brother.

152
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,680
Here.

153
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,330
Come on, come on.

154
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,220
All right. Good days.

155
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,420
- Prime Minister, may I offer you a toast?
- Sure.

156
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,860
This family isn't good.

157
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,930
Come, come. Another one.

158
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,670
We'll definitely enjoy ourselves today.

159
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,190
- Good, good.
- Come, come.

160
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,490
The two of us would like to salute Uncle with a toast.

161
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,310
Good.

162
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,980
Is this handsome and outstanding youngster Prime Minister's nephew-in-law?

163
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,630
Yes, I am Yan Jingchen.

164
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,010
We hear you're the Young Master of Mystic Soul Clique.

165
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,950
That's right.

166
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,230
He is the son of Yan Lie, Mystic Soul Clique Leader.

167
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,050
He is young and talented.

168
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,680
He just came into the imperial court for a lieutenant position in the garrison.

169
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,120
No wonder he is in a laudable tolerant spirit.

170
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,140
He is obviously a descendant of a respected family.

171
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,290
He and the Prefecture Princess are a perfect match.

172
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,970
We are all envied.

173
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,330
This is my husband's first time in Capital Kun.

174
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,360
In the future we'd appreciate help from you officials in the imperial court.

175
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,740
May I offer a toast to thank you first?

176
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,960
Prefecture Princess, you are too humble.

177
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,020
Mr. Yan is obviously an young elite.

178
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,390
His becoming an official is our Deep Water's blessing.

179
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,540
Let's drink up!

180
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,390
Come on. Come on...

181
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,200
Not bad, not bad.

182
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,370
- Enjoy your drinks, both officials.
- Okay.

183
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,180
Come, come.

184
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,140
That's right.

185
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,090
You have a good memory.

186
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,660
Get lost!

187
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,350
Did the young girl just then look better than me because she's young and cute?

188
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,370
There are so many people.

189
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,770
Stop messing around.

190
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,940
Come, I'll toast you.

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,230
Get a fruit.

192
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,300
All right. I'll get a fruit.

193
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,330
Feed me.

194
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,680
All right.

195
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,950
His Majesty arrives!

196
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,170
Why isn't Lady Fair here yet?

197
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,710
Answer to Your Ladyship, my lady is too ill to even get up.

198
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,510
Your Majesty, this—

199
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,010
She doesn't feel well.

200
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,770
Let's not force her.

201
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,000
In a while, summon an Imperial doctor to check on her.

202
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,860
Yes.

203
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,640
Your Majesty, the auspicious hour has arrived.

204
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,370
Start.

205
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,920
It's the auspicious hour.

206
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,210
The banquet for Winter Clothing Festival now begins.

207
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,130
Start the music.

208
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,340
It's really great.

209
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,830
Not bad.

210
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,900
Look at how well they dance.

211
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,600
Look at her.

212
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,260
Allow me to toast you.

213
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,940
- Eat some more.
- Sure.

214
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,430
Nice!

215
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,020
I'll go out for a second. I'll come back later.

216
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,300
This is great.

217
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,240
What did you say?

218
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,620
He's the one who told me to leave.

219
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,290
Now you want me to stay?

220
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,240
Are you in cahoots to play me?

221
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,060
Miss, stop being angry.

222
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,340
Mister also has his difficulties.

223
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,470
I'm doing this on my own and I know he'll surely scold me.

224
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,800
But I really have to tell you something.

225
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,620
What is it?

226
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,600
Do you remember that night when he went to find the Earth Absorbing Bell for you?

227
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,480
You only know that he found it,

228
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,810
but you didn't know he was badly hurt after receiving three punches from First Princess.

229
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,380
I have followed him since childhood.

230
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,610
For all these years, I have never seen him care for someone so much.

231
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:33,170
I've never seen him helping someone with no regard of his own life.

232
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:38,720
But he clearly... clearly pretended to not care.

233
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,630
He did it for your safety.

234
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,290
He knows you're wounded and doesn't want you endangered more.

235
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,990
But by doing so, his plan and his own safety will now become uncertain.

236
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,570
He wouldn't tell you any of this.

237
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,970
Do you mean, he doesn't want me in danger

238
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,810
so he deliberately treated me like that?

239
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,290
- Miss, let me finish talking.
- What else is there to talk about?

240
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,180
Winter Clothing Festival has started.

241
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,370
It's better that I am not late.

242
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,920
Thank you, Miss.

243
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,860
Is this Prime Minister's nephew-in-law?

244
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,430
Get lost!

245
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,490
Was the young girl just then young and cute?

246
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,000
Feed me.

247
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,490
Fuyao?

248
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,440
Fuyao, is it you?

249
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,050
Sorry. I just drank some wine so I recognized the wrong person.

250
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,800
Please forgive me, Lady.

251
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,040
Hurry and leave.

252
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,520
Thankfully, the Little Tail cast that spell.

253
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,670
Otherwise I'd be dead today.

254
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,470
I didn't recognize the wrong person!

255
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,930
You're Fuyao.

256
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,060
Even if you have a different face, but I can tell from your back and the way you walk.

257
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,930
I do not make mistakes.

258
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,200
Your Majesty, the Winter Clothing Festival of Deep Water must have clothing burning, sword dances and ancestor offerings.

259
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,070
The attendance of this Imperial banquet is surely high tonight.

260
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,180
Has Your Majesty invited any sword dancers tonight?

261
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,910
Why would we need sword dancers?

262
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:14,400
Your Majesty, I heard the Ladies have learned many talents a while ago.

263
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,470
I wonder if we can see it today.

264
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,890
The Prime Minister usually organizes these things.

265
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,930
This... We need to ask Prime Minister. Right?

266
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,750
Your Majesty, I don't know anything about such entertainment.

267
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,040
I only know to do my job to relieve Your Majesty's worries.

268
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,910
Prime Minister, this—

269
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,500
Your Majesty.

270
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,210
Speak.

271
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,640
I recently learned a new set of sword play that is quite interesting.

272
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,160
I would like to perform for your enjoyment.

273
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,760
Oh, sure!

274
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,010
But this sword play is out of the ordinary.

275
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,670
I need the servants to make some preparations.

276
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,170
Approved.

277
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,700
Go do it.

278
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,250
Yes.

279
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,630
Your Majesty, this sword play came from a hermit.

280
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,160
Although it's not some famous choreography,

281
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,830
it's magical by the addition of the 12 Lustrous Mirrors.

282
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,390
These Lustruous Mirrors are the treasures of Deep Water Nation.

283
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,890
They can reflect the entire lifetime of the person standing before it.

284
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,980
Although it may appear as only one person is dancing,

285
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,090
it looks as if there's a crowd of thousands with the reflection from the mirrors.

286
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,660
It's definitely unique.

287
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,180
You really worked hard to get it.

288
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,090
All right, let's show us your special performance.

289
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,630
Thank you, Your Majesty.

290
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:51,030
Your Majesty, may I offer a toast?

291
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,430
Come, let's drink!

292
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,330
Fuyao, do you know?

293
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,760
Ever since we parted on Mt. Mystic Soul,

294
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,610
I could only see you in my dreams.

295
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,860
- My heart—
- First Senior Brother,

296
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:21,480
because of our relationship in the past, I still call you First Senior Brother today.

297
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,910
But you are already someone else's husband now.

298
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,830
It doesn't matter who you married,

299
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,720
please take good care of her

300
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,850
because it's your own choice.

301
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,090
It-It's not my choice.

302
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,130
It's a mistake.

303
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,950
It's the biggest mistake in my life!

304
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,010
Fuyao, are you not willing to forgive me?

305
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,920
We don't need forgiveness between us.

306
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,910
Eunuch Cao, I noticed the color of our place settings are all different.

307
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,790
Is there a special reason?

308
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,770
Of course, there is.

309
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,900
Depending on each imperial concubine's ranking,

310
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,940
everyone is given different treatment.

311
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,030
See, you are Lady Precious.

312
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,400
You're the most precious and graceful,

313
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,680
so all of your tableware is red.

314
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,120
Lady Virtuous is a Prefecture Princess,

315
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,190
so we used the blue color that they are accustomed to.

316
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,610
Lady Fair uses pink tableware,

317
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,100
and Lady Virtue uses white ones.

318
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,480
All Ladies are given colors appropriate to their social status.

319
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,550
Huan'er.

320
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,490
Fuyao, I know you are upset and sad.

321
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,050
I gave up and left you back then.

322
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,320
I know it's all my fault.

323
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,000
I... It's all my fault.

324
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,640
First Senior Brother, did you really think that I am still sad?

325
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,890
Are you not?

326
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,810
That's right.

327
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,890
When I was at Mt. Mystic Soul back then, I was indeed heartbroken.

328
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,910
But the thing that saddened me was that

329
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,590
my most loved and respected First Senior Brother since youth,

330
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,420
how he could just betray me like that.

331
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,170
I thought, wasn't this our childhood promise?

332
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,560
How could you go back on your promise?

333
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,780
I didn't understand anything at that time.

334
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,210
I was really sad.

335
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:25,020
Thankfully, before Pei Yuan and Clique Leader were able to kill me,

336
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,560
I left Mt. Mystic Soul.

337
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,530
On my way down,

338
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:33,540
I met many people and encountered many things.

339
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,950
I finally realized that it was because my view was so small,

340
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,800
but this world is actually large.

341
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,130
So I understand First Senior Brother.

342
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,190
In order to pursue your goals,

343
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,280
giving up on some feelings is nothing.

344
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,620
But while I understand why a man would do this,

345
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,960
I will never pine for him.

346
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,280
I finally understand what I want

347
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,620
is someone who treats me nice with his whole heart

348
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,690
and won't betray me no matter what the terms of exchange are or what happens.

349
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,940
Of course, I will also return the same level of loyalty and undivided attention.

350
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,400
I know that this person is not First Senior Brother.

351
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,400
So I won't be heartbroken. I'm actually glad.

352
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,760
I'm glad that person isn't you.

353
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,050
Fuyao, I—

354
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,150
I was just confused then, Fuyao!

355
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,970
Fuyao, even though I've married Pei Yuan,

356
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,730
we don't have the reality as a couple.

357
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,690
I only have you in my heart.

358
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,010
Fuyao, wait for me until I'm successful.

359
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,710
I... I'll give you the best.

360
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,260
I'll genuinely only see you. Okay?

361
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,610
First Senior Brother,

362
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,860
let bygones be bygones.

363
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,890
I'll call you First Senior Brother one last time.

364
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,630
Let go.

365
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,590
Goodbye.

366
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,330
Where was the earring dropped?

367
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,300
This?

368
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:49,780
This Older Sister, have you seen a pair of my Miss' earrings that she lost earlier here?

369
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,470
I didn't see anything.

370
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,990
Older Sister, I'm doomed. I'm doomed.

371
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,220
If it's like this, my Miss will surely beat me to death!

372
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,790
Older Sister, can you help me find them together?

373
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,770
They were here. They were lost right here!

374
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,230
But I still have to deliver wine.

375
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,070
Look, can you pity me?

376
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,610
If I can't find them, my Miss will beat me to death.

377
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,390
Can you go over there to look?

378
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,480
I'll look over here.

379
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,030
If you can't find them, this gold leaf will represent my gratitude for Older Sister.

380
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,390
Okay.

381
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,270
Thank you, Older Sister. Thank you, Older Sister.

382
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,940
Where did they go?

383
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,170
Where could the earring go?

384
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,460
If I can't find them, my Lord will really...

385
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,320
Where are my earrings?

386
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,490
Where were they exactly dropped?

387
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,150
What to do? What to do?

388
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,920
I've found them!

389
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,230
Older Sister! I've found them! I've found them!

390
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,780
They were here.

391
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,660
Then all is well.

392
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,640
Thank you, Older Sister.

393
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,490
I didn't help you much.

394
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,790
Older Sister, you have helped me greatly.

395
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,290
Old Sister, people are rushing us.

396
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,310
Let's go quickly.

397
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,210
I am sorry, Lady Fair.

398
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,670
Why are you so careless?

399
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,700
I'm sorry, Lady Fair. Please don't punish us.

400
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,290
It's nothing, rise.

401
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,040
Yes.

402
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,270
Where did you go?

403
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,620
Why did you come back only now?

404
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,820
I asked you a question.

405
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,330
Where did you go?

406
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,680
Why did you come back only now?

407
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,680
I asked you a question.

408
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,790
I don't want to answer!

409
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,230
I want to go home!

410
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,810
Have you gone mad?

411
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,870
Yes, I have gone mad.

412
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,130
I should have gone mad a long time ago.

413
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,860
Your Majesty, I will show my routine.

414
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,390
Go ahead.

415
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,890
Younger Sister, please hold.

416
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,910
Your Majesty, today is Winter Clothing Festival.

417
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:41,310
Winter Clothing Festival is not just about reminiscence but also about national patriotism.

418
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,900
I don't have any talents.

419
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,910
So I will offer a toast to show my gratitude.

420
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,000
Rong'er has spoken well.

421
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,920
So, how about we all drink the toast at the same time.

422
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,620
A toast to Your Majesty.

423
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,260
I'm sorry to be late to the festival.

424
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,380
Will Your Majesty please forgive me?

425
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,720
Oh, didn't they say Lady Fair was sick?

426
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,510
Why force yourself to come here?

427
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,030
I was originally feeling terribly ill,

428
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,790
but for some reason, I recovered all of a sudden.

429
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,720
It must be because the Winter Clothing Festival is so sacred.

430
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,550
All gods gave their blessings.

431
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,700
And the King, the Ladies,

432
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,880
and all the Officials prayed sincerely.

433
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,100
I am lucky to have caught a little bit of the auspicious blessing.

434
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,290
I hope I didn't disrupt Your Majesty's enjoyment.

435
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,310
Lady Fair, you are indeed blessed.

436
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,390
I am very gratified.

437
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,910
Take your seat.

438
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,540
It looks like His Majesty especially cares for Lady Fair.

439
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,640
Naturally, Lady Fair was the Prime Minister's goddaughter.

440
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,880
His Majesty obviously values her.

441
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,340
I thought they said the most loved was Lady Precious.

442
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,410
He even rewarded her with many things. How come this—

443
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,750
Now that the Ladies of Clear Goose Palace are all here.

444
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,760
With Younger Sister's sword dance for entertainment, everything is now perfect.

445
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,000
Then please, Lady Virtuous.

446
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,440
- She dances graciously.
- Agree.

447
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,420
This is nice.

448
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,470
Protect His Majesty!

449
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,610
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

450
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,620
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

451
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,760
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

452
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,390
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

453
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,270
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

454
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,580
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

455
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,720
His Majesty is startled.

456
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,430
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

457
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,260
Release me!

458
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,560
You!

459
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,640
Your Majesty, I didn't deliberately do it.

460
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,430
Your Majesty!

461
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,140
Guards, take down Lady Virtuous who tried to assassinate His Majesty!

462
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,650
- How dare you!
- Gao Song!

463
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,250
You were standing next to His Majesty but yet you didn't protect him.

464
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,440
What kind of motive do you have?

465
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,720
Lady Virtuous caused this kind of accident.

466
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,800
It's reasonable and usual practice that she gets arrested first.

467
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,200
How dare you ignore the manners to the King and scold in the presence of the King?

468
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,290
What are you coveting?

469
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,330
Your Majesty, I, Gao Song, have always been loyal to you.

470
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,070
Ruo'er messed up her sword dance, that's because she didn't learn it well.

471
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,380
But if you say that she tried to assassinate His Majesty, then you make unfounded accusations!

472
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,890
- You!
- You can quit arguing.

473
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,800
I don't think this has anything to do with Lady Virtuous.

474
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,290
What is she doing?

475
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,800
- Really?
- She throws up.

476
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,910
I have lost all my pride today.

477
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,400
I...

478
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,980
I'd rather die.

479
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,730
That's right.

480
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,640
All right, let's clean up everything here.

481
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,310
Help Lady Virtuous get out of here.

482
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,960
Miss.

483
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,930
Your Majesty, there must be a conspiracy.

484
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,710
Prince, what do you mean?

485
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,090
Even if Ruo'er didn't learn it well, it wouldn't be as discomfited as this.

486
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,860
It's clearly that someone is framing her.

487
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,150
The wine.

488
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,520
The wine that she just drank, Your Majesty.

489
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,050
There must be something wrong with it.

490
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,600
- You!
- Yes.

491
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,700
Your Majesty, there really is something wrong with it.

492
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,930
Who?

493
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,260
Who is framing my daughter?

494
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,600
The Son of Heaven is right above and hundreds of officials are here as witnesses.

495
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,180
And yet someone dares to injure people in the evening banquet of the Winter Clothing Festival.

496
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,070
This person is going against the heavens!

497
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:51,940
Your Majesty!

498
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,400
Prince, calm down.

499
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,190
Let's make the conclusion after the results come out.

500
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,260
Perhaps there is something else strange about it.

501
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,190
Your Majesty, it has to be her who poisoned the wine.

502
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,210
It has to be her. I'm sure.

503
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,330
Younger Sister, you must have mistaken.

504
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,370
Why would I want to drug you?

505
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,820
This— I—

506
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,640
Your Majesty, please judge fairly.

507
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,330
Why did you say it was Rong'er?

508
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,500
I... I... I—

509
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,790
I... She... I also—

510
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,290
Ruo'er, it's all right; be brave and just say it.

511
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,940
Just now, I already asked the maidservant who is serving today.

512
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,780
A'Xiu had said, just before I started performing,

513
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,110
her personal maidservant went to find a earring or something.

514
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,590
She even used a golden leaf to bribe her.

515
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:47,400
She must have poisoned the wine when she wasn't paying attention!

517
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,730
♫ What do you know? ♫

518
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,810
♫ What is good about the three realms? ♫

519
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,650
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

520
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,870
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

521
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,500
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

522
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,330
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

523
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:36,850
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me, and I only want him to love me ♫

524
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,960
♫ What do you use ♫

525
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,010
♫ To exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

526
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,900
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

527
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,010
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

528
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,610
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

529
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,520
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

530
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,730
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

531
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:07,600
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

532
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,300
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

533
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,430
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

534
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,170
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

535
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:24,230
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

536
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,240
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

537
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,580
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

538
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,450
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

539
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,230
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

540
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,960
♫ Have someone's company♫

541
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,010
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

542
