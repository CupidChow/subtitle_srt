00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,360
♫ I start to dance nimble and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,490
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:23,500
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,900
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,000
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,730
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,490
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,040
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,690
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,830
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,860
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,290
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,350
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:21,540
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,770
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,190
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,520
~ Episode 56 ~

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,600
- Hurry! Hurry!
- It was quite a coincidence, too.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,810
Afterwards, Feng Xuan and Feng Qi almost simultaneously got pregnant and went in labor on the same day.

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,910
They successively gave birth to two babies.

25
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,730
- Legend says that when Feng Xuan gave birth to her daughter,
- Put in more energy!

26
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,370
- that girl had a lotus flower on her mouth, such an auspicious sign.
- It will be over soon. Put in more energy, You!

27
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,500
- And at that time, Young Phoenix Lake actually had a miraculous manifestation.
- Push hard! It's coming out...

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,320
- Hence, everyone firmly believed that this child with a lotus flower was the one with phoenix spirituality.
- It's coming out. Push hard!

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,260
And using it as proof, Feng Xuan was conferred as the First Queen Heir.

30
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,900
Not long after, Feng Qi got sick and died.

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,860
And then afterwards, Feng Xuan successfully ascended to the throne.

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,510
Who then is this person who was born with a lotus flower?

33
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,890
It was Folian.

34
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:30,920
But Folian not only wasn't named the immediate heir, she is now being restricted. Why?

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,000
That is because Feng Xuan changed the inheritance rules after ascending the throne.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,430
She changed it such that the eldest daughter gets to inherit the throne.

37
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,580
It makes no sense. That's unorthodox.

38
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,460
It really makes no sense.

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,290
If Folian is indeed the fated heir, why then did Feng Xuan change the rules?

40
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,090
Unless, Folian isn't Feng Xuan's biological daughter. Or?

41
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,390
Or that both of them don't have the phoenix spirituality.

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,770
Feng Qi also gave birth to a child then.

43
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,250
Too bad.

44
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,030
This child wasn't fortunate and didn't survive.

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,630
Is she called Feng Wuming?

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,940
Could it be that this Feng Wuming is the one with the phoenix spirituality?

47
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,450
I also suspected that.

48
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,610
But all the people who knew about this matter have all died.

49
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,090
Based on what you two have said, there must be another story on Feng Xuan's ascension to the throne.

50
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,790
Too bad, Feng Wuming is also dead.

51
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,530
No.

52
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,780
She probably isn't dead.

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,420
In the Plough royal clan genealogical record,

54
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,140
I saw that the phoenix representing a live person would flap their wings and fly high,

55
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,820
while the phoenix representing a dead person will meet fire and get turned into ashes.

56
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,720
But only this Feng Wuming didn't look like she's truly alive or truly dead.

57
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,860
Didn't you say last time...

58
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,500
that Feng Wuming's father, Meng Shuo, is still alive?

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,060
Yes. Based on the genealogical record, he indeed is still alive.

60
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,700
Could it be—

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,040
Ever since, Feng Xuan and Feng Qi had a close sibling relationship.

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,830
The person who initially caused a break between them was a man named Meng Shuo.

63
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,550
The person who initially caused a break between them was a man named Meng Shuo.

64
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,690
Do you know who Meng Shuo is?

65
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,770
Alioth of the ten saints is him.

66
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,970
I never thought that it was actually him?

67
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,200
The ten saints of Five Regions are the best fighters in this world,

68
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,410
but only this Alioth is a genius in both literary and martial arts.

69
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,700
He is also the most handsome, tallest, and most well-built man among them.

70
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,770
Indeed. At that time, Alioth was very popular.

71
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,930
Who among the Plough royal princesses didn't have a crush on him?

72
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,540
Did that also include Feng Xuan and Feng Qi?

73
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,830
He is a descendant of Plough nobility.

74
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,430
He frequently visited the palace since he was little.

75
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,910
Feng Qi and him had long developed mutual affection.

76
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,530
The two were childhood sweethearts and found each other congenial.

77
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,980
Afterwards, Alioth was ordered to represent Plough to participate in the ten saints contest.

78
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,590
He became one of the ten saints of Five Regions.

79
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,900
From then on, he bore the name Alioth of Plough.

80
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,520
His mighty name was known throughout Five Regions.

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,520
But actually, Feng Xuan has loved him ever since.

82
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,790
Where is this Alioth now?

83
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,030
Since Feng Qi died, he left.

84
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,120
No one knows where he has gone.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,450
What's most important now is Feng Xuan is gravely sick.

86
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,520
She might not last long.

87
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,450
At present, Feng Jingzhi is the one managing the state affairs.

88
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,340
And that Folian, Feng Jingfan, I'm sure she won't just sit and wait for death.

89
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,740
The Plough now is at the edge of eternal doom.

90
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,000
Then does it mean that Young Phoenix Lake is going to be in trouble?

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,330
Deep within Young Phoenix Lake is an auspicious phoenix.

92
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,980
Legend says that this phoenix is guarding a huge evil power inside the lake.

93
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,870
If Plough falls into chaos and Feng Xuan is unable to protect Young Phoenix Lake,

94
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,350
causing that auspicious phoenix to flee, Five Regions then will fall into eternal doom.

95
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,030
Since my wife died in an unjust manner, I have been living like a zombie.

96
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,670
What status, position, or wealth, all are meaningless to me.

97
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,970
Now that Plough is in trouble, I can't just watch as it gets destroyed.

98
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,890
For things that I am powerless to do, I ask Crown Prince Wuji to help us, for sure.

99
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,630
For our Five Regions, for our descendants, please save Plough.

100
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,860
Please.

101
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,170
Young Master Tang is a loyal descendant and an outstanding talent.

102
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,810
May Crown Prince Wuji be at ease in ordering him and training him.

103
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,500
Thank you, Prefect Wu.

104
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,360
Please stop here. You don't need to walk us out more.

105
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,550
If my guess is right, your surname isn't Tang but Feng. Isn't that so?

106
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,870
Your Highness Crown Prince, you indeed are all knowledgeable.

107
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:17,070
After Feng Xuan ascended to the throne, my father's siblings successively suffered misfortunes and died tragically.

108
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,670
My father got discouraged and lived in seclusion.

109
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,940
Duke National Peace's manor is my mother's parents' home.

110
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,990
Afterwards, I also changed my identity and joined the Phoenix Lead Pavilion.

111
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,560
It's my duty to follow the royal clan at their beck and call,

112
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,450
but I don't want to become an assassin that massacred the Five Regions.

113
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,740
Only by stopping Her Majesty early on can we prevent the carnage here in Plough.

114
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,530
This is the reason why I wanted Your Highness Crown Prince to intervene in this matter.

115
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,710
Then it means that the person who wrote Wuji a letter and hoped that he'll come here is you?

116
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,110
I've never sent any letter.

117
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,190
What's this about?

118
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,570
This is not important anymore.

119
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,780
What's important is to investigate how many more secrets Feng Xuan is hiding.

120
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,400
There is one more person in the palace who knows a lot about Her Majesty's secrets.

121
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,570
It's just that this person appears unpredictable and is hard to approach.

122
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,890
There are two groups who are directly under Feng Xuan's command in Plough's Palace.

123
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,270
One is the Phoenix Lead Pavilion that I command.

124
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,660
The other one is this shadow that has never shown his face.

125
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,290
These past years, he has helped Her Majesty do a lot of dirty deeds.

126
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,470
This person's martial arts skills are extremely profound.

127
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,360
Normal people aren't his competition at all.

128
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,160
Could this person you're describing be Alioth?

129
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,280
Only by finding him can we know the truth.

130
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,190
There's one more thing that I need your help with.

131
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,330
Crown Prince, please give the instructions.

132
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,910
We must go to check out Young Phoenix Lake.

133
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,150
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

134
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,310
Just for everything today, I exerted so much effort.

135
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,940
There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.
(T/N: implies that even when a good outcome or conclusion seems certain, things can still go wrong.)

136
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,030
Unexpectedly, you still discovered it.

137
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:37,040
No one is allowed to foil my plan, even my own biological daughter.

138
00:10:53,830 --> 00:11:00,390
They finally have all slowly walked into this trap.

139
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,490
Grand Teacher. Grand Teacher, your wish will soon happen.

140
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,260
I earnestly ask Grand Teacher to bless and protect me all the way.

141
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,130
Let them go and be unable to return.

142
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,940
Grand Teacher.

143
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,250
You did well, but you must not harm her life.

144
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,700
Grand Teacher, it's enough that my wish be granted.

145
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,870
This is the deepest level under Young Phoenix Lake.

146
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,990
Be careful.

147
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,750
This place is really strange.

148
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,780
There are no sounds at all.

149
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,070
You can't even hear the phoenix call.

150
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,390
Silence indeed makes things unpredictable.

151
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,280
What is that area?

152
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,770
That place is the real Young Phoenix Lake.

153
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,040
You...

154
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,750
You, look over there.

155
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,060
There is a fire phoenix.

156
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,280
Where? How come I can't see it?

157
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,290
It's over there...

158
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Come look from where I'm standing. Look.

159
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,600
I can't see it, either.

160
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,960
What?

161
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,360
What did you say?

162
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,390
You also can see it.

163
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,970
Oh, my, you're back!

164
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,920
You scared me to death! I thought something bad happened to you two in Young Phoenix Lake.

165
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,960
What can happen to us?

166
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,870
Be careful!

167
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,670
I'm fine.

168
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,350
It's Feng Xuan's shadow. It's him again.

169
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,510
I'll go meet him. You two stay here.

170
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,320
You stay here. I'll go help him.

171
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,430
Be careful!

172
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,580
Veteran Meng Shuo! Please wait!

173
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,830
Hurry.

174
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,950
Auntie Wan! Auntie Wan!

175
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,110
Let go! Let go of me!

176
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,730
- Let go of me!
- Let go of me!

177
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,120
Don't hit her!

178
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,420
Let go of her! Auntie Wan!

179
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,350
No! Let go of me!

180
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,480
Auntie Wan...

181
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,010
Don't!

182
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,340
Who told you to be disobedient?

183
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,670
Don't hit her!

184
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,550
Auntie Wan!

185
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,260
Auntie Wan!

186
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,100
This?

187
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,990
Fuyao!

188
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,590
- You've killed my older sister.
- I?

189
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,450
How dare you! You killed my older sister.

190
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,360
So you pretended to be the Medical Sage and were harboring evil intentions.

191
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,840
You murdered the queen heir and were caught red-handed.

192
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,480
Younger Sister,

193
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,860
you traveled all the way to come here to our Plough just to complete this great act.

194
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,640
It's really so exciting.

195
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,800
It was you.

196
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,200
You framed me.

197
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,840
Framed?

198
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,220
You're the one who killed her and you're even holding the knife.

199
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,300
Weren't you the one who is a killer?

200
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,180
You pretended to be the Medical Sage,

201
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,970
deliberately got near my Queen Mother, poisoned her.

202
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,690
You entrenched yourself in every step and meticulously plotted.

203
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,430
And, today, you actually killed my older sister.

204
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,030
And she was even so sincere towards you.

205
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:16,960
It was really so pitiful and lamentable.

206
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,480
Don't waste your energy.

207
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,070
Since you accepted my ruyi that day, you have fallen into this trap.

208
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,700
It's hard for you to escape from it anymore.

209
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,760
You poisoned me?

210
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,880
Poisoned?

211
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,440
If I poison you, how can that fool Crown Prince Wuji?

212
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,490
I just asked my Grand Teacher to slightly help me with some trick.

213
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,760
A mere mortal like you can never notice it.

214
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:05,430
I... am going to take back everything that you took from me.

215
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,920
Whether it's your identity or status. Correct.

216
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Also, Wuji.

217
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,160
Because all these were mine to begin with.

218
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,530
All were supposed to be mine! They are mine, Feng Jingfan's!

219
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,860
Folian... Feng Jingfan...

220
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,160
Feng Jingfan?

221
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,270
I beg you already!

222
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,290
I already saw very clearly what kind of person you are.

223
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,160
I already saw those seductive traits you brought with you when you were born.

224
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,720
You should have died long ago.

225
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,250
I should have killed you then!

226
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,930
Why did I allow a source of disaster like you to stay?

227
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,860
Why did I allow you to live and let you become the greatest obstacle between Wuji and I?

228
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,370
You... took away the person that I love the most.

229
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,820
You stole everything that I treasured for these past ten years.

230
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,490
You took away everything that I valued the most for these past ten years.

231
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,270
You should have died in that darkness-filled cold palace.

232
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,520
Why must you harm us?

233
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,960
Why must you harm us?

234
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,800
You deserved it.

235
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,150
These are all your retribution.

236
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,620
Retribution.

237
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,370
Let me tell you.

238
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,550
That person's name was Xu Wan.

239
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,400
Her mistake was... why must she save you then?

240
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,580
Her mistake was that she shouldn't have let a source of disaster like you live.

241
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,560
Hence, she deserved to die.

242
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,200
Don't hit her!

243
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,260
Who am I exactly? Who am I exactly?

244
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,530
Who am I exactly? Who am I exactly?

245
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,500
- Who am I exactly?
- Who are you?

246
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,040
You are... the killer who killed the queen heir of Plough.

247
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,670
You won't make it in time.

248
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,950
Your words don't count.

249
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,560
That was the bell signifying that a person has been murdered here in Plough.

250
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,990
Everything has been finalized.

251
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,130
It can't be unchanged.

252
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,750
You won't be able to reach her in time.

253
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,230
Your words don't count.

254
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,710
I can help you save her.

255
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,830
Make a deal with me.

256
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,440
Who am I exactly?

257
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,380
Why must you frame me?

258
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,020
You must have worn masks for so long

259
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,540
that you've forgotten who you are exactly.

260
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,260
Let me tell you now.

261
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,850
This person isn't some Medical Sage Zong Yue.

262
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,500
Because I saw the real Mr. Zong when I was in Megrez Imperial City.

263
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,420
I also saw... this...

264
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,960
criminal who defied her superiors!

265
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,530
At that time, Lord Emperor had ordered for her to be killed.

266
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,060
I never thought that she actually escaped to our Plough Nation.

267
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,700
Is that true?

268
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,440
It was her who killed my older sister.

269
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,990
I personally saw it.

270
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,520
She was even holding a knife that time.

271
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,340
It was her who killed her.

272
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:01,140
She said that Crown Prince Wuji mustn't have any marital alliance with our queen heir.

273
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,480
She even said that Crown Prince Wuji can only be hers.

274
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,680
Why did you do it?

275
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,690
I didn't kill anyone nor harm anyone.

276
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,800
Who really is the real killer?

277
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,700
Who really is the one who committed a crime?

278
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,670
Your Majesty, don't you clearly know?

279
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,520
Don't worry.

280
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,200
I will give you a grand funeral.

281
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:52,390
I'll announce to the world that you died from excessive exhaustion for working for the nation.

282
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,790
But the gossiping mouth of all those government officials,

283
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,260
how can I block it?

284
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,600
- Queen Mother.
- Who's there?

285
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,800
It's me.

286
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,430
Why did you come?

287
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,270
Leaving your palace without permission, do you know what punishment you'll receive?

288
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,830
I brought Buddhist scriptures that I've newly copied.

289
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,490
I initially planned to help Queen Mother calm your heart and nurse your energy.

290
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,450
But from the looks of it,

291
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,290
Queen Mother seems to have encountered new trouble.

292
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,240
I fear that this book isn't enough.

293
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,890
- How dare you!
- Queen Mother...

294
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,970
- What do you mean?
- I'm willing to unburden you.

295
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:47,430
No matter what I saw, you clearly know that I'm on your side.

296
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,130
It's true.

297
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,890
Right now, I have a perfect plan.

298
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,090
Rise and say it.

299
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,250
I deeply care about you

300
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,320
and wanted to ask Medical Sage Zong Rue to concentrate on nursing your health.

301
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,400
But when I saw that Medical Sage, I kept feeling that there's something wrong with him.

302
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,180
He...is that Fuyao that framed me back in Megrez!

303
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,060
She is not some Medical Sage.

304
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,190
That person is harboring evil intentions and is entrenching herself at every step.

305
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,450
Queen Mother, do you know why she's here in Plough?

306
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,150
Why?

307
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,600
Because...

308
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,380
Just say it.

309
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,930
Because she...

310
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:55,570
is Feng Wuming.

311
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,130
Why didn't you say so sooner?

312
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,920
I just learned about it; hence, I immediately came here to report it to you.

313
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,350
Alike. They indeed looked alike.

314
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,460
Queen Mother, don't worry.

315
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,950
We only need to eliminate the problem down to the roots.

316
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,670
Reason is on our side.

317
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,880
Fuyao pretended to be the Medical Sage,

318
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,410
harbored evil intentions, and assassinated the queen heir.

319
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,400
She should be executed.

320
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,920
How dare you, criminal! All the evidence is against you.

321
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,160
You still dare to refute it?!

322
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,010
This woman disguised as the Medical Sage,

323
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,460
harbored evil intentions, and assassinated the queen heir.

324
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,470
She should be executed.

325
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,910
Wait.

326
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,360
It's fine with me if you want to accuse me of those crimes,

327
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,240
but I can't die confused.

328
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,280
Tell me. Who am I exactly, Feng Jinfan?

329
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,450
You!

330
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,620
Who are you?

331
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,920
Miss Fuyao, you must have been blinded by a moment of selfishness and greed.

332
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,630
In the future, I will surely pray Buddhist scriptures so you can be reincarnated,

333
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,680
and remove this foul aura around you.

334
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,870
Informing Your Majesty.

335
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,620
The assassination of the Heiress Apparent is an extremely saddening matter for whole Plough Nation.

336
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,880
But presently, Plough is swaying in the midst of a storm, a country can't last a day without a ruler.

337
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,660
We all suggest to let Princess Folian ascend to the position of the Heiress Apparent

338
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,600
to placate the hearts of the people.

339
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,700
No.

340
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,730
It's better to seek vengeance for royal eldest sister first.

341
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,970
Let's just talk about it after punishing this murderer.

342
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:47,580
May Queen Mother decide on all the rewards and punishment.

343
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,520
Crown Prince Wuji is here!

344
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,700
Your Majesty.

345
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,190
How come no one came to inform me when such a huge incident has happened in the palace?

346
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,000
Informing Your Majesty.

347
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,990
It is indeed true that this person who assassinated Heiress Apparent has disguised herself as Medical Sage Zong Yue,

348
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,850
but it was still Crown Prince Wuji who brought her here in Plough and introduced her to you.

349
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:43,610
Based on that, does Your Highness Crown Prince have any motive against our Plough?

350
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,950
Generally speaking, our Plough has always treated your empire well.

351
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,530
Now is a year of great disaster.

352
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,020
Imperial City suffered from a noxious epidemic.

353
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,950
We even delivered thirty extra carts of gold to your city.

354
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,550
We also never decreased the deliveries in the past.

355
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,380
Even if we have to diminish our own supply,

356
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,680
we tried our best to guarantee the supply to the Imperial City.

357
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,490
If we're going to talk about loyal service, Plough has always given its best effort.

358
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,500
We don't ask you to remember our merits, but you shouldn't be stabbing us in the back, right?

359
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,180
If Your Highness Crown Prince has some prejudice against us,

360
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,660
why not just directly say it?

361
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,970
Why must you still course it through other people?

362
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,520
- Your Majesty—
- Your Majesty!

363
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,530
Your Majesty, pretending to be Zong Yue was completely my own doing.

364
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,360
- It has nothing to do with Crown Prince.
- You!

365
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,890
If you want to punish anyone, just punish me only.

366
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,300
If it was done by one person, then only one person will be punished.

367
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,520
- Men!
- Here!

368
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,640
Lock this assassin who pretended to be the Medical Sage into Ancient Prison.

369
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,200
Guard her strictly!

370
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,690
Yes.

371
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,590
You two.

372
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,950
Your Majesty, this matter has so many doubtful points.

373
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,270
I earnestly ask to talk with you privately.

374
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,390
Please agree to it.

375
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,760
I still haven't fully recuperated from my illness.

376
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,050
At this moment, I'm already mentally and physically exhausted.

377
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,200
Hope Your Highness Crown Prince understands.

378
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,430
Let's just talk about your matter next time.

379
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,700
Respectfully sending off Your Majesty.

380
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,200
[Astute Time Palace]

381
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,100
Counting the days, I've already taken in the golden sap of blistering beetle for almost a month.

382
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
It won't do me any harm, right?

383
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,400
Your Majesty, don't worry.

384
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,000
The poison in the medicinal soup I've concocted is only around 30%.

385
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
There is also Official Alioth who personally controls the amount.

386
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,400
It will never harm your internal organs.

387
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,700
Plus, the antidote that Medical Sage Zong gave you a few days ago,

388
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,000
Your Majesty's body now doesn't have much poison anymore.

389
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,800
What Medical Sage Zong?

390
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,800
It was just a fake.

391
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,600
Yes.

392
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
Listen well.

393
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
This poisonous golden sap of blistering beetle was a method used by evil people to harm our Plough.

394
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,800
It has nothing to do with Alioth or me.

395
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,400
Do you understand?

396
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,100
I... will continue to keep my mouth shut and obey the command of Your Majesty.

397
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,600
I dare not say any word.

398
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,800
It's good that you remember.

399
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,030
Get up.

400
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,000
You have gained merit.

401
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,200
Your rewards for today will be delivered to your manor.

402
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

403
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,230
This person has no use anymore.

404
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,000
Who am I exactly?

405
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,100
I told you to kill him, but I didn't ask you to do it now.

406
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,000
An old man dying outside my Astute Time Palace, that's such bad luck!

407
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,590
Okay, already.

408
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,340
I was just casually ranting.

409
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,990
I didn't intend to blame you.

410
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,090
I've done my mission.

411
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,900
I'm going now.

412
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,540
Why?

413
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,560
Look at me.

414
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,420
Look at me.

415
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,600
Look at me well.

416
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,600
I clearly looked the same as her.

417
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,100
How come I can't be the one?

418
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,140
Tell me.

419
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,300
Why?

420
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,840
You are not her.

421
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,970
Never will be.

422
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,600
Too bad.

423
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,000
Her life and death is in my hands.

424
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,600
You finally can't help yourself and want to kill me.

425
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,900
You served by my side for nineteen years.

426
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,400
If you dared to do it,

427
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,500
I would have died a thousand times.

428
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,600
Killing me?

429
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,580
It is too easy for you.

430
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,000
But too bad...

431
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,500
you can't bear to.

432
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,400
You can't bear for me to die

433
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,800
and can't bear to continue searching for the whereabouts of your wife and child.

434
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,100
If I die,

435
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,400
you will never find them.

436
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,300
Isn't that so?

437
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,200
These past years, you've turned into a ruthless being.

438
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,800
Just to gain power, you killed so many innocent people.

439
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,800
What's funny is I actually was that most vicious blade in your hand.

440
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,400
I fear that this dirty blood on me can never be cleaned anymore.

441
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,060
What does being not a human nor a ghost mean?

442
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,200
What does having a heart that's like ash mean?

443
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,800
Look! Look!

444
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,800
You really think that I would believe you?

445
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
It was you who forced me to make a life pact.

446
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,400
It was you who forced me to kill people for power.

447
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,000
It was you who forced me to become what I am now.

448
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,800
And you even said that you'll help me find them.

449
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I think that you'd rather take the secret to your grave

450
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,400
than tell it to me, am I right?

451
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Even if it's like that, you brought it on yourself!

452
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,400
Who told you to choose Feng Qi then and not me?

453
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,900
In terms of appearance,

454
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,000
I looked completely the same as her.

455
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,600
In terms of talent and learning,

456
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,000
I never lost to her.

457
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,400
In terms of strategies fit for a ruler, I'm better than her by a mile!

458
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,800
For so many years, your feelings for her have never changed!

459
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,600
Why?

460
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,800
Why must I let you live a happy life?

461
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,400
I wanted to die long ago.

462
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,600
Since living will be this painful, then let's just die together!

463
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,650
Your daughter isn't dead.

464
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,890
Where is she?

465
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,430
Where is she exactly?

466
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,300
Don't rush.

467
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,800
After I execute that murderer who killed the queen heir tomorrow,

468
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:21,700
everything in the past, the whereabouts of your daughter,

469
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,100
I will tell them all to you.

470
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,800
Okay.

471
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,500
I'll wait.

472
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,900
Girl!

473
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,160
Sorry.

474
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,400
I had you suffer. I'll take you out of here now.

475
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,200
Wait a minute.

476
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,470
I can't leave.

477
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,200
I don't want to leave.

478
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,000
I've investigated this whole matter.

479
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,300
I will never spare those that harmed you.

480
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,380
The reason I don't want to leave is...

481
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,600
Do you remember that I once told you that I'm investigating a phoenix totem?

482
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,800
I seemed to have seen that totem when I was little,

483
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,850
but I can't remember where.

484
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,500
Although Folian framed me this time,

485
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,600
it made me remember some incidents in the past,

486
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,200
but all are still very fuzzy.

487
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,800
Hence, I want to continue staying here and see if I can find out about my past.

488
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,100
Maybe I will be able to remember who I am.

489
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,400
I'll help you.

490
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,700
I also found out a few things on my side.

491
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,800
I can vaguely see the truth behind the royal palace of Plough.

492
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,500
Maybe your true identity is deeply connected with the secret of this royal palace.

493
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,000
We must start here.

494
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,600
But if we want to find the truth out, we still must ask one person for help.

495
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,820
Who are you talking about?

496
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,600
Alioth.

497
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,800
He is already an old person in this palace.

498
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,600
As Feng Xuan's shadow, everything that happened here in the palace,

499
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,200
he knows it more than anyone else.

500
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,600
Why would he help us?

501
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,800
I made an agreement with him.

502
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,060
As long as I can help him find the whereabouts of his wife and daughter,

503
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,000
he then will secretly help us here in the Plough Palace

504
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,800
and try his best to restrict Feng Xuan.

"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

506
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,900
♫ What do you know? ♫

507
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,800
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

508
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,600
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

509
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,000
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

510
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,600
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

511
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,400
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

512
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,400
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

513
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,000
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

514
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

515
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

516
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,100
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

517
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,600
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

518
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,600
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

519
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,800
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

520
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,000
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

521
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,200
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

522
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,500
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

523
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,400
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

524
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,200
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

525
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,200
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

526
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,600
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

527
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
♫ Dreams beg heart  ♫

528
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,200
♫ to grant me love and have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

529
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,200
♫ Have someone's company♫

530
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,000
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

531
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,200
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

532
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,400
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

533
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,000
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

534
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,100
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

535
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:58,400
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

536
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,800
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

537
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,000
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫
