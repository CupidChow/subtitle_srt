00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,300
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,470
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,580
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,870
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,940
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,810
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,440
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,050
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,730
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,790
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,990
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,650
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful ♫

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,330
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,430
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:21,510
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,780
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,100
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,430
~ Episode 21 ~

22
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,690
I'll bathe and change.

23
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,340
You come do it.

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
Yes.

25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,270
This Mystic Spirit Leaf is with me all the time.

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,210
If you can take that away from me, I'll help you break the seals.

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,510
If you can't obtain it this same day of next month,

28
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,950
you will have to obey me and work for me.

29
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,530
This is an item that I carry around with me everywhere I go.

30
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,320
You must be extra careful.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,020
Yes.

32
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,030
On this kind of day, I want to drink some sweet osmanthus brew.

33
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,270
I am the most skilled at making sweet osmanthus brew.

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,730
If Your Majesty doesn't mind, I am willing to make it for Your Majesty.

35
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,980
How could I let you do such lowly chores?

36
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,600
How is this a chore?

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,280
Your Majesty, as long as Your Majesty is willing,

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,870
even if you want this heart of Rong'er,

39
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,750
Rong'er would be willing to give it.

40
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,540
Do you have an objection?

41
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,540
I do not dare.

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,160
Since you mean well, I can't turn away your good intentions.

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,390
Go then.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,990
Yes.

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,660
You all retreat, too.

46
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,770
Yes.

47
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,620
You stay.

48
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,860
This little eunuch here.

49
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,300
You look...

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,280
a bit unfamiliar.

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,960
Strangers in the first meeting, acquaintances in the second meeting, Your Majesty.

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,410
In the middle of night,

53
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,870
coming without being invited, a single man and a single woman,

54
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,630
I can't guarantee that I'll maintain consciousness.

55
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,440
So you already discovered me a while back?

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,450
Fine, you don't need to remain conscious.

57
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,800
I'll leave after I get the Mystic Spirit Leaf.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,190
Disgusting. This trick again?

59
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,200
I like this trick.

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,870
Girl, don't be impatient.

61
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,990
So impatient?

62
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,150
I hide from you again and again and avoid you,

63
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,100
yet the result turns out contrary to my expectations.

64
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,220
I meet you time and time again.

65
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,130
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

66
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,160
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

67
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,690
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

68
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,590
Since this is fated to be doomed love,

69
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,390
then I'll act willfully this one time.

70
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,860
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

71
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,080
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

72
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,980
Your Majesty.

73
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,690
Your Majesty... save me.

74
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,860
Your Majesty, save me!

75
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,460
What was the point of hitting a woman?

76
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,490
The master is right here.

77
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,080
Today is your day of death!

78
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,390
Didn't I tell you to hide?

79
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,130
Why are you so disobedient?

80
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,590
If the obedient one is already lying on the ground...

81
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,250
You've gotten what you want. Why are you still here?

82
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,150
If you die, who will I ask for good luck from?

83
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,570
- That's it?
- What else did you expect?

84
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,910
You, you're actually very skilled,

85
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,980
but you pretended to be injured.

86
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,880
I'm willing to.

87
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,020
There are assassins! Protect His Majesty!

88
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,070
You, girl. are weird enough.

89
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,200
When normal people come up against dangers, they can't wait to hide.

90
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,660
Unlike you, always throwing yourself out there even if you're not capable.

91
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,910
You're fated to die.

92
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,980
If everyone hides,

93
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,440
then everyone just dies together.

94
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,540
I'd rather give it a try to fight and there may be a way out.

95
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,150
But you're still a woman after all.

96
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,190
Women are destined to be protected by men and cared for by men.

97
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,350
Let the men do the violent fighting.

98
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,630
Be gentle.

99
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,000
Those are the majority of women.

100
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,670
Not me.

101
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,360
Right, it's not you.

102
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,790
It's not you.

103
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,060
Earlier,

104
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,370
in the water earlier,

105
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,610
why were you so unusual?

106
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,280
So special,

107
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,430
I can't bear to let you leave.

108
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,210
When did you steal it?

109
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,800
This was a bet to start with.

110
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,360
Now I've won.

111
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,000
You need to concede defeat.

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,560
You? You cheated.

113
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,080
No matter what, a win is a win.

114
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,040
Girl, don't be stubborn.

115
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,850
You lost this bet willingly.

116
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,320
Your Majesty!

117
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,220
Hurry up. Hurry up.

118
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,200
Hurry up.

119
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,980
- Your Majesty.
- Hurry Up.

120
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,870
Your Majesty!

121
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,160
I'm not done with you yet.

122
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,950
I'm willing to pester you till death.

123
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,980
It is full of guards out there.

124
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,130
It's safer to hide here.

125
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,980
- Your Majesty!
- Hurry up.

126
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,580
Your Majesty! Hurry up. Hurry up.

127
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,980
Call the Imperial doctor. Dear Consort was hurt badly for saving me.

128
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,960
Hurry up. Hurry up.

129
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,020
Bastard.

130
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,170
What's going on? Where is the King?

131
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,510
Why isn't His Majesty here yet?

132
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,650
All officials, listen to me.

133
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,280
His Majesty was seriously injured during an assassination attempt last night.

134
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,390
He won't be here for the morning gathering today.

135
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,160
Dear Officials, please leave.

136
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,630
What? Assassination?

137
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,640
Who would have thought?

138
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,970
Was this incident arranged by you?

139
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,130
What are you talking about, Prince?

140
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,140
I'm telling you, Prime Minister. Why are you so impatient?

141
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,280
He was recently enthroned.

142
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,200
You should be patient before you take action.

143
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,690
Prince, why do you say this?

144
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,180
Why would I kill him?

145
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,070
Were the assassins last night your men?

146
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,490
If I wanted to kill him, I wouldn't need to drag in many people to do it.

147
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,280
That wouldn't be an assassination.

148
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,200
It would clearly be a suicide.

149
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,930
It really wasn't you?

150
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,580
I want to find out who it was, too.

151
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,350
Who could it be then?

152
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,130
- Prime Minister
- Eunuch.

153
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,960
How is His Majesty?

154
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,020
To answer your question, His Majesty is not seriously injured.

155
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,330
He only has a small wound,

156
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,120
but he went ballistic.

157
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,350
Yes. Didn't he already issue an order?

158
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,600
He replaced all the guards in the inner palace, such as the Imperial Patrol.

159
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,640
- He replaced them?
- Yes.

160
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,120
When did this happen?

161
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,930
Just now.

162
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,110
His Majesty already said that whoever dares to plead,

163
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,990
he'll be removed from office and put under investigation.

164
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,480
Thanks, Eunuch. I understand.

165
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,470
I'm taking my leave.

166
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,930
I still have work to do at the palace. Okay?

167
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,340
Godfather, are you saying that His Majesty planned his own assassination?

168
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,080
Last night, the assassins were able to sneak into the palace easily.

169
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,610
They definitely weren't amateurs.

170
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,560
Yet Xuanyuan Min only suffered a light injury.

171
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,260
Isn't that strange?

172
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,020
I think he already knows that the guards inside or outside of the palace are all my spies.

173
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,020
He's using this opportunity to get rid of them all.

174
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,090
So, to say, we must not underestimate this puppet king.

175
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,090
I can replace all the guards one by one again.

176
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:25,670
But for the time being, I must have a real spy next to him to monitor him.

177
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,350
Otherwise, the consequences will be dire.

178
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,780
The Lady has said that she must be the most eye-catching at this coming Winter Clothing Festival.

179
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,830
That says even if there are ghosts in Dense Beam Palace Hall, we still need to go.

180
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,030
Is the Dense Beam Palace Hall really that magical?

181
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,640
That's right.

182
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,220
Then, how did you know about this?

183
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,190
I heard this from Madam.

184
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,690
She said that the Lustrous Mirror hidden in Dense Beam Palace Hall can reflect a thousand of a person's reflections.

185
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,470
It's entirely mystical.

186
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,470
Whoever looked at it will become entranced.

187
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,030
But not anyone can enter the Dense Beam Hall.

188
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,090
It's haunted.

189
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,440
I also heard that the Lustrous Mirror has a curse.

190
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,390
It can kill.

191
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,530
But if we don't get the mirror, we will die.

192
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,360
This task is really too difficult.

193
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,310
Looks like we need to go there tonight.

194
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,890
That's right.

195
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,670
What mirror were you talking about?

196
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,360
- No. No. We didn't say anything.
- We didn't say anything.

197
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,220
Gao Puruo is bringing a mirror to the Winter Clothing Festival.

198
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,660
If a mirror is there, then I—

199
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,470
Miss, you must take good care of yourself.

200
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,500
You must not look into water or mirrors.

201
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,720
Any reflective object will reveal your true form.

202
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,230
You must remember! You must remember!

203
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,080
If you are going to use this, I will shatter it.

204
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,360
Old Master, you say the rich people in the capital are well-informed.

205
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,870
Now that our miss just came back, look, the visit request cards are flowing in.

206
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,780
Official Qian Minyuan even sent some calligraphy, painting and jade.

207
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,080
I didn't dare to accept them and returned everything.

208
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,140
His staff made it very clear.

209
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,410
He said Official Qian's son turned eighteen years old this year.

210
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,370
He'd like a marriage alliance with the Prime Minister.

211
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:41,010
A measly Jonkheer dares to seek connections in our high place.

212
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,420
- These pampered sons in a manor are all good for nothings.
- Right.

213
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,620
How can they be worthy of Yun'er?

214
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,850
When you receive such match-making again, just tell them that Yun'er is still young.

215
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,200
She is not of marriageable age yet. Decline them all.

216
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,010
Yes, Old Master.

217
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,170
Old Master, are you going to Miss' room?

218
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,680
Yes, she has been staying in the manor for the past few years.

219
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,250
She couldn't go anywhere.

220
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,950
Did she throw a tantrum?

221
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,910
Miss said she was feeling bored in the manor.

222
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,420
She went out with Yun Hen in the morning.

223
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:25,320
Fortunately, Yun Hen is the same age as Miss in this manor.

224
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
Ever since First Miss came home,

225
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,150
Yun Hen has been doing everything he can to keep her happy.

226
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,300
He thinks of new things every day to entertain her so she won't be bored.

227
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,820
- Is that so?
- Yes.

228
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,430
Actually, they grew up together anyway.

229
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,460
The fate of childhood friends is indeed different.

230
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,470
I remember when Yun Hen just arrived here, he was a servant.

231
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,450
A servant will always be a servant.

232
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,970
Yes.

233
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,280
Are you saying that the Dragon Scale Armor was on Qi Yun?

234
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,990
Why do you say that?

235
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,220
Have you seen anyone resurrected from the dead?

236
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,910
I have seen it.

237
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,720
Qi Yun's mother gave birth to her at seven months.

238
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,520
Ever since she was born,

239
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,840
her blood counter-flows.

240
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,980
The location of her muscles and bones are also different from normal people.

241
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,540
All the physicians in the city said that she would not survive past six years old.

242
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,430
How can a child, who was supposed to die, still be alive now?

243
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,360
It passes comprehension.

244
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
A blood disorder?

245
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,700
That's right.

246
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,110
Can it be cured?

247
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,730
A highly skilled Taoist at that time told Qi Zhen that

248
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,800
this is caused by Qi Yun's extremely cold inner energy.

249
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,320
In order to continue to live,

250
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,770
it can only be suppressed by the super hot energy of the Dragon Scale Armour.

251
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,380
Now I see Qi Yun again. She is normal.

252
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,420
She has either been cured or

253
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,940
the Dragon Scale Armor is on her.

254
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,750
How can we ascertain this?

255
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,390
A physician has his way of knowing.

256
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,900
[Dense Beam Palace Hall]

257
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,740
It's such a big place.

258
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,760
Where could the mirror be?

259
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,370
Yuan Bao?

260
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,690
Don't run!

261
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,040
Trying to run away?

262
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,900
You are a fox.

263
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,310
I thought you were Yuan Bao.

264
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,580
You bit me?

265
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Stop there.

266
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,600
Where are you?

267
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,400
This is the Lustruos Mirror, isn't it?

268
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,530
Lady, it’s been half an hour.

269
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,050
The Prime Minister is still not here.

270
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,690
Why don’t we go back first?

271
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,080
If someone sees us,

272
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,640
it will be troublesome.

273
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,740
Wait for a bit more.

274
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,990
Greetings, Prime Minister.

275
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,130
Greetings, Prime Minister.

276
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,910
Lady.

277
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,120
Please don't, Prime Minister. I don't deserve this.

278
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,740
If you didn’t recommend me,

279
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,260
I wouldn’t have a chance to enter this palace.

280
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,640
My father always reminds me, too.

281
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,550
The Tang family is favored only because the Prime Minister takes care of us.

282
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,010
I don’t dare to forget.

283
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,930
I don’t even know how I can thank you.

284
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,270
How can I accept your bow?

285
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,070
Consort selection is related to the royal family's bloodline.

286
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,440
Sharing the king’s burden is my job, too.

287
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,710
Your father, General Tang, is a loyal and brave talent.

288
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,270
You're also beautiful and smart.

289
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,850
It is reasonable for you to get selected.

290
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,920
To be honest,

291
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,990
I entered the palace alone.

292
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,480
My father and older brothers are far away.

293
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,930
If I really want to stay in this palace comfortably,

294
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,080
I think I need to rely on you, Prime Minister.

295
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,090
The background of all the concubines aren’t simple.

296
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,910
And the King took care of me, too.

297
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:56,030
I’m afraid... I’m afraid that someone will take my life one day.

298
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,400
I've known your father for many years.

299
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,850
We are also good friends.

300
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,070
It’s my responsibility to take care of you.

301
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,050
But the palace is full of intrigue.

302
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,350
There are also many ruthless people.

303
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,230
Even if I have you to protect me,

304
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,800
it's inevitable someone will find an opportunity to harm me.

305
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,040
If—

306
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,640
If...

307
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,540
If what?

308
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,720
If I could be the queen of the nation,

309
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:38,200
I think I would not be on tenterhooks then.

310
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,790
If you can help me,

311
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,090
Rong’er will definitely follow your instructions.

312
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:58,020
Who will be the Queen, it all depends on His Majesty.

313
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,520
Since you have that mind,

314
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,490
I guess you already know which side you should stand,

315
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,690
what you should say or shouldn’t say.

316
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:16,000
If there’s a chance, I would definitely praise you in front of His Majesty.

317
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,130
Thank you very much, Prime Minister.

318
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,710
It's going to be the Winter Clothing Festival in a couple of days.

319
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,720
According to the rules, that day will be the day the Queen is selected.

320
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,500
Grand festival of the royal family, what a great chance.

321
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,320
You can prepare yourself well.

322
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,370
Thank you for your advice, Prime Minister.

323
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,900
I told you, I can shop on my own.

324
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,320
I’ll follow you.

325
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,660
My father sent you here to look after me, right?

326
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,050
Prime Minister is just caring about you.

327
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,350
Why do I need him to care?

328
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,100
Prefecture Princess.

329
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,110
What did you call me?

330
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,760
Prefecture... Prefecture Princess.

331
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,910
Didn't you always call me "Yun’er, Yun'er" in the past?

332
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,410
Why aren’t you calling me that now?

333
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,160
Master and servant are on different levels.

334
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,360
No way. You call me "Yun’er."

335
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,340
You call me "Yun’er."

336
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,170
You call me "Yun’er."

337
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,880
You call...!

338
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,900
Call me "Yun’er."

339
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,070
Call me "Yun’er," all right?

340
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,570
Yun’er.

341
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,720
This is better.

342
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,930
Let's go. Shop in VIP Shop with me.

343
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,150
Let's go! Hurry up!

344
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,120
You've put out so many new chic outfits and accessories.

345
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,160
I guess I can’t protect my purse.

346
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,870
Miss, what you spend will all be worth it.

347
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,720
Our VIP Shop has obtained the best products in the Five Regions.

348
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,260
All the ladies from big families in Capital Kun like to come here.

349
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,640
If you don’t see anything you like,

350
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,760
come look at those over there.

351
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,990
See if you like any of them.

352
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,760
This is not bad.

353
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,360
It suits my hairpin.

354
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,240
If you like, we can ask people to send it to your manor.

355
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,910
It’s okay. I’ll try it now.

356
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,760
The Miss is going to try out the dress. Why are you following?

357
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,750
Are you afraid that you may lose her?

358
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,080
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

359
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,820
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

360
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,620
Who caged me?

361
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,430
Stop wasting your energy.

362
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,620
You can’t escape.

363
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,630
Who’s this?

364
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,630
You’re Older Sister Immortal, right?

365
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,230
I guess I’m dreaming about Older Sister Immortal.

366
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,940
You’re a sweet talker.

367
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,290
I would like to ask. How should I call such a beautiful Older Sister Immortal?

368
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,490
I don't need you to judge whether I'm immortal or just beautiful.

369
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,210
There’re many people who praised me in the world.

370
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,690
You’re not the only one.

371
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,280
But people like you, who are not afraid to die,

372
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,520
you’re the first one I've met.

373
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,150
I’m afraid to die.

374
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,030
I’m really afraid to die.

375
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,760
I... I... I didn’t come here purposely to disturb you.

376
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,590
I... I... I...

377
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,500
Looking how honest I am,

378
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,700
can you not cage me? Okay?

379
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,150
Entering Dense Beam Palac Hall without permission,

380
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,370
you disturbed my quietness.

381
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,870
You deserve to die.

382
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,040
Don’t do that. I didn’t disturb you purposely.

383
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,910
That’s because just now... because there’s a stinky fox which bit me.

384
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,030
I followed that stinky fox in.

385
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,590
It’s all that fox’s fault.

386
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,720
What did you say? A fox?

387
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,270
Right. There’s a white fox there.

388
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,630
That white fox bit me.

389
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,680
Are you blind? The mystic, spiritual, one-and-only white fox in the world

390
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,920
was getting such... such terrible comments from you.

391
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,760
You’re really blind.

392
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,180
So many years. In order to avoid everyone,

393
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,750
in order to let everyone believe that Dense Beam Palace Hall was haunted,

394
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,740
I... I worked so hard.

395
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,060
Now, it's actually messed by you, a little child.

396
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,120
I want to cage you! Cage you! Cage you! Cage you!

397
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,830
Cage you! Cage you! Cage you!

398
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,560
What is this?

399
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
This is mine.

400
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,500
This is very important to me.

401
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,800
No joke. No joke.

402
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Return it to me, okay?

403
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,900
Very important?

404
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,300
So...

405
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,000
it's very important?

406
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,990
I'm definitely not giving it to you.

407
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,400
Return it to me. It's very important.

408
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,600
Don't go.

409
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,300
What's... What's going on?

410
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,400
Have you seen Mr. Qiu?

411
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,500
He had also told you what I ought to tell you.

412
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,000
You know what path you should take in the future.

413
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,450
How would I not know?

414
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,900
I treated the Prime Minister's manor as my home originally.

415
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,630
Taking Qi Zhen father and his daughter as my family.

416
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:38,250
He brought me up, taught me and also doted on me.

417
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,400
Other than not having the biological relationship,

418
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,900
he has never treated me badly.

419
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,970
Now,

420
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,900
you are here and brought your hatred along with you.

421
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,270
You tell me I took an enemy as a father.

422
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,520
Where should I go next?

423
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,400
You tell me.

424
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,600
If I didn't tell you the truth and it would make you happy the rest of your life,

425
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,260
that would be worth it.

426
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,600
But you have always been by Qi Zhen's side,

427
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,870
you scheme against other people by any possible ways.

428
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,800
Are you really happy doing that?

429
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
You regard him as your godfather.

430
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,800
He only treats you as a loyal dog.

431
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,400
Qi Zhen only cares about benefits.

432
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,200
He has no sentimentality.

433
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,000
You wandered the country alone.

434
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,600
Of course, you suspect everyone to be evil.

435
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,800
Qi Zhen and King Father were sworn brothers.

436
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,000
They would die for each other.

437
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,500
My One Hundred Day elebration was organized by him.

438
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,600
Everyone throughout the imperial court knew Qi Zhen and King Father were as close as true brothers.

439
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,300
It's because of this,

440
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,600
that King Father was framed with no warning.

441
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,300
It's why you and I were separated for eighteen years.

442
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,800
Talking about evil,

443
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,300
what can match him?

444
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,000
I have lost my biological parents.

445
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,050
Now,

446
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,710
you even want me to lose the person who brought me up.

447
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,600
There were seventy eight people who died that night in the Heir Apparent's manor.

448
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,100
I can still smell the stench of blood from that night now.

449
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,800
Your parents, relatives and those seventy-eight lives,

450
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,900
are they not able to compare to a murderer you treat as a father?

451
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,200
If you insist on being his dog,

452
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,800
I can't stop you.

453
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,500
However, the Xuanyuan family can no longer acknowledge you.

But there's one thing.

469
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Qi Yun has nothing to do with the grudge between the two families.

But the enmity due to the extermination makes it impossible for both of you to live under the same sky.

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,000
♫ The world is the embrace ♫

488
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,700
The Dragon Scale Armor has always belonged to the Xuanyuan family.

♫ Only love is the remedy for heart ♫

490
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,670
Your Majesty, please read over and give remarks on these.

491
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,500
The Prime Minister looks over regular memorials to the throne.

492
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,200
I haven't taken back that order.

493
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,800
Yes. It's just that Official Guo from Imperial Auditorium is waiting outside.

494
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,800
He wants to discuss the Heavenly Offering Ceremony with you personally.

495
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,400
The Deep Water's Ceremony has been conducted for thousands of years.

496
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
He can't change it to whatever he wants.

497
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,250
Tell him to do it as tradition dictates.

498
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,400
Having you to supervise him will be okay.

499
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,700
Go now. Take these away.

500
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,200
Yes, Your Majesty. I'm going to reply to Official Guo now.

501
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Mister, something bad has happened.

502
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,300
Some news from the harem says that Fuyao has been missing for two days.

503
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,900
At first, the servants thought she'd escaped for fun.

504
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,500
They didn't pay attention to it and just said she was sick.

505
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Now, they've searched both inside and outside the palace and can't find her.

506
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,800
This girl is skilled in martial arts.

507
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,000
If she really needed to fight,

508
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,400
even the Head of the Imperial Guards in the palace wouldn't be able to take her down.

509
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,300
She has been missing for two days.

510
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
There are only two possibilities.

511
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,800
First, she has gone into hiding herself.

512
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,600
She probably wouldn't do this.

513
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Second, I'm afraid she has met someone whom she can't defeat.

514
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
There are not that many people in the palace who can defeat Miss Fuyao.

515
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,300
Could it be—

517
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,600
♫ What do you know? ♫

518
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,600
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

519
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,400
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

520
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,600
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

521
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,300
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

522
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,200
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

523
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,200
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

524
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,800
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

525
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,800
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

526
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,600
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

527
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,700
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

528
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,400
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

529
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,400
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

530
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,500
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

531
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:26,700
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

532
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,000
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

533
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,200
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

534
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

535
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,000
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

536
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

537
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,300
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

538
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,300
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

539
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,000
And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

♫ Have someone's company♫
