♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,500
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,720
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,820
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,100
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,810
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,500
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,040
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,670

~ Episode 40 ~

22
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,530
Don't!

23
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,290
Just kill me!

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,140
This is the ending that a traitor should have!

25
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,920
Kill her! Kill them all!

26
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,510
Don't spare any of them!

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,010
Mister!

28
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,170
Don't go, Mister! Don't go.

29
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,080
It's my life that they want.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,860
If I die, they will spare you your life.

31
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,230
Miss, I already killed so many of them.

32
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,990
Do you think they will let me go free?

33
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,180
All right then,

34
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,500
let us die together.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,630
I was going to ask you to send him a message, but it looks like that can't be done now.

36
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,630
I only hope Mister can promise me to destroy my dead body after I die.

37
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,350
I don't want it to fall into their hands.

38
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,630
Master's order is to protect you and keep you safe.

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,400
Whether I live or die, I can't disappoint him.

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Mister! Mister!

41
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,810
Fuyao?

42
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,550
Fuyao?

43
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,230
Tie Cheng, don't cry.

44
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,600
Fuyao.

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,650
I know you've tried your best.

46
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,580
For your kindness to me, I, Fuyao, will repay you in the afterlife.

47
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,550
Yuan Bao, is it Fuyao...

48
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,860
is it Fuyao who asked you to come here?

49
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,450
How is she?

50
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,370
Sorry to trouble you. Quick, quick.

51
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,820
Quick. Quickly go find her. Quick.

52
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,790
People are like Flowing Light.

53
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,070
In life and death,

54
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,360
one has no fear.

55
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,260
Oh no! It's Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend.

- Quickly run!
- Quickly run!

57
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,080
Quickly run!

58
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,410
Woman, I didn't keep an eye on you for just a moment, then you got yourself into trouble.

59
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,400
Zhan Beiye.

60
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,260
Of course, it's me.

61
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,200
Dark Storm Cavalry, hear my command!

62
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,270
Kill them!

63
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,820
Charge!

64
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,930
Where do you want to go?

65
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,630
Where to go?

66

[Yao City]

67
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,410
Except here, anywhere will do.

68
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,410
Fuyao?

69
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,200
Fuyao.

70
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,210
You finally wake up.

71
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,580
How long was I asleep?

72
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,110
Three days already.

73
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,060
Don't move.

74
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,050
Get more rest.

75
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,670
This? What place is this?

76
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,570
My military camp.

77
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,890
You now have to recuperate from your wounds.

78
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,430
Is there... Is there news about Wuji?

79
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,960
Are you talking about that Prince Wuji who was disguised as the King of Deep Water?

80
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,010
Xiaoqi told me about him.

81
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,970
On your way here, did you see him?

82
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,650
Or have you heard anything about him?

83
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,940
I already sent people to look for him.

84
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,330
Here.

85
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,250
I had a dream.

86
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:24,080
I dreamed of Wuji. I dreamed about Wuji in the desert.

87
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:31,800
That desert has no trees or water but blue mist.

88
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,150
He was stranded there.

89
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,440
What else did you see in your dream?

90
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,900
I also saw... Wuji... Wuji's hands...

91
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:58,270
hands turned into stone and unable to move.

92
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,850
Beside him... Beside him there were lots of rocks.

93
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,000
All... All were transformed from humans.

94
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,170
Why did he go to such a desert?

95
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,320
Why is there such a desert in the world?

96
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,290
What's going on?

97
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,200
Since it was just a dream, so nothing in it was real.

98
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,520
Don't worry.

99
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,950
I want to go save Wuji.

100
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,590
I—

101
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,640
I want to go save him.

102
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,420
General, has Miss Fuyao woken up?

103
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,930
- Yes, she has awakened.
- Here.

104
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,890
Before, when we abducted Miss Fuyao in Capital Kun,

105
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,140
I just felt that she was an arrogant and unbridled wild girl that dared to charge and fight.

106
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,030
But looking at her now,

107
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,760
she actually was able to carry the burden of the citizens

108
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,380
and became the general of Yao City.

109
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,370
In taking command of an army and annihilating the bandits, she won't lose to men.

110
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,160
She really opened my eyes and made me have a whole new respect for her.

111
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,170
General, Miss Fuyao was able to survive such a grave ordeal and will surely experience blessings in the future.

112
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,990
With you by her side now,

113
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,440
no one can easily bully her anymore.

114
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,590
Stop worrying too much.

115
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,640
Although she's awake now, she's still severely injured.

116
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,920
I still got there too late.

117
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,970
Also, what I'm most worried about now is her dream.

118
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,780
Dream?

119
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,690
She said she dreamed of the desert and a blue mist.

120
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,990
- Isn't that?
- That forbidden area in Geya Desert.

121
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,550
She... How could she have dreamed of that place?

122
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,380
She even said that she saw Crown Prince Wuji.

123
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,130
Also, Crown Prince even contracted the Stone Petrifying Disease.

124
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,180
Maybe... Maybe this is just a coincidence.

125
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,580
After all, it was just a dream.

126
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,300
Impossible.

127
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,910
The people I sent to look for Crown Prince Wuji had reported back

128
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,680
that the place where the Crown Prince disappeared is exactly the Geya Desert.

129
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,850
But for such a dangerous place that you yourself avoid entering,

130
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,520
how could Crown Prince Wuji not know that?

131
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,820
Risking danger out of desperation, he must have had no other choice.

132
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,580
If Miss Fuyao's dream is true,

133
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,600
then this Crown Prince Wuji can only die in there.

134
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,910
Older Sis Fuyao! Why are you up?

135
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,110
Quickly lie down. Have a good rest. Come.

136
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,150
What's wrong? Are you all right?

137
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,680
- I-I want to go out.
- What are you doing?

138
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,720
- You want to... Where are you going?
- I want to go...

139
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,300
You're badly hurt so just have a good rest.

140
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,260
Lie down. Hurry. You lie down yourself.

141
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,230
You know that I'm very weak and you're still not helping me?

142
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,540
I'm exactly helping you.

143
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,860
You should be recuperating right now, got it?

144
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,650
You mustn't go anywhere. Be obedient. Lie down.

145
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,240
Wuji is in danger.

146
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,910
I-I am going to save him.

147
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,290
I know that he's in danger now so all the more I can't let you go.

148
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,300
Look at how badly injured you are now. Even if you go to Geya Desert, you will just be going there to die!

149
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,780
You... hurry and just lie down.

150
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,270
What did you say?

151
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,800
I didn't say anything.

152
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,900
I said that you quickly lie down. Be good.

153
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,280
What... What Geya Desert?

154
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,630
What? Say it.

155
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,980
- No.
- Say it!

156
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,980
No, it was General Zhan who said it earlier.

157
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,200
He said about the Geya Desert is a place of no return.

158
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,620
Crown Prince Wuji, he—

159
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,330
Older Sis Fuyao, don't go down!

160
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,030
Are you all right?

161
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,490
Older Sis Fuyao, quickly go back up.

162
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,730
Whether he's alive or dead, I must personally see it.

163
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,980
If you go there like this now, it's too dangerous!

164
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,760
Quickly go back up, Older Sis Fuyao. Be obedient.

165
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,060
Just lie down first, okay?

166
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,410
- Wuji...
- No, you can't go!

167
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,230
- Older Sis Fuyao!
- Wuji...

168
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,360
I won't let you go

169
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,490
General Zhan! General Zhan!

170
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,700
General Zhan, Older Sis Fuyao can't last long anymore!

171
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,350
Quickly come here!

172
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,490
General Zhan! Older Sis Fuyao, don't scare me!

173
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,790
General Zhan!

174
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,050
Fuyao? Fuyao?

175
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,290
General Zhan, Older Sis Fuyao is fine. Right?

176
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,180
The matter I'm most worried about still happened.

177
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,060
General Zhan, I beg you to save her.

178
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,150
She can't die.

179
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,680
I beg you to save her, General Zhan!

180
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,420
I beg you to save her.

181
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,340
General Zhan, I beg you to save her.

182
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,600
Save her, General Zhan.

183
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,630
I beg you to save Older Sis Fuyao, General Zhan.

184
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,130
Let me borrow the Earth Absorbing Bell for a while.

185
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,170
General, you must not!

186
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,400
You all get out.

187
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,080
General, this might cause you your life. You must not!

188
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,090
I said that you all get out!

189
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,020
Go!

190
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,960
Xiaoqi, can you stop moving back and forth in front of me? Don't you get dizzy?

191
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,150
The one in danger is Older Sis Fuyao. Of course, you're not panicking.

192
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,190
Not panicking?

193
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,000
You only know that Fuyao is in danger.

194
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,580
Do you know that for General to save her...

195
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,990
what method he will be using?

196
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,330
No, what do you mean?

197
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,890
I will not let you die.

198
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,200
General is going to use the Earth Absorbing Bell

199
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,410
to transfer his spiritual sense and inner power to Miss Fuyao.

200
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,730
This is equivalent to tying his life with Fuyao.

201
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,020
He... then...

202
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,730
Then will General Zhan be in danger?

203
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,030
Using this method is just a minor matter if it only harms one's vitality.

204
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,750
But if the two of them get trapped in their dream,

205
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,440
they will never wake up.

206
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,630
That is a major problem then.

207
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,210
What should we do then?

208
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,360
Is there any other way?

209
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,880
Is there still another way?

210
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,240
Let's get a doctor as a backup.

211
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,690
Let's go.

212
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,200
Let's go!

213
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,480
Wuji?

214
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,490
Fuyao!

215
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,130
Zhan Beiye?

216
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,790
- Why are you here?
- This place is very vast.

217
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,200
Without me, you'll get lost.

218
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,940
But earlier... we?

219
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,940
This is your dream.

220
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,710
This is my dream?

221
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,070
Then... those are?

222
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,720
Aquatic Dragon Secret Army.

223
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,480
- Come with me.
- What?

224
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,000
Isn't this a dreamland?

225
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,380
Why must we hide?

226
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,170
Although it's just a dream, there still is a real existing danger.

227
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,500
Are you talking about those people I saw?

228
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,290
Those are a strange phenomena that we shouldn't be seeing.

229
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,260
Maybe it's Heaven's will.

230
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,000
But the greatest danger now is ourselves.

231
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,500
How about it?

232
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,680
This is a very strange and complicated illness.

233
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,800
Forgive me, but I really couldn't do anything about it.

234
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,240
We've searched all the doctors around here.

235
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,700
How come there aren't any useful ones?

236
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,310
General just crawled out of death not long ago. How come now—

237
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,520
It was my Fifth Older Brother who saved Fuyao. Where are they?

238
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,520
- Quickly take me to see them!
- Zhuzhu! You're here!

239
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,420
I heard that Older Sis Fuyao and Fifth Older Brother are sick.

240
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,200
What kind of illness is it actually?

241
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,040
Mr. Zong! Mr. Zong, you're finally here!

242
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,940
Now that you're here, they surely will be saved. Quickly go look at them.

243
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,490
Don't rush. Take me inside to see them.

244
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,250
Okay. Let's go.

245
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,960
What did you say?

246
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,640
Wuji... is dead?

247
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,530
Do you know the consequence of saying such words?

248
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,790
I dare not make baseless remarks.

249
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,280
The report said that inside the desert, Crown Prince mistakenly fell into quicksand.

250
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,950
The people you sent to rescue him observed for a long time but didn't see any movements.

251
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,530
I fear that he didn't survive.

252
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,370
Heaven envies the talented!

253
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,090
My pitiful younger brother has died,

254
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,010
but he didn't even leave a corpse.

255
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,090
You all listen well.

256
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,130
Even if you have to dig deep, you must find me his corpse.

257
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,990
I will be giving my younger brother a grand funeral.

258
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,020
Prince Assist is benevolent. I will do it right away.

259
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,630
Royal Uncle.

260
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,360
I was incompetent in my rescue and caused Crown Prince to die.

261
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,350
You already did your best.

262
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,720
If Wuji learns about this in the afterlife,

263
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,140
he surely will be grateful for everything you did.

264
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,050
I am grieving for the world for losing such a wise crown prince.

265
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,700
Grieving for being so negligent and stupid.

266
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,150
I wasn't able to share the burden of the Five Regions.

267
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,900
From now on, I still have to rely on Royal Uncle's guidance and care.

268
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,160
I'm just an idle person.

269
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,510
How can I bear to receive your attention?

270
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,280
Royal Uncle, you're being overly humble.

271
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,760
For a rare talent like you,

272
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,490
just being engrossed with poems, wines, teas, and arts all day,

273
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,380
is really a bit unfair to you.

274
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:05,130
To say some treacherous words, if Royal Uncle can sit on the throne of the supreme ruler of the Five Regions—

275
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,880
Prince Assist—

276
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,260
Prince Assist, don't scare me.

277
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,370
If you want to have me executed, you can just go directly and inform Royal Older Brother.

278
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,060
Why must... Why must you scare me like that?

279
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,050
I never had any grand ambition in my life.

280
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,470
I just love listening to operas, drinking teas,

281
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,130
planting and caring for flowers and plants.

282
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,760
What I want is being carefree and idle for the rest of my life.

283
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,040
And as for the power and glory that you mind,

284
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,560
I'm not interested at all.

285
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,550
Prince Assist,

286
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,120
you can be at ease for sure.

287
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,560
Royal Uncle, you've said it too seriously.

288
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,730
I... never had such thoughts.

289
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,830
It's just that Wuji died at such a young age.

290
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,770
I might have to bear the heavy burden of supporting the Five Regions.

291
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,320
The road ahead is long.

292
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,470
Hope Royal Uncle can do your best to assist me.

293
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,190
Since I'm a member of the Zhangsun clan, I will surely exert my measly strength for the world.

294
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,650
No such thing as working too hard.

295
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,840
With Royal Uncle's words, I am now at ease.

296
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,590
Don't walk me out anymore.

297
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,910
Royal Uncle, take care.

298
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,590
With Prince Virtue's help, you are now like a tiger with wings.

299
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,280
This Crown Prince position will be yours soon.

300
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,630
Do you two think I'm stupid?

301
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,290
With those words that he said, do you think I can't discern which is true and which is false?

302
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:13,060
I fear that after killing Wuji, the next one that should be eliminated is him.

303
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,490
- Then—
- Watch him closely.

304
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,650
Report to me if he makes any strange movements.

305
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,940
Yes!

306
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,650
I'm unable to cure their condition.

307
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,850
Impossible. Aren't you the Medical Sage?

308
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,430
How come you can't cure it, either?

309
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,250
Is there really no way to save them, Mr. Zong?

310
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,570
Fuyao has a strange pulse to begin with and then there is the Passion Lockup Toxin.

311
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,220
For a long time, she's been relying on drugs and her internal qi to continue living and suppressing its activation.

312
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,500
After the Yao City battle, I fear that the desertion then brought great trauma in her heart.

313
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,910
Hence, the qi that was protecting her heart and the vital channels greatly weakened.

314
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,640
Plus, the fact that she's worried about Wuji, several wounds flaring up altogether,

315
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,630
leading to her present irreversible state.

316
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,390
What about General?

317
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,430
General Zhan used the Earth Absorbing Bell.

318
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,970
His life and Fuyao's life then are intertwined.

319
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,930
If Fuyao is unable to wake up, then General Zhan will also—

320
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,130
Impossible. You surely will have a way!

321
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,090
You surely will have a way!

322
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,310
It's not completely hopeless, either.

323
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,100
There is indeed one person in this world who can save them.

324
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,340
It's just that—

325
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,580
Tell me who that person is.

326
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,160
Even if I have to exchange my life for it, I will save them.

327
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,020
If it's that simple, why would I be this troubled?

328
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,460
It's just that this person, unless she's willing, no one can make her come here.

329
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,400
Everywhere, it's the same sand and scenery.

330
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,360
I feel that we can't walk out anymore.

331
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,890
No matter how tired, you can't sleep.

332
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,100
Once you close your eyes, you will never wake up anymore.

333
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,030
- I'm so sleepy.
- Fuyao...

334
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,030
Fuyao...

335
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,750
Fuyao! This dream state can bewitch a person's mind.

336
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,600
You will lose all your consciousness.

337
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,120
All the truth or false, time, and life or death can happen in an instant here.

338
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,760
Slowly, you will lose your drive and forget who you are.

339
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,800
Forget your obsession, your hatred, even to the point of forgetting that you are a human.

340
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,660
You will get trapped in here and unable to leave forever.

341
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,340
Fuyao! Wake up!

342
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,090
I'm so sleepy...

343
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,010
- You're not sleepy anymore, right?
- What's going on?

344
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,400
Get up!

345
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,170
Inside the dreamland, the two of us are sharing one body.

346
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,740
Although I hit myself, you also will feel the pain.

347
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,450
I'm unable to hurt you.

348
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,490
But if I let you sleep, we will forever get trapped in here.

349
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,110
Thank you for what you've done for me.

350
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,370
I was the one who brought you here.

351
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,830
I also must safely take you out.

352
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,160
In my previous dream, I seemed to have seen Wuji.

353
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,800
Is Wuji also in this desert?

354
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,590
What you saw must be his real state in Geya Desert.

355
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,270
Wuji is really here.

356
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,700
Then isn't he in danger?

357
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,760
You don't need to worry about this.

358
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,870
After separating from Capital Kun, I traveled into Geya by myself.

359
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,070
Not only did I not die, I was able to recruit 3,000 Dark Storm Cavalry.

360
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,960
If I'm able to survive here,

361
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,660
then Zhangsun Wuji has no reason to be inferior to me.

362
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,000
Right. Going back to it,

363
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,970
Zhan Nancheng has been doing all means to harm you all this time.

364
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,500
Where did you hide?

365
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,930
Also, what's the Dark Storm Cavalry?

366
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,410
When Wuji left Yao City, he already prepared himself for the worst.

367
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,250
It's just that he also might have not expected that Yao City would experience such a huge change.

368
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,040
If not because Miss Fuyao insisted on looking for Crown Prince Wuji,

369
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,650
her condition wouldn't have worsened that fast.

370
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,730
Neither would General...

371
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,600
Forget it.

372
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:42,000
Mr. Zong, I heard from Xiaoqi that you and Wuji left Yao City together.

373
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,120
In the path back to the capital, Zhangsun Pingrong has set up a dragnet.

374
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,640
Just to avoid them, Wuji took a detour into Geya Desert.

375
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,900
But unexpectedly, the Thousand Cavalry of Upper Yang Palace that were supposed to provide support to him didn't appear.

376
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,870
We were left with no choice that time.

377
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,770
Wuji could only charge forward into the desert to lure the chasing soldiers,

378
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:07,470
while I traveled through the official road towards the Imperial city to get him reinforcements.

379
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,870
Mister,

380
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,110
a coup occurred in Megrez Imperial City.

381
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,460
The Thousand Cavalry of Upper Yang Palace got transferred to North Plain.

382
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,660
I fear that Mister might be in danger.

383
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,870
Who mobilized the army?

384
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,850
I still don't know. We're still investigating.

385
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,380
I hadn't reached South Border yet when the news of Wuji's death had spread.

386
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,300
Of course, I don't believe it.

387
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,270
I originally planned to go to Geya Desert alone.

388
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,830
I then bumped into Miss Yalan on my way there.

389
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,400
I learned about the situation of Yao City so I rushed towards here.

390
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,750
But in the end, I was still late.

391
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,030
If Crown Prince Wuji really got trapped inside Geya Desert,

392
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,440
then the chances of him surviving are slim.

393
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,100
That place is called "No Wild Goose Return."

394
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:06,360
Once you go in and don't come out for three days, you will surely die.

395
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,470
Maybe not.

396
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,520
Isn't this Dark Storm Cavalry brought by Prince Fierce from the inner region of Geya Desert?

397
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,380
What? You have been there, too?

398
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,000
These people were brought by my Fifth Older Brother from Geya?

399
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,240
This matter is a long story.

400
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
While in Capital Kun, I was worried that Zhan Nancheng would eventually make his move.

401
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,470
Hence, I sent Ji Yu back to Rock City to make contact with our old men.

402
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,610
Never thought that Zhan Nancheng sensed it beforehand.

403
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,910
Not only did he eliminate my old men, he even ordered the killing of Ji Yu.

404
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,700
Ji Yu ran to Geya with my Consort Mother's secret letter.

405
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,310
In the end... In the end, he got rescued by our people.

406
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,500
You still have your people in Geya Desert?

407
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,770
Geya was originally my maternal grandfather's fiefdom.

408
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,730
When my Consort Mother married into the palace, this fiefdom became a territory of Heaven Fiend.

409
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,440
But the army that my maternal grandfather created still stayed here to guard.

410
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,800
After so many years, for them to still willingly submit to you,

411
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,780
they are indeed very loyal subordinates.

412
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,270
At the start, they helped treat our wounds and saved our lives.

413
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,370
I naturally treated them as friends.

414
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,100
Hence, I followed General's initial instruction and set off a safe signal to him

415
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,800
so he could immediately know that we are there and come find us.

416
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,640
What happened afterwards?

417
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,200
They couldn't have plotted to harm my Fifth Older Brother, right?

418
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,510
Very soon, we realized that they were not just saving us.

419
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,640
They seemed to be discussing and planning something.

420
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,770
No matter what, this Ice Land Tribe isn't a safe place anymore.

421
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,020
- Hawk Feather Letter?
- Hurry! Hurry!

422
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,610
That's why, when you hurriedly left Capital Kun,

423
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,940
- you were meeting up with Ji Yu and the others?
- Yes.

424
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,740
Using the Hawk Feather Letter to pass the information, then it must be a very urgent matter.

425
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,040
I can't disregard it.

426
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,760
And then... And then, you found them?

427
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,380
Yes. The people who saved me and Ji Yu are the Dark Storm Cavalry.

428
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,370
Who are the Dark Storm Cavalry? Why did they help you?

429
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,000
Only after saving me, did I notice something was off.

430
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,460
But when we wanted to run away then, it was too late.

431
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,030
They wanted to kill you?

432
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,950
Yes. They wanted to use our lives

433
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,160
to complete a sacrificial offering.

434
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,360
Later on, we discovered that the god they were worshiping

435
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,940
is the legendary Aquatic Dragon Secret Army.

436
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,690
They use living human blood as offering.

437
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,100
Secret Army?

438
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,740
What Secret Army?

439
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,590
Legend says that inside Geya Desert, there is an army guarding the Aquatic Dragon Ancient City.

440
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,670
They are invincible, but were being suppressed by a curse for generations.

441
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,120
They can never leave the ancient city and are in severe pain because of it.

442
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,060
You guys saw the Secret Army?

443
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,380
No. General broke their offering ritual and saved us.

444
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,940
This also angered these barbaric Ice Land Tribe members.

445
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:19,330
Just to find us, they didn't mind sending out the whole tribe and setting up an inescapable net.

446
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,400
Quickly go!

447
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,580
The Blue Dragon above! The person who is able to obtain the Blue Dragon Wildness Sword

448
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,160
can command the Dark Storm Cavalry of the Five Regions!

449
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,130
We swear to follow you until our death!

450
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,420
Blue Dragon in the wilderness rides the wind as its banner.

451
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,010
Blue Dragon Wildness Sword...

452
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,970
That time, it was so chaotic.

453
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,410
I was focused on fighting those poisonous bees.

454
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,850
Hence, I just randomly looked for a weapon.

455
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:05,050
Never thought... I actually pulled out this sword.

456
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,250
If what you said is true,

457
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,740
poisonous bees are the signal that the Secret Army is making strange movement,

458
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,190
the moment you pulled out the sword stopped exactly those poisonous bees.

459
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,440
Indeed.

460
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,150
Its purpose is to suppress the Secret Army.

461
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,380
Is it suitable for you to take away such a precious item?

462
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,590
This is an item left by my maternal grandfather.

463
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,080
He buried it deep in the Ice Land for so many years

464
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,640
and it now returned to my hands.

465
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,690
I then must inherit the will of my maternal grandfather.

466
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,700
Will?

467
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,670
Take over his old army and guard Geya Desert.

468
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,940
Suppress the Secret Army.

469
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,950
Distribute it to everyone.

470
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,050
Thanks.

471
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,030
Hey, so they are the Dark Storm Cavalry from Ice Land?

472
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,780
Dark Storm Cavalry is a military unit name that has been passed down for generations.

473
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,000
Since Heaven Fiend was created, it has existed.

474
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,530
It was initially led by Grandmaster Zhou, General's maternal grandfather.

475
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:40,150
And now, this is the only troop left of the triumphant Dark Storm Cavalry.

476
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:43,350
Why did they disappear then?

477
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,170
This is an old matter in the royal court.

478
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,450
My knowledge is also limited.

479
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:51,230
They followed Grandmaster Zhou's last will to keep watch of the Secret Army,

480
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,090
so they know that the person who's able to pull out the Blue Dragon Wilderness Sword

481
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,340
is not an ordinary person.

482
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:03,040
You mean my Fifth Older Brother has instantly stunned them?

483
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,780
That's right.

484
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,040
When these people knew about Prince Fierce's identity, they didn't hesitate and immediately swore alliance to him.

485
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,150
Hence, we now have these 3,000 Dark Storm Cavalry.

486
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:49,100
Do you know how sad I was when you left and didn't bring me with you?

"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

488
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,260
♫ What do you know? ♫

489
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,270
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

490
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:22,030
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

491
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,300
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

492
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,950
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

493
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,760
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

494
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,000
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

495
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,270
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

496
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:46,370
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

497
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,120
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

498
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,430
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

499
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,000
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

500
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,020
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

501
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,050
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

502
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:09,970
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

503
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,100
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

504
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,870
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

505
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,450
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

506
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:26,550
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

507
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,650
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

508
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:35,000
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

509
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,950
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

510
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,630
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

511
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,430
♫ Have someone's company♫

512
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,400
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

513
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,590
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

514
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,410
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

515
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:58,280
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

516
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,470
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

517
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:06,730
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

518
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:11,140
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

519
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:17,000
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫
