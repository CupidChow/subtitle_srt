2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,400
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,000
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,300
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,700
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,600
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,200
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,400
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,400
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,300
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,200
~ Episode 36 ~

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,600
My conscience is clear.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,500
And I'm not willing to just casually give up.

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,900
Wuji,

25
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,610
I will never give up on this engagement.

26
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,150
Oh?

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,300
Are you leaving again?

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,800
I just want you to meet someone.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,700
Say it.

30
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,600
Folian already knew beforehand that Fuyao and you had a special relationship.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,400
Hence, she was determined to destroy her reputation,

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,800
so she will forever hate you.

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,600
She set up this trap since the day she met her outside the city.

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,700
Stop talking.

35
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,000
- Stop talking.
- She came to my manor and used the marital alliance to fool me into harming Fuyao.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,200
She said there can only be one woman by your side

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,500
and that woman is Folian.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,600
Stop talking!

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
When had I harmed you?

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Your Highness Prince Assist,

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,100
why must you harm me like this?

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,800
If you won't admit these matters, I don't mind.

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,100
To let the citizens of Five Regions believe me,

44
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,300
there are so many ways.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,600
It's not like that.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,200
Too bad, the act that you've put so much effort to perform for more than ten years,

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
all ended up in vain.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,400
Wuji,

49
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,600
listen to my explanation one more time. All right?

50
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,680
Think about it yourself.

51
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,600
Wuji!

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,500
Don't leave!

53
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,790
I've said all that I should say.

54
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,000
I've also done everything that I can do.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
With my state now, I can't be any threat to you.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Regarding that matter with South Border, can you just let it go?

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,300
What you're doing now will cause me my life!

58
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,700
Your life is not worth a penny.

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,800
All right. Then go and report to Emperor Father.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,600
Tell him that the South Border's matter has nothing to do with me.

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,200
Just say that this is all a misunderstanding! All right?

62
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,000
The antidote. What I want is the antidote for the Passion Lockup Toxin.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,850
There is no antidote for the Passion Toxin—

64
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,200
When I learned the Divine Physician Starlight from teacher before, I also asked him for the method to cure it.

65
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,600
But Teacher said that after teaching his disciple, he must leave a backup for himself.

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,200
He was unwilling to teach it to me.

67
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,400
This Passion Toxin can only be cured by Teacher.

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Everything I said is true. I'm not lying.

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
It's just that Teacher wanders around the world.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,200
I don't know where he is now, either.

71
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,360
We are biological brothers.

72
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,200
Why can't we just coexist?

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,800
Just let me off!

74
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,180
That's right.

75
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,100
We are biological brothers.

76
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,000
It's unethical to kill you.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
Killing one's royal older brother is a grave crime.

78
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,300
Hence, I surely will investigate it very clearly.

79
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,600
Let Your Highness Prince Assist willingly accept your punishment.

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
All right.

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,070
You insist on pushing me to death.

82
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,300
Don't think of having it easy, either!

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,400
[Black Tribe Gang]

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,400
What? Special Envoy from the Imperial City?

85
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Which bold man dared to step into my territory?

86
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,280
Are they seeking their death?

87
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,600
First Boss,

88
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
let me lead our men and charge into the city. I'll kill him for you.

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,860
That's right... Massacre Yao City first.

90
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,200
Let's see if he can still be some magistrate.

91
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,500
- That's right.
- No.

92
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,590
If that man was indeed sent by the Imperial City,

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,700
we can't just casually kill him.

94
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,200
Don't be idle these few days.

95
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,500
- Go loot the villages around Yao City.
- Indeed!

96
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,200
We're just waiting for those orders from you, First Boss.

97
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,900
It's been so long since we ate meat.

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,100
Remember, you can only snatch items.

99
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,530
You're not allowed to snatch women.

100
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,800
The more, you mustn't kill anyone.

101
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
T-This... Why?

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,400
I just want to make some movements.

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,100
See what kind of person this new official from the Imperial City is.

104
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,500
There's so many things. Are they all for Fuyao?

105
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Yes.

106
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,240
Miss Fuyao is really so fortunate.

107
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,400
A mister personally came to our VIP Shop

108
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,900
and chose the most exquisite items in Five Regions.

109
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,000
He even especially instructed us to personally deliver these to South Border.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Then... is the mister you're talking about, Wu–

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Crown Prince Wuji?

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't say it, but you can make a wild guess.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,900
Then all right. Just put them here.

114
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,400
- Thanks, thanks, thanks.
- All right.

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,940
- Older Sis Fuyao.
- Just focusing on joining in on the fun

116
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,200
and you've forgotten what you should do again.

117
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,830
I'll do it myself.

118
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,000
This doctor's medicines are really hard to drink.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,400
Older Sis Fuyao, you say, who sent these presents?

120
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,800
Anyway, it's not from you nor from that hateful doctor.

121
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,100
It is indeed from Crown Prince Wuji.

122
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,000
Things that others couldn't obtain, he just casually—

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
What are you saying?

124
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,900
Crown Prince Wuji.

125
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,670
Or Xuanyuan Min.

126
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,330
Who are you talking about?

127
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,540
I don't understand.

128
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,600
Then... what about these presents?

129
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
Do we throw them away?

130
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't.

131
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,200
There's a use for them.

132
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,900
- Slowly. Hold it well. This one's good.
- Thank you!

133
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,700
- Everyone will get one. Don't push.
- Give me some.

134
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,100
- Everyone will get one. Don't push.
- Thanks!

135
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,970
Don't push. Everyone will get one.

136
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,000
- Come one by one. Slower.
- Don't push.

137
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,600
This is for you. Don't push. Everyone gets to have one.

138
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,000
Come, slowly.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,300
Tie Cheng, why are you just standing there?

140
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,810
This... is a very good one.

141
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,380
It's made of gold. This...

142
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,200
There's a purple phoenix on it.

143
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,800
My mother said that it might look very pretty if you put it on.

144
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,000
Everyone will have one! Don't rush!

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Here... For you.

146
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,000
Slowly! Everyone will get one!

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Here. Hold it well.

148
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,300
Now, Fuyao has taken over the magistrate position of Yao City and holds the city's military power.

149
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,600
She ordered the repair of the whole city,

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,000
group training, and plans to organize a citizen soldier troop.

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Use them to fight against the troublesome Black Tribe Gang bandits.

152
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,600
She's very energetic and deeply indulged in pleasure.

153
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,300
It's just that... if you still don't rush here,

154
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,600
she might really forget about Wuji.

155
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,600
I heard that the Saintess of Plough, Folian,

156
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,700
went to Fufeng to practice Buddhism and do good deeds.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Your traveling around these past years and

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,200
swiftly moving from place to place is also an advantage.

159
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,970
Now, even if they are unable to find your whereabouts,

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,740
no one will find it strange.

161
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,200
Am I right?

162
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,680
If the Saintess really does encounter a misfortune,

163
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,200
it can only be considered as a mysterious case.

164
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,720
Could you really be that ruthless?

165
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,240
Showing any mercy to a ruthless person is also doing a bad deed.

166
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:19,000
Weren't all these because I love you?

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,800
I missed you.

168
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,200
I am not worthy of it.

169
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,900
I'm unable to bear it.

170
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm just going to ask you one question.

171
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,100
Are you canceling this engagement or not?

172
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,270
Plough's Queen Heir, Folian, prioritized the world and the citizens.

173
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,630
With the consideration that in Five Regions, there are still wars, starving citizens,

174
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,780
and people who worry and in wretched poverty,

175
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,860
she can't endure to disregard these disasters and attempt to enjoy happiness.

176
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,900
Folian especially chose to sacrifice the marital alliance between Megrez and Plough

177
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,550
and is just focusing on meditating and praying for the citizens.

178
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,530
If this continues, our brothers of Black Tribe Gang will be starving to death.

179
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,220
What kind of thing is that Fu gal?

180
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,190
How come she's this capable?

181
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,530
We'll know once we meet her.

182
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,840
You can't go! What kind of place is Black Tribe Gang?

183
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,220
You won't be able to come back!

184
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,970
Chigui never had any good intentions.

185
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,180
What is possible if he asks you to go there for a talk?

186
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,890
This is clearly a trap to harm you!

187
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,470
What you said is reasonable.

188
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,010
Those Black Tribe Gang criminals are cold and ruthless.

189
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,450
They might sound courteous in that invitation,

190
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,210
but this clearly is a Hongmen Banquet for you.

191
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,300
Mister Zong...

192
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,050
Let her decide.

193
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,470
I'm just a doctor.

194
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,390
Don't...

195
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,800
I got it.

196
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,130
This invitation was made from rabbit skin.

197
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,750
This is a rare item!

198
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,040
You mustn't go to Black Tribe Gang!

199
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,630
Why can't I go?

200
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,450
I made so many grand movements here before I was able to receive this invitation.

201
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,580
Just because you say so, I won't go?

202
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,820
But you still have not fully recovered from your injuries.

203
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,740
If you fight with others now, won't they be at an advantage?

204
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,710
Can others take advantage of me that easily?

205
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,280
If I go there, we still don't know who will be getting whose advantage.

206
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,360
No... You can't go. Mister Zong will also not let you go.

207
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,230
Right, Mister Zong? Mister Zong!

208
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,590
Can't you see that Mister Zong isn't minding you?

209
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,350
Just stay here and guard our house.

210
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,130
- This Black Tribe Gang...
- Mister Zong, try to dissuade her.

211
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,290
I'm surely going.

212
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,800
I really want to take a look at it.

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,540
At this late hour, where is Official Fu going?

214
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,380
This night scenery is good. I want to go out of the city to admire the moon.

215
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,980
Today is the new moon.

216
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,410
There is no moon scenery.

217
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,940
With the way you're dressed, you must be attending a banquet. Right?

218
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,780
You just won't disappear.

219
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,070
The thing I hate the most is meddling into other people's business, especially yours.

220
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,400
If not because someone entrusted you to me and I made an oath, I wouldn't—

221
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,590
Hey, enough! Stop talking.

222
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,040
Just come with us if you want to.

223
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,920
[Black Tribe Gang]

224
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,240
[Black Tribe Gang]

225
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,570
Your martial arts skills are not bad.

226
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,650
Official Fu, be careful!

227
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,420
Official Fu?

228
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,930
I never thought that Official Fu would personally come here.

229
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,480
I thought it's some martial arts master that trespassed our lair.

230
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,060
Official Fu indeed has great fighting skills.

231
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,200
If I offended you earlier, I hope you can forgive me.

232
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,030
It's okay. Please forgive me for my actions, too.

233
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,810
Just flowery fists and fancy footworks, we've embarrassed ourselves in front of you.

234
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,590
Since Official Fu came to our place for the first time, we should express some hospitality.

235
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,330
Bring it in!

236
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,330
Just a small token. Not enough to show my respect for you.

237
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I am a very useless person.

238
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,950
Whenever I see gold, I just can't proceed.

239
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
This color...

240
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,680
First Boss is really very generous.

241
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,860
You two take these.

242
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,800
We should share the wealth.

243
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,790
Official Fu said it right.

244
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,980
As long as we are united, there are still a lot of chances to get rich in the future.

245
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,280
Gold is really a good thing.

246
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,330
But... even if I'm greedy, it's within the bounds of morality.

247
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,260
Evil money like this obtained from killing, arson, and stealing,

248
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
feels hot when held in my hands.

249
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,200
Since I've become the magistrate of Yao City,

250
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,610
I will then not allow anyone to bully my citizens.

251
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,780
If everyone doesn't want to give me this honor,

252
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,210
I must then do things based on the rules of Megrez.

253
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,030
Our Black Tribe Gang survived how many Yao City magistrates in these past ten-some years?

254
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,300
Of course, there were also a few stubborn officials like you,

255
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,040
who aimed to bleed our gang just to get on the good side of the government.

256
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,540
What were the results?

257
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,480
Not only were they unable to hurt us one bit,

258
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,760
they all eventually died!

259
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,510
Official Fu, you are a smart person.

260
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,160
You probably wouldn't want to end up like them, right?

261
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,010
Who isn't afraid of death?

262
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,190
Mainly because I'm being paid by the government,

263
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,220
so I must work for them. Right?

264
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,460
But since we all are serving the same master,

265
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,110
we have to treat this matter differently then. Right?

266
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,290
We'll treat this matter differently.

267
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,860
Okay.

268
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,130
One family doesn't say things differently. Serve the wine!

269
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,170
Serve the wine!

270
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,510
This way.

271
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,980
This is the lavatory.

272
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,800
Thanks.

273
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,740
I heard that your Black Tribe Gang has this rule

274
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,740
that if there are any conflicts among yourselves, you will use drinking to settle it.

275
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,830
Whoever drops first must listen to the other party.

276
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,590
Am I right?

277
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,580
Official Fu, do you want to compete in drinking alcohol?

278
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,610
With just your thin and weak appearance, do you still want to compete with our First Boss in drinking alcohol?

279
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,130
Aren't you putting too much confidence on your skills?

280
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,690
Let me be honest with you then, our First Boss can drink 3 jin of alcohol in one gulp,

281
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,540
no breathing in between.

282
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,630
Here in Black Tribe Gang, no one can beat him.

283
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,700
Official Fu, let me drink for you.

284
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,860
Let's have a duel then!

285
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,000
- Okay!
- Okay! Good!

286
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,700
Official Fu, you've drank more than seventeen jars.

287
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,900
One more time!

288
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,200
How come that fair-skinned scholar who came with you

289
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,800
hasn't returned from the lavatory yet?

290
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Don't mind other people!

291
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,140
Good wine.

292
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,400
If I follow you, I'll get to have wines, meat, and even gold.

293
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,500
Drink!

294
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,960
- Drink!
- Drink!

295
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,800
Drink!

296
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,100
First Boss.

297
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,500
What?

298
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,620
Do you think I'm really drunk?

299
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,120
Bring him here!

300
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
This is not fun anymore.

301
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,000
Arrest them all!

302
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,360
Say it.

303
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,700
What really is your purpose in coming to Black Tribe Gang?

304
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,600
Arrest them!

305
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,500
Wait!

306
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,040
First Boss surely recognizes this token, right?

307
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,200
Where did you steal that token?

308
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,000
Steal? How many thieves in this world can sneak into the royal palace of Megrez and steal the token of Prince Assist?

309
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
First Boss, go steal one for me then.

310
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,400
We were given verbal orders by Prince Assist

311
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,800
to come here to Black Tribe Gang and check

312
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
if you have been loyal to him,

313
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,900
if you've been following his commands.

314
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,600
Are you really subordinates of Prince Assist?

315
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,100
The dagger on your waist was given by Prince Assist, right?

316
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,200
Although that dagger looks simple, it can cut gold and silver.

317
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,400
If you're not a royalty of Megrez, it's impossible for you to get one.

318
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,200
We've been loyal to Prince Assist, but he actually dared to suspect me now.

319
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,400
First Boss, don't be mad.

320
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
His Highness Prince Assist was also just being cautious.

321
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,700
Isn't it also for the sake of our grand plan?

322
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,800
Isn't it?

323
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,000
Official Fu, you're right.

324
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,400
Come, for our grand plan.

325
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Grand plan!

326
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:57,400
Grand plan!

327
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,200
[Yao City Magistrate Office]

328
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,200
Good thing you recognized that dagger on the waist of Chigui.

329
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,100
Or else a blood battle would have ensued.

330
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,500
But how did you guess that he and Zhangsun Pingrong were colluding?

331
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,000
Also, where did you get that token?

332
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,260
Do you really want to know?

333
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,480
What's there to beat around the bush for?

334
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,000
Of course, I can tell you.

335
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,700
It's just that...

336
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,880
I'll have to mention that name that you don't want to hear.

337
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,400
Don't say it anymore.

338
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,900
What really are you mad about?

339
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,300
Just for you, that person staked his Crown Prince position.

340
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Do you know what that means for him?

341
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,200
You keep saying that it was for me,

342
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,400
but it's different from what I saw and heard.

343
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,270
You people would say one thing and do another thing.

344
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,200
This world is complicated.

345
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,100
There is no such thing as pure truth.

346
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,400
If you want to see it clearly,

347
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,300
don't just rely on your eyes and ears. You must rely on your heart.

348
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,600
For a person who must even hide his real identity,

349
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,700
how can there be any sincerity?

350
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,700
How come when one is drunk...

351
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,540
even one's imagination is so life-like?

352
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,700
I don't want to see you at all.

353
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
I don't want to see you at all.

354
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,100
Enough.

355
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,600
You asshole...

356
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,200
How come you never said any truth to me?

357
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,300
Why must you lie to me?

358
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,900
Because... you're not him.

359
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,200
He won't come to see me.

360
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,030
But...

361
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,600
But you and him...

362
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,010
how come you two look so much alike?

363
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Who is the "him" that you're talking about?

364
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,400
Enough. Enough.

365
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,320
Enough.

366
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,780
Why did you drink so much?

367
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,780
Was it because you missed me?

368
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,000
I know you missed me.

369
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,280
Good girl.

370
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,560
Good girl.

371
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:23,730
When you sober up later and still feel hurt,

372
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,390
I'll feel for you.

373
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,720
You won't-You won't feel for me.

374
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:50,820
You won't feel for me. You won't feel for me.

375
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,410
In your heart... In your heart, you only have that Saintess.

376
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,680
You don't have me in your heart at all.

377
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,520
Who says so?

378
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,380
You're so overbearing.

379
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,900
You've taken up my whole heart.

380
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,230
How would it have room for anyone else?

381
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,460
I-I don't believe it.

382
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,860
I don't believe.

383
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,360
I'll prove it to you.

384
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,720
I'll prove it to you.

385
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,510
Girl, I'll definitely find a way to have the best of both worlds,

386
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,890
spend this lifetime with you.

387
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,360
Older Sis Fuyao. Fu... What?

388
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,260
Official Fu.

389
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,090
I've told you. Don't call me Official Fu.

390
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,970
You can just call me Fuyao.

391
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,130
- Fuyao.
- Your-Your face is—

392
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,690
No, it's nothing. My mom... made some mung bean porridge.

393
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,560
Didn't you drink too much last night?

394
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,930
This is good for your stomach and will also help you sober up.

395
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,220
Thank your mom for me.

396
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,860
No. No. No. No need to be so polite.

397
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,050
My mom had said that Official Fu is part of the family.

398
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,880
No need to be so courteous. No need to be courteous.

399
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
I'm actually a bit hungry now.

400
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,070
Really? I'll go get some for you right now. Wait for me!

401
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,600
- Add some sugar.
 - All right!

402
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,510
What do you think?

403
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,610
I already told you, if you still didn't come back, she'd really forget you.

404
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,760
Let's not speak of this right now.

405
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,350
Tell me about what you saw last night.

406
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,040
Your information was correct.

407
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,590
Zhangsun Pinrong did bribe the Black Tribe Gang.

408
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,230
Yao City is easy to defend and hard to be attacked.

409
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,540
It's a place where Megrez defense troops must fight.

410
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:26,080
Zhangsun Pinrong's planting his pawn here, makes his ambition very clear.

411
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,720
Say it again!

412
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,920
Incurable? What do you mean incurable?

413
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,840
Your Highness, your-your reproductive system is already damaged at the root.

414
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,660
I...

415
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,840
I have no way to change it.

416
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,360
Absurd, you!

417
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,200
You imbecile. Your medical skills are lacking and yet you still muddle along in the palace.

418
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,920
I really should kill you.

419
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,480
Prince Assist, spare me. Spare me. Spare me, Prince Assist.

420
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,750
I can spare you.

421
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,940
But you must do something for me.

422
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,810
You just need to spread the word

423
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:06,990
that my body is fully recovered, as healthy as the day I was born,

424
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,630
and it definitely will not affect my future ability to have royal children.

425
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,540
- But this—
- But what?

426
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,490
My family has received royal favor for many generations.

427
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,820
This is something that will affect the Zhangsun royal family for a hundred years.

428
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,890
I dare not.

429
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,070
I dare not tell such an unauthorized lie.

430
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,720
Prince Assist!

431
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,490
Prince Assist, spare me! Prince Assist...

432
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,500
Prince Assist. Prince Assist, spare me! Prince Assist!

433
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,580
- I am the Master of Sand God Lantern.
- Nonsense.

434
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,080
- I am the Master of Sand God Lantern.
- No, I am!

435
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,530
Why are you spouting nonsense? I'm the real Master of Sand God Lantern.

436
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,760
You're nothing. I am the real Master of Sand God Lantern!

437
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,890
- You're nothing
 - Miiiiggghhty.

438
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,880
You two arguing like this is all for the Worship Festival.

439
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,870
You're both calling yourself the Master of Sand God Lantern.

440
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:48,280
Then why don't we let the Sand God himself decide?

441
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,100
How can the Sand God decide himself?

442
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,430
I don't know. Let's hear her out.

443
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,390
Official, how can he decide?

444
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,420
You see. It will be the Worship Festival in another couple of days.

445
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,240
You guys each make half the lanterns in the village.

446
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,720
I'll then do a count.

447
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,310
Whoever sells more lanterns, gets to take this tablet home.

448
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,030
How about that?

449
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,730
We'll do as Official Fu says.

450
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,190
We'll do as Official says.

451
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,100
Official.

452
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,720
I, Yuan Zhaoxu, want to accuse Miss Fu of Mt. Mystic Soul in Deep Water.

453
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,300
She loved me at first but deserted me at the end.

454
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,790
She betrayed our true feelings.

455
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,170
She is inconsistent in love.

456
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,210
She abandoned me.

457
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,200
Xiaoqi!

458
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,550
I'll treat this as our love token.

459
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,230
This complaint letter of yours is not at par with the rules.

460
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,780
Official,

461
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,550
you can take this written complaint and show everyone here.

462
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,310
I think it's carefully and neatly done.

463
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,620
And I also put the love token

464
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,500
together with the written complaint as proof.

465
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,530
The person you want to sue is in Deep Water.

466
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,730
This is Megrez.

467
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,030
You should lodge your complaint in Deep Water.

468
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,040
Official!

469
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,100
Although the woman is from Deep Water,

470
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,990
she likes to travel.

471
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:22,380
And most recently, she's hiding within Megrez, right here in Yao City.

472
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,530
And this girl is a swindler of both love and money.

473
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:33,280
It's hard to say whether there will be other victims like me in the future.

483
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:38,660
♫ Dust vanishes gradually into the skies ♫

484
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,780
♫ My heart changes back and forth that no one understands ♫

485
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:50,470
♫ I'm waiting for you to shine through my window ♫

486
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:06,180
♫ Only because of you, I let the fated life wave goodbye ♫

487
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,320
♫ Also only because of you, it lets me get saved ♫

488
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:16,390
♫ Roam around the world ♫

489
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:21,530
♫ Love and hate tease me ♫

490
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:31,290
♫ The hunger of a speeding pulse ♫

491
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:36,590
♫ My shadow drifts along this world ♫

492
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,750
♫ Dust vanishes gradually into the skies ♫

493
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,870
♫ My heart changes back and forth that no one understands ♫

494
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:53,970
♫ I'm waiting for you to shine through my window ♫
