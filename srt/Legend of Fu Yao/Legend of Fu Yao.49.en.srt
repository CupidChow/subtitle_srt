00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:12,290
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,510
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:23,580
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,840
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,920
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:39,690
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,480
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,050
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,690
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,740
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,890
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,070
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,590
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,360
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,440
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,760
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,520
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,530
~ Episode 49 ~

22
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,940
Before, Prince Eternal expressed to Your Majesty

23
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,840
that the nation's treasury was in deficit.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,160
Your Majesty even ordered for him to investigate some corrupt officials.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,750
That was already some time ago.

26
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,230
Your Majesty, have you seen any money?

27
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,300
Royal Older Brother, I'm innocent!

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,910
Whether you're innocent or not, we can just go to your manor and see.

29
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,390
Look over there!

30
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,900
Hurry!

31
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,110
- There! Hurry!
- Here!

32
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,830
Look over here!

33
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,920
- There!
- A few of you, go there!

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,510
- Hurry! Here!
- There's nothing here!

35
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,810
- Hurry!
- Come here!

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,110
We've found it! It's in here!

37
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,030
Hurry! Hurry!

38
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,290
Younger Brother Heng, you have wealth that can compete with the nation's.

39
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,000
How...

40
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,980
How could this be?

41
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,270
How could this be possible?

42
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:31,130
You don't plan to say that someone secretly placed this in your manor, right?

43
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,560
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, have mercy!

44
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,300
I really don't know where this gold and silver came from!

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,930
Your Majesty, please investigate it wisely.

46
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,450
It must be her! She and Crown Prince colluded to frame me! Royal Older Brother.

47
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,680
Are you saying that my eyes are blind, my brain is defective,

48
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,330
and couldn't even discern if you were being framed?

49
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,660
No.

50
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,520
This is all the gold being kept inside the nation's treasury.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,320
Only a few can touch it.

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,320
You helped me manage it; hence, have access to it.

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,280
Your Majesty, have mercy!

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,680
I'm innocent!

55
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,630
These past years, I did corrupt a few kickbacks,

56
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,990
but it's not this much!

57
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,250
There must be someone who is framing me! Someone is framing me.

58
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,980
- Report!
- Royal Older Brother!

59
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,860
Informing Your Majesty, there is one more level in the basement that's hiding bows, armors, and fire weapons.

60
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,130
- What else do you want to say?
- Royal Older Brother.

61
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,370
Younger Brother Heng, we have the same mother.

62
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,080
I've always thought that even if others would rebel against me, you wouldn't.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,980
Looks like I was wrong.

64
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,250
Do you think that since I'm able to sit on this throne, you too can?

65
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,630
No.

66
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,270
Do you think that by inciting me to kill all our brothers from a different mother,

67
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,000
you then can have a reason to call for an uprising?

68
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,010
Have I not given you enough all these years?

69
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,090
I've given you what should be given,

70
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,430
yet you are still greedy and discontented.

71
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,810
You being like this is more hateful than others.

72
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,250
Take him away!

73
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,740
Lock him up in the Celestial Prison!

74
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,930
Yes!

75
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,000
No! No!

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,180
Royal Older Brother, don't!

77
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,640
Royal Older Brother, don't! Royal Older Brother!

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,770
Royal Older Brother!

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,420
Royal Older Brother!

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,010
Your Majesty.

81
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,190
Please punish me.

82
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,530
What crime did you commit?

83
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,570
Why must I punish you?

84
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,400
Your Majesty must think that...

85
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,910
since I only said a lot of things today,

86
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,260
it must be because I'm conniving with Crown Prince.

87
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,370
You must be feeling that I have an ulterior motive.

88
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,250
Isn't that so?

89
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,310
I have no ulterior motive at all!

90
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,550
What I have in my heart is just prolonged torment.

91
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,460
The reason that I know about all of this is because Crown Prince trusted me.

92
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,090
As a member of the secret guard,

93
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,720
even if I lose my life, I can't betray my master.

94
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,460
But now, I'm already Your Majesty's Generalissimo Black Tortoise.

95
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,420
You've treated me so well and I owe you a lot.

96
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,430
How could I disappoint your trust?

97
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,610
How could I just watch Prince Eternal harm you?

98
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,500
Although these past days, I might look high spirited,

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,720
my heart was being tormented day and night.

100
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,570
On the one hand, I kept thinking that I shouldn't break my promise.

101
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,360
On the other hand, I'm thinking of Your Majesty's safety.

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,560
Today, it was all because Prince Eternal was pressuring me too much.

103
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,900
I had no choice but to say all these truths.

104
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,930
But I also know...

105
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,460
that once I say all these truths,

106
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,580
Crown Prince and I...

107
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,390
will become irreconcilable enemies.

108
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,020
Your Majesty will not trust me anymore, either.

109
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,370
Fine then.

110
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,640
By saying all of this today, I was able to ensure Your Majesty's safety.

111
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,610
I've then repaid my debt of gratitude towards you.

112
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,730
Even if from now on, I have to bear eternal infamy, I will accept it.

113
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,690
I just ask Your Majesty to be merciful and

114
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,840
let me have a place to live in Rock City.

115
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,010
Even if I'm unable to stay by your side every day from now on,

116
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,950
I could at least look at the royal palace of Rock City,

117
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,120
think about your absolutely stunning reign,

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,430
and spend the rest of my miserable life like that.

119
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,430
I'm already contented.

120
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,460
Come.

121
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,290
You sincerely have done things for my sake.

122
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm not some muddled king who can't discern right from wrong.

123
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,620
As the secret guard of Upper Yang Palace, if not because of what happened today,

124
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,680
I would probably not dare to give you any important position.

125
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,900
Your Majesty, you—

126
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,570
Now, you and Zhangsun Wuji have completely broken up.

127
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,720
You also gained merit for protecting me and removing a traitor.

128
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,440
You even helped me fill up our nation's treasury.

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,330
With such a huge contribution, how can I punish you?

130
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm going to reward you; a big reward!

131
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,870
Thank you, Your Majesty!

132
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,990
I announce Generalissimo Black Tortoise Jiang Feng will now be handling Gold of Heaven Fiend.

133
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,740
From today on, he will control and command the army in the capital.

134
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,660
Especially conferring him the title rank one General Nation Stabilizer,

135
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,200
rank one Guarding Marquis Nation Protector.

136
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,150
Prince Eternal plotted to rebel, privately kept military fire weapons,

137
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,300
embezzled the nation's treasury, wrecked the country and brought ruin to the people.

138
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,600
He is truly a trouble to the government.

139
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,670
His crime is unpardonable.

140
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,860
Considering that he's a royal relative, he's being allowed to maintain a full corpse.

141
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,090
He's being granted a poisoned wine and asked to commit suicide.

142
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,640
The important military affairs under Prince Eternal

143
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,630
will now be temporarily handled by Generalissimo Black Tortoise.

144
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,490
No mistakes must be made.

145
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,680
You did great.

146
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,350
You've worked hard in staying inside Prince Eternal's Manor for a few days.

147
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,850
Teacher, it's not my own merit.

148
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,980
If not because you already had men inside Prince Eternal Manor, this false incrimination matter wouldn't have been a success.

149
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,480
When did you learn to fawn?

150
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,380
Now that we've eliminated Prince Eternal,

151
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,960
I don't know how things are going with General Zhan.

152
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,630
- Here is some food.
- Thank you.

153
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,360
Be careful. Slower.

154
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,660
I still want to rest for a while.

155
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,700
Sure.

156
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,600
Are you all right?

157
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,790
What are you thinking?

158
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,610
The battle in Ice Land was the second time that you've saved me.

159
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,810
I will never forget it.

160
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,590
In front, it's already Geya Desert.

161
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,470
But I must go in.

162
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,610
I must charge back to Rock City and retake the throne.

163
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,960
But this journey is too dangerous.

164
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,610
I fear that you—

165
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,270
No matter what choice you make,

166
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,400
I will follow you.

167
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,270
Whether it's Geya Desert or charging back to Rock City,

168
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,990
as long as you're there,

169
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,400
I will forever accompany you, forever.

170
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,390
Even the most powerful Prince Eternal has become a traitor prince.

171
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,000
From now on, our Rock City will not have any prince that won't fall.

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,770
With the crimes like embezzling public funds and even storing military fire power, even ten Prince Eternal couldn't bear it.

173
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,240
The palace has sent men to capture the remaining allies of Prince Eternal.

174
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,040
Don't know how many people will be involved.

175
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,450
Move aside! Move aside!

176
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,160
Move aside! All of you, clear the way!

177
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,590
You are finally willing to see me.

178
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,920
Oh, no! Oh, no! Royal Older Brother!

179
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,490
Royal Older Brother! Royal Older Brother, spare my life!

180
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,240
Royal Older Brother, spare my life! Royal Older Brother, spare my life!

181
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,950
His Majesty said that even though you harbored intentions to rebel and it's unpardonable,

182
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,830
you have still loyally served him for many years.

183
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,020
Even if you don't have merits, you had exerted effort.

184
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,890
Hence, he especially sent me to send you off.

185
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,230
Royal Older Brother was afraid that I wouldn't die

186
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,980
and asked you to monitor me. Am I right?

187
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,260
In this life, I've lived more cautiously and meticulously than anyone.

188
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,880
I was afraid that I'd invite a fatal disaster.

189
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,700
Never thought...

190
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,020
I still wouldn't be able to escape it.

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,170
Rather than dying with false accusations, I should have just truly rebelled!

192
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,760
Maybe, I could have found a way to survive.

193
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,020
That's right, too.

194
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,790
I've always known Royal Older Brother's character and temper.

195
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,650
Even if I escape this time,

196
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,390
I wouldn't have a good death in the end.

197
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,170
Rather than saying that you framed me,

198
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,800
why not just say that Royal Older Brother has been guarding against me all this time.

199
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,680
My ending today was him taking advantage of a favorable opportunity.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,480
For Prince Eternal to realize this, it's for the best.

201
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,720
Retribution!

202
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,740
These past few years, just to keep my life,

203
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,000
I personally killed three of my biological brothers.

204
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm ashamed to face the ancestors of the Zhan clan!

205
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,620
I indeed deserve to die.

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,500
Today... let's just treat this as my apology for my crimes.

207
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,720
I will ensure the safety of your wife and children.

208
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,020
Just go in peace.

209
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,820
Could that be the Aquatic Dragon Ancient City?

210
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,140
Hold tightly to my hand.

211
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,270
Whatever happens, you mustn't let go. Understand?

212
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,680
The distinguished king of Deep Water coming into Heaven Fiend alone,

213
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,610
it can't be because you miss me, right?

214
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,630
I'm here to look for a person.

215
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,780
Qi Yun?

216
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,020
You've seen her? Where is she now?

217
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,580
I heard that she joined the competition of the Gold of Heaven Fiend just to look for you.

218
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,850
Yes.

219
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,800
Did she get hurt?

220
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,240
Where is she now?

221
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,450
Up to when do you plan to keep being manipulated by them, the father and daughter?

222
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,050
I... am just worried about her.

223
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,880
Was it only about her?

224
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,730
Is it not because Qi Zhen has escaped prison and you're unable to find him,

225
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,110
that's why you chased them up to here?

226
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,380
So, you already knew.

227
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,190
How long did you plan to hide this from me?

228
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,910
How did all these happen?

229
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,960
At the start, I locked Qi Zhen up in the celestial prison.

230
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,210
A few days ago, he suddenly fell ill.

231
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,490
He looked as if he wouldn't last long anymore.

232
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,140
Qi Yun then came to see me.

233
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,910
She said that she wanted to take care of her father on his last few days.

234
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
I got soft-hearted and agreed with it.

235
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,170
Not only did you agree,

236
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,250
you even had him removed from prison, delivered to the side courtyard,

237
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,800
and even had an imperial physician treat him.

238
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,470
At the start, I thought that he was lingering on his last breath.

239
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,810
I didn't guard against him.

240
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:48,510
But who would have thought that old man was actually doing an escape act.

241
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,340
You couldn't even keep watch of Qi Yun. Why then were you so confident that you could keep watch of Qi Zhen?

242
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,730
You treat him as a godfather that raised you,

243
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,760
but he sees you as the hateful person who stole his royal throne.

244
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,030
He might be hiding now and preparing to kill you anytime.

245
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,470
He isn't like that.

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,370
This is a letter he left me before he escaped. Read it.

247
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,290
[For my son, Yun Hen]

248
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,030
General, I've searched everywhere.

249
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,400
There are no traces of the secret army.

250
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,260
Everyone, set up camp here.

251
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,270
Even if we have to wait, we must wait for them.

252
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,840
Yes!

253
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,920
Qi Zhen said that the reason he did every means to find the Dragon Scale Armor back then was to preserve Qi Yun's life.

254
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,160
You also know that without the Dragon Scale Armor, Qi Yun won't survive.

255
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,940
And?

256
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,030
Qi Zhen also said that he knows how great his sins are.

257
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,020
He is escaping just to find Qi Yun.

258
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,250
He said that even if he and his daughter lose their lives,

259
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,260
he will return the Dragon Scale Armor to our Xuanyuan clan.

260
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,560
He said that it's time to close the debts he had with the Xuanyuan royal clan.

261
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,330
Really?

262
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,150
But I don't believe any words that Qi Zhen said.

263
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,040
He already lost military power and trusted aides.

264
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,800
Even if he has escaped, what can he do?

265
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,050
In the past, he had such great power, but still failed in getting the royal throne of Deep Water.

266
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,570
That is more impossible now.

267
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,390
I am... just worried...

268
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,000
that he'll hurt Qi Yun if he falls into severe despair.

269
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,040
Qi Zhen knew you so well.

270
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:50,400
He's doing this to take advantage of your kindness and your feelings towards Qi Yun.

271
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,110
Can you not really see it?

272
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,040
He is Yun'er's father!

273
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,610
Yun'er is his daughter!

274
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,150
Did Qi Zhen contact you already?

275
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,820
That's good then.

276
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,120
I plan to find him sooner or later anyway.

277
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,670
I'll go with you and finish what should have been finished.

278
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,150
Zhangsun Wuji has been meticulously protecting you.

279
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,520
I thought it was some big shot.

280
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,010
But aren't you also just some ordinary person?

281
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,390
What is your relationship with Wuji?

282
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,560
Wuji?

283
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,550
You call him so intimately.

284
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,860
What right do you have to ask me?

285
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,150
Fine.

286
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,820
I'm too lazy to ask.

287
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,690
Hey! Who gave you the permission to leave?

288
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,580
What do you want? Kill me?

289
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,470
Why would I kill you?

290
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,590
I have a message that I want you to relay to Zhangsun Wuji.

291
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,110
Our Grand Teacher has words to ask him.

292
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,800
Tell him to listen well.

293
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,650
Since it's your Grand Teacher who has a message for Wuji,

294
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,770
just personally tell it to him.

295
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,140
I won't help you with this favor anymore.

296
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,380
You just do what I tell you to do.

297
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,200
Don't force me to get physical.

298
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,650
Don't look for trouble.

299
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,580
Just quickly go home, child.

300
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,400
You dare say that I'm a child?

301
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,930
I won't allow you to protect her!

302
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,940
- I'm fine.
- Is it painful?

303
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,750
- Have you had enough?
- Isn't it just a superficial wound?

304
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,370
My co-disciple, just casually hurting others. Looks like as the first student of Firmament I must teach you a lesson.

305
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,730
You dare use a restriction technique on me?

306
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,470
Don't appear in front of her again.

307
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,770
Let's go.

308
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,410
If you die in her hands in the future, don't blame me for not warning you!

309
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,300
The medicine of that doctor is quite effective.

310
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,380
It's not painful anymore.

311
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,060
You still got hurt right in front of me.

312
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,840
It was my fault.

313
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,130
What are you saying?

314
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,520
Compared to the things we've been through, this small wound is nothing.

315
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,600
Hey, but who is that girl?

316
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,510
Why is she targeting me?

317
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,840
Her name is Taiyan.

318
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,960
She's the student of Palace Leader Fei Yan.

319
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,550
Palace Leader Fei Yan?

320
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,030
My teacher is Lama Heavenly Secret of Firmament.

321
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,010
He manages Evergreen Shrine.

322
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,410
Although Palace Leader Fei Yan came from our sect,

323
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,210
she rarely interacted with us.

324
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,860
But since we all are in Firmament,

325
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,700
I should even be calling her Aunt Teacher.

326
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,180
Hence, Taiyan can be considered to be my junior sister in Firmament.

327
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,990
She's used to being an annoying troublemaker.

328
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,380
She's not really targeting you.

329
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,710
Don't mind her at all.

330
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,020
I won't mind,

331
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,390
but I'm very curious why you went to Firmament to train for ten years.

332
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,220
I don't know if it counts as escaping,

333
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,180
or maybe I wanted to prove myself.

334
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,290
No one forced me to go to Firmament.

335
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,350
It was a decision that I made.

336
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,190
But I never thought that I would be gone for ten years

337
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,650
because there was a thing that I couldn't face.

338
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,630
If... you...

339
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,410
trust me, I can face it with you.

340
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,230
We have to start with the marital alliance between my Emperor Father and Empress Mother.

341
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:03,140
This couple that others see as a match made in heaven to the eyes of bystanders,

342
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,200
isn't really as perfect as others imagined.

343
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,900
Because that time, my Empress Mother already had someone she loved.

344
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,640
You are finally willing to see me.

345
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,960
I never thought of competing with Zhangsun Jiong for anything.

346
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,030
Zhangsun Jia?

347
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,040
It's Prince Virtue?

348
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,650
He... is your Royal Uncle?

349
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,400
I don't know what happened in the past generation.

350
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,040
Two people are clearly in love,

351
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,380
but Empress Mother married Emperor Father in the end.

352
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,190
What I couldn't understand more is since she made such a decision,

353
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,180
why then must she still long for Prince Virtue and disregard Emperor Father and the empire?

354
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,070
Have you known this all this time?

355
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,750
Since you can't change what has happened before,

356
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,000
stop stuffing them in your heart.

357
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,720
Don't punish yourself for the mistakes of the past generation.

358
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,790
If I'm just an ordinary person, I probably wouldn't make things this difficult on myself.

359
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,370
But I'm the Crown Prince of Megrez.

360
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:03,530
Every time I face Emperor Father, I would remember those unbearable things.

361
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,600
We've been guarding here for two days, but we haven't even seen the shadows of that secret army.

362
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,240
Will they really appear?

363
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,530
Presently, they are our only choice.

364
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,150
We can only wait until they appear.

365
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,800
No matter how long we must wait, I will accompany you.

366
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,960
Come over here.

367
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,030
Is it cold?

368
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,610
No.

369
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,480
I just feel that this place is too lonely.

370
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,650
Other than the sound of the sand being blown by the wind, there's no sign of life at all.

371
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,120
Fifth Older Brother, you said before that this Secret Army was once a member of the Dark Storm Cavalry.

372
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,710
- Yes.
- They became like this because they betrayed the Five Regions.

373
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,220
But why would they do that?

374
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,700
It's because of this Aquatic Dragon Ancient City.

375
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
For this city?

376
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,090
Yes.

377
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,330
Even though Aquatic Dragon Ancient City is now dilapidated,

378
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,360
according to legends, there used to be endless amounts of treasure hidden under this city.

379
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,780
Even if you gather all the resources of the Five Regions, it can't compare.

380
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,430
They took interest in those treasures.

381
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,240
Just for gold, silver, and precious gems, they allowed their mind to get disturbed.

382
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,650
Isn't that getting bewitched too easily?

383
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,000
This Aquatic Dragon Ancient City has always been an enchanted place.

384
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,260
Those treasures are also being protected by a mystical power.

385
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,150
Mere mortals like us can never touch them.

386
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,800
If you get bewitched by them, you must bear a curse that can't be reversed.

387
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:58,010
They can't ever leave Geya?

388
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,490
Correct.

389
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,000
It's exactly because of their betrayal,

390
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,340
thousands of citizens within the Aquatic Dragon Ancient City lost their lives.

391
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,670
Just to punish them, Firmament had them imprisoned here for generations.

392
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,940
If no one will remove the seal for them,

393
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,210
they will then suffer torment for generations.

394
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:29,560
Hence... you tried your best to prove that you're an outstanding crown prince.

395
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,000
One is to make up for your Empress Mother's crime.

396
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,640
Second is to let your Emperor Father know that under any circumstances,

397
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,380
you are their most outstanding son.

398
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,450
That's right.

399
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,410
Hence, I... dare not have any moment of slacking off.

400
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,140
Because only I know how heavy this crown prince position of Megrez is.

401
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,480
I don't want Emperor Father to have any disappointment or dissatisfaction.

402
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,080
But didn't you still disobey your Emperor Father in the end?

403
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,590
Do you know how much your Emperor Father is against me being by your side?

404
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,020
Without you, I might be living just for the royal throne.

405
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,220
But it's exactly because of you that I realized

406
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,850
that there are a lot more things in this world that are worthy to be done.

407
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,090
But I'm lucky that I've finally found a person in this lifetime

408
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,230
whom I can share my secrets and give my trust to.

409
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,780
I also feel fortunate

410
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,690
that I was able to find a person that can fight with me side by side.

411
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,440
Someone that can go through challenges with me.

412
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,520
This Secret Army... think about it.

413
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,500
They got confused and became traitors.

414
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,980
After the Great Firmament Battle, they suffered a huge loss.

415
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,140
That was thousands of years ago.

416
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,170
They were unable to live any good days.

417
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,860
It's enough to be suffering a bad reputation for generations,

418
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,930
but even just going home for once is excessive expectation.

419
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,720
They are so pitiful.

420
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:22,680
I think that they surely don't want to keep being like this.

421
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,210
They probably are hoping to be released from this soon.

422
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,900
Since they chose to betray, they then must suffer the punishment.

423
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,070
But it's been thousands of years.

424
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,030
No matter how big their sin was, they have suffered enough punishment.

425
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,840
- Fifth Older Brother.
- Yes.

426
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,450
You said before that the Blue Dragon Wildness Sword can restrict them.

427
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,470
Then, is there a way for it to release them?

428
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,260
That's right.

429
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,020
The Secret Army betrayed, that's why they got cursed.

430
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,960
If I make an oath with this Blue Dragon Wildness Sword again,

431
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,630
maybe I can make them fulfill their promise once again.

432
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,310
Let them fulfill their promise again.

433
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,660
Come, eat and drink.

434
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,810
Come. Eat. Here.

435
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,290
Mr. Zong, going out this early in the morning?

436
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,250
The one lying inside my room is my younger brother.

437
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,600
He got tired from traveling, so don't wake him up.

438
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,880
Okay. Mister, don't worry.

439
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,080
You said it right.

440
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,930
Qi Zhen has raised you for eighteen years.

441
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,980
You can't just pretend that you don't remember this gratitude.

442
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,800
My appearance was just pain and hatred for you.

443
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,970
But I can't forget the deep grudge of the massacre of our family.

444
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,120
For the citizens of Deep Water, your kindness is a good thing.

445
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,540
For our dead parents, it's being unfilial.

446
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,440
I know that all of these are torture and suffering for you.

447
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,400
Since I'm the older brother, just let me end this bloody stench and filthy things that you don't want to face.

448
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,120
My life is just borrowed to begin with.

449
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,670
It's not worthy to be cherished.

450
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,720
But you must remember the honor of the Xuanyuan clan of Deep Water.

451
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,090
As the king of Deep Water, you must serve your nation loyally and earn its citizens blessings.

452
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,840
With that, I will die with no regrets.

453
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,560
In the name of the Blue Dragon Wildness Sword,

454
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,110
I'm calling all the Dark Storm Cavalry in the Five Regions!

455
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,280
Blue Dragon in the wilderness rides the wind as its banner.

456
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,850
Blue Dragon in the wilderness rides the wind as its banner.

457
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,290
General, they are here!

458
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,730
Is the Aquatic Dragon Ancient City a place that mortals like you should enter?

459
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,000
Since you people are here, it's just proper that I come!

460
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,260
Who are you?

461
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,170
You don't know me?

462
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,970
Then don't you recognize this sword?

463
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,200
Grandmaster Zhou is my maternal grandfather!

464
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,440
Impossible.

465
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,920
I, Zhan Beiye, am the son of Heaven Fiend's King Jianhe,

466
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,360
the only descendant of Grandmaster Zhou.

467
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,800
Being able to wield this sword already explains everything.

468
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,910
What questions do you still have?

469
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,840
Why did you come here?

470
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,080
I came to take back your promise.

471
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,050
Take back?

472
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,620
We didn't make any promise to you.

473
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,220
But you all made an oath to this.

474
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:57,500
Once the Blue Dragon appears, the Dark Storm Cavalry is swearing to serve him until death.

475
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,550
Even if you hold the Blue Dragon Wildness Sword,

476
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,100
even if you are the descendant of the Zhou and Zhan families, so what?

477
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,190
We'd been abandoned by the Five Regions long ago!

478
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,210
We don't want to get controlled by your lusts anymore.

479
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,830
You... don't have the right to order us around.

480
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,550
That's why you'd rather get locked up in here.

481
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,820
You all are the citizens of Five Regions!

482
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,070
You've signed a life contract that lasts for generations.

483
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,680
You said that you're going to follow and loyally serve the imperial court until death!

484
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,720
I don't know what kind of seduction happened thousands of years ago,

485
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,170
but I know that you all will never forget that you are a decent human being.

486
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,470
That you shouldn't get trapped in this barren land living in fear.

487
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,590
Have you ever thought

488
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,150
that there is no ending in this kind of torture aiming to ravage one's dignity?

489
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,490
Although there are a lot of unbearable matters and regrets in this world,

490
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,090
we still continue to move forward,

491
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,990
still continue to fight for the survival of Five Regions!

492
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,390
But what about you?

493
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,380
Would you rather get trapped in here and just watch how the citizens suffer?

494
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,520
This bright red eye of the Sword God

495
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,300
bore witness to the moment when each Dark Sword Cavalry made their oath.

496
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,090
Fighting for Heaven Fiend!

497
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,410
Fighting for the citizens of Ice Land!

498
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,420
Have you all forgotten all these words?

499
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,300
What do you want exactly?

500
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,060
I want your strength.

501
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,020
Five Regions now has danger sprouting left and right.

502
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,990
Heaven Fiend is currently being ruled by a muddled king.

503
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,320
The citizens are in unbearable suffering.

504
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,220
I want you all to fight for the citizens of Heaven Fiend.

505
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,170
Why must I believe you?

506
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,660
You can only believe me.

507
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,090
I'm swearing by the name of the Blue Dragon Wildness Sword

508
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,800
that as long as you all accompany me in eliminating the muddled king, support the true royal ruler,

509
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,190
and return peace to Heaven Fiend,

510
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,540
I'm willing to use the Heaven Fiend Double Sound to remove your curse.

511
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,760
Only I can remove the curse of the Aquatic Dragon Ancient City.

512
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,990
You know that more than anyone.

513
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,740
You all must believe him.

514
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,300
He... is the most trustworthy man who keeps all his promises.

515
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,440
That I've seen in this life.

516
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,900
He wouldn't lie to you!

517
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,390
We believe you.

518
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,870
I want you to swear using a life.

519
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,760
- I agree to it.
- General, you can't die!

520
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,730
Let me do it!

521
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,100
This is none of your business!

522
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,690
I only want a woman.

523
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,930
Sacrifice her life as an offering.

524
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,330
Only by offering her life will we fight for you.

525
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,390
Don't even think of it!

526
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,230
There's no room for discussion then.

527
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,770
Wait!

528
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,140
I'll do as you say!

529
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,070
No!

530
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,880
I won't allow you to do this.

531
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,480
Fifth Older Brother,

532
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,170
this is the last thing I'm going to do for you.

533
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,940
Let go.

534
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,000
No!

535
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,330
Let go of me!

536
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,220
I won't allow you to do it!

537
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,460
General!

538
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,330
You all listen.

539
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,480
I'm the descendant of the Zhan and Zhou clans.

540
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,660
This is my own matter.

541
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,060
It has nothing to do with others.

542
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,980
If you insist on using a life as an offering,

543
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:11,030
then just take mine.

544
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,180
But you all must fulfill your promise.

545
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:19,180
I want you to eliminate the muddled king

546
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,910
and return peace to Heaven Fiend.

547
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,010
General!

548
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,950
