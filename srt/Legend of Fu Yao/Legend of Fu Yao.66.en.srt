00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,410
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,580
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:24,740
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,990
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,950
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:40,040
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,500
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,020
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,700
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,890
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,930
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,070
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,590
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,270
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,670
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,600
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,800
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,590
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,970
~ Episode 66 ~

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,800
This is a destined deadlock.

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:46,470
If... If the will of the heavens can't be changed,

24
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,020
then I... will die with her.

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,900
Okay.

26
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,760
If this is your choice, I'll help you until the end.

27
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,860
No, Taiyan, listen to me.

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,810
I don't want you to help me...

29
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,070
I... I am doing this.

30
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,650
I... I am doing this so that you all don't need to give up everything.

31
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,820
You! Leave.

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,270
Leave. Leave.

33
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,610
Leave, Taiyan!

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,500
I don't want any of you, any of you sacrificing your life for me again!

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,470
Don't! Taiyan!

36
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,150
I also have my selfish reasons and things that I care about.

37
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,480
Don't. I beg you! I beg you!

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,690
- No one can change my decision.
- Taiyan!

39
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,090
Taiyan! No.

40
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,600
Taiyan! Taiyan, don't!

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,960
Don't, Taiyan! Don't.

42
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,940
No. Don't do it...

43
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,300
Move aside and I'll spare your life.

44
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,140
I won't let you pass even if I die.

45
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,990
Kill him!

46
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,160
If I'm unable to block you, I swear that I won't continue living as a human.

47
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,730
Older Sis Fuyao, I already did my best.

48
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,340
Technically speaking, if the 5th seal in her hasn't been broken,

49
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,750
she can't be truly considered to be the female demon

50
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,070
and will be unable to revive Di Feitian.

51
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,920
When the time comes, the five of us will just need to unite and seal her,

52
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,140
eliminating this future trouble, and we'll be able to bring peace and stability to the world.

53
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,990
Will that female demon really come here to seek death?

54
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,320
Wuji!

55
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,480
Wuji!

56
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,450
Wuji? Wuji?

57
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,420
Wuji. Wuji.

58
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,470
Sorry...

59
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,910
Girl.

60
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,520
Girl.

61
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,890
You shouldn't... shouldn't have come here.

62
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,290
Listen to me.

63
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,520
Leave now. Leave now.

64
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,920
- I'm not leaving.
- You shouldn't have come here.

65
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,310
Grand Teacher... Grand Teacher won't let you off.

66
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,680
Quickly leave. Leave!

67
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,610
Leave!

68
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,150
Leave! Leave!

69
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,000
Girl, leave!

70
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,150
Leave!

71
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,870
Quickly leave!

72
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,750
Girl! Girl!

73
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,390
Girl!

74
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,400
- I also suffered the coldness of my bones getting gnawed at, the pain of getting my heart getting stabbed at.
- Leave!

75
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,170
- Don't care about me anymore!
- I was able to survive it.

76
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,310
- You also surely can!
- Don't mind me anymore!

77
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,010
This is the peak of the heavens and not Emotionless Realm!

78
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,990
How did you know...

79
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,930
How did you know that I'm talking about Emotionless Realm?

80
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,030
Could it be it's you...

81
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,510
There's no use in mentioning past things.

82
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,010
Sorry, I owe you so much.

83
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,500
You... listen well.

84
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,800
I never want you to pay me back for anything.

85
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,390
I did all these to achieve my goal.

86
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,190
Now, I don't need you anymore.

87
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,190
Leave. Leave.

88
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,830
Leave!

89
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,330
Wuji...

90
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,530
I fear that she won't be able to leave even if she wants to.

91
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,200
Leave... Quickly go...

92
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,690
You are not their equal.

93
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,130
Leave.

94
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,000
Quickly leave.

95
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,030
Go. Go.

96
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,590
Hurry up and leave, Fuyao...

97
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,920
Fuyao! Fuyao! Fuyao!

98
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,980
Fuyao!

99
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,580
Leave! Leave!

100
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,070
Fuyao!

101
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,280
Looks like there's no room for any discussion anymore.

102
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,540
Fuyao!

103
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,230
How dare you! Put down your sword

104
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,090
Or else don't blame us for being ruthless.

105
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,730
Why weren't you lenient with Wuji?

106
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,630
You should ask yourself that question.

107
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,690
Wuji was initially my best student.

108
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,020
He's the future heir of Evergreen Shrine.

109
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,240
But just to protect you, he disobeyed his teacher's orders,

110
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,230
- No...
- went against the mandate of the heavens, and ended up in such a state.

111
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,100
All these happened because of you!

112
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,500
Fuyao.

113
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,140
Thanks.

114
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,110
Don't. Fuyao!

115
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,550
As long as you let Wuji go,

116
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,060
I'll bear whatever you want to do to me.

117
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,130
I'll let you do anything you want to me.

118
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,480
Don't. Fuyao! Don't!

119
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,410
Okay!

120
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,220
Don't! Don't! Don't!

121
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,350
Don't!

122
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,400
Since Wuji is unable to do it, what else are we waiting for?

123
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,060
Today, we'll be the one to seal this female demon.

124
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,860
Don't! Stop!

125
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,880
Grand Teacher!

126
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,940
Do it now.

127
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,420
I beg you! I beg you!

128
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,490
Don't! Don't do it!

129
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,670
Even if you're a woman who is deeply affectionate and loyal to your friends,

130
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,340
you are still the female demon that's going to bring trouble to the world!

131
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,540
For Five Regions, we can only do this!

132
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,350
Don't do it! Don't!

133
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,360
Don't!

134
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,190
Don't!

135
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,110
Girl!

136
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,720
Girl!

137
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,540
Girl!

138
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,100
Fei Yan, you're too despicable.

139
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,410
You attacked us from the back while we were using our energy.

140
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,960
What are you trying to do?

141
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,430
Illusion Palace has always been Di Feitian's Illusion Palace.

142
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,870
I'm Di Feitian's only bloodline.

143
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,850
If not because of planning to make a comeback,

144
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,620
why would my Illusion Palace collude with Firmament ants like you

145
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,610
and seal the remnant sense of Di Feitian?

146
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,750
Just to look for this female demon, Illusion Palace has waited for thousands of years.

147
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,480
This is your real purpose.

148
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,930
Fei Yan, you are planning to revive Di Feitian?

149
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,660
As long as I use her as an offering to Di Feitian's sealed stone,

150
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,730
the confined Di Feitian can then see the sun again.

151
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,230
By then, the evil fire inside the female demon will return to Di Feitian's body.

152
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,860
As long as he has that evil fire, Di Feitian will be able to recreate his past glory.

153
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,930
Very soon, this Five Regions will become our Five Regions.

154
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,470
You have long plotted for this.

155
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,560
It was you all who were too stupid.

156
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,190
I must kill you today!

157
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,130
Fei Yan, you'll suffer heaven's retribution.

158
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,920
An ungrateful wretch.

159
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,630
Grand Teacher. Grand Teacher.

160
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,230
Student, it's your turn.

161
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,640
Kill Wuji.

162
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,230
By then, no one can foil our plan.

163
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,930
Quickly go.

164
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,660
Yes.

165
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,980
Yan'er, why are you disobeying me?

166
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,900
Do you think I won't be able to notice those feelings of yours?

167
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,380
There were so many times that you left without permission with the pretense of doing your mission,

168
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,210
but secretly, didn't you go see that scoundrel?

169
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,810
Yan'er, you are really too naive.

170
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,110
Do you really think he loves you?

171
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,940
You're wrong. He doesn't love you at all.

172
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,420
Is it worth it for you to do this?

173
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,240
- What nonsense are you saying?
- Taiyan.

174
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,750
I told you before that if you want to be well-versed in that sword technique,

175
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,400
you must sever any affection and you'll be able to kill infinite enemies.

176
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,300
I kept reminding you, but how come you're unable to learn it?

177
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,430
Stop. Stop.

178
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,660
A student that couldn't be taught.

179
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,250
I then can only endure the pain to let you die before me.

180
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,650
Taiyan!

181
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,080
Fei Yan!

182
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,630
I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you!

183
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,690
I'm going to kill you!

184
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,900
Fei Yan, you're already dying.

185
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,530
Why continue to struggle?

186
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,190
Your pulse is abnormal.

187
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,410
Your breath is weak.

188
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,520
Calculating it, it's the time for the Palace Leader of Illusion Palace to ascend to the immortal world. Is it not?

189
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,950
You're making up things.

190
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,640
I'm not making up things.

191
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,620
Calculating it.

192
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,260
You're about to die.

193
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,520
You might look pretty, just like how you were before,

194
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,900
but all those were obtained in exchange for other people's lifespans!

195
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,330
A life that is being sustained by relying on magic.

196
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,860
Once you reach the duration of its effect,

197
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,670
you will decline and disappear in a blink of an eye!

198
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,500
Shut up!

199
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:21,690
Maybe, the day of your ascension isn't today.

200
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,620
But you used too much energy earlier.

201
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:31,710
Even if I, Zhangsun Wuji, will be dying here today,

202
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,280
I am going to let you, the Palace Leader of Illusion Palace, be buried with me!

203
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,080
You still will die before me.

204
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,800
What's to fear?

205
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,150
Just die.

206
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,340
Fuyao.

207
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,180
Fuyao.

208
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,270
A bunch of mortals, you're overestimating your capabilities.

209
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,850
For the citizens of this world.

210
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,310
For my friends and family, I won't forgive you!

211
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,090
Today, we're going to kill you, female demon!

212
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,210
Since you all insist on stopping me in reviving Di Feitian,

213
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,090
I'll let the whole world die with me then.

214
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,200
Die!

215
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,430
Fuyao!

216
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,930
Aren't you all belittling my Illusion Palace too much?

217
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,150
Before I ascend to the immortal world,

218
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,780
I'm still going to use my life to open the last seal of the female demon.

219
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,830
My wish will be fulfilled soon.

220
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:43,140
Reviving Di Feitian is the greatest glory you can have.

221
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,530
Go, child.

222
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,390
Go.

223
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,130
Girl!

224
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,730
How are you, Girl?

225
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,290
Girl...

226
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,540
I fear that she has become the female demon and doesn't recognize us anymore.

227
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,160
We are just obstacles for her to revive Di Feitian.

228
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,060
Girl, don't be like this.

229
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,560
Don't be like this, Girl. Don't be like this.

230
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,430
Don't!

231
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Girl! Girl!

232
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,430
Girl!

233
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:09,250
Last time, that was also the area that you stabbed.

234
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,330
I'll treat this as our love token.

235
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,070
I want to stay alive with you.

236
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,010
I once hoped that you could just quietly stand by my side.

237
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:18,090
I initially thought that I could prepare everything and then welcome you in a grand manner.

238
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,670
Girl.

239
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,640
Maybe life is indeed vast and long.

240
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,070
There is some persistence and memory that will never change.

241
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:32,990
For ten years, twenty years, or a lifetime,

242
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,360
it will forever be the first day.

243
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,920
Among the 33 levels of skies, the level of being separated is the highest.
(There are 33 levels in Buddhism.)

244
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,110
Among the 404 illnesses, being lovesick is the most painful.

245
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,870
You're mine. How could you think about others?

246
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,560
How could you—

247
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,170
Whether you cry or smile,

248
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,130
I will always be there for you.

249
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,500
I'll accompany you until the end.

250
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,000
Girl.

251
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,330
Blame it all on me.

252
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,290
Girl!

253
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,810
Blame it all on me for not locating you sooner.

254
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,220
I didn't protect you well enough.

255
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,260
Girl! Girl!

256
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,460
I came too late and left too early.

257
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,590
I'm sorry.

258
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,010
Wuji?

259
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,030
Girl.

260
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,750
It was you who made me believe that there are beautiful things in the world.

261
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,560
It was you who gave me the hope to continue living.

262
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,770
Now, you made me trust in the human heart again,

263
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,480
believe that Heaven didn't abandon me.

264
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,150
I am willing to use this lifetime to grow old with you.

265
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,110
No matter when, where,

266
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,490
in Heaven or on Earth, we will never separate.

267
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,300
Girl!

268
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,890
Wuji.

269
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,590
Girl.

270
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,600
♫ What do you know? ♫

271
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
♫ What is good about the three realms? ♫

272
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,400
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

273
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,800
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

274
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,300
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

275
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,200
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

276
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,420
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

277
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,700
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

278
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,000
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

279
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,800
- Girl.
- I'm here.

280
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,600
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

281
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,800
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

282
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,300
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

283
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,400
Wuji, I finally did it.

284
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:37,300
I... thought... I was going to lose you.

285
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,400
From now on, I'm not allowing you to do this again.

286
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,300
Everything started with me anyway.

287
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,500
It should also end with me.

288
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:05,480
I just want to use my death to exchange for the survival of the world.

289
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,300
From now on, in this world...

290
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,700
there won't be any female demon anymore.

291
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,000
Only Fuyao.

292
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:48,900
We... We actually defeated... the chains of fate.

293
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,000
All things are equal in this world,

294
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,780
but the heavens are wise and just.

295
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,200
If one cares about the world, one will live if he is dead.

296
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,000
It's never, never disappointing.

297
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,360
I really hope...

298
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:19,200
hope that in this world, there will be no more killing.

299
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,500
Of course.

300
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,200
I... hope that this world will be in peace.

301
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,100
I... want... you to become...

302
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,520
the empress of Five Regions' Megrez Empire,

303
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,100
the most blissful empress.

304
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,400
I want that every winter... I want that every winter, I'll take you to eat roasted sweet potatoes.

305
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,800
I'm going to take you to eat all the fish in Mt. Green Bead.

306
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,500
Take you to step on every inch of land here in Five Regions.

307
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,000
I want to... I want to

308
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,400
use a lifetime to ensure your safety.

309
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,700
Accompany you to grow old together.

310
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We... have...

311
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,800
we have experienced so much suffering in this world.

312
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,200
From now on,

313
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,800
- we must enjoy all the sweetness in this world. Okay?
- Okay.

314
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:46,600
We... We... We want to be together forever.

315
00:38:51,600 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm very fortunate that I met you in this lifetime.

316
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
Me, too.

325
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,400
Slow down!

326
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,000
Did you get heavier?

327
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,700
Who says so?

328
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,400
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

329
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,190
Look. Don't cry.

330
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,400
You should smile.

331
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,000
- Put me down.
- I don't want to.

332
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,800
- Put me down!
- Here.

333
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,100
Your hair is messy.

334
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,200
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

335
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,020
♫ My heart ♫

336
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,600
Among the 33 levels of skies, the level of being separated is the highest.
(There are 33 levels in Buddhism.)

337
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,000
Among the 404 illnesses, being lovesick is the most painful.

338
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,700
I'm not lovesick.

339
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,300
- Really?
- Yes.

340
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,600
Why then did you carve that mark?

341
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,300
For the person that I shouldn't miss out in this life.

342
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,600
Isn't that exactly yearning?

343
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,200
Life is hard and short.

344
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,000
Yearning for someone is too long.

345
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,200
The mortal world is just fleeting.

346
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,300
Death can happen in an instant.

347
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,400
Who knows what's waiting for me is a chance encounter or missing out?

348
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,200
How can I just stand in the same place and let the light and shadow wear me down day and night?

349
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,100
What do you want to do then?

350
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,740
If the mortal world has her, then I'll go to the mortal world.

351
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,000
What if the mortal world will soon be in chaos?

352
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,400
If the mortal world falls into chaos, I'll fight.

353
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,200
If hell opens, I'll go.

354
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,400
If the common people block me, I'll pass through them.

355
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,500
If the whole world gets mad, I'll calm it.

356
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,000
Why go through all the trouble?

357
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,600
But if it's for her,

358
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,600
I don't fear the flourishing secular world and the pain of trials and difficulties.

359

♫ In order to be able to live freely and easily ♫

360
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

361
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,600
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

362

♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

♫ True love won't run short ♫

365
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,600
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

366
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,200
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

367
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,950
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

368
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,000
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

369
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,000
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

370
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,400
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

371
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,100
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

373
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,800
♫ What do you know? ♫

374
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,800
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

375
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,600
♫ If there were no three poisons, if there were no worries, ♫

376
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,800
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

377
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,400
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

378
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,300
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

379
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,400
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

380
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,800
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

381
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,900
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

382
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,700
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness  ♫

383
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,000
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

384
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,500
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

385
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,500
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

386
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,600
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

387
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:06,000
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

388

♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

389
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:16,400
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime  ♫

393
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,500
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

394

♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫
