2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,300
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,610
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:23,780
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,870
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,040
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,910
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,550
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,150
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,860
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,980
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,960
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,080
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,700
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,380
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,440
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:21,390
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,850
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,660
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,120
~ Episode 5 ~

22
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,810
How did you come up? Why are you here?

23
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,590
I also asked myself that earlier.

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,130
Maybe because I'm already addicted to meddling with other people's business.

25
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,650
Who exactly are you?

26
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,990
Why are you helping me?

27
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,770
I’m the one who saved you.

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,550
You just need to remember this.

29
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,880
I will ask you to pay me back in the future.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,900
Come on! The little lowly slave even brought a helper.

31
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,180
Where did you, a wild thing, come from?

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,660
He does not belong to our clique.

33
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,170
There must be fraud.

34
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,550
You’re dead.

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,030
Pei Yuan, what are you doing?

36
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,130
First Senior Brother, I know you’re kindhearted

37
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,680
but the Hunting and Fighting Game is always a life and death battle.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,820
If you keep being so kind, it will only put us into danger.

39
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,470
The game is indeed important.

40
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,120
But we belong to the same clique after all.

41
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,940
How can we take people's lives?

42
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,550
Yuan’er only cares about First Senior Brother in my eyes.

43
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,110
Others’ lives have nothing to do with me.

44
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,720
Everything I did is just to protect First Senior Brother’s pride.

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,060
Yuan’er is willing to do everything for First Senior Brother.

46
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,360
Today’s inhumanity and injustice are all my responsibilities.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,080
I just wish that First Senior Brother is safe.

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,670
Let’s go and get the Dragon Bone Umbrella.

49
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,020
I was waiting for you to say this.

50
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,100
It's red!

51
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,240
The red team has come out!

52
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,050
Clique Leader, the Dragon Candle spat out red fog.

53
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,080
Red team has gotten their bead.

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,150
Yan Jingchen and Pei Yuan passed.

55
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,140
The descendant of the Yan family is indeed outstanding.

56
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,010
In such a short time, he already won.

57
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,230
That Young Master joined the competition with Prefecture Princess Pei from Prime Minister's household.

58
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,960
With such a perfect combination, how can they not succeed?

59
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,220
Let’s go.

60
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,480
-Orange Fog.
- Right.

61
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,850
Clique Leader, the Dragon Candle spat orange fog.

62
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,740
- Orange team got their bead.
- That's wonderful.

63
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,370
Gao He and Chen Yunzhe passed.

64
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,230
Student Yan Jingchen, along with Pei Yuan, got the bead.

65
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,590
I would like to ask for your advice.

66
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,500
Chen’er, you didn’t make your Junior Sister injured. Right?

67
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,420
Thanks, Teacher, for your worries.

68
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,200
Having First Senior Brother's help, I didn’t get injured.

69
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,640
Yuan’er, are you really okay?

70
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,650
Uncle, I’m okay.

71
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,840
Why are you spacing here?

72
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,160
Go and get the Dragon Bone Umbrella.

73
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,480
You-You saved me.

74
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,220
What’s the matter? Are you touched?

75
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,850
Thank you.

76
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,290
How will you thank me?

77
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,550
With your body?

78
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,370
You—

79
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,750
Hold tight. Don’t let go.

80
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,130
Do you know how to swim?

81
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,350
I know a little.

82
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,320
Clique Leader, the Dragon Candle spat blue fog.

83
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,300
Blue team got the bead.

84
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,340
Wang Yuan and Xu Tiankai passed.

85
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,020
This is the fifth team already.

86
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,450
There should be one more team.

87
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,690
We don't know how much longer we have to wait.

88
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,270
It won't be too long.

89
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,010
You see the Dragon Candle will be burned out soon.

90
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,290
The Clique Leader said earlier that the game will only be one Dragon Incense long.

91
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,620
Once it burns out, the game is over.

92
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,510
The Dragon Candle is only used as a timer.

93
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,800
Based on ancestral teachings,

94
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,590
what's the most important thing is the bead that is hung under the Dragon Bone Umbrella.

95
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,130
If you are able to get that bead,

96
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,830
it will be indicated in the Luque Hologram Box.

97
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,990
They will automatically enter the next round.

98
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,120
What if they got the bead but can’t get here before the Dragon Candle burns out?

99
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,400
Replying to Prime Minister,

100
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,980
it will depend on the instructions given by the Hologram Box.

101
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,250
The girl with the Five-Colored Stone finally appeared.

102
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,420
Grandteacher Di Feitian.

103
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,010
The five regions will be your five regions eventually.

104
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,950
Clique Leader, the dragon candle has burned out.

105
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,600
Father, Fuyao still hasn't come out till now.

106
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,490
I'm thinking to—

107
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,580
I hereby announce the second round of the Hunting and Fighting Game has ended.

108
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,160
There is an abnormal phenomenon in the clouds.

109
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,720
I wonder what that means.

110
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,860
There is an abnormal phenomenon.

111
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,160
I saw this cloud with golden scales does look like a dragon spitting out fog.

112
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,100
It has the potential to spread out to tens of thousands of miles.

113
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,360
There must be an appearance of a true dragon here that triggers the changes in the winds and clouds.

114
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,410
The aura of a True Dragon?

115
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,370
Can it be that the one you are speaking of is the heir apparent?

116
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,960
It shouldn't be.

117
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,880
His Highness Heir Apparent isn't here.

118
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,530
Then that's strange.

119
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,630
It's obvious that it's the aura of golden scales.

120
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,490
The True Dragon should be right by its left.

121
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,150
I didn't know that Clique Leader Yan even knows astronomical phenomena well.

122
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,630
In the future, I will definitely learn more from you.

123
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,970
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve it.

124
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,260
Father.

125
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,320
When coming out of the game field, why was Pei Yuan the one that carried the bead?

126
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,510
Chen Er and Junior Sister Pei came down by using the Dragon Bone Umbrella together.

127
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,270
I was too occupied to think about getting the bead.

128
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,960
Too occupied to think about it?

129
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,720
Fortunately Pei Yuan isn't your opponent,

130
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,670
or else you would have already lost your lead.

131
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,310
Yes.

132
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,490
Although you and Pei Yuan are already engaged,

133
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,700
before getting married, there are possibilities for many changes.

134
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,130
Only when people stand on the position that is most advantageous to them,

135
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,320
will they be able to stand without being defeated.

136
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,730
Do you understand?

137
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,190
Yes.

138
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,430
Father.

139
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,340
What else do you have to say?

140
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,960
Father, I want to know. Fuyao...

141
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,070
It's already a time like this and you are still mentioning her!

142
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,540
I just want to know what happened to Fuyao!

143
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,830
She fell down.

144
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,330
We don't know if she's dead or alive.

145
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,650
We still haven't been able to find her.

146
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,910
Stop there!

147
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,550
She is just a servant.

148
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,800
If you keep having her in your mind, I won't let you off.

149
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,030
And even more, I won't let her off.

150
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,410
Do you understand?

151
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,190
I understand.

152
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,740
It's been three days and three nights.

153
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,930
This child doesn't eat or drink. She is in a deep slumber and seems to have nightmares.

154
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,570
She's been screaming all day saying that she fell down from the sky.

155
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,430
Tell me. Is it possible that she hurt her brain?

156
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,890
She is just a kid from the Mystic Black Section.

157
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,660
No one is willing to take a look at her, either.

158
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,260
What if she—

159
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,050
You step out first.

160
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,900
Oh, right. Let me tell you.

161
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,010
This child has a weak body. You must not use strong medications.

162
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,160
Whenever she—

163
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,010
Who are you?

164
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,960
Why am I back here?

165
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,970
What else do you remember?

166
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,850
I remember... I remember that I was battling with the First Senior Brother in martial arts.

167
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,980
And then what happened?

168
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,360
Your external injuries are not serious.

169
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,830
You will recover after resting for a few days.

170
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,220
My head really hurts now.

171
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,550
I can't remember anything.

172
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,740
About that, I don't have the ability to help you.

173
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,150
You're awake!

174
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,240
Thank you, Doctor!

175
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,380
Let me tell you. If not for the doctor, your head would be done for.

176
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,000
If you really did hurt your brain from falling, then what do we do?

177
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,430
My head really hurts now.

178
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,740
I can't remember anything.

179
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,760
Then do you know who I am?

180
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,510
- You are—
- Take a good look.

181
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,800
What? Do you really not know me?

182
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,820
Uncle Zhou! I was just teasing you.

183
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,770
Naughty kid! You scared me!

184
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,420
- Here. Lie down and rest.
- I'll lie down.

185
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,300
Lie down.

186
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,250
Teacher.

187
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,770
Have you found the person?

188
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,220
We've found her. She fell into the deep pond of the back mountain valley.

189
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,750
She is still alive. Doctor Zong just went by to take a look.

190
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,210
He said it's not serious.

191
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,050
Who asked Doctor Zong to attend her?

192
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,560
I am not sure about that.

193
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,320
I heard that Heir Apparent went missing yesterday.

194
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,850
And the guards really were flustered for a while.

195
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,270
I was feeling bored.

196
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,530
I went to the back mountain to catch some crickets.

197
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,070
Why didn't you go watch the game?

198
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,710
Fighting and killing are not interesting.

199
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,070
It isn't elegant, either.

200
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,060
What's good to see?

201
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,930
It's completely by chance that you and I were able to meet at Mt. Mystic Soul.

202
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,950
We have to stay here for a few more days.

203
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,520
Firstly, it's because your body has not completely recovered yet.

204
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,400
Secondly, it's because I hope that you could watch the game and meet more people from the martial arts society.

205
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
So that in the future you can select some and put them to good use.

206
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,040
If we compare the Deep Water Nation to a boat, then you are the helmsman.

207
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,820
Your fate has been determined by the heavens.

208
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,110
In the future, you will definitely shoulder the endless prosperity and welfare of Deep Water.

209
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:14,090
Therefore, you must pay close attention to your mind at any moment.

210
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,580
You must remember your proud and honorable status and mission.

211
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,690
Heir Apparent, what are you laughing at?

212
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,610
I am laughing at this ladybug.

213
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,640
You see.

214
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,190
I blocked its path,

215
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,310
and it became so anxious that it's just bumping its head all over the place.

216
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:58,800
Heir Apparent, can it be that you didn't hear what I was just telling you?

217
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,130
Do you just want to continue like this, living your life by seeking pleasures and fun?

218
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,750
Or are you pretending in front of me,

219
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,800
and not trusting me at all?

220
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,850
Official Qi,

221
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,990
I don't know if you've heard this story.

222
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,550
During the New Year, a man went to the temple to ring the bell and pray for fortune.

223
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,500
The old monk guarding the bell told him,

224
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,790
“You can only ring the bell thrice.”

225
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,930
"First ring is for luck and prosperity.

226
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,660
Second ring is for better position and salary.

227
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,590
Third ring is for health and longevity."

228
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,890
But that man was too greedy and rang the bell one more time.

229
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,110
The old monk was really surprised.

230
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,370
Guess what he said?

231
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,530
"You can’t ring the bell four times.

232
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,130
The fourth ring means everything will be voided."

233
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,890
Exactly.

234
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,520
That man... was too greedy.

235
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,550
He rang one more time and went beyond the limit.

236
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,400
Go beyond the limit?

237
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,790
Heir Apparent, what are you trying to tell me?

238
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,490
Official Qi, I’m afraid of going beyond the limit and ringing the bell four times.

239
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,220
I can’t even be sure if I can ring the bell thrice properly.

240
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,390
With you around,

241
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,490
even if I’m a mouse which can fly,

242
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,740
I won’t even dare to fly to the rooftop.

243
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,460
Even if I can swim, I wouldn’t dare to cross the river.

244
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,840
Good Heir Apparent. I, Qi, will remember the story you told me today.

245
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,320
Let me in.

246
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,580
I have to see the Heir Apparent urgently.

247
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,060
The Heir Apparent isn’t someone you can see on your own will.

248
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,670
Then, help me inform him that I have to see him urgently.

249
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,880
If you still want to go in without permission, don’t blame me if I treat you badly.

250
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,600
Let her in.

251
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,080
Isn’t she the heroine who rode on the Zitie?

252
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,550
You come out. I have something to ask you.

253
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,350
You, fearless lowly slave, how can you not bow when you see the Prime Minister and Heir Apparent?

254
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,910
Greetings, Heir Apparent. Greetings, Prime Minister.

255
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,100
Please stand up quickly.

256
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,280
I heard that you fell into the deep pond at the back of the mountain during the game the day before yesterday.

257
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,480
Are you okay? I was worried.

258
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,590
It seems like Mr. Zong’s medical skills are really outstanding.

259
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,820
You’re fully recovered.

260
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,680
Let me tell you that just to let Mr. Zong examine you,

261
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,290
I had to say a lot of good words to him.

262
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,240
What are you doing?

263
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,120
What’s happening to you?

264
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,600
Why are you being so cold to me?

265
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,550
Are you sick? Your hands are so cold.

266
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,590
No, Heir Apparent. You—

267
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:57,010
It seems like the Heir Apparent is very busy.

268
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,200
I won’t disturb you then.

269
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,660
You said the Heir Apparent likes a slave maidservant. Is it her?

270
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,320
Yes.

271
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,770
- Yun Hen.
- Yes.

272
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,940
Investigate it clearly.

273
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,170
Don't let him play any tricks on us.

274
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,620
Yes.

275
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,580
You're also quite good at acting.

276
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,200
Why were you touching me?

277
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,760
I need to ask you about some serious matters.

278
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,390
How serious?

279
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,760
I wanted to ask you if you were the one teamed up with me in the game that day?

280
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,850
Why do you think that I would team up with you?

281
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,290
I’m a dignified Heir Apparent.

282
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,250
Is it really not you?

283
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,620
But what I've dreamed here and there these few days

284
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,070
are all about me competing with you.

285
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,340
I’m not that nice to poke my nose into these things.

286
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,540
The day before yesterday, I was catching crickets at the back of the mountain.

287
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,310
Besides,

288
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,790
why would I take part in the game with you?

289
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,610
Did water get into your brain after you fell into that lake?
(water entering the brain is an idiom referring to being stupid)

290
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,830
You're the one who has water in your brain.

291
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,560
It’s because I kept dreaming about you these past few days.

292
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,850
That’s why I came here and asked you.

293
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,350
You actually dreamed about me.

294
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,050
You like me, don’t you?

295
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,780
Let go. Who would like you?

296
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,850
You don’t like me.

297
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,900
Then why did you dream about me?

298
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,970
Someone’s eavesdropping.

299
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,550
Don’t scream, understand?

300
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,300
Let me go. Let me go.

301
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,820
- Stop screaming.
- Let me—

302
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,050
Stop screaming.

303
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,760
He’s molesting me!

304
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,930
You—

305
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,020
If you continue screaming,

306
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,520
the people outside will really think that there’s something between us.

307
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,720
You brat, you’re molesting—

308
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,150
You came here on your own today.

309
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,810
Official Qi saw it personally

310
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,900
that it was you who is pestering me.

311
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,170
I’m afraid you may need to be with me in the future.

312
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,350
Okay.

313
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,570
Although that time, I fell off the mountain

314
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,760
and became a bit muddleheaded for injuring my brain,

315
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,560
but I remember everything before that.

316
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,570
If you continue being like this,

317
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,630
I’ll tell Official Qi that his Heir Apparent—

318
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,850
When I gifted you that crystal bottle,

319
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,640
you'd rather enter the Emotionless Realm than betray me.

320
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,760
Tell me. Should I believe that you'll betray me?

321
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,290
This is getting more interesting.

322
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,530
Father.

323
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:18,490
I've forever erased the names of the five students that died in this round.

324
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,780
From now on, they never existed in our Mt. Mystic Soul.

325
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,890
Father, they are already dead.

326
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,280
Why don’t you keep their names?

327
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,820
Aren’t you being too cruel?

328
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,720
Then, you guess,

329
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,370
what will our ancestors think?

330
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,240
They probably won't think that way.

331
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,770
You’re wrong.

332
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,900
They worked hard all their life in exchange for being placed here and being offered incense.

333
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,460
If I’m being kind to the losers today,

334
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,080
then I’m disrespecting them.

335
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,120
Our Mystic Soul has towered over Deep Water Nation for several years

336
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,900
because we relied on the principles of being ruthless in competing for life or death.

337
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:16,780
You have to know, the cruelest thing in this world is not being able to bear.

338
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,370
Not being able to bear yourself and the others

339
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,790
will eventually become your poison.

340
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,570
I'm letting you marry Pei Yuan.

341
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,730
Letting you leave Mt. Mystic Soul.

342
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,930
This is the best path that I've dug out for you.

343
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,310
As for my ending, I will just be placed and offered to here.

344
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,070
And you have to step on these memorial tablets and go even further.

345
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,340
[Ancestors of Mystic Soul]

346
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:50,340
Therefore, you have to do your best in the next game.

347
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,090
Qi Zhen is a cunning and crafty person.

348
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,150
The new Heir Apparent might look muddled,

349
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,450
but he might just be concealing his strengths and biding time.

350
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,740
Your future isn't that smooth.

351
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,610
Hence, we must entrench ourselves at every step.

352
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,890
And for Fuyao,

353
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,710
if she wasn't lucky enough, she would have been included in the ones disappearing today as well.

354
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,760
You must remember this.

355
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,560
You must completely forget this hindrance.

356
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Don’t disappoint me.

357
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,090
This is the best choice for you.

358
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,000
I understand.

359
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,160
Just looking at this game, I know that you prefer the black.
("Prefer the black" and "evil heart" are equivalent in Chinese.)

360
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,400
White is going to lose.

361
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,290
You came here this late at night.

362
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,270
Anything important?

363
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,620
Let me ask you one thing.

364
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,810
What drug did you prescribe that girl?

365
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,120
How come the way she talks seems she's confused like she had amnesia?

366
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,200
I only treated her external injuries and didn't treat her brain.

367
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,300
You didn't prescribe anything to her.

368
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,900
One heart can only focus with one thing.

369
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,050
You're about to lose.

370
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,230
That is true indeed.

371
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,480
How come she can't remember anything then?

372
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,480
Not counted. I was careless. One more time. One more time.

373
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,200
Your heart isn't here.

374
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
It's the same even if we do another round.

375
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,340
Why are you so concerned with a girl from a lowly status?

376
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,160
Could it be that you really have fallen for her?

377
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,820
I have a medicine here that can make people lose memories and become a mentally handicapped person from now on.

378
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,270
Let her drink it.

379
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,990
This way, she won't foil your plan.

380
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,600
Is there really such a drug in this world?

381
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,690
Just leave it for yourself!

382
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,490
What? Can't bear to do it?

383
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,600
I have my own plans.

384
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,030
No need for you to worry.

385
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:22,070
But I still have to remind you to not foil your whole plan just for her.

386
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,790
- Fell asleep?
- How come I'm sleeping here?

387
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,590
Don't know why, but you're always in a daze lately.

388
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,530
You could fall asleep anywhere.

389
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,750
What's wrong?

390
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,990
Let me tell you. I...

391
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,700
don't know if someone...

392
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,820
has deliberately played tricks on me.

393
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,480
Every day, when I go to sleep, I would get abducted and taken to a weird place.

394
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,090
Oh, right. I don't even know who he is.

395
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,380
When I wake up, my whole body would be so sore.

396
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,480
That scary?

397
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,620
Older Sis Fuyao. Older Sis Fuyao, why don't you just go back to sleep?

398
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,550
How about this? I'll guard by the side. Be at ease.

399
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,500
If anyone comes to abduct you, I'll use the stick to beat him to death.

400
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,010
Just you?

401
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,200
What can you guard?

402
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,590
I can do it.

403
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,460
Just go to sleep quickly.

404
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,130
Fine. I'm sleepy.

405
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,480
I'll sleep for a while.

406
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,000
Okay. I'll stay here and guard you.

407
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,820
Don't worry. Okay?

408
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,740
Have you heard it? That Fuyao from the Mystic Black Section seems to have been possessed.

409
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,460
She will wake up in different places every day.

410
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,920
Say, could it be she met something when she fell into the lake during the last competition?

411
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,930
I heard that she keeps saying strange things.

412
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,020
Could she have hysteria?

413
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,480
This is truly interesting.

414
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,440
How come I'm so unfortunate?

415
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,480
It's fine to wake up in different places every day.

416
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,030
I also had to slip and fall very badly.

417
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,700
It's fine to stay alive, Older Sis.

418
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,340
But couldn't I fall in a prettier manner?

419
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,950
Can this really work?

420
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,710
- What's wrong?
- I refuse to believe this.

421
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,350
When you go out later,

422
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,590
close the windows well and lock the door.

423
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,990
Lock it?

424
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,030
Okay. Am I really doing it?

425
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,350
I got it.

426
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,480
I don't believe it.

427
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,850
What's wrong with you?

428
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,820
There has been someone who keeps chasing after me and forcing me to learn martial arts.

429
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,420
What matter is that urgent?

430
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,620
Clique Leader, one of the hanging beads is missing.

431
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:12,180
Look. The eleven hanging beads have been retrieved, but one is still missing.

432
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,150
Mystic Black Section.
