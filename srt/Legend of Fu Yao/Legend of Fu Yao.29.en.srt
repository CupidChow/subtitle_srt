00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,400
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,900
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,600
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,300
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,760
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,200
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,300
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:21,400
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,800
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,300
~ Episode 29 ~

22
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,200
What if...

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,400
the person up there isn't of Xuanyuan blood?

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,600
Those words are punishable by beheading!

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm loyal to the Xuanyuan royal clan.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Heaven and earth can prove it!

27
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,000
Since I started to work for the government,

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,600
I've always put Deep Water's interest as priority in everything I did.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,900
But today...

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
if I clearly know that person up there is fake

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,600
and I still will offer him the customary bows of respect;

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,780
hence, trampling this official court uniform of Deep Water,

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,600
that is what is punishable by beheading!

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You keep saying that he's fake,

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,240
that he's fake!

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,700
- What evidence do you have then?
- That's right. Where is the evidence?

37
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,150
I never do things without confidence.

38
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,700
How are you? Hey!

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,600
Save me! Save me!

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,590
I'm the son of Prince Quandu, Xuanyuan Min.

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,600
Save me.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,600
How is that possible? It must be empty words. That's punishable by execution.

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Absurd. This...

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,100
Your Majesty!

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,000
- This—
- Your Majesty!

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,500
- Who is he calling?
- Absolutely disgraceful!

47
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,900
- This is a big problem.
- Yes. Definitely.

48
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,490
You all see it, right?

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,200
This one is the true Xuanyuan bloodline, Xuanyuan Min!

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,100
Just because you say he is, then he is?

51
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,400
I can say that he is the king.

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,900
He is also the king.

53
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,900
How can you prove that he is of Xuanyuan bloodline?

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,800
That's the water manipulation technique.

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,300
Indeed. How come he knows the water manipulation technique?

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,400
Only the Xuanyuan family knows the water manipulation technique.

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,000
That movement is enough to prove that he truly is from the Xuanyuan bloodline.

58
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,500
There are two Xuanyuan Min appearing at the same time.

59
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,400
This concerns the genuineness of our nation's Xuanyuan bloodline.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,600
We mustn't handle this hastily.

61
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,200
I think Prime Minister doesn't seem to be joking around.

62
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,600
This wedding must be halted!

63
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,000
What a joke! It was His Majesty who saved us from the water disaster before.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
If such a measly trick is the water manipulation technique,

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,600
then wasn't the technique that His Majesty showcased before some witchcraft?

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
- That's right.
- Yes.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
We personally saw His Majesty's Water Manipulation Technique.

68
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,000
They both know the water manipulation technique.

69
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,630
Everyone!

70
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,690
Everyone!

71
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,800
The water manipulation technique is a unique technique to the Xuanyuan royal clan.

72
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,500
It's also rare to see one.

73
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Everyone must have not yet seen enough.

74
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,410
Today is a day of grand celebration.

75
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I was thinking...

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,500
of opening everyone's eyes more.

77
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,500
My Queen.

78
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,400
This Queen...

79
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Queen also knows to do the water manipulation technique?

80
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
This—

81
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,600
My Queen also knows the water manipulation technique.

82
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,900
Is she also of the Xuanyuan bloodline?

83
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,430
Queen Yuwen Zi is from the Changning Manor in the northern border.

84
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,940
She is also the goddaughter of our Prime Minister.

85
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,770
Of course, she's not of Xuanyuan bloodline.

86
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,730
Why then does she know the water manipulation technique, too?

87
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,810
Because this water manipulation technique is fake!

88
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Fake? That's right.

89
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,500
Right. It's fake.

90
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,200
I don't know how this mister controlled it.

91
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
But I know that it was just like some street performance magical technique.

92
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,300
If everyone doesn't believe me, you can come up here and give it a try.

93
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:10,270
Anyone in this palace hall can control this ball of water as long as you stand right here.

94
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,990
Who wants to give it a try?

95
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,600
Stop testing.

96
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,200
What happened in front of us has proven that His Majesty is the true Xuanyuan Min.

97
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Your Majesty is wise.

98
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,490
Your Majesty is wise.

99
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,000
Deep Water will be prosperous!

100
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
How dare you, evil person!

101
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,000
You actually dared to pretend to be from the Xuanyuan royal clan?

102
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,400
- Prime Minister...
- I almost fell for your trick!

103
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,200
Take him away!

104
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,900
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!

105
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,400
I really am Xuanyuan Min! I really am Xuanyuan Min!

106
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,300
I really am Xuanyuan Min!

107
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,800
Your Majesty,

108
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,960
I've delayed your wedding.

109
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,500
I deserve to die.

110
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,500
Today is an celebratory day.

111
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
I'm pardoning your crime.

112
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,400
Have I delayed your auspicious hour?

113
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,500
It's 12 p.m.!

114
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,400
Your Majesty, it's now the auspicious hour.

115
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,400
May Your Majesty continue with your wedding ceremony.

116
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,190
Submit the marshal's seal!

117
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,590
Leave.

118
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:13,850
Starting at this time today, Deep Water's army of 150,000 will be under the command of King and Queen.

119
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,110
Reporting!

120
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,790
Military report!

121
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,510
The cavalry army of Heaven Fiend Nation has attacked us.

122
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,600
They have arrived at the city gates!

123
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,990
- What?
- Report!

124
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,020
The garrison... The garrison has started an uprising within the city!

125
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,600
What? The garrison has rebelled?

126
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,700
Qi Zhen, you're planning to usurp the throne!

127
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,430
Capture him!

128
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,290
- Kill!
- Kill!

129
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,010
Aren't you going to hurry and escape?

130
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,380
He has set up an escape-proof trap.

131
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,530
Even if I run, I might not be able to escape out of this palace hall.

132
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,280
Remember what I told you.

133
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,930
Once I call you "bitch," immediately run away.

134
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,450
Here.

135
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,720
Qi-Qi Zhen, you're rebelling?

136
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,850
Wrong. I'm rectifying the chaos and bringing back order.

137
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,950
Give me the marshal's seal.

138
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,980
Bitch!

139
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,060
Bitch, you are indeed a spy sent by the traitor Qi Zhen.

140
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,920
You—

141
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,300
Good daughter, I wasn't wrong to dote on you.

142
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,400
It's time to make a closure.

143
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,530
Kill him.

144
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,670
Child, no one can give you wealth and splendor.

145
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,150
No one can also care about your life or death.

146
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,030
Only you can help yourself.

147
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:41,250
This royal throne is indeed not comfortable at all.

148
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,400
Kill him!

149
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,140
I'm telling you to kill him!

150
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,780
Kill him!

151
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,570
You actually cut through my clothing?

152
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,990
Zi'er, you...

153
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,540
Listen very well. I'm not your Zi'er.

154
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm Fuyao from the Mystic Black Section of Mt. Mystic Soul.

155
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,180
Mt. Mystic Soul?

156
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,240
Mystic Black Section? Fuyao?

157
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,450
Imperial Guards, listen! The tiger tally is in my hand.

158
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,500
Kill this pair of fake king and fake queen!

159
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,710
What?

160
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,740
Are you all disobeying a military order?

161
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,870
Whoever kills them will be heavily rewarded!

162
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,110
Wait a minute!

163
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,470
Traitor Qi Zhen, do you have problems with your eyes?

164
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,320
The real marshal's seal is here.

165
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,420
- Men!
- Yes!

166
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,380
Arrest this traitor who tried to kill his king!

167
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,410
[Capital Kun]

168
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,420
Open the city gates!

169
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,220
- Who fired that arrow?
- Me!

170
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,150
That was Prime Minister's reinforcement army.

171
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,520
Spreading Prime Minister's order, close the city gates.

172
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,300
Gather all military strength to resist any soldiers from entering.

173
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,030
Those who disobey will be executed!

174
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,790
Fire!

175
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,300
Marquis, if we fight like this, we won't be able to hold on that long.

176
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,240
Even if we won't be able to hold them off, we still have to!

177
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,150
As long as we are alive, the city lives!

178
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,860
If its citizens die, the city dies! Attack!

179
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,040
Mister,

180
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,730
why am I here?

181
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,680
I locked you in here.

182
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,070
Why?

183
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,570
Because I want to tell you a story.

184
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:22,540
I fear that you won't be able to hear it because it's to noisy outside.

185
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,850
Do you still remember that older brother neighbor that you mentioned last time?

186
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,460
What about him?

187
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,840
You said that his family suddenly moved away.

188
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,540
I instead know a different ending.

189
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,750
Do you want to hear it?

190
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,010
This ending is...

191
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:58,750
that family died overnight.

192
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,310
But that older brother lived.

193
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:08,210
He swore that one day,

194
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,370
he would seek revenge for his whole family.

195
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,160
He kept gathering information.

196
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,510
Finally, he learned about the whereabouts of his enemy.

197
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:28,360
Guess if this enemy has a daughter,

198
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,910
who was born on the 3rd day of the 3rd month, the day of Double Third Festival.

199
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,480
She loves to eat the brightly red shrimp balls of Pleasing Wind Restaurant.

200
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,520
She loves the camelia during winter nights the most.

201
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,640
I just knew that I was right.

202
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,240
Older Brother Yue, you are Older Brother Yue, right?

203
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,230
It's not important who I am.

204
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,750
What's important is that your father...

205
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,250
is my enemy.

206
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:25,780
Listen. Your father...

207
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,390
led 400,000 people to rebel and is killing people.

208
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,530
He clearly knew that a lot of people would die because of this,

209
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,490
all because he wants to be the king of Deep Water Nation.

210
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,230
You're lying...

211
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,620
Even if he has to personally kill his sworn brother... !

212
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,440
No. No!

213
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,990
You're lying. It wasn't like that!

214
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,780
You don't know.

215
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,690
It wasn't like that.

216
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,130
You heard everything very clearly that day.

217
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,360
You know very well what is true.

218
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,140
Don't. Don't.

219
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:16,510
It's now time to make your father pay for everything that he did.

220
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,300
I beg you...

221
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,160
Don't...

222
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,380
Older Brother Yue...

223
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,110
Don't.

224
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,000
Get up.

225
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,570
Stop.

226
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,070
Stop?

227
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,880
Such bold words, little child.

228
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,350
Today, I will make her blood splatter all over Deep Nation.

229
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,660
Let her go.

230
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,330
What?

231
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,550
Can't bear to lose her?

232
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,770
I long noticed you two exchanging romantic gazes.

233
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,450
My guess was right.

234
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,040
Your target is me.

235
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,900
As long as you let her go, I'll promise you anything.

236
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,360
Really?

237
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,400
If you had known that it will end like this, why go through so many hardships?

238
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,320
Don't mind me! Quickly kill him!

239
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:28,760
Destroy your martial arts skills and abdicate the throne.

240
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,960
Don't. Don't.

241
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,300
Don't.

242
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,550
Do it.

243
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,780
Don't! Don't!

244
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,440
Reporting!

245
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,130
Informing Your Highness. Prefect Xiping Gao Song has allied with Deep Water royal family.

246
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,770
He is preparing to join forces with Zhang Henian to attack Qi Zhen.

247
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,290
Prince Assist, looks like we must send out an army to reinforce them.

248
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,170
Dispatch an army?

249
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,430
Qi Zhen now has no chance of winning.

250
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:44,040
If I dispatch my army, won't I be involving myself in this mess?

251
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,920
Spread my decree. Withdraw!

252
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,850
Godfather!

253
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,090
- Godfather.
- What is the military situation?

254
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,940
The army of Heaven Fiend Nation got hindered outside Glorious Qilin Gate.

255
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,790
Zhangsun Pingrong never appeared at all.

256
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:59,880
The garrison army inside the city also got subdued by Zhang Henian.

257
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,300
What about the Xiping Army?

258
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,580
That fence-sitter Prefect Xiping must have switched sides a long time ago.

259
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,190
Heaven wants to kill me, but I insist on living on.

260
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,700
Gather our men!

261
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,180
Godfather, where are you still going?

262
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,360
Sweet District.

263
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,020
The only thing we can do now is to leave Capital Kun first.

264
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,020
Remember that Sweet District is my territory.

265
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,910
I still have a backup move there.

266
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:45,320
Retreat first before planning our next move.

267
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,430
Assist me up!

268
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,260
Did you arrange this?

269
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,340
Look at me!

270
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:28,960
Prime Minister, where are you rushing to go to?

271
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,020
There are still matters here that haven't been resolved.

272
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:42,780
In the end, I actually fell for a doctor's trick.

273
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,000
Tell me. Who are you working for?

274
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,900
Zhang Henian?

275
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,910
Or that fake Xuanyuan Min?

276
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,660
Neither.

277
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,000
I am Heir Apparent Wenyi's man.

278
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:21,690
Have you never thought that maybe Heir Apparent Wenyi's descendants have not all died?

279
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:27,540
They will come back one day to seek revenge from you.

280
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,700
Alike.

281
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,970
You look very much like him.

282
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,850
What about him?

283
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,240
You, too?

284
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:55,440
Do you know how many times I almost couldn't endure it and almost killed you?

285
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,580
Do you know how many times I had to help you even if I knew that your crimes are unpardonable?

286
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,370
Of course, you didn't know.

287
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:10,930
You only knew that slandering Heir Apparent for rebellion would make Xuanyuan Ren treat you as a trusted aide.

288
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,450
You only knew that once Heir Apparent was dead, you'd be able to obtain the Dragon Scales Armor.

289
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,360
Am I right?

290
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:25,760
You don't know what I had given just to continue living.

291
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:34,120
You don't know how much effort I spent just to find him.

292
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,700
All these are unimportant.

293
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,290
Now, you only need to know one thing.

294
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:50,740
That is... you... deserve... to... die!

295
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,370
Okay.

296
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:04,970
Let us end everything here then.

297
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,540
You do it.

298
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:03,830
When I woke up this morning, they were all still alive.

299
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,470
In an instant, lives are now in misery and suffering.

300
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:24,750
Yuan Bao, you achieved merit for defending the nation.

301
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,810
What did he say?

302
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:36,650
He said... you are the...

303
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,200
bravest person he has ever seen.

304
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,560
We're finally able to preserve your kingdom.

305
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,240
This isn't my kingdom.

306
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,520
Lian'er!

307
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,850
Lian'er! Lian'er! Lian'er!

308
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,730
My good daughter... Are you alright?

309
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,070
Look... You're hurt. Let's wipe it.

310
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,830
- I'm fine.
- It's my fault for arriving late.

311
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,200
Let's go.

312
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,900
Mother, where are we going?

313
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,280
Leave this palace. Leave this rotten palace.

314
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,810
I initially planned to end my life here,

315
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,340
but it's different now.

316
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,860
You're back now. It's different, daughter.

317
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,610
We can't stay here anymore.

318
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,180
Let's go. I'll take you away.

319
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,760
Mother!

320
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,440
I got it.

321
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,020
It's because you're hurt, right?

322
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,900
That's all right. Let me carry you.

323
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,300
Come. Come!

324
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,180
I...

325
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,460
I can't leave.

326
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,620
Lian'er, why?

327
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,870
Because...

328
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,690
Because...

329
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,480
she's not your daughter.

330
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:23,570
Your daughter, Lian'er, is already dead.

331
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,750
What did you hear and see that day in Megrez?

332
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,350
Tell me.

333
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,000
I don't remember...

334
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,900
I don't remember anything.

335
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,950
I don't remember. I don't remember anything.

336
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:02,290
- I don't remember...
- Xuanyuan Min, let her go!

337
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,390
I don't remember.

338
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,140
I don't remember anything.

339
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,900
- I heard... that day...
- I don't remember...

340
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,530
was similar to today.

"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

342
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,730
♫ What do you know? ♫

343
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,620
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

344
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,390
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

345
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,720
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

346
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,240
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

347
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,250
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

348
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,390
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

349
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,720
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

350
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,820
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

351
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,590
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

352
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,860
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

353
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,380
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

354
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,250
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

355
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,600
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

356
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:51,510
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

357
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,100
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

358
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,290
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

359
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,030
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

360
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:08,060
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

361
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,180
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

362
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:16,380
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

363
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,440
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

364
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,180
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

365
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,720
♫ Have someone's company♫

366
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,870
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

367
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:34,050
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

368
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,870
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

369
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,850
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

370
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,810
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

371
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:48,100
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

372
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,670
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

373
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:59,180
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫
