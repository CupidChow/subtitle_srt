Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,100
The Phoenix Lead Pavilion swears our allegiance to you until death and to protect Plough.

51
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,000
Quickly rise.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Technically speaking, you're my cousin.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,400
You are the first friend I've met here in Plough.

54
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,000
When there's no one around, just speak casually.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Stop with those "Your Majesty" and "your subject" things. Okay?

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
- This?
- Listen to me.

57
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
Okay. I'll remember then.

58
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,540
That... We were still unable to find Folian.

59
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,200
I heard that when she escaped out of the palace,

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,600
she was in a crazy state with messy hair and a dirty face.

61
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,950
She probably won't be able to run that far from here.

62
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,400
Just send more people to find her.

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,350
Yes.

64
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,700
To talk about it, she also is quite pitiful.

65
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,840
How will we handle the remaining allies of Folian then?

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,580
Just follow the rules of the inner palace.

67
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm not very knowledgeable about it.

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,700
- You decide.
- Yes.

69
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,200
Wait!

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,200
What kind of punishment will those remnant allies suffer?

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Based on the laws of Plough, it's the Combing Death Penalty.

72
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,000
Spread my word and remove those Combing Death Penalties.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,900
But?

74
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,400
There are so many people who have died here in Plough.

75
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,700
No blood can be shed anymore.

76
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,200
I'll go do it now.

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,740
Now that you've become the queen of Plough,

78
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,100
how does it feel for thousands of citizens bowing before you when you look out into the world?

79
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,370
Just wait here.

80
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
- Let me tell you.
- Yes?

81
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,400
Jumping up and down up on it is more comfortable than sitting down.

82
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
I was thinking before

83
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,400
that you tell me the one sitting in this throne had to be cautious and careful every day just to preserve the power.

84
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,630
How tiring is that?

85
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,200
But they are like enchanted by some curse,

86
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,500
they'd rather die from exhaustion and continue sitting on this throne.

87
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,110
Why?

88
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,400
Is the view up here different?

89
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
Let me ask you then. What did you see?

90
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:12,080
I saw foul wind, a rain of blood, and countless responsibilities.

91
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,900
I feel that this seat should be given to capable ones for the curse of power to be broken.

92
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,400
Humans would always be painstakingly obsessed with obtaining and move forward because of it.

93
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,200
They hardly realize that what they will obtain has been near them all this time.

94
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,600
You never wanted royal power, wealth, or fame,

95
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,700
but you have no choice but to accept the arrangement of the heavens.

96
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,720
I want you to forever become an open, upright, and carefree person,

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,800
just like the first time I saw you.

98
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,000
I want you to know that maybe life is indeed vast and long,

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
but there is some persistence and memory that will never change.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,800
For ten years, twenty years, or a lifetime,

101
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
it will forever be the first day.

102
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,500
Her Majesty has issued a decree.

103
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,600
The decree reads, Fuyao is initially a person from the mountains.

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,700
She has no heart for power, no interest in being a queen, and has no talent to govern a state and maintain its peace.

105
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,780
Being blessed by the heavens and earth,

106
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,200
she was able to obtain the throne that has been passed on in the Feng clan of Plough for generations.

107
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,600
Plough has always been a crucial state of the Five Regions.

108
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,700
Its governance is also very important for the other nations.

109
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,400
How can I bear such a huge duty by myself?

110
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,600
Starting today, I'm removing the sole governance of Plough by the queen.

111
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Talented subjects will be chosen who will serve as censors.

112
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,400
We will form a 7-man state body that will participate in governance, in cooperation with the five bureaus,

113
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,100
mutually assisting and existing, managing state affairs together.

114
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,800
That's all!

115
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,310
It wasn't easy for you to be a queen, and you just yielded it like that to others?

116
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,800
Power and position have never been my desire.

117
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,600
What I can do is let capable talents bring blessings to the citizens.

118
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,800
I was even hoping that you'd grant me a high official position.

119
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,600
You're really not a friend.

120
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,100
- You still want to be a government official?
- Yes.

121
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,800
That depends if you have the talent for it.

122
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Seriously, I can't even go through the backdoor.

123
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,400
Your Majesty, the guests you've invited have arrived.

124
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,600
- Let them in.
- Yes.

125
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,300
- Go and call Wuji to come here.
- Okay...

126
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,630
Grand Teacher.

127
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,210
Do you know where this is?

128
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,550
This is the cultivation place where ancestral teacher Chang Qingzi trained.

129
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,300
This place is very mystical.

130
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,870
It gathers all the spiritual energies of the whole Five Regions.

131
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,000
It is also Firmament's... Firmament's restricted area.

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,430
Do you know why I brought you here?

133
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,480
This lotus has detected that the female demon will be breaking her fourth seal soon.

134
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,830
She's getting nearer

135
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,610
and all of us can't do anything about it.

136
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,800
Only you can destroy her.

137
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,090
Look.

138
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,150
Thousands of years ago, Five Regions was in a great war.

139
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,320
People were plunged into great misery.

140
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,850
Everything started with Di Feitian.

141
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,040
It's Di Feitian.

142
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,570
Ancestral Teacher Chang Qingzi used the Mystic Spirit Leaf that can condense the energy that he has cultivated for a lifetime

143
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,240
to restrict the nascent spirit of Di Feitian and turned the tides around.

144
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,180
We should leave.

145
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:10,130
In the past, Chang Qingzi used the Mystic Spirit Leaf to defeat the rebel army.

146
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,540
We all thought that Di Feitian had lost and had surely died.

147
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,710
But who knew that some of his remnant blood coagulated to form the five-colored stone?

148
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,910
After thousands of years, if the female demon wearing the five-colored stone breaks the five seals,

149
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,850
he then will be able to be revived again.

150
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,510
By then, the world will be doomed.

151
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,430
Tell me, how can Firmament allow her to be alive?

152
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,900
That is?

153
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,620
I told you that you and Chang Qingzi are from a common origin.

154
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,950
You are the one predestined by his Mystic Spirit Leaf.

155
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,660
This is your bound fetter.

156
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:25,060
From the day that you were born, your whole life has had its destiny;

157
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:32,910
a destiny that is unalterable by you, me, and even Ancestral Teacher Chang Qingzi.

158
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:48,060
Chang Qingzi sacrificed his personal reluctance in exchange for thousands of years of peace in Five Regions.

159
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,380
Tell me. Do you think if he ever had any internal struggle and discontentment?

160
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,370
But he knew that since he had a power that's superior to others,

161
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,610
enjoyed a respected reputations that's beyond others,

162
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,600
he can only bear the important duty that ordinary people can't.

163
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,900
With the citizens of the Five Regions facing disaster,

164
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,400
he has no right to think about his personal interest.

165
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,020
A thousand years ago, the only person who could kill Di Feitian was Chang Qingzi.

166
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:25,720
And now, the only person who can stop Di Feitian... is you.

167
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,280
Do you think I couldn't see the whereabouts of the female demon?

168
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,760
Do you think I don't know about your selfish intentions?

169
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,690
Do you think that there can still be some best of both worlds method

170
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,660
that can both save the world and preserve the life of the female demon?

171
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,420
On one side is that female demon.

172
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,500
On the other, all lives in this world.

173
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,580
If you don't choose to kill one person, that means that you choose to kill millions of people!

174
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,500
Are you going to destroy the whole Five Regions just because of her?

175
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,320
Older Sister Fuyao!

176
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,490
Quickly tell me. How did you suddenly become the queen of Plough?

177
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,950
I heard that you even found your real parents.

178
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,420
Hurry... quickly tell me.

179
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,000
Fuyao is now the queen of Plough.

180
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,560
So many people are looking. Give her some respect.

181
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,640
Just ask her about it later.

182
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,120
Zhan Beiye, when did you become so gentle and considerate?

183
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,880
Did I?

184
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,730
My Fifth Older Brother has always been warm and gentle.

185
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,020
You just didn't know.

186
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,220
Heaven Fiend congratulates Your Majesty Queen for ascending to the throne.

187
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,620
Heaven Fiend is willing to form an alliance of trade and reciprocity.

188
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,590
To congratulate Your Majesty's ascension to the throne, the King of Heaven Fiend has prepared 72 kinds of gifts.

189
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,550
I hope you'll accept it happily.

190
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,200
Thank you then, King of Heaven Fiend.

191
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,760
I heard that someone disguised as me bluffed and deceived the people here in Plough.

192
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,650
Shouldn't Your Majesty arrest this person and punish her for her crimes?

193
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,790
Mr. Zong, long time no see.

194
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,620
The seals of the female demon are being removed one by one.

195
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,250
Once she has completely broken away from the binding of the seals, it will be the death of Five Regions!

196
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,090
You have no more time.

197
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:27,330
Wuji, you must kill her.

198
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,470
Only you can. It must be you!

199
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,400
Grand Teacher, why?

200
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,450
How come it's me?

201
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,260
You could have chosen to tell this to someone else,

202
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,290
but why must you tell me?

203
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,500
Why must you allow me do such a thing?

204
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,000
Because this is the ill fate that you and that female demon are destined to have!

205
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,150
A destined ill-fate!

206
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,610
Are you going to destroy the whole Five Regions just for her?

207
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,460
You have not much time left.

208
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,540
Kill her! Kill her!

209
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,160
Crown Prince!

210
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,550
Crown Prince, the important guests are here.

211
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,950
Older Sis Fuyao is asking that you quickly go there!

212
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,830
Okay.

213
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,520
You go first.

214
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,030
I'll follow in a while.

215
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,340
Crown Prince, are you all right?

216
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,230
I'm fine.

217
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,740
Okay then. Quickly follow.

218
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,720
It's so beautiful. It looks good.

219
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,960
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

220
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,800
How long has it been?

221
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,060
You still eventually gave Qi Yun the Dragon Scale Armor.

222
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,710
That item is basically useless to me.

223
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,530
I'm asking about you.

224
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,510
I've noticed since earlier that your breathing isn't smooth and your inner energy is restricted.

225
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,690
That doesn't happen in just one or two days.

226
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,800
When exactly did it start?

227
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:59,110
If you don't make a move, who else can hurt me?

228
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,360
You!

229
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,530
Don't waste your energy.

230
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,690
This isn't an illness or an internal injury.

231
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,450
You won't be able to help me.

232
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,150
Could it be Firmament?

233
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,450
The Truth Leaf Reprimand, Grand Teacher is already lenient with me.

234
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,040
No matter how deep your inner energy is, it's no match against the magical techniques of Firmament.

235
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,590
Do you still need me to remind you of that?

236
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,260
I know.

237
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,930
If it's really like what I'm thinking,

238
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,630
then aren't you giving out too much?

239
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,500
What are you thinking?

240
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,380
Prosperity is the start of decay.

241
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,370
We both know that this peace in front of us now was obtained in exchange for a bloody battle.

242
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,310
But as long as we're able to obtain a bit of peace,

243
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,060
even if we have to use a lot of darkness just to get that one bit of peace,

244
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,970
it's still worth it for us to do our best to achieve it.

245
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,430
[Astute Time Palace]

246
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,140
Good morning.

247
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,610
Why are you looking at me?

248
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,840
Can't get enough.

249
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,320
I'll let you look at me for a lifetime then.

250
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,130
You're the one who said that.

251
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,580
What did I say?

252
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,350
You're now the queen of Plough.

253
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,520
You should know that a ruler never jokes around.

254
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:34,400
I remember very well every word and phrase that you've said.

255
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,370
I don't remember.

256
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,380
Accompany me to return to Megrez to see Emperor Father.

257
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,690
Reporting!

258
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,660
Urgent report from Megrez!

259
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,790
Urgent report from the Imperial City.

260
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,510
Prince Virtue that disappeared for three months suddenly appeared at the border of Megrez on the sixth of the month.

261
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,510
An army of 300,000 men immediately gathered.

262
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,330
They have strong soldiers and horses, adequate food supply.

263
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,390
The number of their army is still increasing at this time.

264
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,600
Based on our information, Prince Virtue has contacted his old subordinates within the Imperial City.

265
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,180
At the same time, he has won over several royal relatives and despotic gentries.

266
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,370
Without spending any men, he was able to conquer a thousand li of land via negotiations.

267
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,050
Prince Virtue is leading the whole army and is pressing on our borders.

268
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,120
The arrow has been fitted to the string, just accumulating strength to take off.

269
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,990
He seems to be aiming for a comeback and is pressing in on the Imperial City.

270
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,280
Speed has always been Prince Virtue's best tactics.

271
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,440
He can conquer in a sweeping manner and is an expert at traveling lightly and silently to set up ambushes.

272
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,100
If we allow their army to keep progressing,

273
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,410
the defending army will surely get defeated in less than ten days.

274
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,520
The survival of the Imperial City will then be determined overnight.

275
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,830
Currently, General Youlei and Prime Minister Duan are the ones heading the state affairs.

276
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,530
But because they still haven't come up with a good strategy,

277
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,450
the whole Imperial Court is enveloped with fear.

278
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,100
This matter is urgent.

279
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,570
We all must return to the Imperial City immediately to provide support.

280
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:58,610
We'll patiently wait for Mister's great strategy that can open up a path, gain us victory, eliminate the danger, and return peace.

281
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,150
There's trouble in Megrez.

282
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,000
I must quickly go back.

283
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,570
I'll accompany you.

284
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,820
No, you just ascended to the throne.

285
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,440
I can't let you—

286
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,930
Didn't you ask me to accompany you back to Megrez to see your Emperor Father?

287
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,560
I'm agreeing to it.

288
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,050
Okay.

289
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,610
The new reign in Heaven Fiend has just been established.

290
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,320
I can't say that our armaments are adequate,

291
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,190
but having one more soldier, horse, and weapon will be a great help.

292
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,500
As long as you, Zhangsun Wuji, need it, they are ready anytime.

293
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,340
Thank you in advance.

294
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,890
Okay.

295
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,310
Older Sister Fuyao, you two must be careful.

296
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,190
When we return, we'll quickly mobilize the army.

297
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,590
You must tell us if you need any help.

298
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,200
We'll immediately go there.

299
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,640
Don't worry.

300
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,520
With Wuji around, nothing bad will happen.

301
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,390
Older Sis Fuyao, are you really not taking me with you?

302
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,930
Just stay here and be good.

303
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,920
Wait for our return.

304
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,700
I can't be of any help for what will happen from here on, either.

305
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,400
You two take good care of yourselves.

306
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,930
Is that giving us blessings?

307
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,570
We'll accept it then.

308
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,840
Everyone, we'll take our leave.

309
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,750
- Take care.
- Take care.

310
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,580
Everyone, don't worry.

311
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,730
I'm here to deliver a warmer for Your Highness.

312
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,390
The air is cold near the window.

313
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,510
May Your Highness take good care of your health.

314
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:54,590
Your Highness, Prince Virtue has sent men to escort you out of the palace.

315
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,230
What did you say?

316
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,410
Replying to Your Highness, I was sent by Prince Virtue to fetch you.

317
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,410
I don't know what you're saying. Leave.

318
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,920
Your Highness, I was really sent by Prince.

319
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,180
I don't care who sent you.

320
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,500
Stop trying to test me.

321
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,690
Now, I don't trust anyone.

322
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,420
Your Highness, please look.

323
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,920
Your Highness, do you recognize this item?

324
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,530
Jialang? How come you have this?

325
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,290
Replying to Your Highness, it was Prince who sent me to deliver that to you.

326
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:59,000
Jialang? It's really you.

327
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,670
Where is he?

328
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,460
Prince is currently doing well.

329
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,760
He especially ordered me and other people to sneak into the palace,

330
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,190
then find an opportunity to rescue you out of here.

331
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,940
Your Highness, you must believe me.

332
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,030
"My heart isn't a stone."

333
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,720
"It can't be transferred."

334
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,660
"My heart isn't a mat that you can just roll up."

335
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,830
Were those...

336
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,470
taught by him?

337
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,490
Prince said that if I recite these to you,

338
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,770
you surely would believe me.

339
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,170
Currently, all the guards of this Pure Mist Palace Hall has been deployed someplace else.

340
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,850
Chances come and go very fast.

341
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,680
If we miss this moment, it will be very hard for you to go out of the palace.

342
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,300
Where are we going?

343
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,560
To the north bank of the river. Prince has set up a garrison there, with his sword pointing at the Imperial City.

344
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,820
A war will be starting soon.

345
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,270
What did you say?

346
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,030
Zhangsun Jia is rebelling?

347
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,520
Your Highness, don't you know?

348
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,960
He's serious.

349
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,730
He was able to do what he promised.

350
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,720
You will know about the details once you see Prince.

351
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,070
Presently, it's better that we hurry in leaving the palace.

352
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,640
With Prince Virtue rebelling,

353
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,270
who in the government will be facing him?

354
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,390
Do you know who Zhangsun Jiong sends?

355
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,970
I heard that Crown Prince will be returning soon.

356
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,500
Wuji?

357
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,910
He's coming back?

358
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,960
Yes.

359
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,670
No, I can't go with you.

360
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,000
No,

361
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,410
I'm going to find Wuji.

362
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,340
I have to tell him.

363
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,650
I must tell him! Must tell him!

364
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,280
Your Highness! Your Highness!

365
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,690
The rebel army is coming?

366
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,050
Yes.

367
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,460
The military report three days ago stated that the rebel army is still in Ze County, 200 li from here.

368
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,030
In this early morning, they are only just 30 li from the city, just separated from us by a river.

369
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,230
100,000 advancing army that are determined to kill the enemy.

370
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,040
I fear that...

371
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,900
I fear that they will attack our city gates anytime now.

372
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,500
Informing Your Majesty, I heard that the rebel army was swift in their advance.

373
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,870
Along the way, they didn't rob or kill

374
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,230
and instead distributed provisions to earn the citizens' support.

375
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,790
Their wolf-like ambitions are so obvious.

376
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:31,570
From the looks of it now, actively attacking or waiting for the rebel army to make their move each have their pros and cons.

377
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,260
As to what to decide, may Your Majesty guide us.

378
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,040
Wuji should be back soon.

379
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,480
Quickly send word that Mister is back.

380
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,750
Yes.

381
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,130
After the day when Prince Virtue escaped,

382
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,140
His Majesty sent a huge number of people to search and capture him,

383
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,970
but Prince Virtue was well-prepared.

384
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,830
There was no news about him at all. Only early this month did he suddenly appear.

385
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,800
For 300,000 men to gather at the borders, that can't happen overnight.

386
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,380
How come you all just noticed it now?

387
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,540
The scout before said that Prince Virtue was spotted in Kangzhou City.

388
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,440
Everyone then went to the direction of Kangzhou City to search and didn't pay attention to the northeast border.

389
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,930
How many vassal rulers and royal relatives have already defected?

390
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,360
What is the detailed number of feudal nobility that's involved here?

391
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,380
How much money and food supplies do they have in their fief?

392
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,640
This—

393
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,390
What? You are unable to say it or unwilling to say it?

394
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,260
I fear that the situation is worse than you've imagined.

395
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,730
Greetings, Your Highness Crown Prince.

396
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,620
You're finally back.

397
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,530
Your Majesty has been waiting to see you.

398
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,130
Quickly go. I'll wait for you here outside.

399
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,280
Once you've met with your Emperor Father, just come back to find me.

400
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,000
Strictly spread my order.

401
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,860
Fuyao is my woman and an important guest of Megrez.

402
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,780
No one must make things difficult for her.

403
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,700
Yes.

404
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,170
Lead the way.

405
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,780
Emperor Father, I came back late.

406
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,750
Miss Fuyao.

407
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,390
Who are you?

408
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,360
Empress Kindness is asking for you.

409
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,340
Empress wants to see me?

410
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,110
Yes. I am a senior maidservant from Pure Mist Palace Hall.

411
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,590
I've been working here for twenty years already.

412
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,410
When you entered here last time, I've also served you.

413
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,680
Look closely.

414
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,880
Do you still remember me?

415
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,820
Since it is Empress that's calling for me,

416
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,850
you should have an imperial order from Pure Mist Palace Hall.

417
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,600
Your Highness didn't want to alarm the palace.

418
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,350
Something bad happened?

419
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,070
You will know everything once you've met with Her Highness.

420
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,570
I heard that—

421
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,170
Look at that precious medicinal pill inside that oven behind you.

422
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,220
I've been trying to concoct if for more than ten years.

423
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,910
Today, I'm about to succeed.

424
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,640
I heard that Prince Virtue's rebel army has occupied the north bank of the river.

425
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,480
His advancing troop is around 100,000 men.

426
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,700
Based on how Prince Virtue manages his army, he might attack anytime.

427
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,480
Wuji,

428
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,690
that box of tea leaves over there is the dongbai for this year.

429
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,770
Spring tea is the most aromatic and softest.

430
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:32,040
I especially asked them to pick some and leave you a box.

431
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,200
Go take a look.

432
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:51,380
I'll give the imperial seal, the commander's seal, and the decree all to you.

433
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,500
I'll give you all the armed forces and the state affairs of Megrez.

434
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,110
Your father is old now.

435
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,540
I'll leave all the honor or disgrace and good health in the later part of my life in your hands, too.

436
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,790
Emperor Father is not old.

437
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:21,420
The world and the Five Regions still need Emperor Father to look after.

438
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,710
My health is declining.

439
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,090
Wuji,

440
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:42,550
only to let you handle the warfare will I be at ease.

441
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,190
I understand.

442
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,570
I will do my best to lighten your burden.

443
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,150
"I'm still young and beautiful but the emperor already lost his interest in me."
( a poem from Li Bai.)

444
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,960
"The most ruthless is the imperial family."

445
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,240
He is your Royal Uncle.

446
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,960
But now he is a traitor to the country.

447
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,930
Do you clearly understand how to handle him?

448
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,750
The imperial family is the most important.

449
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,830
The emperor and his subjects come first, blood ties go second.

450
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,900
Yes!

451
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,690
The crime of treason is unforgivable.

452
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,430
Good!

453
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,560
I am leaving now to make preparations.

454
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,500
Fuyao?

455
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:41,120
Did you bring that girl back with you this time?

456
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,690
Yes.

457
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,600
I am guilty.

458
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,190
I lied to you before.

459
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,200
I secretly saved her.

460
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,600
Now I brought her back so that we can apologize and ask for your punishment.

461
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,310
I hope Emperor Father won't be too harsh on her.

462
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,070
Why do I want to give her trouble?

463
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,730
I'm your Emperor Father and you are my son.

464
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,620
I also want to see you to be with the girl you love

465
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,100
and that both of you can stay together.

466
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,820
I did oppose in the past.

467
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,750
But I had no choice.

468
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,520
Ministers at the imperial court wouldn't allow that, either.

469
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,250
No commoner girl can just ascend to the position of Crown Princess.

470
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,010
If this matter caused a calamity,

471
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,290
not only you would be in trouble, she also could be implicated, too.

472
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,190
- But Emperor Father—
- I know.

473
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,660
All those mishaps out there, they told me all about it.

474
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,790
I heard she always stood by you and endured all the sufferings with you, right?

475
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,570
To a girl who is so faithful to you,

476
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,780
you have to cherish truthfully.

477
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:07,920
Of course, I'm happy to see you and the girl you love being together.

478
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,400
Thank you, Emperor Father.

479
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,750
Good!

480
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,330
Good!

481
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,050
Go now.

482
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,460
I'll take my leave.

483
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,860
I am guilty.

484
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,360
Greetings, Your Ladyship Empress.

485
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,790
You are now the new Queen of Plough.

486
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,520
Performing such a solemn ceremony,

487
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,770
I'm afraid that I won't even deserve it very soon.

488
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,670
You are Wuji's mother.

489
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,340
No matter how big a ceremony is, you are entitled to it.

490
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,230
It looks like a girl who is able to muddle the royal families of the three nations,

491
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,160
and can make my son Wuji to commit himself totally

492
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,950
should be someone who looks just like you.

493
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,440
Wuji, how is he?

494
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,530
Wuji is right here at the palace.

495
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,330
Why not ask him yourself?

496
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,160
No.

497
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,100
Today, I invited you here because I have a very urgent matter to entrust to you.

498
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,280
What is the matter?

499
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,190
You have to stop Wuji. Stop him from killing one person.

500
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,750
To kill whom?

501
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,300
Prince Virtue, Zhangsun Jia.

502
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,430
You want me to prevent Wuji from killing a traitor to his country? Why?

503
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,640
Because he is...

504
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,790
Wuji's Royal Uncle.

505
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,560
Even if he's his Royal Uncle, he's also a traitor.

506
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,030
Moreover, this is a state affair related to the Megrez. I can't interfere.

507
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,500
No, only you...

508
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,130
Only you can stop him.

509
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,800
Empress, I know you and Prince Virtue have had an unusual relationship.

510
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,560
It's just that it's really a state affair.

511
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,070
I—

512
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,470
Do you think I do this for myself?

513
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,990
I'm doing it for Wuji.

514
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,860
Wuji was separated from me since childhood and he's always very stubborn.

515
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,960
I fear that he won't listen to me.

516
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:20,820
Now, only you may be able to stop him.

517
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,970
Prince Virtue has committed treason, but it isn't his true intention.

518
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,900
Whether win or lose, Wuji shouldn't have to shoulder it.

519
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,770
Prince Virtue can be killed in many other ways,

520
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,490
but he can't be killed by Wuji.

521
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,720
What is the real reason?

522
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,340
I can't. I can't let Wuji live with regrets the rest of his life.

523
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,850
On behalf of Empress Mother, I apologize to you, Emperor Father.

524
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,890
That matter...

525
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,760
I knew it all along.

526
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,290
Wuji, there are things...

527
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,670
that shouldn't be shouldered by you.

528
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,900
But you—

529
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,000
When set against the dignity of the Megrez imperial family,

530
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,390
and the peace among the Five Regions,

531
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,700
her betrayal and alienation...

532
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,420
don't matter much.

533
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,430
But do you... really not mind?

534
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,790
Like a knife in the heart,

535
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,460
as long as you don't pull it out,

536
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,510
you won't see the blood.

537
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,660
The pain lingered.

538
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,120
It would gradually be forgotten as time passes.

539
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:34,960
I... should thank her.

540
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,970
After all, for the Megrez Empire and me,

541
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:54,820
she gave us an outstanding... Crown Prince.

542
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:07,630
With the dignity of being the Empress, I beg you.

543
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,930
Empress, you must not!

544
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,690
Promise me, okay?

545
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,840
After all... After all, this will be Wuji's choice.

546
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,560
I can't hinder him from making his choice.

547
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,460
Even if his choice is wrong?

548
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,040
Even if his choice is wrong!

549
