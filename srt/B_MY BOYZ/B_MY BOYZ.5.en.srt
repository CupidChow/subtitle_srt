MC DEX: 13 vs. 13

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,066
MC DEX: Team Death Match.

3
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:05,499
MC DEX: The team chosen by the TOP IDOL

4
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:08,733
MC DEX: will all survive,
while the team not chosen

5
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,560
MC DEX: will all become
elimination candidates.

6
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,166
(After a fierce battle in the opening)
This is a very important song.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,433
(Love Killa that captivated MONSTA X)

8
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,576
(Stole his heart)

9
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:22,566
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Right
from the very beginning,

10
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,099
MONSTA X KIHYUN: I thought, 'Wow,
this one's going to work.'

11
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:27,833
(SHOOT OUT unleashed explosive energy)

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,720
(Finished with praise)
Good job, good job.

13
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:33,408
(First title song match ends)
13 vs. 13 Team Death Match.

14
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,399
(13 vs. 13 Team Death Match Round 2)
Up next is the second showdown.

15
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,433
The vocal match begins now.

16
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:45,312
('Spring Day' moved everyone with
heartfelt sincerity toward the fans)

17
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:52,533
(Praised as a professional singer)
Felt like a real pro. I really enjoyed it.

18
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,866
(And a collaboration offer to top it off)
You have such an amazing voice,

20
00:00:56,866 --> 00:01:00,033
(All praise for MY MONSTAZ's 'Spring Day')
so I'd love to work with you someday.

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,466
(MONSTA B lost in silence, with smiles gone)
Wow, they got praised that much.

22
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:05,566
It's really...

23
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,300
- Scary.
- Truly scary.

24
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:13,300
KANG JUNSEONG: Out of all the rehearsals
and run-throughs they've done so far,

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,533
KANG JUNSEONG: today seems like
their best performance so far.

26
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,999
PARK SECHAN: Our team seems to
have the advantage in vocal matches.

27
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:20,064
(A subtle tension fills the two teams)
Go for it.

28
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:21,184
JUNSEONG, JUNHYEOK, go for it.

29
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:22,022
You did well.

30
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:23,923
You really did an amazing job.

31
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:25,666
MC DEX: Okay, then.

32
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,633
(After the vocal match,)
MC DEX: MONSTA B will go second.

33
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,280
(the second performer MONSTA B)
MC DEX: Please come to the stage.

34
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,666
JANG WON: I was a bit nervous,
but since our team was doing well,

35
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,966
JANG WON: I thought
we still had a chance.

36
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,199
MONSTA X KIHYUN: I'm really
curious about this team.

37
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,533
KANG JUNSEONG: Since we need to
make impact in single moments,

38
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:44,799
KANG JUNSEONG: I thought we
needed to be a bit more cold-headed.

39
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:48,490
Two, three.

40
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,107
- MONSTA B! We were beautiful.
- MONSTA B! We were beautiful.

41
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,966
KANG JUNSEONG: Hello, we're
'We Were Beautiful' team.

42
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,560
(KANG JUNSEONG)

43
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:00,730
(Haha)
Cute.

44
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:01,983
(Emphasizing again)
Cute.

45
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:04,384
(Hahaha)

46
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,433
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: I heard you
reinterpreted DAY6's original song.

47
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:14,266
('You Were Beautiful' DAY6's original song, conveying
sincere feelings of thanks and longing for a lost love)

48
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:18,333
(Breakup song nostalgically
recalling past love)

49
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:21,336
(Q. About reinterpretation approach)
How do you plan to reinterpret it,

50
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,666
and what do you want to express?

51
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,733
KANG JUNSEONG: Compared to original,
we wanted heavier, sadder atmosphere,

52
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,533
KANG JUNSEONG: so we simplified
instrument arrangements,

53
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,233
KANG JUNSEONG: and through the arrangement,
we tried to express ourselves more.

54
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:33,255
(Nodding)

55
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:34,888
(Proud)

56
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,433
(Frustrated)
The story...

57
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,000
(Should explain the story)
- No, explain... - Wait.

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,256
What are you two doing?

59
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
(Snap out of it, huh?)

60
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,779
(LIA KIM, JINHO)
Mom and Dad.

61
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,176
(MONSTA B's "parents" can't look away)

62
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:47,066
Oh my, oh my.

63
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,133
(A burning heart of a parent)
I'm so frustrated.

64
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,366
(MONSTA B's story?!)
They had storyline.

65
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,152
(Round 2 Competition D-17, MONSTA B Practice Room)
Alright, 'You Were Beautiful' team, please gather.

66
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,800
KANG JUNSEONG: Let's discuss
arrangement approach too.

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,152
Miss you.

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,744
(This doesn't mean restarting,
just lingering memories resurfacing)

69
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,024
It carries the meaning of 'I've
been missing you constantly.'

70
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:06,016
The lyrics remind me of that movie,
'On Your Wedding Day'.

71
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,584
(I know)
Senior PARK BOYOUNG.

72
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:08,700
Is that the right feeling?

73
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,566
JANG WON: The male lead goes to her
at the end and tells her everything.

74
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:16,416
(A story about going to
his first love's wedding)

75
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,122
(and saying what he wanted to say)
I wish you well.

76
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,240
Wishing you lots
and lots of happiness.

77
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:24,559
JANG WON: This song is quite famous,

78
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,166
JANG WON: but after looking
at the lyrics, I thought

79
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,700
JANG WON: we could
express it differently

80
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,466
JANG WON: and change the concept
based on the lyrical interpretation.

81
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:34,516
('You Were Beautiful', it feels like
there's nothing more to wish for)

82
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:36,333
(The moments only you gave me, they're
all gone now, but you were so beautiful)

83
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,600
(B:GINNER LI ZHIWEI getting inspired after hearing lyrics)
- Ah, I know. - This part changes here.

84
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,000
LI ZHIWEI: Here, it's finished.

85
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,966
(Here? = Chorus) (Understanding complete)
- Here, it's finished? - Yes, it's finished.

86
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,700
('You were so beautiful',
after the final chorus ends, boom)

87
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,166
LI ZHIWEI: The audience
might think the song is over,

88
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,766
LI ZHIWEI: but there's
a hidden final part.

89
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,900
JANG WON: With lingering attachment,
like 'Let me say one last word' in this feeling.

90
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:57,500
(The final hidden part completes the song's narrative)
- Yes, right. - Surprising.

91
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:00,296
(Already immersed in the song's final farewell)
-That's so... - Then I'll structure it like this.

92
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,366
(MONSTA B arrangement meeting)
- Nice to meet you. - Yes, nice to meet you.

93
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,800
(KWON TAEEUN / Music Director)
KWON TAEEUN: How should we approach this?

94
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,966
JANG WON: When I first heard this song
and saw the lyrics, what came to mind was

95
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,566
(Movie referenced for song concept: 'On Your Wedding Day')
the movie called 'On Your Wedding Day'.

96
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:14,700
- KWON TAEEUN: Is that the vibe you want?
- Exactly.

97
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:24,033
(So good)

98
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:25,728
(Let's sing)
1, 2.

99
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:33,333
(Building harmonies on
real-time arranged melodies)

100
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,433
(Continuous exclamations of admiration)

101
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:38,208
Ah, it's so good.

102
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,166
KWON TAEEUN: Since
you mentioned the movie,

103
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,400
KWON TAEEUN: that scene
popped right into my head.

104
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,933
KWON TAEEUN: That concept
seems really good.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,700
JANG WON: The music director gave
feedback saying 'The ideas are good',

106
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,900
KANG JUNSEONG: so I felt really good.

107
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,066
KANG JUNSEONG: Listening to our combined
voices and how the parts were distributed,

108
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,533
KANG JUNSEONG: we felt
our harmony matched well.

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
(Practices going smoothly
like well-matched harmonies)

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,266
(Mid-check)
Here come the pretty ones, the 'You Were Beautiful' Team.

111
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,966
- Hello, we're the 'We Were Beautiful' Team.
- Hello, we're the 'We Were Beautiful' Team.

112
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,888
(Masters satisfied)
- Beautiful. - Hello.

113
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:19,616
(Full of favoritism)
- Already beautiful. - So beautiful.

114
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,599
(Successful promotion of team name and song title)
Already beautiful.

115
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,666
YUJU: I feel like JUNSEONG's
going to do really well.

116
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:24,864
(Overflowing with charm)

117
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:29,866
(In this warm and friendly moment,
he's feeling nervous)

118
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:32,933
- JINHO: JANG WON, smile!
- Yes.

119
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,433
(Corners of mouth lifted
with all strength)

120
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:38,464
(Clearly nervous B:GINNER JANG WON)
Is there something specific we should focus on?

121
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:40,896
When we first heard that...

122
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,666
KIM JEONGHOON: JANG WON on
the vocal match team, we were a bit surprised.

123
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,433
Like, 'Wait, JANG WON?'

124
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,633
LIM JIHWAN: Honestly, as a 'You Were So Pretty'
team member, I never expected JANG WON.

125
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:51,366
CHOI YOHAN: I never expected
JANG WON went for vocal match.

126
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,799
PARK SECHAN: Actually in Round 1,
B:GINNER JANG WON

127
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:56,866
PARK SECHAN: showed
many vocally lacking moments.

128
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,299
(In Round 1 Love Talk Team,)

129
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:04,033
(B:GINNER JANG WON
who failed to show skills)

130
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,433
You can't go on stage like that.

131
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,833
(In Round 1, he got harsh feedback)
Get it together.

132
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:12,666
JANG WON: Since I didn't show
good performance in Round 1,

133
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:19,033
JANG WON: I worried I might
burden the team members.

134
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:21,699
(Nervous)
My throat went completely dry.

135
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,433
PARK SECHAN: B:GINNER
JANG WON was extremely nervous.

136
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,499
LEE JUNMYEONG: I thought we'd
definitely win in terms of vocals.

137
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,533
YUJU: The concept of 'You Were Beautiful'
is a first love's wedding!

138
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:34,304
(Interpretation that draws curiosity)
A sorrowful take on 'You Were Beautiful'? Let's see.

139
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:39,299
(The rearranged intro is good)

140
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,799
(Carefully singing the first verse)
♪You were beautiful♪

141
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:52,544
(Oh nice!)
♪Look at me, the gaze you gave me♪

142
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:55,733
(Surprised)
♪That voice that used to call me, everything♪

143
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,566
(You're doing great, JANG WON)
♪All of that to me♪

144
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:07,043
♪You were beautiful♪

145
00:07:07,603 --> 00:07:12,366
♪The way you looked at me♪

(This is it)(Surprised)
♪That voice that used to call me♪

147
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,368
♪Everything♪

148
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:21,333
PENTAGON HUI: JANG WON sings well, huh?

149

(A new side of JANG WON they've never seen before)
♪All of that to me♪

150
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,633
(What kind of evaluation will they receive?)
Thank you.

151
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:31,272
(Got tense again)

152
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,999
YUJU: JANG WON, you sing well.

153
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:40,266
(Mid-check starting with praise)
- Oh, I was surprised. - Our JANG WON can sing too.

154
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,399
YUJU: For a moment, JANG WON
looked exactly like a wedding guest.

155
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:45,060
(Wedding guest?)
Wedding guest?

156
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,899
YUJU: Right from
the start of the first verse...

157
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,053
(Immersed)
♪You were beautiful♪

158
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,888
♪The way you looked at me♪

159
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:56,899
YUJU: It really felt like
you were looking at the bride.

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,048
KANG JUNSEONG: Thank you.

318
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:52,690
KANG JUNSEONG: I was questioning
if I did a good job. Now I know I did.

319
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,657
KANG JUNSEONG: I'm getting
goosebumps. This is amazing!

320
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,584
MONSTA X KIHYUN:
PARK JUNHYEOK, you did well.

321
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:06,024
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Are you the type
who's both confident and stubborn?

322
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:08,090
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Your singing
also had that kind of vibe.

323
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:11,290
(Stubborn, Haha)

324
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,290
MONSTA X KIHYUN: B:GINNER
JANG WON took the very first part.

325
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,290
(JANG WON handled the crucial opening
part for You Were Beautiful Team)

326
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:20,357
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Your vocal tone
matched the arrangement perfectly.

327
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,436
(Proud)
JANG WON: Thank you.

328
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:25,824
(Surprised) MONSTA X KIHYUN:
There's one little regret.

329
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:32,124
MONSTA X KIHYUN: There's one little regret.
Many in the audience may catch it.

330
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,757
MONSTA X KIHYUN: For a second there,
you seemed to zone out.

331
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,857
(Eyes suddenly losing focus and shaking)

332
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,724
MONSTA X KIHYUN: That part was slightly
disappointing, but everything else was great.

333
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:44,789
JANG WON: Thank you.

334
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:47,690
JANG WON: When he said I lost focus,

335
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,890
JANG WON: Oh, what did I do?

336
00:17:50,324 --> 00:17:52,457
JANG WON: Did I get nervous on stage?

337
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:54,757
(Mistake)
JANG WON: I can't remember.

338
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:58,790
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: LI ZHIWEI,
your voice suits this song perfectly.

339
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,457
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: Your voice fits well.

340
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,756
(Right)

341
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:06,157
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: The only slight
issue was the key going up at the end.

342
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:11,690
(Slightly off pitch in the high notes)

343
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,624
MONSTA X HYUNGWON:
It seemed a bit challenging.

344
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:17,024
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: Apart
from that, it was good overall.

345
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,357
LI ZHIWEI: There were
some minor mistakes.

346
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:25,024
LI ZHIWEI: I don't think
I showed the full effort

347
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:27,857
LI ZHIWEI: I usually do in practice.

348
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,690
MC DEX: Thanks to the main vocals
and B:GINNERs

349
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,924
MC DEX: of the MONSTA B Team
for bringing us You Were Beautiful.

350
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:37,704
(A stage with regrets but full effort)
Thank you.

351
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,357
(Good job!)

352
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:43,290
KANG JUNSEONG: We've been
working hard to improve

353
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,824
KANG JUNSEONG: based on the masters'
feedback and our own ideas.

354
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:52,890
KANG JUNSEONG: And today, it feels
like we did our best performance yet.

355
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,057
KANG JUNSEONG: I'm happy with it.

356
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,557
JANG WON: "Ah, at least, we finished it
without major mistakes."

357
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:01,790
JANG WON: I think I gained
more confidence.

358
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,757
PARK JUNHYEOK: Compared to
practice, there are many regrets,

359
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:07,424
(No regrets as we did our best)
PARK JUNHYEOK: but I have no regrets.

360
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:09,924
LIA KIM: If it goes like this,
I don't know how it'll turn out.

361
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,944
JINHO: Both teams did so well.

362
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,527
LIA KIM: They both did so well.

363
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:17,920
(Both teams did their best
regardless of the result)

364
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:20,967
13 vs 13 Team Death Match.

365
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:23,745
Now only the final match remains.

366
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,248
(3 set,
Mega Performance Match)

367
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,352
(Chapter 5, TOP PICK,
Toward Team Survival)

368
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:32,445
LEE JUNMYEONG: I pretty expect
the Mega Performance Match stage.

369
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:36,712
MOON JAEIL: We put a lot of time into
the Mega Performance Match performance.

370
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:40,524
(Meaningful match with all 13 members)
I'm most excited about the mega performance,

371
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:41,912
where we can combine
all of our team's energy.

372
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:44,628
But for this stage, anticipation
overcomes nervousness.

373
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:47,278
(Masters are full of anticipation)
How much cheers will they receive?

374
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:50,712
Oh, but the two teams have
completely different charms.

375
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:54,645
The B:GINNERs prepared everything,
including stage, choreography,

376
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,145
(This match's competition song?)
and visuals. What's their battle song?

377
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:01,216
Trespass, the debut song

378
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:03,272
that marked the beginning
of TOP IDOL MONSTA X.

379
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:04,776
(MONSTA X, Trespass)

380
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:08,312
(MONSTA X's explosive debut song)

381
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,678
(Firmly impressed the public)

382
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:17,178
MC DEX: Mega Performance Match.

383
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:19,412
MC DEX: Everyone, please
come up to the stage.

384
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:24,878
(MY MONSTAZ Team)

385
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:29,524
Oh, cool.

386
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:35,745
(MONSTA B Team)

387
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:37,332
(Anticipation up)

388
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:40,640
(Highlight of the 13 vs 13
Team Death Match)

389
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:42,868
Mega Performance Match.

390
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,292
MY MONSTAZ Team,
how will you pull off Trespass?

391
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,538
I'm curious about your reinterpretation.

392
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:53,871
SEO JUNHYEOK: We wanted to steal
and imprint on B:IN US fans' hearts,

393
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:56,571
SEO JUNHYEOK: so we imagined
13 mischievous boys.

394
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:58,964
(Concept: Kitsch hip-hop troublemaker)
SEO JUNHYEOK: We prepared a kitsch stage.

395
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:00,876
Then, MY MONSTAZ,

396
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:03,271
what's your team's visual concept?

397
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:09,652
LEE JUNMYEONG: Following
the "mischievous boys" concept,

398
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:11,380
(Video utilizing graffiti)
LEE JUNMYEONG: we formed a crew look

399
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,871
LEE JUNMYEONG: with matching
outfits and graffiti visuals,

400
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,020
LEE JUNMYEONG: emphasizing
freedom with the word "Gravity."

401
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,452
LEE JUNMYEONG: The choreography
also highlights this free vibe.

402
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:20,571
LEE JUNMYEONG: We hope you like it.

403
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,540
MONSTA X SHOWNU: Could you briefly
show us a choreography highlight?

404
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:26,705
LEE JUNMYEONG: Our
choreography's highlight is

405
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:28,705
LEE JUNMYEONG: a move
that mimics a motorcycle.

406
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:31,156
(Engine, Vroom)

407
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,124
LEE JUNMYEONG: It just feels like this.

408
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,166
Where does this fit?

409
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,505
JINHO: That was their way
of taking control early on. You know?

410
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:40,705
(Interpretation: We can do
at least this much) Properly.

411
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:43,284
(Full power) They didn't just show it,
but they really showed it.

412
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:44,605
But he pretended to do it lightly.

413
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:47,271
(Masters saw through the strategy)
Exactly.

414
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:51,271
MC DEX: Now, all B:GINNERs
look full of confidence.

415
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,100
MC DEX: Ah, something amazing
seems to be coming.

416
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:55,988
(Will reveal why MY MONSTAZ are so confident)
MC DEX: Let's look forward to

417
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,738
MC DEX: what a true mega
performance is all about.

418
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,905
MC DEX: What about the MONSTA B Team?

419
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:02,305
MC DEX: How did you interpret Trespass?

420
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:06,338
KANG JUNSEONG: The keyword we
thought of after hearing this song was

421
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:10,005
KANG JUNSEONG: thieves
going to steal love from safes.

422
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,238
(Thieves stealing love from safes)

423
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:13,152
KANG JUNSEONG: Since
the concept was "thief,"

424
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:14,871
we tried on a techwear-style vest

425
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:17,171
(Visual Point 1, Techwear)
with lots of pockets.

426
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:21,538
KANG JUNSEONG: And
on the screen behind us...

427
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:25,705
(Visual Point 2, Story-driven video)
we used clear visuals like a bank, a vault, and metal to show our story.

428
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:27,338
What parts or highlights

429
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:30,205
(MONSTA B's Trespass highlights)
should we be watching for?

430
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:35,171
MOON JAEIL: Since it's a bank heist
concept, we thought about

431
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:38,316
MOON JAEIL: how to represent the safes.

432
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:41,471
(Choreography expressing safe locks)
MOON JAEIL: We tried in this way.

433
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:43,657
Ah, safe.

434
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:46,038
Oh, do it harder.

435
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:48,738
(Full of passion)
Should do it like this.

436
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,292
Oh my God!

437
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,771
Just like "Boom, Boom, Boom."

438
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,405
(The most serious about this match)
Boom, haha.

439
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,638
Do your best.

440
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:58,996
I wonder what was most difficult
during stage preparation.

441
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:00,438
YANG HYEONBIN: Well...

442
00:23:00,438 --> 00:23:02,638
YANG HYEONBIN: What was
hardest was matching

443
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:06,484
YANG HYEONBIN: the huge amount of
practice B:GINNER MOON JAEIL put in.

444
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,471
(Everyone agrees)
Oh, the leader's practice load.

445
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,905
YANG HYEONBIN: We kept practicing
without eating.

446
00:23:11,252 --> 00:23:12,871
No!

447
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,783
You should eat before working.

448
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,148
(Sparta MOON JAEIL)
Ah, that much.

449
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:19,388
MOON JAEIL gave them 2 minutes
to drink water.

450
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:21,556
- That's impossible.
- I don't want to work with MOON JAEIL.

451
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:22,548
(I don't want to work with JAEIL)

452
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:26,271
MC DEX: MONSTA X, you must have
experienced this before too, right?

453
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,605
Still should eat meals.

454
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:32,468
Yes, I hope you eat well
even secretly between practices.

455
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,068
(What was the intense
practice process of both teams?)

456
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:36,468
(Round 2, Competition D-17,
MY MONSTAZ's Practice Room)

457
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:40,605
SEO JUNHYEOK: We need to select someone
who can create choreography and lead.

458
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:43,605
SEO JUNHYEOK: Those who are
confident, please raise your hands.

459
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,038
(Raise his hand)
Me.

460
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:46,071
Even creating choreography...

461
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,905
LEE JUNMYEONG: I'm
confident in creating.

462
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:49,938
LEE JUNMYEONG: During Round 1,
I think I created exactly half of it.

463
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:55,028
(Got involved in the choreography
during Round 1)

464
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:57,771
It feels like the person who
created the choreography

465
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:03,484
(B:GINNER LEE JUNMYEONG praised by
TOP IDOL NCT) showed their interpretation.

466
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,971
LEE JUNMYEONG: Fortunately,
regarding the creation part,

467
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:08,105
LEE JUNMYEONG: I think I
received good evaluations.

468
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:09,638
LEE JUNMYEONG: I'm confident.

469
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:13,071
(Made a Mega Performance Match choreography
with a 1-minute-30-second song clip)

470
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:16,105
LEE JUNMYEONG: Since
I first heard this song,

471
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:20,060
LEE JUNMYEONG: I had
a few concepts in mind.

472
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:23,145
LEE JUNMYEONG:
We can just freestyle while listening.

473
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,688
(This is freestyle choreography quality)
Oh, nice.

474
00:24:27,688 --> 00:24:29,803
(Satisfied)
Oh, it seems nice.

475
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:32,808
(Choreography ideas to pull off
the lyrics) Oh, that part is good.

476
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:35,545
You try catching my back.

477
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,192
(LEE JUNMYEONG leads choreography)
Let's do it together at once.

478
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:39,344
LEE JUNMYEONG: Lean forward.

479
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,511
Oh, nice.

480
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:43,845
KIM JEONGHOON: LEE JUNMYEONG
had diverse opinions,

481
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,645
KIM JEONGHOON: which
made me feel reassured.

482
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:47,400
(LEE JUNMYEONG keeps guiding
the choreography) One and two.

483
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,613
(Somehow awkward)
Three, and four,

484
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,672
(Somehow awkward)
five,

485
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:51,536
(It's hard...)
six.

486
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:53,896
(WILLIAM, after pulling this, what was next?)
WILLIAM.

487
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:54,664
After pulling this, what was next?

488
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,605
What was next?

489
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,600
(MY MONSTAZ struggling together
with the challenging choreography)

490
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,464
(Struggling)
Four.

491
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,288
I'm really bad at this type of choreo.

492
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:04,392
(Even skilled B:GINNER HYO finds it difficult)
It's too hard.

493
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:06,448
Yeah. Too hard.

494
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:07,696
I can't memorize it.

495
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:11,378
PARK SECHAN: It takes me a week
just to learn choreography...

496
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:14,112
(Staring)
PARK SECHAN: JUNMYEONG's choreo is

497
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,311
PARK SECHAN: a hip-hop style
I struggle with the most,

498
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:19,784
(Still seems difficult)
PARK SECHAN: so it's still challenging for me.

499
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:21,104
Yes, yes.

500
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,740
Can you do it a bit slower?

501
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,016
A bit slower.

502
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,144
(...Understood)
Yes, understood.

503
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:28,911
(B:GINNER JUNMYEONG slows down at team's request)
Let's try counts 1 and 2 with just these three first.

504
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:32,545
And the rest... One, two, three, four.

505
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:33,945
(Level-adjusted explanation)
Like this, slightly...

506
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:34,525
(Submission complete)
Okay.

507
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:35,532
Stand ready, three, four. OK?

508
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,080
Seven, eight. One, two, three, four.

509
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,008
(Wait!)
Ah, wait.
(Suddenly stopping practice...)
Ah, wait.

510
00:25:42,003 --> 00:25:44,064
Can you do the waist bounce?

511
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:44,936
Because...

512
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,978
(Movements incomprehensible to pro dancer JUNMYEONG)
One, two, three, four. We can just go straight.

513
00:25:49,978 --> 00:25:52,616
Is this not working?

514
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:54,984
(Choreo detail compromised for easier execution)
Or just like this.

515
00:25:54,984 --> 00:25:56,816
Just the body...

516
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:59,280
(Ah... bouncing looks cooler though)
Bouncing does look cooler though.

517
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,744
(Even all-rounder KIM JEONGHOON struggles)
To do this move...

518
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:02,056
Okay.

519
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:05,952
KIM JEONGHOON: Learning
the choreo took so long that

520
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,928
KIM JEONGHOON: I felt it would be
tough to perform JUNMYEONG's dance.

521
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,643
(Round 2 Competition D-15, MY MONSTAZ Mega Performance Class)
Did you prepare hard?

522
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:12,256
- Hello.
- Hello.

523
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:14,078
(Master YUJEONG checking MY MONSTAZ's condition first)
You okay? Mega Crew?

524
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:15,755
It's difficult.

525
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:17,323
LEE YUJEONG: Should we just go first?

526
00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:18,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

527
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,339
LEE JUNMYEONG: Movements
need to flow smoothly.

528
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:19,915
Yep.

529
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:22,259
(B:GINNER JUNMYEONG meticulously managing MY MONSTAZ)
Don't forget the choreography.

530
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:23,123
Yes.

531
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:25,107
(Grinning)

532
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,720
(How will MY MONSTAZ's
first Mega Performance look?)

533
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:45,867
(Performing)

534
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:54,459
Pretty good, huh?

535
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:55,265
- Oh, really?
- Is that so?

536
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:56,786
Thank you.

537
00:26:56,786 --> 00:26:59,723
(Praise pouring in during first class)
I was surprised it turned out better than I expected.

538
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:04,953
LEE YUJEONG: There are parts that feel
slightly lacking and need improvement.

539
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:06,955
(Can you share one or two tips?)
Can you tell us just one or two things?

540
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:07,699
Wait a minute.

541
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,579
Like this.

542
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:11,667
(Master YUJEONG demonstrating personally)
But here,

543
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,907
even this kind of step works.

544
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:15,891
(Splendid)

545
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:18,620
LEE YUJEONG: Don't
kick twice, this is hard to do.

546
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,635
Just kick once.

547
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:24,353
(Detailed choreo lesson that MY MONSTAZ can handle)
Actually, it's easy, just here.

548
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:25,595
Only the direction.

549
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:26,566
Switch it.

550
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,107
A turn, even just doing this works.

551
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:29,419
It's okay to keep it simple

552
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:32,620
LEE YUJEONG: instead of
trying to do something flashy.

553
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:34,986
(Splendid)

554
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:37,204
(No need for extravagance)
So don't try to do something flashy.

555
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:38,675
(How do you do that without being flashy?)
How?

556
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:41,747
(Simple!)
Be simple.

557
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,074
(Output complete)
Simple.

558
00:27:43,853 --> 00:27:45,986
LEE YUJEONG: I think it'd be better for
JUNMYEONG to choreograph the last chorus.

559
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:46,507
Yes.

560
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:47,923
I think it'd be great
if you choreographed it,

561
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:48,979
(Don't overcomplicate it)
but just don't overcomplicate it.

562
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:50,186
Ah, yes understood.

563
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:52,459
LEE YUJEONG: Not everyone can
handle really broken-down counts.

564
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:52,947
Yes.

565
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:55,051
That also needs some consideration.

566
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:56,651
LEE YUJEONG: There's a wave
movement in the dance, right?

567
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:57,235
Yes.

568
00:27:57,771 --> 00:27:59,731
If it doesn't fit,
it can really backfire.

569
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:00,120
Alright.

570
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,739
If synchronized well, it looks awesome.

571
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:02,187
Yes.

572
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:03,475
But think about whether

573
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,203
(Time to think about moves)
it only looks cool on you

574
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:09,683
(Time to think about moves the whole team can handle)
or fits the group choreography as well.

575
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:10,731
Yes, understood.

576
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:13,131
LEE JUNMYEONG: Master YUJEONG said that

577
00:28:13,293 --> 00:28:17,220
LEE JUNMYEONG: dancing as a group
is different from dancing alone,

578
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,086
LEE JUNMYEONG: and that some moves
only look good when done together.

579
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:24,267
LEE JUNMYEONG: So from that moment, I tried
to make the choreo look beautiful as a whole,

580
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:27,435
LEE JUNMYEONG: rather than
just making one person stand out.

581
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:30,483
(To create a cooler stage)
But can't we stand out while still dancing as one?

582
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:34,953
(JUNMYEONG is brainstorming with the team)
I hope the four of them can think this through.

583
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:37,259
(D-17 to Round 2 Competition, MONSTA B's Practice Room)
First, the overall composition.

584
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:38,771
(MONSTA B's First Mega Performance
Choreography Practice Day)

585
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,299
Something fun like this.

586
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:41,011
This is fun.

587
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,227
Let's do it right away. It seems nice.

588
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:45,523
MOON JAEIL: I really
like MONSTA X seniors.

589
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,279
Oh, really?

590
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:48,435
Because I'm a MONSTA X fan

591
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,523
(I'm a MONSTA X fan)
Are you a fan?

592
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:53,483
MOON JAEIL: Since I'm MONBEBE,
a fan of MONSTA X seniors...

593
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:55,531
(JAEIL's MONSTA X love started from the dorm)
I'm a MONSTA X fan.

594
00:28:56,491 --> 00:29:00,075
Yeah. Let's go MONSTA X.

595
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:01,523
(Undying fandom spirit)
MONSTA X.

596
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,053
(Good grief, shouting MONSTA X...)
Pronounce it correctly.

597
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:05,555
(Shout out loud for MONSTA X)
- Why... - MONSTA X.

598
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:12,220
(Even during training camp, only
watching MONSTA X videos nonstop)

599

(Hosting a solo room concert)

00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,353
(Now let's sleep, even
if all B:GINNERs leave)

601

(My fangirling won't end)

602
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:25,142
MOON JAEIL: Since middle school, I've
watched many MONSTA X senior videos.

603
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:27,371
MOON JAEIL: As a MONBEBE,
MONSTA X's fan,

604
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:29,195
MOON JAEIL: this mission was so good.

605
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,058
(Trust MONBEBE with choreography creation)
I think it would be nice if one side comes up with it.

606
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,220
MOON JAEIL: If we do it like this
from the back, the center...

607
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,459
(Ideas) (flowing nonstop)
Like this.

608
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,986
- We can just go, right?
- Right.

609
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,523
(Following B:GINNER JAEIL, B:GINNER AI also releases ideas)
If we do it twice initially,

610
00:29:43,563 --> 00:29:44,555
(Good x2)
Okay.

611
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,253

this, we look like thieves!

(In an instant)
(Flawless group dance done)

613
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,707
(Awesome)

614
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:55,283
It's done.
- Quite nice.
- See, it worked.

615
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,099
Okay.
(Smugly, maybe I'm a genius)
Genius, right?

616
00:29:57,907 --> 00:29:58,451
Okay.

617
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,286
MOON JAEIL: I was already well familiar with
'Trespass,' the mega crew mission song.

618
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:05,120
MOON JAEIL: So the choreography
creation flowed smoothly.

619
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,275
One and two, three and...

620
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:09,971
It's three and four.

621
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:11,859
Seven, eight.

622
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:14,820
Do what you want,
what do you want to do?

623
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,827
(MY MONSTAZ completing the choreo
step by step through collaboration)

624
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:18,867
I think we need to do it in this way.

625
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,953
KIM JEONGHOON: When we suggest ideas,
JUNMYEONG listens and creates the choreography.

626
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:27,553
LEE JUNMYEONG: YEONTAE, WILLIAM,
and JEONGHOON helped a lot,

627
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:31,220
LEE JUNMYEONG: so it became
an opportunity to broaden our perspectives.

628
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,920
LEE JUNMYEONG: We're still working on
the choreography for the back part.

629
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,286
LEE JUNMYEONG: I think
teamwork will be prioritized.

630
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:39,720
There's a hidden special move,
so please look forward to it.

631
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,820
MOON JAEIL: It's a MONSTA X
senior's song, and I think

632
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,120
MOON JAEIL: we need to show a strong,
masculine, and powerful image.

633

(ONLY MONSTA X MONBEBE MOON JAEIL VS

635
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,096
Mega performance.

636
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,675
Looking forward to this.

637
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:54,821

00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,387
(Well)

641
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,416
(Crazy harmony)

642
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:14,016
(Right?)

643
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,416
(Revealing the hidden special move)

644
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,019
(Cool, huh?)

645
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:20,936
(Oh)

646
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:28,553
OK.

647
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,586
(Nice? Applause pours)
-Oh. -Oh.

648
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:36,353
MOON JAEIL: JUNMYEONG is a bit
of a challenge in terms of performance.

649
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:40,203
(Meaningful)

650
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:40,886
Yes.

651
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:42,353
(Curious)

652
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:50,753
LIA KIM: The overall
structure is well done!

653
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:54,859
LIA KIM: It's hard to believe
that trainees created it...

654
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:57,120
(Proud master)
The quality is good.

655
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,253
LIA KIM: Did JUNMYEONG
create a lot of it?

656
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:00,043
Yes! JUNMYEONG did most of it.

657
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,620
(MY MONSTAZ showing mega performance
recognized even by opposing team masters)

658
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,899
LEE YUJEONG: We went to the training camp,
and it's completely changed since then!

659
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:09,586
(Impressive)
Oh.

660
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:13,786
HUI: The overall composition seems
harmoniously well-structured.

661
00:32:13,853 --> 00:32:15,153
The vibe is good.

662
00:32:15,186 --> 00:32:15,986
- Well done.
- I'll look forward to it.

663
00:32:16,153 --> 00:32:20,286
(MY MONSTAZ's highly praised mid-check)
- Thank you. - Thank you.

664
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:23,953
LEE JUNMYEONG: It felt good
to hear positive feedback that

665
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:26,586
LEE JUNMYEONG: the choreography
exceeded expectations.

666
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,853
Next up is MONSTA B's evaluation turn.

667
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:29,915
Let's watch it right away.

668
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,371
- Yes.
- Yes.

669
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:33,099
(Anticipating)

670
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:39,083
Good.

671
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:06,411
What is this?

672
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,320
LEE YUJEONG: From what I see...

673
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,620
LEE YUJEONG: the energy kept shifting

674
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,853
LEE YUJEONG: between a mischievous
vibe and a rough thief feel,

675
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:20,420
LEE YUJEONG: so I wasn't quite sure
what concept you wanted to convey.

676
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:23,627
(Not sure about the intended concept) LEE YUJEONG: I guess
LEE YUJEONG: I didn't fully understand the overall concept,

677
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:26,315
LEE YUJEONG: which was a bit disappointing.

678
00:33:26,315 --> 00:33:27,686
(Sensing)
- Yes. - Yes.

679
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:31,083
(Unexpected concept criticism for confident MONSTA B)
LEE YUJEONG: Having someone climb up and everyone

680
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,099
LEE YUJEONG: trying to open the safe together,
then when it doesn't work,

681
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:35,752
LEE YUJEONG: all of them trying something else,

682
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:37,579
(Nodding)
LEE YUJEONG: that kind of bold,

683
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:40,331
(Master LEE YUJEONG from the opposing team giving feedback)
LEE YUJEONG: group action scene should appear

684
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:44,235
LEE YUJEONG: near the beginning
to show a strong visual.

685
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:47,648
- I keep thinking it should be in the verse.
- Yes.

686
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:50,347
The concept seemed difficult
for me to understand...

687
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:51,947
LEE YUJEONG: It feels like you
tried to cram in too much.

688
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:53,547
LEE YUJEONG: Shouldn't
you remove some instead?

689
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:54,205
Yes, understood.

690
00:33:55,353 --> 00:34:00,920
MOON JAEIL: I thought I knew 'Trespass'
better than the other B:GINNERs,

691
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,220
MOON JAEIL: but after receiving
negative feedback during the mid-check,

692
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,620
MOON JAEIL: I felt really
disappointed in myself.

693
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,453
(MONSTA B dance class after mid-check)
LIA KIM: During the earlier evaluation,

694
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:13,803
LIA KIM: MY MONSTAZ had
at least one impactful scene.

695
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:18,320
(The mega mission's highlight,
MY MONSTAZ' powerful moment)

696
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,453
LIA KIM: That dance move can be a powerful
asset, an unforgettable scene for the team.

697
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,353
(Remember?)
- You remember, right? - Yes.

698
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:28,267
"Your team doesn't seem to
have equally impactful scenes."

699
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,497
(That's right)
I also agreed with that statement.

700
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:34,053
LIA KIM: And also, the storyline
is too complicated.

701
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:40,753
LIA KIM: It was difficult to convey everything
properly within 1 minute 30 seconds.

702
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:42,786
(Starting dance teaching with revisions)
Now, you come out like this...

703
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:45,020
- Then someone comes from behind and does this.
- Yes.

704
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,699
(Master LIA KIM adding details B:GINNERs might miss)
Pop out...

705
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,522
Pop out, glance once, then...

706
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:49,515
Come out one more time.

707
00:34:49,515 --> 00:34:52,203
A bit more like this...

708
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:53,520
(Nodding)
Wanna try that part once?

709
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,553
(MONSTA B dancing the original version)
One, two, three, and four, five, six and seven, eight, and one...

710
00:34:59,627 --> 00:35:01,195
You look so nice right now, you know?

711
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:02,129
It's so nice, but...

712
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:05,163
(Thinking...)

713
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:07,595
How about fully climbing up once?

714
00:35:08,395 --> 00:35:09,579
Fully climbing up once...

715
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:10,795
(Will that work?)

716
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:13,195
(The standout B:GINNER AI)
Attitude, then jump.

717
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:15,153
(Scary...)
Hey, jump.

718
00:35:15,153 --> 00:35:17,553
(Brave AI B:GINNER flies!)
Something like this...

719
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:20,395
(Details and techniques enriched by LIA KIM's teaching)
Everyone, when adding a technique, you need to practice a lot.

720
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:21,515
Like this?

721
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:23,147
Right, so this...

722
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:26,379
If you do it like this, your moves might
not be visible. If it's set up this way...

723
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:27,563
Let's begin.
Hey.

724
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:29,771
- Wow!
- Whoa.

725
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:30,853
- Wow!
- Like this a bit...

726
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:31,953
(Cool...)

727
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:34,253
But we need to add one thing.

728
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:35,787
(Reexperiencing Master LIA KIM's overwhelming class)
Or if you keep watching from behind...

729
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:36,779
Someone to support.

730
00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:38,515
Wait and practice.

731
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,120
MOON JAEIL: When Master LIA KIM
taught the mega performance lesson,

732
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,720
MOON JAEIL: she provided
various solutions,

733
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,686
truly proving masters are different.

734
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,120
(Choreography practice after master's teaching)
Five and six and seven and...

735
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,553
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

736
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:56,420
(Adjusting the formation position)
Let's move this forward.

737
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,115
(B:GINNER JAEIL modifying choreo per feedback)
There's someone doing this...

738
00:35:59,115 --> 00:35:59,563
Yes.

739
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:02,447
For those doing that part,
begin with a down motion.

740
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,291
(It's tough...)
And the people in the back,

741
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:07,616
just pump up and
start with your right foot.

742
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,843
(MONSTA B confused by revised movements)
Yes, while going down...

743
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:10,501
- Keep going like this.
- Do it while going down.

744
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,762
Ah, okay.

745
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:12,953
Three, okay.

746
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:15,820
Better to
align your body directions slightly.

747
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,803
Bow properly when bowing.

748
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:18,622
Yes.

749
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:20,163
Eight and one.

750
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:23,083
(Stumbling)
Two, three, and four and... OK, OK.

751
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,020
One more time.

752
00:36:24,203 --> 00:36:26,153
(MONSTA B's slowing practice progress)
And maybe we should lean forward more decisively.

753
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:27,179
Okay.

754
00:36:27,614 --> 00:36:30,315
(This won't do...)

755
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:33,853
(Focus here, here!)
- I'll transition here. - Okay.

756
00:36:33,953 --> 00:36:36,619
(No choice but to practice relentlessly!)
Five, six, seven, eight.

757
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:39,415
One and two and three and four.

758
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:40,997
One, two.

759
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:42,589
(Missed the beat)
Three and four.

760
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:48,171
One more time!

761
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:50,123
Please do it again.

762
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
What if we fall during the choreography?

763
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:54,376
Okay.

764
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:56,653
Everyone fell?
Then let's practice again.

765
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:59,453
JANG WON: When I first saw B:GINNER
JAEIL as the opposing team in Round 1,

766
00:36:59,453 --> 00:37:04,820
JANG WON: I thought "Wow, he's really good at
dancing" and "He's definitely the TOP B:GINNER here".

767
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,553
JANG WON: But after becoming
teammates and practicing together...

768
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:11,653
JANG WON: Wow, now I understand
why he's the dance TOP.

769
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:13,553
The practice volume is astonishing!

770
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:20,686
AI: We've been practicing the mega
performance non-stop for 6 hours without breaks.

771
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,320
My legs hurt so much it's exhausting.

772
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:30,053
(Forget MONBEBE JAEIL, awaken as tiger MOON JAEIL!)
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

773
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,053
(Ankle hurts)

774
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:32,811
(You okay?)

775
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:34,853
(Probably)

776
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:40,800
(Injuries occurring everywhere)

777
00:37:41,952 --> 00:37:44,331
Since many people are painfully injured,

778
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:50,603
then shouldn't we be cautious
for rehabilitation purposes?

779
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:53,490
(Grueling practice that might damage bodies)
And one, two, three, and four.

780
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,957
(B:GINNER MOON JAEIL silently leading alone)
And five, six, seven, eight.

781
00:37:56,223 --> 00:38:01,857
YANG HYEONBIN: B:GINNER JAEIL choreographed
the mega performance almost alone,

782
00:38:01,857 --> 00:38:04,757
YANG HYEONBIN: and
controlled all 13 members.

783
00:38:04,757 --> 00:38:07,464
KIM BOHYEON: B:GINNER JAEIL even
skips meals to teach us diligently.

784
00:38:08,157 --> 00:38:10,357
KIM BOHYEON: So I feel bad
suggesting "Let's eat first".

785
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:13,390
KIM BOHYEON: Other B:GINNERs
seem equally committed.

786
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,990
Six, seven, eight. OK.

787
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,857
(To exhausted MONSTA B)
We can do it, we can.

788
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:18,952
(B:GINNER MOON JAEIL encouraging while leading)
Just kick hard and bow quickly.

789
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:21,290
Five, six, seven, eight.

790
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,200
YANG HYEONBIN: Without B:GINNER JAEIL,
we couldn't complete the mega mission.

791
00:38:24,657 --> 00:38:30,323
MOON JAEIL: We prepared hard as
a team, giving our all for this stage.

792
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,890
So I'm absolutely confident we'll win!

793
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:35,557
LEE JUNMYEONG: We all
agreed from the start

794
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:37,857
LEE JUNMYEONG: 'Let's make
the team shine, no matter what.'

795
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:42,257
LEE JUNMYEONG: So we made sure every member
had a chance to stand out, even just a little.

796
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:44,136
(Round 2 Competition D-DAY)
Let's close the doors now.

797
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:45,448
Closed.

798
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,523
Yes, from there.

799
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:48,590
(Until stage entry moment)
HYO, go all the way.

800
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:51,490
(MY MONSTAZ practicing endlessly till stage entry)
Creak, it opened, it opened.

801
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:58,242
- You must set up quickly here firmly.
- If doing it, extend the torso to here.

802
00:38:58,242 --> 00:39:01,317
-Like this. - Let's try this.

803
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:04,744
(Two teams obsessed
with creating mega performance)

804
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,264
(Which team will ultimately
win this showdown?)

805
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,292
- Fighting!
- Wow.

806
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:11,784
B:MY BOYZ

807
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:17,486
13 vs13 Team Death Match
Showdown, Mega Performance Match.

808
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:19,336
Here comes Trespass

809
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:21,288
(MY MONSTAZ's first strike)
by MY MONSTAZ.

810
00:39:21,564 --> 00:39:23,107
Let's get started.

811
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,239
Go for it!

812
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,939
(MAX energy)
Let's go!

813
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:29,960
Let's have fun!!!

814
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,406
Okay, okay.

815
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:32,296
Let's go.

816
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:34,419
Ah, good spirit.

817
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:36,712
Fighting!
Finally, they are doing it.

818
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:38,339
But guys...

819
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,739
JINHO: You've worked
hard already, really hard.

820
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:42,056
(The most nervous person at this moment)
They put their hands together.

821
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:43,668
I can't see.

822
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:44,957
They put their hands together.

823
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:47,624
(MONSTA B also watches half excited, half nervous)
Anticipating it, exciting.

824
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:48,444
Finally.

825
00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:50,406
(Though we are competitors)
Hope they do well!

826
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:54,506
(Original Song: MONSTA X
Choreography by: MY MONSTAZ)

827
00:40:10,376 --> 00:40:11,448
Wow, JUNMYEONG.

828
00:40:16,306 --> 00:40:17,573
(Why is he so good?)
Ah, JUNMYEONG.

829
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:35,139
(That look!)
Wow, SECHAN really pulled it off.

830
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:37,339
(B:GINNER SECHAN, first time seeing this side)
- Can he even make that face? - What's up with SECHAN?

831
00:41:02,908 --> 00:41:05,512
- Great tension!
- Well done.

832
00:41:13,706 --> 00:41:15,706
(Bike launch)
- Hey, bike. - Wow.

833
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,473
(B:GINNER YEONTAE's bike-riding form looked great)
That was awesome, wow!

834
00:41:19,356 --> 00:41:22,408
- His expressions are insane.
- YEONTAE, seriously.

835
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:39,789
Expression master, JEONGHOON!

836
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,016
- JEONGHOON looked so cool when he came forward.
- Whoa, awesome.

837
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:04,551
They did so well.

838
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,584
(WOW)

839
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,517
(Isn't it over?)
Is there more? What's left?

840
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,200
(What's going on?)

841
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,349
(Curious)
What? What is it?

842
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:36,466
(Team MY MONSTAZ)

843
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:39,466
(B:IN US collectively swooning)

844
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:44,423
Oh, mischievous boys!

845
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,333
(Continuous exclamations)

846
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:51,220
(Seal claps)
Wow, well done! Well done!

847
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:54,708
(Proud)
- Covered their mouth. - They love it so much?

848
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:57,428
- They're being genuine.
- Seems really surprised.

849
00:42:57,428 --> 00:43:00,116
(Quality like this deserves instant recognition)
Ah, this is impressive, impressive. They did so well.

850
00:43:00,116 --> 00:43:02,292
Wow, this is a fan-making stage.

851
00:43:03,252 --> 00:43:04,820
Your tension is really high today.

852
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,233
(First time seeing this side)
Seems like you're chatting the most today, huh?

853
00:43:09,908 --> 00:43:11,124
(And...)
Cool.

854
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:12,116
Yes.
Good.

855
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:14,996
(Post-opening act tension lingers over MONSTA B)
Whoa, intense.

856
00:43:16,904 --> 00:43:22,533
YANG HYEONBIN: They synced well,
and the motorcycle choreo was cool.

857
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:29,633
MOON JAEIL: The performance
quality was better than expected.

858
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:30,910
(Enough, let's boost confidence)
We can do it.

859
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,488
But we're better, right?

860
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:33,256
What nonsense.

861
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:35,048
(I'll erase all memory of their first stage)
We're better, right?

862
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:36,556
Obviously.

863
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:41,000
Watching B:GINNER LEE JUNMYEONG's
performance, I was convinced

864
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,800
(Stage proving why he looked confident)
why you looked so confident earlier.

865
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,233
LEE JUNMYEONG: We faced many
trials creating this choreo.

866
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:51,433
LEE JUNMYEONG: This stage is
our best effort and peak, so

867
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:54,000
LEE JUNMYEONG: even if we lose, no
regrets, and I think we'll win for sure.

868
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,880
(Doing both stage and speech well)
Ah, cool.

869
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,260
Ah, they did their best.

870
00:43:57,672 --> 00:44:01,311
Now, B:MY BOYZ 13 vs13
Team Death Match.

871
00:44:01,311 --> 00:44:05,448
(Responding to that, MONSTA B goes second)
Now, let's start Trespass prepared by MONSTA B.

872
00:44:05,448 --> 00:44:07,286
MONSTA B.

873
00:44:07,286 --> 00:44:09,320
(Full of spirit)
Fighting!

874
00:44:10,785 --> 00:44:11,720
Let's go.

875
00:44:11,912 --> 00:44:12,776
Don't do it.

876
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,076
Yeah, momentum.

877
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:15,872
(Desperate)
It's momentum.

878
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:18,854
Where are you saying this?

879
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:20,296
Where? Where to?

880
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:22,760
(Already transmitted energy via Bluetooth)
No, my energy will be delivered.

881
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,819
- Yes.
- Ah, understood.

882
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:24,680
Yes.

883
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:26,280
Fighting.

884
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,336
Looking forward to it.

885
00:44:27,336 --> 00:44:28,888
They're good, but just a little behind us.

886
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:33,064
(MONSTA B gathered on the left, not center stage)
Oh, starting from the left.

887
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,514
Ah, they start like that?

888
00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:39,000
(Original song: MONSTA X - Trespass)

889
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:03,120
Ah, nice.

890
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:18,312
(The standout moment)
Oh.

891
00:45:18,312 --> 00:45:19,208
Ah.

892
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,877
(AI made it shine)
Ah, this part is so good.

893
00:45:21,192 --> 00:45:22,305
AI nailed it.

894
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,848
Yeah, the clean choreography really shows.

895
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:57,256
(MOON JAEIL, reliable as always)
JAEIL is reliable as always.

896
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,666
(Heart shot)

897
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,933
(Ending killed it)

898
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:30,952
(Speech-stopping powerful finale)
There's a knockout punch at the end.

899
00:46:30,952 --> 00:46:31,688
I admit this.
- Wow.
- I admit this.

900
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,992
Feels good, right?

901
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,035
So the vibe is really good.

902
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:37,133
Well done.

903
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:38,293
What, what?

904
00:46:42,747 --> 00:46:45,402
(Team MONSTA B)

905
00:46:56,966 --> 00:46:59,066
(Cheek-raising cute ending)
Stole it.

906
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:00,296
(Heart-stealing success)
Stole hearts.
My heart...

907
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,512
They stole my heart.

908
00:47:03,336 --> 00:47:04,552
- Good.
- Well done.

909
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:06,568
(Our MONSTA B did so well on stage)
Well done, well done, they did amazing.

910
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:10,533
PENTAGON JINHO: The sharp group
choreo really stands out.

911
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:12,392
JAEIL choreographed well too.

912
00:47:12,392 --> 00:47:13,174
It was well structured.

913
00:47:13,174 --> 00:47:14,856
(Confidence fades, leaving MY MONSTAZ nervous)
But honestly, not sure about the result.

914
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:24,433
KIM JEONGHOON: It's a mega-performance,
clean yet intricate group work.

915
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:29,400
LEE YEONTAE: Truly
unpredictable, neck-and-neck.

916
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,333
(No clue who'll win)

917
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,533
(I don't know)

918
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:34,952
(MONSTA B racing across stage like playground)
This stage wasn't a vault,

919
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,648
but it was a playground.

920
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:38,312
You guys looked so happy.

921
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:41,640
Now that all the battles are over,
how do you feel?

922
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,500
AI: We showed what we've
practiced hard for till today,

923
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,288
AI: so no regrets. I think
we did well. Thank you.

924
00:47:50,184 --> 00:47:52,914
AI, well done!

925
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,450
(The fierce mega performance match)
Now, B:MY BOYZ 13 vs 13 Team Death Match.

926
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,472
The final mega performance match.

927
00:47:58,472 --> 00:48:02,366
MC DEX: Let's now hear
MONSTA X's comments.

928
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,656
The quality was

929
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,133
so good.

930
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,560
It was so good.

931
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,618
It was truly so good.

932
00:48:09,866 --> 00:48:13,200
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Overall, it's
not easy for all 13 members

933
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:17,933
MONSTA X KIHYUN: to blend so
well and truly feel like one team.

934
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:23,233
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: The choreography
flowed seamlessly from start to finish.

935
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,000
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: That
part was also highly impressive.

936
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,128
(Stage radiating MY MONSTAZ's intent)
Your intent resonated perfectly,

937
00:48:29,128 --> 00:48:33,933
and I think it wasn't just a coincidentally
good stage. It was brilliantly executed.

938
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:35,866
For the great stage, I want
to express my gratitude.

939
00:48:35,866 --> 00:48:38,312
Everyone, without exception,
was determined to do your best.

940
00:48:38,312 --> 00:48:43,033
(Everyone shining with passion)
Your passion really shone through.

941
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:46,533
MONSTA X SHOWNU: Also, the fact that
you created the choreography yourself

942
00:48:46,566 --> 00:48:50,133
MONSTA X SHOWNU: and performed it
in perfect sync as a team is truly impressive.

943
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:53,000
It was a great performance to watch.

944
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,016
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

945
00:48:56,648 --> 00:48:59,966
(Judges' thoughts on MONSTA B's performance)
I'm so curious what MONSTA X's thoughts are.

946
00:48:59,966 --> 00:49:05,064
I felt like what was stolen
from the safe was my heart.

947
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:08,133
(Heart-fluttering from sweet words)

948
00:49:08,232 --> 00:49:11,800
(Sweet comments exceed the limit)

949
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:19,100
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: Getting 13 people
to move in perfect sync takes nothing but practice.

950
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,500
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: The stage reflected
all that effort, and it was so flawless

951
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:28,866
it let both the audience
and me feeling satisfied.

952
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,331
Thank you.

953
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:34,566
MONSTA X KIHYUN: You said B:GINNER
MOON JAEIL made you guys practice brutally hard.

954
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:37,933
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Now I understand why.

955
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,336
MONSTA X KIHYUN: You all did great on
stage, and the tight,

956
00:49:39,336 --> 00:49:44,533
MONSTA X KIHYUN: and clean synchronization
really showed. It made me realize...

957
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:48,633
(A result proven through practicing)
just how much you guys practiced.

958
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:51,624
JAEIL's role was truly massive.

959
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:56,000
The results of JAEIL's
intense training showed.

960
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,866
MONSTA X SHOWNU: The performance of one minute
and 30 seconds wasn't just constantly intense,

961
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:06,666
MONSTA X SHOWNU: but they
have moments of easing off

962
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:10,504
MONSTA X SHOWNU: that make the rhythm
fun and the stage enjoyable to watch.

963
00:50:10,504 --> 00:50:14,700
MONSTA X SHOWNU: It showed great storyline
and solid performance.

964
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,221
Thank you.

965
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:26,500
KANG JUNSEONG: I'm thrilled they said our
storyline and concept were clearly communicated.

966
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:35,648
MONSTA B HIROTO: I was really happy because it felt like
they could see how hard I had practiced.

967
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:38,400
MONSTA B HARUTO: I feel so good.

968
00:50:39,866 --> 00:50:42,033
(After the final stage concluded)

969
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:45,896
(It really hurts now... really hurts)
Ah, it hurts.

970
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:49,288
- Well done.
- Really?

971
00:50:49,288 --> 00:50:52,566
(B:GINNER YANG HYEONBIN
is limping off stage)

972
00:50:52,833 --> 00:51:00,033
YANG HYEONBIN: I hurt myself during yesterday's
practice from a bad landing after a jump.

973
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:03,966
(Even during the day of rehearsal)

974
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:09,366
(Persistent limping)

975
00:51:10,504 --> 00:51:11,176
What's wrong with your ankle?

976
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:12,360
The injury from yesterday.

977
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,674
It's from the injury yesterday.

978
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:17,736
It's really okay.

979
00:51:17,736 --> 00:51:19,336
(Despite teammates' worries)
After it's over, if it hurts,

980
00:51:19,592 --> 00:51:22,408
- it's okay then.
- If it hurts after this...

981
00:51:22,408 --> 00:51:25,433
YANG HYEONBIN: If I make them
miss a rehearsal because of me,

982
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:32,100
YANG HYEONBIN: it'll affect both
me and my teammates,

983
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,352
YANG HYEONBIN: so I just endured it.

984
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:36,200
YANG HYEONBIN B:GINNER.

985
00:51:38,504 --> 00:51:43,700
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: You stood out
by nailing your parts while exuding charisma.

986
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:47,366
(Capturing MONSTA X's attention
despite brief moments)

987
00:51:47,366 --> 00:51:48,776
(Moved)
Thank you.

988
00:51:51,144 --> 00:51:56,040
(Precious words that made pain forgotten)
I'd rather sprain my ankle and get praised one more time.

989
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,522
I felt so happy.

990
00:51:57,522 --> 00:51:59,176
I have nothing to say
except compliments.

991
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,500
By the way, it's really...

992
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,032
LEE YUJEONG: It's B:GINNERs' first stage
created entirely from start to finish.

993
00:52:05,032 --> 00:52:06,952
LEE YUJEONG: All the details.

994
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:12,133
LEE YUJEONG: I think that makes
it so significant.

995
00:52:12,552 --> 00:52:13,766
Everyone worked hard.

996
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:15,656
(After all stages)
Well done.

997
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,024
You did well.

998
00:52:18,024 --> 00:52:19,100
Home run.

999
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,866
LEE JUNMYEONG: "I liked how no one was
lacking and we looked like one team."

1000
00:52:22,866 --> 00:52:25,466
LEE JUNMYEONG: That feedback
made me really happy.

1001
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:31,733
Our practice wasn't in vain.

1002
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:36,766
SEO JUNHYEOK: I'm really grateful that
all the team members talked together

1003
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:40,033
SEO JUNHYEOK: through the hard times and
the good times, helping us finish strong.

1004
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:46,066
SEO JUNHYEOK: I hope we never forget
the moments we shared.

1005
00:52:47,433 --> 00:52:51,166
MOON JAEIL: Some were injured or unwell.

1006
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:56,133
MOON JAEIL: Thank you for
following without a single complaint.

1007
00:52:56,456 --> 00:53:02,600
MOON JAEIL: Thanks to that, we could create
this mega performance stage.

1008
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:07,666
(A mega performance match
proving the value of teamwork)

1009
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:13,533
MC DEX: All 26 B:GINNERs who
completed Round 2 stages did well.

1010
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:16,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1011
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,974
MC DEX: MONSTA X members,

1012
00:53:17,974 --> 00:53:21,874
MC DEX: what did you think of B:GINNERs'
13 vs 13 Team Death Match?

1013
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:26,407
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Both teams delivered
such brilliant stages today, thank you.

1014
00:53:26,407 --> 00:53:28,518
MONSTA X KIHYUN: After watching,

1015
00:53:28,518 --> 00:53:30,707
MONSTA X KIHYUN: I really felt and saw

1016
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:35,440
MONSTA X KIHYUN: how much time
and effort you all poured into the stages.

1017
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,607
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Even if the results
today aren't what you hoped for,

1018
00:53:40,607 --> 00:53:42,274
MONSTA X KIHYUN: I hope you don't feel
any regret about not showing your best.

1019
00:53:42,274 --> 00:53:45,907
MONSTA X KIHYUN: I wish you feel relieved
and satisfied. It was a great performance.

1020
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:47,740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1021
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:54,874
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: Since we've also experienced it,
we know how nervous today's stage must have felt.

1022
00:53:54,874 --> 00:53:56,574
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: We
understand exactly how you feel.

1023
00:53:56,574 --> 00:54:02,240
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: But I don't think I could
deliver such a stage back in my early days.

1024
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,974
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: Since you showed
a much more splendid stage than I ever did,

1025
00:54:06,974 --> 00:54:10,874
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: we can genuinely
look forward to in the future.

1026
00:54:10,874 --> 00:54:13,807
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: So I hope you'll
continue with confidence moving forward.

1027
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:16,123
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1028
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,630
Then, from now on...

1029
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,718
(Once again, TOP PICK
announcement time approaches)

1030
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:24,574
MC DEX: B:MY BOYZ Round 2
13 vs 13 Team Death Match.

1031
00:54:24,574 --> 00:54:27,740
MC DEX: I'll now reveal
MONSTA X's TOP PICK.

1032
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,414
(The tension builds)

1033
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:30,574
Ah, please, please.

1034
00:54:30,574 --> 00:54:33,474
(The tension builds as the main
announcement begins)

1035
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,807
MOON JAEIL: It was
truly a bit unpredictable.

1036
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:40,507
SEO JUNHYEOK: I was confident.

1037
00:54:40,507 --> 00:54:44,974
LEE JUNMYEONG: I thought "Wow, if
we really lose this, it'll feel terrible."

1038
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:47,622
The team that captured MONSTA X's hearts

1039
00:54:47,622 --> 00:54:49,374
will be chosen as the TOP PICK

1040
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:50,974
and all members will survive.

1041
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:53,074
The team that isn't chosen will

1042
00:54:53,074 --> 00:54:56,107
have all members become
elimination candidates.

1043
00:54:56,574 --> 00:54:58,310
(Tough time even for TOP IDOL)
Ugh, I'm feeling exhausted too.

1044
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,028
I can't watch this.

1045
00:55:00,307 --> 00:55:07,774
Please announce which team
is the TOP PICK now.

1046
00:55:07,774 --> 00:55:13,207
MONSTA X KIHYUN: The TOP PICK
team chosen by MONSTA X is...

1047
00:55:13,207 --> 00:55:15,494
LEE YEONTAE: We can do it. We can do it.

1048
00:55:15,495 --> 00:55:17,958
SEO JUNHYEOK: MY MONSTAZ...

1049
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:35,274
(TOP PICK TEAM)

1050
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:40,512
MONSTA X KIHYUN: The TOP PICK
team chosen by MONSTA X is...

1051
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:47,232
MONSTA X KIHYUN: The TOP PICK
team chosen by MONSTA X is...

1052
00:55:50,952 --> 00:55:53,816
(MONSTA X's waiting room)
First, the team... did you decide on a team?

1053
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:59,516
MONSTA X KIHYUN: For the stage itself, the title song
match Shoot Out was better with MONSTA B.

1054
00:55:59,516 --> 00:56:05,316
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Even when their notes
might crack, they just went all out. So great.

1055
00:56:05,316 --> 00:56:07,682
MONSTA X HYUNGWON:
JUNSEONG sang really well.

1056
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:10,982
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Actually,
when judging by vocal match, I think

1057
00:56:10,982 --> 00:56:15,816
You Were Beautiful team
showed much better performance.

1058
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:20,640
JANG WON, JANG WON.

1059
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,832
For me, JAEIL.

1060
00:56:24,832 --> 00:56:26,849
He's only been training for 7 months...

1061
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:30,912
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Oh, and the ones who listed
all-rounder as their main position were really good.

1062
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:36,128
I thought Love Killa and Shoot Out
were neck and neck.

1063
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:37,316
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: I felt like
MY MONSTAZ

1064
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:38,816
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: really
landed a big one at that point.

1065
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:39,976
- MY MONSTAZ?
- Yeah.

1066
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:42,760
Things like the concept design
and the way they changed formations...

1067
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,072
(MY MONSTAZ stood out)
Right, right.

1068
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:46,664
It was so full of variety, and I felt like
that part was all about creative ideas.

1069
00:56:46,664 --> 00:56:49,352
Really did well, YEONTAE, uh,
YEONTAE's practice period...

1070
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:51,432
(MY MONSTAZ's LEE YEONTAE, with a striking expression)
He's only practiced for 9 months but is really good.

1071
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:52,328
Yeah, he was good.

1072
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:53,416
He stood out.

1073
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:54,248
(A stage that is acknowledged)
Really.

1074
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:55,416
He really did well.

1075
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:58,949
MONSTA X KIHYUN: JUNMYEONG
gives off JOOHEON vibes in his style.

1076
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,256
He's got so much talent, like pulling

1077
00:57:01,256 --> 00:57:04,808
(LEE JUNMYEONG, who showed great talent)
one thing out of his pocket after another.

1078
00:57:05,608 --> 00:57:07,080
And HYEONBIN.

1079
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:07,515
Well...

1080
00:57:07,515 --> 00:57:09,032
(YANG HYEONBIN not overwhelmed by cameras)
With the camera...

1081
00:57:09,616 --> 00:57:11,182
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: He resembles MINHYUK.

1082
00:57:11,182 --> 00:57:13,382
MONSTA X HYUNGWON: He
seems good at using the camera.

1083
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:16,616
(Not an easy decision
to choose one team)

1084
00:57:16,616 --> 00:57:17,800
We just need to be careful.

1085
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:19,216
After that,

1086
00:57:19,216 --> 00:57:22,282
the eliminated team members
become elimination candidates.

1087
00:57:22,282 --> 00:57:25,416
MONSTA X KIHYUN: As I mentioned
earlier, it truly wasn't an easy choice.

1088
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:27,549
MONSTA X KIHYUN: There were many
differing opinions among us too.

1089
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:31,682
MONSTA X KIHYUN: But since we had to pick
one team, so we made this decision.

1090
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:36,704
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Don't get too discouraged
if you weren't selected, and keep showing

1091
00:57:36,992 --> 00:57:39,968
MONSTA X KIHYUN: your
growth in the future.

1092
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:45,792
The TOP PICK team chosen
by our MONSTA X is...

1093
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:50,536
(The TOP PICK, hoping
more desperately than ever)

1094
00:57:53,882 --> 00:57:56,982
(Since both teams
performed better than ever,)

1095
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:59,916
(two teams getting more nervous)

1096
00:58:00,016 --> 00:58:01,982
(MY MONSTAZ with B:GINNER LEE JUNMYEONG)

1097
00:58:02,082 --> 00:58:04,082
(MONSTA B with B:GINNER MOON JAEIL)

1098
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:08,360
(TOP PICK TEAM)

1099
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:13,376
It's MY MONSTAZ.

1100
00:58:13,704 --> 00:58:15,203
It's MY MONSTAZ.

1101
00:58:16,882 --> 00:58:20,149
(Round 2 TOP PICK team)
MY MONSTAZ.

1102
00:58:20,149 --> 00:58:28,082
(All MY MONSTAZ members survived)

1103
00:58:28,082 --> 00:58:30,979
Thank you.

1104
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,349
(Joy and sorrow)

1105
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:36,182
(Mixed emotions)

1106
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:38,016
(Both teams did great job)
Good job.

1107
00:58:38,016 --> 00:58:40,448
(This result is particularly heartbreaking as teammates)
Oh, so this is 'a mix of joy and sorrow.'

1108
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:46,547
MC DEX: What was the reason for choosing
MY MONSTAZ as TOP PICK between the two teams?

1109
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,147
MONSTA X KIHYUN: MONSTA B also has many
members with outstanding capabilities,

1110
00:58:51,147 --> 00:58:54,113
MONSTA X KIHYUN: but
this is a team match, right?

1111
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,480
MONSTA X KIHYUN: I thought the blend
of MY MONSTAZ's teamwork

1112
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:02,472
MONSTA X KIHYUN: and their stage
synergy was what made them stand out.

1113
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:06,580
MC DEX: MY MONSTAZ has been
selected as TOP PICK team.

1114
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,113
MC DEX: Let's hear
a word from the leader.

1115
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:15,980
SEO JUNHYEOK: Since I became
a leader during training camp,

1116
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,680
SEO JUNHYEOK: I focused most
on aligning our team's harmony,

1117
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,313
SEO JUNHYEOK: which I think is the reason
we were chosen as TOP PICK team.

1118
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:26,480
SEO JUNHYEOK: I'm
grateful to my teammates,

1119
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,480
SEO JUNHYEOK: and want
to thank MONSTA X too.

1120
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,680
SEO JUNHYEOK: I really
wanted to hear those words.

1121
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,180
SEO JUNHYEOK: "Your team
feel like a real team."

1122
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:37,180
LEE YEONTAE: Honestly,
until we stood on stage,

1123
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,680
LEE YEONTAE: we worried whether our
teamwork and harmony would show,

1124
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,413
LEE YEONTAE: and there
were many ups and downs.

1125
00:59:45,413 --> 00:59:50,113
LEE YEONTAE: But being told we looked
like one team was very meaningful.

1126
00:59:50,113 --> 00:59:53,613
LIM JIHWAN: We always
said we'd shine someday,

1127
00:59:53,613 --> 00:59:58,247
LIM JIHWAN: and getting this
reward feels really good.

1128
00:59:58,247 --> 01:00:04,511
MC DEX: The key evaluation was
ultimately how united you became.

1129
01:00:04,863 --> 01:00:09,780
MC DEX: Unfortunately, MONSTA B's B:GINNERs
that were not selected by MONSTA X

1130
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,347
MC DEX: have become
elimination candidates.

1131
01:00:12,347 --> 01:00:16,013
MC DEX: But it's too early to despair.

1132
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:21,080
MC DEX: There's one last chance to be excluded
from elimination candidates, right?

1133
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,847
MC DEX: MONSTA X
selected TOP PICK B:GINNERs,

1134
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:27,847
MC DEX: granting them
another survival chance.

1135
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,313
KANG JUNSEONG: Two members?

1136
01:00:30,413 --> 01:00:37,447
MC DEX: Who will be the TOP PICK B:GINNER
excluded from elimination?

1137
01:00:37,447 --> 01:00:38,952
MC DEX: Please announce.

1138
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:43,747
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Choosing these
TOP PICK B:GINNERs took a long time too.

1139
01:00:43,747 --> 01:00:46,880
MONSTA X KIHYUN: We picked
members who truly mastered their parts

1140
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,147
MONSTA X KIHYUN: and clearly
demonstrated their capabilities on stage.

1141
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:55,780
MONSTA X KIHYUN: Those are
the B:GINNERs we selected.

1142
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:01,313
(Round 2 TOP PICK) We'll announce.
The TOP PICK B:GINNER chosen by MONSTA X is...

1143
01:01:01,313 --> 01:01:03,347
JANG WON: Still not knowing,
'Please let it be me...'

1144
01:01:03,347 --> 01:01:06,413
HARUTO: Hearing "elimination
candidate" made me really sad.

1145
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,980
KANG JUNSEONG: Maybe I won't
be called again like last time?

1146
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:15,080
MOON JAEIL: Must make it into the two slots.
Now it's individual competition since we lost.

1147
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,780
MONSTA X KIHYUN: The TOP PICK
B:GINNER chosen by MONSTA X is...

1148
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:26,560
(Who will be the final
survivor to avoid elimination?)

1149
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:31,176
- The last chance to avoid elimination...
- TOP PICK B:GINNER is...

1150
01:01:31,176 --> 01:01:33,984
Some will have to end their
journey toward their dreams.

1151
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:35,296
This is too cruel.

1152
01:01:35,296 --> 01:01:37,280
I was feeling very nervous.

1153
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,699
(I felt really sad)
I felt really sad.

1154
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:42,976
From now on, the 48-hour
countdown begins.

1155
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:46,176
(The B:MY BOYZ signal song ringing out)

1156
01:01:46,176 --> 01:01:47,304
(The song is good, but...)

1157
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:48,008
So good.
How do I do this?

1158
01:01:48,744 --> 01:01:49,792
It's too difficult.

1159
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:54,240
You will have to perform
the signal song live in 48 hours.

1160
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,952
Excluding time for sleep
and meals, it's less than two days.

1161
01:01:57,952 --> 01:02:00,832
We practiced nonstop without
taking even a little break.

1162
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:01,678
It's scary.
