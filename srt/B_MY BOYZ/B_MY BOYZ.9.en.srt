Isn't it the Baggy Jeans Team?

20

(We are Baggy Jeans) (And the other two)
Baggy Jeans Team and these two...

21
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:45,866
- Feels like two members were added.
- Yeah, it felt like that.

22
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,300
Why did you choose 'Mirotic'?

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,000
Ah, first of all...

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,728
(Even among legendary songs,)

25
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:52,915
'Mirotic', in a way,
among TVXQ!'s songs,

26
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:54,847
(it's a legend song)
is one of the most representative songs, right?

27
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,096
(Like a legend, it has been
covered by many idols)

28
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:57,175
Besides us,

29
00:00:57,445 --> 00:00:59,400
many idol seniors have covered it.

30
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,333
The balance between soft and powerful.

31
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:04,833
It's a song with both dynamic intensity
and irresistible sexiness.

32
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:08,933
(I need to choose 'Mirotic')
I strongly felt that I have to choose this song.

33
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,900
(But there's a certain issue with the 'Mirotic' Team)
Of course, it might be the first time seeing TVXQ!,

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,533
but I think the general audience
and the masters

35
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:17,760
(For the audience, it could always feel the same)
might feel the same way.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,648
(Show a new side)
A new side...

37

(Six)
Five.

55
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,899
I heard in an interview that YEONTAE
has a hard time counting, is that so?

56
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,969
Want to count it in English? In English?

57
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,728
- Ah, it's English.
- 'One' is in English.

(Resolving the stuck part in the second lesson together)
needs to be like this.

63

this kind of team atmosphere too.'

64

yet sexy song.

seems quite far from sexy...

70
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,416
(The song 'Mirotic' has a strong sexy vibe)
It has a pretty distinct color, right?

71

challenges like this vibe.

U-KNOW's intense knee slide performance)

164
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:45,024
(Under pressure, let's at least try this performance)
I thought that if I do it, I could really pull it off.

165
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:46,772
(Sacrificing knees)

166
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:47,360
(Proud)
Not bad, right?

167
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,996
(Couldn't be as cool as senior U-KNOW)
But it wasn't that cool just now.

168
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:51,485
(Shocked)
Ah.

169
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:54,656
PARK SECHAN: I think only
TVXQ! seniors can pull this off.

170
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:55,744
PARK SECHAN: How do I do this?

171
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:57,120
(How do I do it?)
You have to do more.

172
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,639
(Have to practice to death)

173
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:02,752
(1st attempt) (2nd attempt)
(3rd attempt)

174
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:04,596
(Make it possible if it's not)
(I, PARK SECHAN, am a man who doesn't give up.)

175
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:05,443
This is better

176
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:07,287
- than before...
- Oh, my knees.

177
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:09,664
You didn't get the injury, did you?

178
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:10,611
(Got injuries on the knees
in exchange for passion)

179
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:11,968
Hey, I...

180
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,664
(Are knees important? The stage is more important to me)
- I can do this too, really. - Okay.

181
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,681
I can do it.

182
00:07:15,188 --> 00:07:17,184
PARK SECHAN: I wonder
if I can do it well,

183
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:21,984
PARK SECHAN: but on the other hand,
I think I can totally slay it.

184
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:26,423
('Rising Sun' Team's key mission:
Challenging high notes and dance) Seven, eight...

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,399
Five, six.

186
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:29,866
LEE JUNMYEONG: Since the things
I've been doing naturally

187
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,799
LEE JUNMYEONG: received criticism,
I think this song gives me a chance

188
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,616
(It's actually a chance to show growth)
LEE JUNMYEONG: to show a completely different side

189
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,344
LEE JUNMYEONG: in the next round.

190
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:39,840
KIM BOHYEON: I know
the members are talented,

191
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,752
KIM BOHYEON: so I believe that if we
all do our best, we'll naturally win.

192
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:47,474
(B:GINNER KAI ponders how to express the song's anger)
This song definitely has an angry feel...

193
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:49,664
(What's KAI's special
move to express anger?)

194
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:51,712
(Let's go!)

195
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:54,368
(Let's go!)

196
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,248
KAI: If we show our energy,

197
00:07:57,248 --> 00:08:01,568
KAI: maybe we could
get a better evaluation...

198
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:05,280

- Oh, what?
- What?

201
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:10,509
(The B:GINNERs arrive at a mysterious location)
- AI - Lies.

202
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,420
- No...
- High school?

203
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,048
- Huh?
- Oh.

204
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:15,136
(Is it a school?)
School.

205
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,608
(Why are B:GINNERs at a high school?)
Is this real?

206
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:17,920
No way.

207
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,080
(Panicked x100)
Totally panicked.

208
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:25,854
(Completely clueless, just laughing)
- What is this? - Oh, but is this right?

209
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,773
(Confused)
- Why are we at school? - At school...

210
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:30,144
Are we experiencing school lunch?

211
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,256
(Who am I, where am I?)
I'm scared, what do I do?

212
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,175
- It's a relief.
- It's a relief.

213
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:35,744
(B:GINNERs arriving at school full of questions)
I'm nervous.

214
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,936
KANG JUNSEONG: I had all sorts of thoughts,
'Are TVXQ! seniors giving us a lesson?'

215
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,848
- LIM JIHWAN: Look here! There's a ball!
- Soccer.

216
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:45,019
(There's a soccer ball!)
There's a ball, a soccer ball.

217
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,293
LI ZHIWEI: As soon as we got off
the bus, we saw this huge soccer field.

218
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,495
LI ZHIWEI: So, I thought maybe we're deciding
the order by playing soccer among ourselves.

219
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:55,488
HYO: Are we doing something
fun by playing soccer?

220
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,944
HYO: We don't have time to play around.

221
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:00,115
(The B:GINNERs are currently moving)

222
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:01,248
Hello, everyone.

223
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,720
(Masters gathered with students?)
Hello.

224
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,096
Hello.

225
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:12,212
LIA KIM: Today, the B:MY BOYZ B:GINNERs
are going to have a mid-check in front of you.

226
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:13,460
(Unexpected mid-check for Round 4)

227
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,304
(A sudden mid-check evaluation in front of over 400 students)
You all are playing a really important role today.

228
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:18,176
(The most evaluated people
in B:MY BOYZ mid-check history)

229
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:22,336
YUJU: The B:GINNERs must be
very, very nervous.

230
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:23,392
(Nervous)
Wow.

231
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:25,601
(It's the cafeteria)
Wow, it's the cafeteria.

232
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:26,944
(Mid-check evaluation even after eating?)
It's been so long.

233
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:27,876
Wow, amazing.

234
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,440
(Wow)
It's him.

235
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,336
It's the first time.

236
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh, we...

237
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,960
We came for lunch, right?

238
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:33,944
Ah.

239
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,232
Is this a classroom?

240
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:37,217
(Contrary to the B:GINNERs' hopes, passing by the cafeteria)
No, no? Why are we going up?

241
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:39,700
(B:GINNERs moving with only their curiosity growing)
Is it middle school? Or high school?

242
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:41,152
Oh, it's a gym.

243
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:42,720
It's a gym, a gym.

244
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:45,350
- PARK SECHAN: It's an auditorium.
- Wow, it's a gym.

245
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,528
(Heading straight into the auditorium)
Go in.

246
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:51,520
(Huh?)

247
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:59,840
PARK SECHAN: Suddenly, I heard cheering from the auditorium,
and I heard the familiar voices of Masters.

248
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,224
LEE YEONTAE: I couldn't even imagine,
and I couldn't imagine the place, either.

249
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,368
(Flustered)
MOON JAEIL: I was really flustered.

250
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:08,804
MOON JAEIL: All I could think about
was wanting to go home.

251
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,432
(The B:GINNERs are so flustered that they are at a loss)
Hello.

252
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:12,875
Hello.

253
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:14,560
(Amazing)

254
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:20,256
(Maximum tension) First, their expressions are
so different from what we usually see.

255
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:21,440
JINHO: You all are
really nervous, right?

256
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:22,496
- Yes.
- Yes.
Alright, then...

257
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:27,136
(Smile, guys) You're wide-eyed,
but start with a hello.

258
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,207
- Hello.
- Hello.

259
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:31,648
- We're B:MY BOYZ B:GINNERs.
- We're B:MY BOYZ B:GINNERs.

260

(Welcome)

261
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,560
Wow, the sound is so loud.

262
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:42,113
Wow.

263
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:48,720
LIA KIM: The students in front
will evaluate your performance.

264

(Out of the blue)

265
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:56,032
The order of the B:GINNERs' main stage
in Round 4

266
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:58,208
is decided by the votes after your show.

267

(What?)

268
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,017
(Will the order be decided?)
The order? Wow!

269
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:09,005
PARK SECHAN: Performing in front of
the students made my hands shake.

270
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,504
LIM JIHWAN: Doing a mid-check
in front of the students. Really?

271
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:19,872
AI: I thought, "We've only practiced
for three days. Can we do well?"

272
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:23,360
LEE YUJEONG: We need to decide
the order for the mid-check stage, right?

273
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,008
LEE YUJEONG: The leaders will come out
and decide the order by rock-paper-scissors.

274
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:29,884
Fighting.

275
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:32,672
HYO: I want to go second.

276
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:37,264
KIM BOHYEON: If we go later,
won't the tension decrease a bit?

277
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,200
KANG JUNSEONG: I really want to win.

278
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,770
- I trust you.
- Let's go. Rock-paper-scissors.

279

(Scissors, Rock, Rock)

280
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,512
(Is this real?)

281
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,872
PARK SECHAN: Please, anything but first.
If we're not first, I'll consider it half done.

282
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,856
PARK SECHAN: But we lost right away.

283
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:00,704
PARK SECHAN: It's over.

284
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,896
(So sorry)
HYO: I'm sorry.

285
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,808
(Frozen in place, leaving HYO all alone)
Come on, rock-paper-scissors.

286
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,886
(Rock-paper-scissors for the final team)
Rock-paper-scissors.

287
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:12,704
Yeah!

288
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:16,178
(The Mirotic Team: Last one)
Last. Absolutely last.

289
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,144
(The Keep Your Head Down Team: Second one)
Oh, you did well.

290
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,096
You did well.

291
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:21,216
Let's proceed like this.

292
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,999
Fighting.

293
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,376
Fighting!

294
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,912
(Voices of support
sent to the B:GINNERs)

295
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:30,656
LIM JIHWAN: I wanted to feed off
the energy of the previous team.

296
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,928
LIM JIHWAN: But since that didn't
happen, it's a bit disappointing...

297
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:36,608
LI ZHIWEI: Today was a sudden mission,
but we'll do well for sure.

298
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,616
Two, three.

299
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:40,184
- Hello.
- Hello.

300
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,496
- We are the Rising Sun Team.

HYO: Hello, I'm Leopard HYO
from B:MY BOYZ.

304
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,884
(Nice to meet you)

AI: Hello, I'm AI who wants
to become your baby.

306
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,033

(Hello, my friend)

311
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:13,164
Well done. You must do it.

312
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:16,492
(Satisfied) (Well done, PARK SECHAN)
Alright. Share your confident points

313
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:20,370
and what you want the audience
to notice. Then, start singing.

314
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:25,484
HYO: I think the first part of
the chorus is quite impactful.

315
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:28,396
HYO: So, I'd appreciate it
if you could check that part.

316
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:29,760
(I'll definitely watch it)

317
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,340
They sound nervous.

Don't be nervous.

322
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:43,628
(The Rising Sun Team is encouraging
each other) Fighting.

323
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:45,055
Make sure the formation
is aligned properly.

Yes.

605
00:26:45,707 --> 00:26:47,407

anger towards an ex-lover?

618

It's not just a little anger.

619

This song is...

620
00:27:26,704 --> 00:27:28,624
(It's like hitting with words)
It's almost literally hitting with words.

621
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:31,931
But, your basic mood has to match that.

622
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:32,848
(Keep Your Head Down Team was lacking in expressing
the intense anger of the song)

623
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:34,960
(And the following dance class?)

(This is total rage)
This is total rage, total rage.

625

This is real anger.

626
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,112
You can't be too gentle.

00:27:42,112 --> 00:27:47,888
HARUTO: During the mid-check, I did my best, but
they said I couldn't control my facial expression well.

628
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:49,584
It was a bit disappointing

629
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,416
(Keep Your Head Down Team knew
the 'rage' keyword but lacked expression)

630
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:54,141
That maddening, infuriating feeling…

631
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:56,752
LIA KIM: I'd love to see you express
being insanely angry properly.

632
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:57,441
Alright.

633
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:59,241
Have you ever been really
angry at someone?

634
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:03,160
I don't think I've ever been angry enough
to express it in a song like this.

635
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,176
(B:GINNER LEE YUNSUNG hasn't
felt enough anger to express the song)

636
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:06,474
LIA KIM: Then, how do you express anger?

637
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:07,641
Crying.

638
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,583
(The past days when I swallowed anger with tears...)
Crying? Oh, dear.

639
00:28:10,032 --> 00:28:10,824
(What should I do)
Too soft.

640
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:14,224
(Tears should stop instead of anger)
No, no, no, no.

641
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:17,544
(I'm going to say something painful)
I'm going to say something a little painful.

642
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:21,435
(It looks really cool only when KAI appears)
Only when KAI appears does it look really cool.

643
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:23,372
Let's go!

644
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:27,376
(B:GINNER KAI certainly made
an impression during the mid-check)

645
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:34,574
(Other members who had
relatively weak presence)

646
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,851
(Except for KAI, everything else is very unstable)

might get overshadowed by KAI.

criticized for their song interpretation and expression)

652
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:58,800
(Rising Sun Team's dance master class after the mid-check)
How was it during the mid-check?

653
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,483
(I was really surprised...)
I was surprised.

654
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:01,241
Were you surprised?

655
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:04,641
HYO: I thought, I need
to work a little harder.

656
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:06,207
LIA KIM: First, let me talk
about the overall things.

657
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:10,441
LIA KIM: Every time HYO
comes out, it's really cool.

658
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:15,504
(Dominating the stage with a powerful rap
starting the performance, HYO)

659
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,811

you get this really intense feeling.

660
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:22,416
(But in that momentum, the dangerous one is AI B:GINNER)
The really dangerous person is AI.

661
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:26,864
LIA KIM: HYO comes out, and
then AI follows behind.

662
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:27,745
Right?

663
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:29,841

that HYO has built up.

669
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,168
(At this rate, AI is in danger)
It felt exactly like it was dangerous, right?

670
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:59,104
AI: In fact, what I felt
while practicing was,

671
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:08,048
AI: I thought I had less power and
impact compared to B:GINNER HYO.

So, let's try using a bit more energy.

679

Ultimately, this song isn't meant to be sung brightly.

684
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:43,841
JINHO: Think carefully
about your own lyrics.

685

JINHO: What your lyrics are expressing.

686

vocals that match them.

the song properly.

We are a bit... yesterday we were...

696

to understanding the song.

697
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:23,907
(Focused only on live practice, missed the interpretation)
I thought immersion was more important.

698
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:27,941
LIM JIHWAN: Then, maybe we
can apply it to our situation.

699
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:33,274
(We need our own interpretation of the song)
If we find something, it might be easier to immerse ourselves.

Five, six, seven, go.

808
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:44,934
Anger, anger.

809
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,934
Anger, anger. AI.

810
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:50,501
(Still a stiff-faced B:GINNER AI's expression)
One, two. AI, your expression.

811
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:54,634
LIA KIM: You don't really get
the vibe of this song, do you?

812
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:59,920
AI: I translated it into
Japanese and studied.

813
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,967
LIA KIM: It seems like you're not sure
what expression to make with this song.

814
00:37:16,664 --> 00:37:17,984
It's okay, it's okay.

815
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:29,101
AI: After the mid-check,
I felt pressured to work hard too.

816
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:34,067
AI: I felt overwhelmed with anxiety
about whether I could do it. So I cried.

817
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:39,034
PENTAGON JINHO: Don't overthink it,
just think as if you're getting angry.

818
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:44,567
HYO: AI is too nice,
so he doesn't know how to be angry.

819
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:51,801
(What's anger?
B:GINNER AI who is usually full of smiles)

820
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,976
Just look in the mirror with these expressions.

821
00:37:53,976 --> 00:37:55,544
Yes, that's right.

822
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:59,192
Think it over, and you'll get it, okay?

823
00:37:59,192 --> 00:38:00,134
(Master JINHO teaching expression
to pressured B:GINNER AI)

824
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:06,534
AI: I want to work hard
and show them how well I do.

825
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:11,896
AI: Through this stage, I hope
I can show some growth.

826
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:17,034
(Next, the rehearsal of the Mirotic team)
Hello, we are the Mirotic team.

827
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:20,401
HYO: It seems the Mirotic team
is being closely watched.

828
00:38:20,784 --> 00:38:24,464
KANG JUNSEONG: I wonder if the Mirotic
team will show a different image this time too.

829
00:38:24,464 --> 00:38:27,504
KANG JUNSEONG: I wonder if they
will portray the same image.

Honestly, right now you guys

844
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:21,706
are the member combination
we're most excited about,

845
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:25,920
but there's a sense of limitation
in your expression.

846
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,421
LEE YUJEONG: Do you guys feel
like you're trapped in the song?

847
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:34,826
(Problem arose while pursuing sexiness)
Because of the concept, it feels like...

848

You're losing to the song
right now, right?

849
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,408
I think that's the case.

I think those things
are really noticeable.

851
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,176
You're not doing what you used to do well,

852
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,891
and at the same time,
I don't think you've nailed the concept either.

I feel like still

854
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:55,668
YANG HYEONBIN: we're lacking in
expressions and emotional delivery.

855
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:59,835
LEE YEONTAE: I think we
were trapped in the mindset

856
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:04,268
LEE YEONTAE: of just focusing on the practice
and sticking to what we had rehearsed,

857
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:09,935
LEE YEONTAE: and so failed to capture
the mood and relaxation of the song.

858
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:15,135
(The Mirotic team feels slightly unsatisfied)
I believe that when every team member fully expresses that mood,

859
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:17,237
there will be a catharsis,

860
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,677
and that's when you'll get good results
in tomorrow's competition.

JINHO: Overall,

878
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:13,468
JINHO: it was good that each part had
expressive facial expressions, but

879
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:19,468
It seems like
you've never shown hatred...

880
00:41:19,502 --> 00:41:24,149
The basic mood itself is weak and seems timid.

(The Keep Your Head Down team
still hasn't solved their keyword "anger")

882

Your team seemed unable
to fully express it.

883
00:41:26,168 --> 00:41:27,655
It wasn't the kind of performance

884
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:28,761
that really pulled us in.

885
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:32,702
LIA KIM: It didn't feel
like it's full of confidence.

886
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:36,235
(Master LIA KIM giving final feedback)
This song is just pure anger,

887
00:41:36,235 --> 00:41:38,168
it's just anger itself...

888
00:41:38,702 --> 00:41:39,573
We'll completely dominate the stage.

889
00:41:39,573 --> 00:41:40,668
We'll just

realized "Oh, we were like that." quickly.

987
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,697

990
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:46,287
Too bad.

1011
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:49,031

00:46:56,931 --> 00:46:58,597
KIM BOHYEON: TVXQ U-KNOW had

1016
00:46:58,597 --> 00:47:02,597
KIM BOHYEON: such an aura and
presence that it gave me chills.

1017
00:47:02,597 --> 00:47:07,031
PARK SECHAN: He's a world-class idol,
even without saying it.

1018
00:47:07,097 --> 00:47:08,271
(Legend acknowledged)
He is indeed a legend.

1019
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:10,348
Truly a legend.

1020
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:14,231

appreciate the kind words.

1025
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:29,697
It's actually my 22nd year
since debuting with TVXQ.

1026
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:31,855
(Born 22 years ago)

1027
00:47:31,855 --> 00:47:33,031
(Born 16 years ago)

1028
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:36,464
TVXQ U-KNOW: It feels like I debuted
before the B:GINNERs were even born.

1029
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:39,231
TVXQ U-KNOW: But actually,
before judging today,

1030
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,597
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I watched all
the videos you've done so far.

1031
00:47:45,743 --> 00:47:48,331
KANG JUNSEONG: Ah,
I shouldn't be nervous.

1032
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:52,559
KAI: Everyone's expressions changed suddenly,
and it seems like we got quite nervous.

1033
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:56,297
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Watching the B:GINNERs,
I hope to regain my original mindset

1034
00:47:56,397 --> 00:48:01,131
TVXQ! U-KNOW: and exchange positive
energy with each other.

1035
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,264
(Strange feelings, pleasant yet scary)

1036
00:48:03,264 --> 00:48:05,464

through all the performance videos?

the theme for today's Round 4,

1040
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,375

1046
00:48:31,087 --> 00:48:35,087
MC DEX: First, I'll reveal the song
for the selected song match.

1047
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:37,999
(Harmony of intensity
and sophistication)

1048
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:42,479
Rising Sun.

1049
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:43,663
(The spell that enchanted everyone)

1050
00:48:43,663 --> 00:48:48,111
Mirotic.

1051
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:50,575
(Emphasizing power and precision)

1052
00:48:50,575 --> 00:48:54,364
Keep Your Head Down.

MC MIYEON: And also,

1056
00:48:58,264 --> 00:49:01,711
(Addictiveness) B:GINNERs will use legendary
keywords that represent the history of K-POP,

1057
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:05,519
(Dynamism) and each team will create
their own intro for TVXQ!'s iconic song

1058
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,591
(Connectivity)
as part of the selected song match.

where all teams will perform TVXQ!'s Hug,

their debut.

1062
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:19,197
(I love it)

1063
00:49:19,197 --> 00:49:22,664
MC MIYEON: The song match for Hug
will have all the teams come up on stage

1064
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:24,031
MC MIYEON: and showcase
their live performances

1065
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,703
MC MIYEON: of the parts they've chosen.
B:IN US, we'd appreciate it

1066
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:29,263
MC MIYEON: if you could watch
the B:GINNERs' stages closely.

1067
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:33,764

on stage is to bring out your charm.

1072
00:49:53,765 --> 00:50:00,335
TVXQ! U-KNOW: The best way to get
a high score is to reveal your true self.

1073
00:50:00,335 --> 00:50:04,687
MC MIYEON: Let's begin
the B:MY BOYZ Round 4 now.

00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:19,887
Starting with Rising Sun?

1083
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:21,221
(Heart pounding)
Oh really?

1084
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:21,871
(K-POP Legend Match)

1085
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:22,990
It's Rising Sun.

1086
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,097
(A classic song that makes your
heart react with just the intro)

1087
00:50:27,297 --> 00:50:29,664
MC DEX: What does this song mean?

1088
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:32,864
TVXQ! U-KNOW: This song is an SMP
track, which set the direction

1089
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:33,295
for TVXQ!'s music.

1090
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:35,055
(It's the start of the SMP genre)
I believe it's a song that helps us

1091
00:50:36,244 --> 00:50:42,507
understand K-POP music
to some extent today.

1092
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:44,335

looking forward to is

1094

(The senior said he's
looking forward to it)

1096
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:55,497
(Rising Sun team's tension
level has risen by 200 percent)

1097

TVXQ!'s legendary song, Rising Sun team,

1098

the stage for the first team.

1099
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,179

(Expectant look)

1101
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:14,767
- Hello.

- We are Rising Sun team.

1104
00:51:18,927 --> 00:51:20,271
(Gulp)

1105
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:24,015
MC DEX: It's the first time I've seen B:GINNERs
so nervous, isn't it the same for you?

1106
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:27,121
(The reason B:GINNERs
are especially nervous is...)

1107
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:29,903
(Just like God)
There's a person like God,

1108
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:32,916
(Untouchable force)
with something different about the aura.

1109
00:51:33,263 --> 00:51:36,897
(Frozen in front of the legend)
I was overwhelmed.

1110
00:51:36,897 --> 00:51:40,797
MC MIYEON: U-KNOW, you might
also have questions for the B:GINNERs.

1111
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,031
MC MIYEON: Please ask your questions.

1112
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,197
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Since the intro is
an important part, have you thought

1113
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:50,575
TVXQ! U-KNOW: about which keywords and what
kind of creation would be good to showcase?

1114
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:52,303
Who would like to answer
as a representative?

1115
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:54,031
TVXQ! U-KNOW: There's a B:GINNER whose answer
I'm really looking forward to hearing.

1116
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:55,023
Ah yes.

1117
00:51:55,023 --> 00:51:56,672
(B:GINNER AI)
AI.

1118
00:51:56,672 --> 00:51:57,487
Yes.

1120
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:03,055
AI: I did listen carefully to
senior U-KNOW's question,

1121
00:52:03,055 --> 00:52:05,775
AI: but for a moment,
my mind went blank.

1122
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:08,500
(Korean language skills fully activated)
Our concept is...

1123
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,688
AI: Since our concept was 'addictiveness,'

1124
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:14,288
(The one who's speaking earnestly).
AI: it was hard to express that,

1125
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,632
(The one who's observing closely)
AI: so we came up with

1126
00:52:18,016 --> 00:52:20,859
(You're doing well)
AI: a clock-like choreography

1127
00:52:21,897 --> 00:52:23,897
AI: and synchronized it together.

1128
00:52:23,897 --> 00:52:26,080
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Did you match it like that?

1129
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:28,271
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Well done.

1130
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:29,583
(Proud)
You did very well.

1131
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,704
The keyword addictiveness means
there should be

1132
00:52:32,704 --> 00:52:36,324
a point that sticks with you
even after hearing it just once, right?

1133
00:52:36,324 --> 00:52:40,824
HYO: I looked at the lyrics, and since
there's a lot of talk about time...

1134
00:52:40,832 --> 00:52:43,488
(Time holds the only answer)
HYO: It seems like time is a recurring theme,

1135
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:47,520
(The idea to use the sound of a clock)
HYO: so I'd love to incorporate a clock.

1136
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,560
I have an idea, how about
we all sit in a circle...

1137
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,357
(The B:GINNERs become clock hands)
One, two, three, four.

1138
00:52:54,357 --> 00:52:57,190
(Large human clock)
Five, six, seven, eight.

1139
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:02,290
HYO: If the ticking sound repeats
too much, it can get boring, right?

1140
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:08,224
- Right.
- HYO: I think it was challenging to figure out

1141
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:11,232
HYO: how we could connect that
to the original song and express it,

1142
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:13,952
HYO: but it was still fun to create.

1143
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,240
Great, B:MY BOYZ Round 4,

1144
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,696
K-POP Legend Match first stage.

1145
00:53:21,696 --> 00:53:23,936
MC DEX: Let's watch
the Rising Sun stage.

1146
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:25,249
Fighting, fighting!

1147
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:28,950
Two, three.

1148
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,501
- Rising Sun.
- Rising Sun.

1149
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:34,400
(Energy ready)

1150
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,584
- Right.
- Okay.

1151
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:36,864
Let's do well, everyone.

1152
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:41,124
HYO: During our mid-check...

1153
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:46,424
HYO: Actually, during yesterday's rehearsal,
we received some disappointing feedback.

1154
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:51,712
HYO: Can we do this? I think
there was anxiety as well.

1155
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:59,224
HYO: I thought it would actually be
better to transform that anxious feeling

1156
00:53:59,224 --> 00:54:01,157
HYO: into a rebellious mindset.

1157
00:54:01,216 --> 00:54:05,650
(A leader HYO's resolution)
Rebel against your anxious self, let's win.

1158
00:54:06,752 --> 00:54:09,312
(The determination to burn everything)
Let's really set this stage on fire.

1159
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:12,960
We will create a stage that will imprint
on your hearts like the sound of a clock.

1162
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,696

I got goosebumps.

1167

Oh, the expression.

1222
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,990
TVXQ! U-KNOW: First of all,
you worked really hard.

1223
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,790
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Being the first to
perform in a competition like this

1224
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,690
TVXQ! U-KNOW: can actually have a lot
of downsides and anxious moments.

1225
00:59:03,224 --> 00:59:05,890
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Because it can be
really pressuring.

1226
00:59:06,132 --> 00:59:08,384
TVXQ! U-KNOW: But the B:GINNERs had
such great energy.

1227
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:10,957
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I felt that.

1228
00:59:10,957 --> 00:59:13,792
He said exactly what we were

1229
00:59:14,132 --> 00:59:16,124

1230
00:59:16,124 --> 00:59:19,490
PARK JUNHYEOK: so it felt like
we solved a huge problem.

1231
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,272
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I was really curious
about how you would

1232
00:59:22,432 --> 00:59:24,090
TVXQ! U-KNOW: express
the intro choreography,

1233
00:59:24,324 --> 00:59:26,724
TVXQ! U-KNOW: and now I understand
why you chose to represent it with a clock.

1234
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:29,120
TVXQ! U-KNOW: During the part
where the music flows

1235
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,296
TVXQ! U-KNOW: and there's that
sharp burst, the energy from

1236
00:59:31,296 --> 00:59:36,357
TVXQ! U-KNOW: all of you really popped
forward, making it easier to watch.

1237
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:41,124
TVXQ! U-KNOW: In the intro, the B:GINNER
AI even executed two kicks, right?

1238
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,824
TVXQ! U-KNOW: That kind of movement

1239
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:47,457
TVXQ! U-KNOW: was really great.

1240
00:59:47,891 --> 00:59:50,690
We did the intro really cool,
highlighting the point a bit.

1241
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,824
- They made all the changes exactly.
- Yes.

1242
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,890
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Musically speaking,
the B:GINNER HYO starts with the rap,

1243
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,457
TVXQ! U-KNOW: and that's
the most important part.

(In a charismatic tone)

1245
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:07,690
(Rap that was stable in pitch and tempo)

1246
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,890
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Personally, today, I think

1247
01:00:09,957 --> 01:00:12,160
TVXQ! U-KNOW: the B:GINNER HYO
did a great job opening the door

1248
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,560

- This song especially suits HYO.
- Yeah.

1252
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:25,457

01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,416

today, right?

1255
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:29,920
- LI ZHIWEI: Yes.
- TVXQ! U-KNOW: I see.

master of B:MY BOYZ)

1257
01:00:34,724 --> 01:00:37,390

possibly due to nerves)

1258
01:00:37,472 --> 01:00:39,790
TVXQ! U-KNOW: This place is
rather to see the potential,

1259
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:42,424
TVXQ! U-KNOW: so I think you should
grow that potential.

1260
01:00:42,657 --> 01:00:48,190
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I was really looking forward to
how B:GINNER LIM JIHWAN would do the final Rise Up.

01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:52,057
(The legendary ending section
that's now become a classic)

1262
01:00:52,057 --> 01:00:54,190
TVXQ! U-KNOW: There must
have been two answers.

1263
01:00:54,368 --> 01:00:58,624
TVXQ! U-KNOW: It seems like it was
a choice between focusing on

1264
01:00:58,624 --> 01:01:01,657
TVXQ! U-KNOW: the performance
or showcasing more of Rise Up rock style.

1265
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:06,924
(A reinterpretation of
Rise Up in their own style)

1266
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:11,824
TVXQ! U-KNOW: But I think you guys expressed
unique charm, so that part felt clean and sincere.

1267
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:17,757
TVXQ! U-KNOW: However, when I have
to give a more objective evaluation,

1268
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,757
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I think your team focused

1269
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:23,124
TVXQ! U-KNOW: a little too
much on the dance aspect.

1270

(A slight sense of disappointment
felt in breath or tempo)

1271
01:01:29,824 --> 01:01:31,824
TVXQ! U-KNOW: You guys pushed forward
with momentum,

1272
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:35,257

it a bit more, it would be really great.

a lot even on stage, and it was so good.

01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,321
(Hoping they will continue to
Rise Up even more in the future.)

1283
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:09,520
The final hurdle is…

1284
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,328
The last round just
before the live broadcast is…

1285
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:12,784
- I have to win.
- I want to win.

1286
01:02:12,784 --> 01:02:14,105
('I want to debut')
I thought, 'Let's show everything without any regrets.'

1287
01:02:15,392 --> 01:02:17,760
You missed the beat slightly, huh?

1288
01:02:18,689 --> 01:02:20,263
If only I had done well…

1289
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:23,488
There were some disappointing parts.
You poured too much energy into it.

1290
01:02:23,488 --> 01:02:25,248
I'm scared I might get eliminated.

1291
01:02:25,248 --> 01:02:28,128
Since there was some regret, I thought,
'I have to do the 'HUG' stage well.'

1292
01:02:28,128 --> 01:02:29,664
Rather than thinking about competing,

1293
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:32,384
I thought, 'Let's create
a great stage together…'

1294
01:02:32,384 --> 01:02:34,784
It felt like we were
members debuting together.

1295
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,192
(For a moment, like one team)
I felt like we had become one team.

1296
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:38,272
There were moments
that made me feel choked up.

1297
01:02:38,272 --> 01:02:39,936
The feeling was kind of strange.

1298
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:42,112
The fact that we can't be
a team together again…

1299
01:02:42,112 --> 01:02:45,152
But I also thought, 'I could get
eliminated if I'm not careful.'
