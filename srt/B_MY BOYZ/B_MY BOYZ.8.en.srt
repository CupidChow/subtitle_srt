really too good, aren't they?

168
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:51,499
(The first 'BOOMERANG' is hard to distinguish superiority)
MC DEX: did perfectly on the first stage,

169
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,599
(The last important stage 'Burn It Up' that will determine victory and defeat)
MC DEX: so I think the winner will be decided in this second stage.

we don't know either.

can't afford to lose,

The stage is all about energy, right?

185

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,888
(Mouth corners endlessly rising)

472
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:14,208
BAN DANIEL: As much as I practiced,
I also received a lot of praise.

473
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,233
BAN DANIEL: I smiled while judging.

474
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:20,768
(What about Boo+It Up Team?) (Hesitant)
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: Boo+It Up Team... You...

475
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,352
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: Why did
Boo+It Up Team choose 'Burn It Up'...

476
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,500
(Surprised)

477
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,500
(What kind of evaluation will
the Boo+It Up Team receive?)

478
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,640
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: Boo+It Up Team...

479
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:40,173
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: You...

480
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:45,204
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON:
I could see exactly why this team

481
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,164
- AB6IX LEE DAE HWI (WANNA ONE): Smart.
- WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: chose the song,

482
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:47,668
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: 'Burn It Up.'

483
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,204
(Relief) WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON:
It was such a solid performance.

484
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:53,173
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON:
Compared to our stage,

485
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,252
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: I thought
they did better than our WANNA ONE.

486
00:20:56,106 --> 00:20:57,684
(High praise)

487
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:58,548
Amazing.

488
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,739
(The highest praise sought by all)
- It's the highest compliment. - Really.

489
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:05,606
AB6IX PARK WOOJIN (WANNA ONE): I noticed
B:GINNER KIM JEONGHOON

490
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:07,106
AB6IX PARK WOOJIN (WANNA ONE):
did pretty good this time.

491
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:15,439
(B:GINNER KIM JEONGHOON,
commanding presence at the center)

492
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:16,884
(B:GINNER KIM JEONGHOON recognized
by masters) Yes, KIM JEONGHOON.

493
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,269
Time to be noticed.

494
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,244
(B:GINNER KIM JEONGHOON, strong contender for
the TOP PICK) Shouldn't JEONGHOON also aim for it?

495
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:21,204
Yeah.

496
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:22,548
In the Boo+It Up Team,
KIM JEONGHOON stands out distinctly.

497
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,752
Right.

498
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:26,106
KIM JEONGHOON: Honestly, I don't remember
what happened on the stage.

499
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:32,573
KIM JEONGHOON: I stood there with my mind clear.
Ultimately, I proved my presence.

500
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:34,139
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG:
One more thing surprised me.

501
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:39,639
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG: B:GINNER MOON JAEIL,
your dance background really showed.

502
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:42,206
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG:
Your wave is next level!

503
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:49,206
(The soft charisma of B:GINNER
MOON JAEIL's powerful dancing)

504
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,873
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG: It was so sexy.

505
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:51,348
Thank you.

506
00:21:51,348 --> 00:21:52,724
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG:
You dance is amazingly well.

507
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:54,484
HUI: Ah, but this time MOON JAEIL

508
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:55,732
(Feedback received)
HUI: is completely...

509
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:56,468
MOON JAEIL did so well.

510
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:57,812
(Completely changed B:GINNER MOON JAEIL)
It seems like his charm just exploded.

511
00:21:57,812 --> 00:21:58,644
He broke through that wall of...
(Admit it)
Opened up, right?

512
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:01,556
I think he completely broke his wall.

513
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:03,252
Once again,

514
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:07,039
I expected a neck-and-neck result.

515
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,820
Thank you. Both teams did an amazing job.

516
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:12,239
(End of Round 3 final stage)
Thank you.

517
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,492
(To the B:GINNERs who did their best)
You worked hard.

518
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:14,740
(Warm applause from WANNA ONE)
So cool.

519
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:17,509
You guys are the best, the best.

520
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,300
(You worked hard)

521
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,106
Well done.

522
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:27,606
PARK SECHAN: We really
did well without regrets.

523
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:29,108
(Boo+It Up team, you all did an amazing job)
Everyone worked hard.

524
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:30,039
Still, being able to perform

525
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,206
MOON JAEIL: with this
transformed version of ourselves

526
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:36,692
(Today, one step more than yesterday, our stage)
made me feel like everyone has grown a bit more.

527
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,973
JANG WON: I poured
everything into the stage.

528
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:44,698
There's a bit of regret,
but I don't think I have any regrets.

529
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:48,939
KAI: This time, I truly
feel like we worked harder

530
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,124
than in any of the previous rounds.

531
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:51,796
That's right.

532
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:56,939
And gave it our all without any regrets.

533
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:03,124
I just want to say, no matter the outcome,
let's keep fighting.

534
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:08,073
(Passing through the darkness,
dreaming of a shining tomorrow, 'us')

535
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:11,373
MC MIYEON: Finally, all the battles
of the 3rd round are over.

536
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:16,806
(The fateful time that came without a break)
Then, we will now announce the B:GINNER'S PICK Match results.

537
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:18,173
(ROUND 3 TOP PICK)

538
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:21,939
MC DEX: Before that, let me tell
you how TOP PICK is selected.

539
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:24,180
For this round, the winning
team from each match

540
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,972
(TOP PICK selection method)
will select two top picks, and the losing team will select one.

541
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:33,012
In total, six B:GINNERs
from the four teams

542
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,700
will be selected as
the TOP PICKs for Round 3.

543
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,788
- Huh?
- What?

544
00:23:36,788 --> 00:23:37,638
What?

545
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:41,606
KANG JUNSEONG: Even if we win, if not selected
as a TOP PICK, I could still be a candidate for elimination...

546
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:43,739
KIM JEONGHOON: So, winning
doesn't mean survival for sure.

547
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:44,596
(TOP PICK rules different
from previous rounds)

548
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:46,045
This rule change is...

549
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:47,892
Select two TOP PICKS
from the winning team.

550
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:48,884
- And from the losing team...
- One TOP PICK.

551
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:49,908
Select one TOP PICK.

552
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:53,428
Exactly, just because your team wins

553
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:54,132
doesn't mean you

554
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,924
automatically win as an individual.

555
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:58,164
It's like a team battle, but really
it's an individual competition, huh?

556
00:23:58,164 --> 00:23:59,339
- That's right.
- Right.

557
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:01,799
(JANG WON 1st round 17th place, 2nd round 12th place)
JANG WON: While preparing this,

558
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,006
JANG WON: I really hoped all our team would survive.

559
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:06,873
JANG WON: I thought it would be nice if we
became the TOP PICK TEAM, but what's this?

560
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:10,663
(SEO JUNHYEOK 1st round 11th place, 2nd round 19th place)
SEO JUNHYEOK: I'm not confident about

561
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:11,973
SEO JUNHYEOK: receiving TOP PICK individually.

562
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:15,006
(KIM JEONGHOON 1st round Rank 26, 2nd round Rank 22)
KIM JEONGHOON: So if we just lose it's really very dangerous.

563
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:17,139
KIM JEONGHOON: We wouldn't
know even if we win.

564
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,339
KIM JEONGHOON: So, I thought,
"Ah, we should just win no matter what."

565
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:24,873
Additionally, the B:GINNERs
from the winning team will receive

566
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:28,039
an extra 100 points added
to their individual vote tally.

567
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:28,753
If we win?

568
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:30,100
If we win, there's a bonus point too.

569
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,548
100 votes.

570
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:33,639
And the B:GINNERs who were not selected

571
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,239
will all become elimination candidates.

572
00:24:36,244 --> 00:24:38,739
(Except these six, the rest
are candidates for elimination)

573
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:39,806
(A challenging moment even for
audition seniors WANNA ONE)

574
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:41,139
Not easy.

575
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:43,444
(WANNA ONE's waiting room)
Difficult to choose.

576
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:45,297
Too difficult, huh?

577
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:50,260
(Selecting the TOP PICK TEAM
is also a difficult task)

578
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,586
(Refer to the stage video for a cautious evaluation)
Can I watch this video for a moment?

579
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:52,340
(Refer to the stage video
for a cautious evaluation)

580
00:24:58,036 --> 00:24:59,444
(HYO with good pronunciation when rapping)
He has really good pronunciation.

581
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,036
Yeah, that's true.
He doesn't seem to be Japanese.

582
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,388
AB6IX LEE DAEHWI (WANNA ONE):
This B:GINNER is kind of like me.

583
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:07,636
Oh right, oh right.

584
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,244
- WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG: Oh right.
- Yeah?

585
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:12,884
(B:MY BOYZ's LEE DAEHWI = AI?)

586
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:13,652
AI is better than you.

587
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,470
He's better than me.

588
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:20,244
(LI ZHIWEI's singing ability praised by all)
AB6IX LEE DAEHWI (WANNA ONE): LI ZHIWEI is really good.

589
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:21,236
Really good.

590
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,639
He solved everything.

591
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:23,668
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON:
Honestly, I'll choose LI ZHIWEI.

592
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:25,684
AB6IX LEE DAEHWI (WANNA ONE): I think
everyone will choose LI ZHIWEI for this stage.

593
00:25:25,684 --> 00:25:26,708
(Well)

594
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,764
Is it different?

595
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:31,956
AB6IX PARK WOOJIN (WANNA ONE): The one my eyes were
constantly drawn to overall was B:GINNER KIM BOHYEON.

596
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,540
(BOHYEON with a solid tone)
His voice is so nice.

597
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,596
Right, he did well.

598
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:38,825
Certainly solid and very good.

599
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:43,073
AB6IX LEE DAEHWI (WANNA ONE): Looking at
the whole stage, I think B:GINNER BOHYEON did better.

600
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:44,084
It's 2:2.

601
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,268
Who did you choose? LI ZHIWEI?

602
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:46,006
I also chose LI ZHIWEI.

603
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:48,573
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG: I couldn't take my eyes
off him because his live performance was just that good.

604
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:50,239
(Cannot agree)

605
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,773
You don't understand
the struggles of high notes, huh?

606
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:54,406
We don't know.

607
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:56,308
(Can't relate because can't do high notes)
You've never tried hitting high notes, right?

608
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:56,916
Oh, but...
Not once...

609
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:58,676
(The continued Beautiful stage was...)

610
00:25:58,676 --> 00:25:59,873
Ah, it was so sad.

611
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:01,773
AB6IX LEE DAEHWI (WANNA ONE):
Around this time, tears welled up right?

612
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:03,252
(Beautiful brought back old memories)
Seems like watching our old stage.

613
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:03,988
That's right.

614
00:26:03,988 --> 00:26:05,316
I thought of our last concert.

615
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:08,724
(And in the Burn+Merang team)

616
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:10,132
KAI kind of has it, right?

617
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:11,673
AB6IX PARK WOOJIN (WANNA ONE):
Yes, the vibe.

618
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:12,573
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON:
He's got a certain vibe, doesn't he?

619
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,116
(KAI was most impressive in Burn+Merang team)
Ah, the opening is good.

620
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:16,564
KAI.

621
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:17,856
Oh, KAI did well.

622
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:22,639
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON:
B:GINNER BAN DANIEL has a great passion.

623
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:23,706
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG:
I'll choose team Burn+Merang.

624
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:25,940
(Burn+Merang team with growth potential)
In the long run, I think this team has a lot of potential.

625
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,836
You saw their potential?
Yeah, I think they have
a lot of potential too.

626
00:26:27,773 --> 00:26:30,406
AB6IX PARK WOOJIN (WANNA ONE):
B:GINNER BAN DANIEL is still very young.

627
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:33,239
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: I'm totally
the opposite. I want to choose team Boo+It Up.

628
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,388
(Boo+It Up team's stage is...)

629
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:35,991
So good, so good.

630
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:39,939
AB6IX LEE DAEHWI (WANNA ONE):
How did they synchronize their dance well?

631
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:43,380
I think Boo+It Up team

632
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:46,906
did well because
the balance overall was good.

633
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,673
AB6IX PARK WOOJIN (WANNA ONE):
In a team battle,

634
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,739
AB6IX PARK WOOJIN(WANNA ONE): it's important
for individuals to stand out, but harmony is key too.

635
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:54,740
(As expected of Avengers, team
Boo+It Up showed perfect teamwork)

636
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,330
(Watching the video)
Watching makes it more confusing.

637
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,339
AB6IX LEE DAEHWI (WANNA ONE):
Both did very well.

638
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:00,500
Actually, I have one in mind.

639
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:01,780
- Me too.
- Me too.
Actually, I chose.

640
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,116
But that's just your opinion.

641
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:07,720
(Let's discuss and decide)
I'm expressing my opinion now. You should express yours too.

642
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:10,164
(After much thought, who will
be WANNA ONE's TOP PICK?)

662

The Energy+Full team had amazing teamwork,

664
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:28,756
(Energy+Full that created an emotional stage with great teamwork)
and we could feel the same emotion we felt,

665
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:32,416
so we chose them.

666
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,821

that B:GINNER HYO sang is my part, and for that part,

680
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,939
I think he did better than me.

681
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:30,100

699
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:25,617

and genuinely happy.

707

Everyone showed their absolute best.

735
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,783

made mistakes, so anyone could have been the TOP PICK.

746

more on myself and neglected the team a bit.

WILLIAM: to share the stage with them.

925
00:43:04,884 --> 00:43:08,217
IKUTO: What I felt during
B:MY BOYZ was that

926
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:11,950
IKUTO: my skills were lacking
compared to the other B:GINNERs,

927
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:16,350
IKUTO: so honestly, I wondered if
debuting here would be difficult.

928
00:43:16,617 --> 00:43:23,784
IKUTO: Still, the B:GINNERs
treated me so warmly,

929
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:25,950
IKUTO: and they helped me with practice,

930
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:29,084

a really good memory.

932

the other B:GINNERs who helped me so much.

my dream of debuting as an idol.

955

in Korean, singing, or dancing,

956
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:12,864
IKUTO: I'll never let
anyone outdo me in effort.

957
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:19,750

like this before.

I hope to continue
this journey and my life

959

based on what I've learned from it.

960
00:45:29,107 --> 00:45:31,651
Once I set a goal,

961
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,797
I practice twice, three times,

962
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,184
or even 100 times harder than others.

963
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:39,393

through this program,

1083
00:52:09,795 --> 00:52:13,195

MC DEX: and proceed with
selecting random keywords.

1087
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:22,731
(Keyword selection: One team member
will draw a legendary keyword,)

1088
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:24,271
(then create an intro and
prepare the performance based on it)

1089
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:25,551
(What keyword will B:GINNER
PARK SECHAN pick?)

1090
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:28,736
Choose one that starts with ieung.

1091
00:52:28,736 --> 00:52:29,504
Start with ieung?

1092
00:52:29,504 --> 00:52:31,584
(Five minutes before keyword selection)
I think the part where dynamism

1093
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,720
and connectivity really fit is...

1094
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,537
There's a part that suddenly
changes in this song.

1095
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:47,496
There can be dynamism
and the connection...

1096
00:52:47,528 --> 00:52:52,424
Rising Sun marked the beginning of big success
overseas and the start of global rise.

1097
00:52:53,512 --> 00:52:54,504
It was 2005.
(About 150 press outlets
poured into TVXQ's Malaysia concert)

1098
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:59,976
So, after debuting, the sudden rise and
overseas success correspond to connectivity,

1099
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:03,208
and if it's not dynamism,
then connectivity fits perfectly.

1100
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,832
That's very sharp.

1101
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,952
It was the introduction of an SM fan.

1102
00:53:08,608 --> 00:53:09,430
Thank you.

1103
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:12,659

1104
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,741
Please, SECHAN.

1105

(Pick well)
Connectivity?

1106
00:53:21,593 --> 00:53:25,597
Hey, what did you do?

1107
00:53:25,597 --> 00:53:27,697
PARK SECHAN: I felt a sharp
sensation on my side, so I looked,

1108
00:53:27,697 --> 00:53:30,730
PARK SECHAN: and I saw the others
shooting lasers from a distance.

1109
00:53:30,888 --> 00:53:32,072
(Unexpectedly picked Addictiveness)
It is Addictiveness.

1110
00:53:33,288 --> 00:53:34,376
(Hey, I was trusting you!)
Hey.

1111
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:35,080
That's amazing.

1112
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:36,392
I was trusting you.

1113
00:53:36,392 --> 00:53:37,480
Hey, you...

1114
00:53:37,544 --> 00:53:39,592
(Awkward greeting)

1115
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:41,259
Ah, he took it away.

1116
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:44,631
MOON JAEIL: I really wanted
the Addictiveness keyword.

1117

(What keyword will B:GINNER LEE YEONTAE
in 2nd place in in Round 3 pick?)

1118

1119

also completed keyword selection) Tada. It's Dynamism.

(4th Round K-POP Legend Match)
(Addictiveness, Connectivity, Dynamism)

1121
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,576
Since it's the semi-final,

1122
00:53:57,576 --> 00:53:58,888
it's almost like the final
is right around the corner...

1123
00:53:58,888 --> 00:54:00,264
Keep doing this movement until the end.

1124

1127
00:54:05,832 --> 00:54:07,976
(B:GINNERs running) (in their own ways)
- Let's win. -Let's win.

waiting for the B:GINNERs)

1131
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:27,371
- Hello.
- Hello.

1132
00:54:27,904 --> 00:54:32,054
I was excited since it
was my first time there.

1134

QUINNIE: I feel like one
of you has the kind of face

1140
00:54:53,736 --> 00:54:54,936
QUINNIE: with a potential as an idol.

1141
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:57,203
Oh, who is it?

1142

take a look at your eyebrows?

1145
00:55:02,752 --> 00:55:04,444
(Gently shows it)
Eyebrows.

1146
00:55:05,758 --> 00:55:09,147
QUINNIE: B:GINNER KAI is
the first one that catches my eye.

1147
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:12,222
(Idol face type KAI)

1148
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:14,974
QUINNIE: When looking at
the forehead here, it's quite high.

1149
00:55:14,974 --> 00:55:17,406
(KAI with a high forehead)
KAI: Yes, it seems so.

1150
00:55:17,406 --> 00:55:20,580
QUINNIE: In this case, it's believed
that someone with this feature

1151
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:25,280
QUINNIE: can achieve great
success at a young age.

1152
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,580
QUINNIE: The eyebrows are neatly aligned
in a straight line.

1153
00:55:29,682 --> 00:55:31,262
QUINNIE: This is exactly
the type of eyebrow

1154
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:35,230
QUINNIE: that attracts attention
and popularity.

1155
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:38,080
QUINNIE: Then, when I looked
at your eyes, they're quite big.

1156
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,006
KAI: Yes.

1157
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:44,446
QUINNIE: Peach Blossom,
or DoHwa face types,

1158
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:45,780
QUINNIE: are those whose
eyebrows and eyes alone

1159
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,447
QUINNIE: stand out. It's a face type
that embodies the DoHwa feature.

1160
00:55:50,492 --> 00:55:52,356
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1161

your lips are very pretty like cherries.

1166
00:56:03,914 --> 00:56:06,380
QUINNIE: It's a popularity mark,
especially if singing...

1167
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:11,422
- QUINNIE: Love songs suit better.
- JUNSEONG: Alright.

1168
00:56:12,178 --> 00:56:14,590
QUINNIE: Since your face
shape is an inverted triangle...

1169
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,914
- QUINNIE: Being broad on top and narrowing down, right?
- SECHAN: Yes.

1170

SECHAN: Ah, yes.

1172
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,880
QUINNIE: But there could be
emotional fluctuations.

1173
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,547
Oh! It's certain.

00:56:26,547 --> 00:56:28,014
(SECHAN is very pricked)

1175

(Excited again)

1177
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,654
I love it.

1178
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,014
(Angry in just 5 minutes)
It's really driving me crazy.

1179
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:39,014
Is my face okay?

1180
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,114
I'm without makeup right now.

1181
00:56:40,338 --> 00:56:41,182
As expected...

1182
00:56:41,747 --> 00:56:43,314
(Feeling a bit guilty)

1183
00:56:43,378 --> 00:56:44,990
(Staring)
Huh?

1184
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:49,247
QUINNIE: Shall I take a look at your hands?
It has some gold in it.

1185
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,806
(The fortune teller notices HARUTO's hands.)
QUINNIE: We call it a golden hand,

1186
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,980
QUINNIE: but because the face has
the energy of the Wood Element,

1187
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,680
QUINNIE: there's a softness
with strength.

1188
00:56:59,014 --> 00:57:01,214
(At Sports Day, HARUTO showed his spirit)

1189
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:04,347
QUINNIE: So, you're strong on the inside
but gentle on the outside.

1190
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,534
(Agree)

1191
00:57:05,534 --> 00:57:06,750
- QUINNIE: You know it, right?
- HARUTO: Yes.

1192
00:57:06,846 --> 00:57:10,080
QUINNIE: If you show just
a little more of yourself,

1193
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,747
QUINNIE: you'll stand out even more.

1194
00:57:13,147 --> 00:57:15,514
- QUINNIE: There's a mole under your eye.
- HARUTO: Yes.

1195

1196
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,070

- Nice.

(After touching sneakily)

1198

(That's good)
Good.

1199
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:22,477
As expected, you...

1200
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:24,821
I knew it from the moment you did this.

1201

HEO GUBONG: We have something called Mupyo.

1210
00:57:46,227 --> 00:57:47,834
HEO GUBONG: Don't plan
to seduce yourself, got it?

1211
00:57:48,274 --> 00:57:49,311
HEO GUBONG: So now,

1212
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:51,464
HEO GUBONG: let's talk a bit about
your personality and fortune,

1213
00:57:51,464 --> 00:57:53,255
HEO GUBONG: starting with your
horoscope for the second half of this year.

1214
00:57:53,479 --> 00:57:54,494
JUNMYEONG: Ah, yes.

1215
00:57:54,494 --> 00:57:56,053
JUNMYEONG: This is my first time
reading a fortune.

1216
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,992
- HEO GUBONG: Born in March 25th, 2004?
- JUNMYEONG: Yes, that's correct.

1217
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:02,782
HEO GUBONG: When I look at you, you're a bit
different from the image I had in mind.

1218
00:58:05,502 --> 00:58:07,710
HEO GUBONG: So,
looking at you like this,

1219
00:58:08,382 --> 00:58:11,294
HEO GUBONG: you're quite humble, but
from what I know, that's not really the case.

1220
00:58:11,294 --> 00:58:12,254
(Severely flustered)
HEO GUBONG: Because

1221
00:58:12,626 --> 00:58:14,238
HEO GUBONG: I think you...

1222
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:17,150
HEO GUBONG: You have

1223
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,941
- HEO GUBONG: a fighting spirit.
- JUNMYEONG: Yes.

1224

(Can't stand losing)
Please don't make a mistake.

1225
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:22,942
Please don't make a mistake.

1226
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:25,246
(I'm the best at dancing)
You and I are the best dancers here, right?

1227
00:58:25,374 --> 00:58:27,724
The people here in front of me
are not only here to evaluate me,

1228
00:58:27,724 --> 00:58:30,174
but they're also the ones
clapping for me, right?

1229
00:58:30,321 --> 00:58:31,422
(How did you know?)

1230
00:58:32,401 --> 00:58:34,311
HEO GUBONG: I've analyzed the fortune
readings of leader-type people in advance,

1231
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:36,753
HEO GUBONG: and I picked out one of them,
and you're one of them.

1232

(Leader-type figures among B:GINNERs)

you'll have more great opportunities

1234

of this year, around November. Got it?

1235
00:58:46,712 --> 00:58:47,806
(Bashful smile)
JUNMYEONG: Thank you.

1236
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:50,590
Your ear turned red?

1237
00:58:51,749 --> 00:58:54,484
HYO: I have a slightly personal question.

1238
00:58:54,738 --> 00:58:58,232
HYO: I wonder if I'm debuting...
That's a bit scary to ask.

1239
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,053
HEO GUBONG: Okay.

1240
00:59:00,689 --> 00:59:02,162
(Nervous)

1241
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:05,002
HEO GUBONG: Okay.

1242
00:59:05,002 --> 00:59:07,218
(Holding and shaking a coin)

1243
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:10,715
It comes out.

1244
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,096
(Will HYO's debut
be possible after all?)

1245
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:21,758
(The fortune-teller is
hesitating during the reading)

1246
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,306
(Pyeongwan: A fortune term, an overly prestigious position)
HEO GUBONG: In your case,

1247
00:59:25,306 --> 00:59:27,006
HEO GUBONG: Pyeongwan is a bit strong.

1248
00:59:27,102 --> 00:59:29,086
HEO GUBONG: That means...

1249
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:31,518
HEO GUBONG: When I say Pyeongwan,

1250
00:59:31,518 --> 00:59:34,718
HEO GUBONG: it's greed or more
precisely a desire for honor.

1251
00:59:34,802 --> 00:59:37,630
HEO GUBONG: So, if it's not
through broadcasting or dance,

1252
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:39,838
HEO GUBONG: it's bound
to happen in some other way.

1253
00:59:39,858 --> 00:59:41,298
(Wow)

1254
00:59:41,298 --> 00:59:41,889
Really?

1255
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:43,314
(Relieved)

1256
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:45,726
HEO GUBONG: From the age of 27,
things will get better. Got it?

1257
00:59:45,726 --> 00:59:47,134
HEO GUBONG: That's probably
when you'll reach your peak.

1258
00:59:48,658 --> 00:59:49,982
Let's stay close.

1259
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:54,030
(Let's remain close in the future)
Keep my phone number and don't erase it.

1260
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,166
HYO: Yeah.

1261
00:59:55,518 --> 00:59:57,310
HYO: Actually, I was really worried.

1262
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:00,302
HYO: But hearing that I can do it
in the future made me really happy.

1263
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:03,706
(Time for a tarot reading)
QUINNIE: So now, with tarot cards,

1264
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:05,823
QUINNIE: I think I can
answer a variety of questions.

1265
01:00:05,823 --> 01:00:07,667
PARK SECHAN: There's something
I'd like to ask.

1266
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:09,406
PARK SECHAN: I've never been...

1267
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:10,078
QUINNIE: Yes.

1268
01:00:10,078 --> 01:00:12,414
PARK SECHAN: I've never been on the same
team as JEONGHOON until now.

1269
01:00:12,414 --> 01:00:14,622
PARK SECHAN: I'm curious
how our chemistry will be.

1270
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,998
(How JEONGHOON and
SECHAN's chemistry will be?)

1271
01:00:20,434 --> 01:00:21,438
(Nervous)

1272
01:00:23,602 --> 01:00:24,862
(Spreading)

1273
01:00:26,546 --> 01:00:29,096
QUINNIE: Think about
each other and pick a card.

1274
01:00:29,394 --> 01:00:30,334
(Embarrassing)

1275
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:31,643
That's a bit...

1276
01:00:32,082 --> 01:00:33,374
QUINNIE: Pick one please.

1277
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:36,171
KIM JEONGHOON, KIM JEONGHOON,
KIM JEONGHOON.

1278
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,622
- Oh, SECHAN.
- Seems like SECHAN.

1279
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,391
Seems like SECHAN?

1280
01:00:42,494 --> 01:00:44,703
(Card open)
Isn't it SECHAN?

1281
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:49,206
QUINNIE: I'll show you, this is Pentacles 4.
"You are mine".

1282
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:55,647
- JEONGHOON is mine.
- Just stay still.

1283
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:58,879
You must be with me
and can't go anywhere else.

1284
01:01:00,274 --> 01:01:02,942
Oh my, oh my.

1285
01:01:02,942 --> 01:01:05,654
- Nice.
- QUINNIE: This is a love card.

1286
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:07,959
What's it?

1287
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:11,691
QUINNIE: It's good if there's love.

1288
01:01:11,762 --> 01:01:14,746
SECHAN has been looking at me
in a certain way recently...

1289
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:17,918
(Unfair)

1290
01:01:18,302 --> 01:01:20,997
QUINNIE Whether two of you
will be together this time...

1291
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:26,110
QUINNIE: It seems like it might be difficult
for you two to work together this time.

1292
01:01:26,865 --> 01:01:28,616
(How did you know?)

1293
01:01:28,616 --> 01:01:30,184
QUINNIE: It's a card
that cannot stay together.

1294
01:01:30,184 --> 01:01:34,144
QUINNIE: This card suggests a situation
where you two have to be apart all the time.

1295
01:01:34,144 --> 01:01:37,288
QUINNIE: You guys are soulmates, though.

1296
01:01:37,883 --> 01:01:39,008
(Conclusion: They must have been married in a past life)
I guess we were married in our past lives.

1297
01:01:39,008 --> 01:01:43,808
We're about to head into the 4th round,

1298
01:01:43,808 --> 01:01:46,153
and I'm curious how it will turn out.

1299
01:01:46,153 --> 01:01:48,144
I'm nervous.

1300
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:55,319
(AI is picking cards carefully)
This one... these two.

1301
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:56,648
Three.

1302
01:01:57,211 --> 01:01:58,793
The one at the end.

1303
01:02:00,892 --> 01:02:02,912
Oh? Seems good.

1304
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:07,016
(The result is...)

1305
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,760
QUINNIE: This is the Queen of Swords.

1306
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,656
QUINNIE: Might be some mistakes.

1307
01:02:12,443 --> 01:02:16,776
(What happens to AI in the 4th round?)
♪Shining brightly as it burns brilliantly♪

1308
01:02:18,728 --> 01:02:22,837
QUINNIE: This is
the Three of Swords card.

1309
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:24,789
QUINNIE: Pain and hurt.

1310
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:27,990
(What happened to JUNSEONG's 4th round?)
♪You and me♪

1311
01:02:28,553 --> 01:02:30,912
PARK SECHAN: Will all five
of us be able to debut together?

1312
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:35,285
QUINNIE: I don't think all five will debut.

1313
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:36,512
(What?!)

1314
01:02:36,512 --> 01:02:37,824
(Where are we going?) (B:GINNERs moving somewhere?)
Where are we heading now?

1315
01:02:37,824 --> 01:02:39,520
We're being drawn somewhere.

1316
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,544
An unexpected situation arises.

1317
01:02:40,544 --> 01:02:41,224
Where is this?
There is a soccer ball over there.

1318
01:02:43,336 --> 01:02:44,392
(School?!)

1319
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:47,040
- School Attack?
- The 4th round *** will be decided

1320
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:48,232
through a mid-term evaluation.

1321
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:49,672
I thought it would be scary.

1322
01:02:49,672 --> 01:02:51,456
That was the most nerve-wracking moment.

1323
01:02:51,456 --> 01:02:52,008
(B:GINNERs are tense)
(under the sharp gaze of the legend)

1324
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,344
The part that was disappointing...

1325
01:02:54,344 --> 01:02:56,344
I felt like I was standing
on the guillotine.

1326
01:02:56,344 --> 01:02:58,344
(The final round towards the finale)
I'll nail the last round.

1327
01:02:58,344 --> 01:02:59,872
(Who will be the B:GINNERs to survive?)
