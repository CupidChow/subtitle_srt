00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:56,233
It was also the part I wanted to
do the most, so I have to work hard.

160
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:59,666
LEE YUNSUNG: I feel both pressure
and nervousness with this part.

161
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,952
(With the parts decided, it's time for serious practice)
Five, six, seven, eight.

162

163

(Tiptoeing)

168
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,166
HYO: At first glance, his physique is great
and my eyes keep going to YUNSUNG,

169
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,266
HYO: so I think he's
perfect for the center.

170
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,566
KIM JEONGHOON: YUNSUNG, your
timing is on point when you dance,

171
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,999
KIM JEONGHOON: but you should...

172
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:29,248
(JEONGHOON helping center YUNSUNG)
You really have to put strength into your body.

173
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,368
You can't dance it lightly.

174
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,666
LEE YUNSUNG: I had many
weaknesses in dancing,

175
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:38,199
LEE YUNSUNG: so JEONGHOON taught me
a lot and was very dependable.

176
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:44,066

and singing on the 'Fact Check' stage...

doing well. He's good.

powerful energy broadly.

185
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,733

First, what we need to check is,

186
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,866
KIM JEONGHOON: if there's
any confusing part, unclear timing,

187
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:19,766
KIM JEONGHOON: or you're not sure
what to do, please speak up right away.

188
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,133
I'll make sure you remember it clearly.

189

- Yes. - Great.

190
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:29,233

when the dance progresses, he counts well too.

191
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:32,768
(A leader that team members can trust and follow)
One, two, three, four. That's right.

192
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,784
You've got to sweep it like this
to really bring out the feeling.

193

Yes, just touch it, as much as possible.

194

00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:21,299
It was a good choice, 'Shoot Out'.

208

more impactful song than 'Love Killa',

00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:40,450
HUI: Did you know today
was the mid-check?

315
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:44,550
(Tension)

316
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:48,480
LIA KIM: I guess you guys
didn't practice seriously.

317
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,046
(Colliding while moving on stage) LIA KIM: Collisions
happened due to poor stage movement coordination.

318
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:57,022
JINHO: And the intro lacked charisma.

319
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,480
JINHO: You should capture
everything in the intro.

320
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:02,776
(Even the replaced intro part is getting harsh criticism)
JINHO: The moves and energy in the intro feel off.

321
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,208
JINHO: The overall
tension is just too low.

322
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:12,546
CHOI YOHAN: I was worried
and ended up regretting not dancing harder.

323
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:17,113
HARUTO: Still showing a lack
of confidence in the dance,

324
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:20,413
HARUTO: singing, and movements...

325
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:23,146
MOON JAEIL: There were
many small mistakes,

326
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:26,462
MOON JAEIL: and the stage
movements had quite a few flaws.

327
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:29,592
I think you all should
start feeling the urgency.

328
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:31,000
This is a big deal.

329
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,546
KIM JEONGHOON: As the one
leading the choreography,

330
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:39,346
KIM JEONGHOON: I was disappointed
and felt the pressure

331
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:41,046
KIM JEONGHOON: seeing we only delivered

332
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,580
KIM JEONGHOON: this much quality
at the mid-check.

333
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,020
(MY MONSTAZ in crisis)
I kept thinking, "This is serious trouble."

334
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:50,686
(Continued mid-check for MONSTA B)
Let's watch MONSTA B's performance right away.

335
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:51,773
- Yes.
- Yes.

336
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:58,180
(Starting with B:GINNER
MOON JAEIL at the center)

337
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,224
(Wow)

338
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:00,780
(That's right)

339
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,134

00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:31,346
PARK SECHAN: They are doing great.

349
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:34,713
YUJEONG: Still, it seems like
you guys practiced a lot overall.

350
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:35,966
Thank you.

351
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

352
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:39,134
(Well done)
Good, well done.

353
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:41,413
YUJEONG: I really want to praise JAEIL.

354
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,813
YUJEONG: The energy JAEIL
gives when he starts

355
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:47,128
YUJEONG: seems to carry the mood a lot.

356
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,846
YUJEONG: That's why
I want to praise him.

357
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:53,480
YUJU: Since the opening
energy was amazing,

358
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,313
YUJU: the overall stage
felt more impressive

359
00:16:57,313 --> 00:17:01,180
YUJU: than that of MY MONSTAZ.

360
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,272
(You all worked hard)
YUJU: You worked hard.

361
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,774
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

362
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,946
KIM BOHYEON: It feels like
a ray of hope is breaking through.

363
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:11,046
AI: I gained confidence
that I can do well.

364
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:23,480
SUTHASCHAI: There's still some
worry about whether I can do well,

365
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,780
SUTHASCHAI: but for now, I'm having fun
and will try even harder next time.

366
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,280
MOON JAEIL: Thanks to the team members
keeping up well, I believe we finished it successfully.

367
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:35,213
(Suddenly)
The disappointing parts...

368
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:36,380
LEE YUJEONG: The disappointing parts are

369
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,946
LEE YUJEONG: that each part's center
should really own the moment,

370
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:42,780
LEE YUJEONG: but every time the centers
appear, they actually come off too weak.

371
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,446
LEE YUJEONG: Actually, those weaknesses
were especially noticeable with HIROTO.

372
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:50,313
(Relatively weak as a center, B:GINNER HIROTO)
♪The feelings that left burst out without hesitation, pop pop pop♪

373
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:53,546
LEE YUJEONG: Those parts
definitely need to be strengthened.

374
00:17:53,546 --> 00:18:01,086
HIROTO: Yeah, I know... I'm still
lacking, and I do feel a little apologetic.

375
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:06,913
(After mid-check, MONSTA B's dance class)
LIA KIM: Master YUJEONG said earlier

376
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:11,880
LIA KIM: that when you're
center, you have to fully commit

377
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:16,146
LIA KIM: with your
expressions and gestures.

378
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,174
LIA KIM: HIROTO, you get it?

379
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:18,713
HIROTO: Yes.

380
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:21,653
LIA KIM: Try it alone that part once.

381
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:22,494
HIROTO: Yes.

382
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:23,914
LIA KIM: Start.

383

387
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:37,150
(The vibe naturally changes to HIROTO's personal class)
LIA KIM: You need to have this body when doing this.

388
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,568
(The vibe naturally changes to HIROTO's personal class)
LIA KIM: Move like this.

389
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:42,616
LIA KIM: Doo-doong, like this, start!

390
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:45,246
LIA KIM: Doo-doong.

391
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,928

in the mirror and really put in the work.

392

HIROTO: Yes.

393

you've got to train the vibe too.

394
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,502
HIROTO: Yes.

395
00:18:54,446 --> 00:19:01,630
HIROTO: This round's been a bit tough... I'm
trying a lot of things for the first time, like rapping,

396
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:09,713
HIROTO: and I've been feeling nervous,
like, "Can I really pull this off?"

397
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:18,713
(When everyone is asleep, B:GINNER HIROTO
comes out to the living room alone)

on parts lacking compared to others)

Okay, HIROTO fighting.

403
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:38,580
HIROTO: Thank you.

404
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:41,304
(Practicing hard)

405
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,546
(Next morning)

406
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:02,413
(B:GINNER HIROTO, the first
to arrive at the practice room)

407
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,405
HIROTO: I know I'm lacking in skill
and trying a lot of things for the first time,

408
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:11,868
HIROTO: but I see it as a great
opportunity for growth.

409
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:17,125
(HIROTO, who always pushed himself
one step further than the others)

410
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,117
- Okay.
- Ah, yes.

411
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:26,998
HIROTO: It's taking me a long time,
so I feel really sorry to my teammates.

412
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:33,928
HIROTO: I'm going to work even harder. Let's
all do our best, so we can make it together.

413
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,648
(After the mid-check, MY MONSTAZ gather)
JEONGHOON, you really worked so hard too.

414
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:39,698
We're almost there now,
just a little bit more.

415
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:40,962
LIM JIHWAN: Is everything
going alright, JEONGHOON?

416
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:50,498
KIM JEONGHOON: Hmm...
right now, I feel like I'm a bit...

417
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:56,328
KIM JEONGHOON: Ah, don't say that.

418
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:57,762
- Good job.
- You're doing well.

419
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,016
(Sudden burst of tears)
- You're doing well. - You're doing well.

420
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:02,946
(Sorry)

421
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:10,344
KIM JEONGHOON: Actually, I was
the one leading the choreography,

422
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:17,256
KIM JEONGHOON: so as the leader, I should
have been the best at expressing it.

423
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:19,831
KIM JEONGHOON: But I felt lacking,

424
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,386
KIM JEONGHOON: and I started to question

425
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:28,648
KIM JEONGHOON: whether
I'm really fit to keep leading.

426
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:29,538
(KIM JEONGHOON, feeling sorry and
responsible for the team, bursts into tears)

427
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:34,626
KIM JEONGHOON: Since losing
basically means I'm out

428
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,231
KIM JEONGHOON: unless
the rankings shift dramatically,

429
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:40,584
KIM JEONGHOON: I really need
to lead the team to success,

430
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,186
(B:GINNER KIM JEONGHOON, who wanted
to lead the team better than anyone else)

431
00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:43,331
KIM JEONGHOON: but
it's not going smoothly.

432
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:48,131
LIM JIHWAN: It's okay, you're doing
well, so don't feel too pressured.

433
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:52,731
(Since the team knows JEONGHOON's heart)
LIM JIHWAN: You lead, but communicate well with the team.

434
00:21:52,964 --> 00:21:55,720
LEE YUNSUNG: JEONGHOON worked hard,

435
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,131
LEE YUNSUNG: so we need
to show our best for his effort.

436
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:04,200
WILLIAM: We just need to trust JEONGHOON
a bit more and follow along well.

437
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:05,256
Okay.
- It's okay.
- Okay.

438
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:07,784
(MY MONSTAZ, gradually aligning
their goals and determination) It's okay.

439
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,744
It's okay.

440
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,768
Okay.

441
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:11,431
KIM JEONGHOON: Let's
start from 'five, six, and.'

442
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:16,064
(Thus, starting over from the beginning to synchronize)
KIM JEONGHOON: Five, six, and seven, and eight.

443
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:18,536
(And KIM JEONGHOON gets up again to lead the team)
KIM JEONGHOON: Instead of pushing it out like this,

444
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,168
KIM JEONGHOON: you need
to bend it like this, like this.

445
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:22,050
KIM JEONGHOON: Yes a bit more.

446
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:30,531
IKUTO: JEONGHOON is giving dance
feedback to each member one by one.

447
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:35,938
Come over here and try it like this.

448
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:37,730
Yes.

449
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:41,698
YANG CHENGXI: From the very
first day, he kept saying

450
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:44,731
YANG CHENGXI: he truly believes in me
and thinks I can do well on stage.

451
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:47,618
KIM JEONGHOON: Seven and eight and one.

452
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:50,466
KIM JEONGHOON: Yes, make sure
the moves are spot on.

453
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:54,097
LEE YUNSUNG: As the youngest,
JEONGHOON probably felt it hard

454
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:58,031
LEE YUNSUNG: to reach out
to the older members,

455
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:03,031
LEE YUNSUNG: yet he motivated us
and helped with the dance moves a lot.

456
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:08,731
HYO: I think overall confidence increased
and the team atmosphere improved.

457
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:12,364
(And the unresolved task of the intro center)
At first...

458
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:17,531
KIM JEONGHOON: I think YEONTAE
should be the intro center.

459
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,594
(As the new intro center, LEE YEONTAE)
You'll need to put in plenty of effort and preparation.

460
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:27,664
KIM JEONGHOON: I thought it would
be good for YEONTAE to do it

461
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:31,331
KIM JEONGHOON: because he
brings this part to life so well.

462
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:35,597
LEE YEONTAE: I'll work harder,
and if we all put in more effort together,

463
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:36,764
LEE YEONTAE: we'll definitely win.

464
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:42,336
HIROTO: If we practice diligently
and do well, I think we can definitely win.

465
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:46,297
MOON JAEIL: We haven't slacked off
since the mid-check.

466
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:48,064
MOON JAEIL: Because we've
practiced even harder,

467
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:51,064
MOON JAEIL: I assure you that we will show

but "Shoot Out" is different.

480
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:32,690
MONSTA X KIHYUN: For "Shoot Out",
you should make it tear up the stage.

MOON JAEIL: If the opposing team
kept pushing after the mid-check,

490
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:56,344
MOON JAEIL: it could be a match
where no one knows who will win.

00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:15,769

Yes.

wanted to really express thanks

948

PENTAGON JINHO: to the fans
through the arrangement,

949
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:26,175
PENTAGON JINHO: the movements
on stage needed to match that feeling.

950
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:27,669
PENTAGON JINHO: But as it is, I don't get

951
00:47:27,669 --> 00:47:29,369
PENTAGON JINHO: why you
used that first formation,

952
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:30,535
PENTAGON JINHO: why you
stayed still in the middle,

953
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:33,069
PENTAGON JINHO: and then suddenly moved
and linked arms at the end...

954
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:34,869
It just looked like a friendship song.

955
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:37,735
It doesn't feel like a fan song at all!

956
00:47:37,735 --> 00:47:41,621
PENTAGON JINHO: If you chose that
arrangement direction, you should stick to it.

957

Yes.

PARK SECHAN: Our initial goal was a fan song,

959
00:47:45,435 --> 00:47:48,602
PARK SECHAN: but because it was starting
to feel more like a friendship song,

960
00:47:48,602 --> 00:47:53,735
PARK SECHAN: the atmosphere seems to have
shifted to a more serious tone after the mid-check.

961

that keeps repeating?

967
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:03,701
"I miss you."
(Lyrics repeated "I miss you")
"I miss you", right?
