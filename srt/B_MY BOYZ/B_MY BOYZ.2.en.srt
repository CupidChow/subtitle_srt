didn't fully understand

KANG JUNSEONG: What really caught my attention
was TEN's impressive look during the chorus.

463
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,176
Honestly, I was a bit smitten.

464
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:32,256
(Blushing)
Thank you.

465
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,599
(JUNSEONG fallen for TEN's
sexy energy in the chorus)

466
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:40,966
(Is this the vibe you mean?)

467
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:42,933
(Blushing)

468
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,333
(MC mode)
NCT JOHNNY: How's it feeling right now?

469
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,664
It's nice, but I feel a bit shy.

470
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,799
NCT TEN: But there's something
I'm curious about too.

471
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,933
NCT TEN: While practicing 90's Love,

472
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:59,048
I want to hear what you think
is the point of 90's Love.

473
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,766
PARK JUNHYEOK:
Our focus is simply to show you

474
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:05,792
how much we're enjoying ourselves.

475
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,032
- That's a great mindset.
- Oh.

476
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:09,184
Good.

477
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:13,784
PARK JUNHYEOK: Our goal
is to enjoy the stage.

478
00:25:13,784 --> 00:25:17,038
PARK JUNHYEOK: Whether we do well
or not, we just want to enjoy the stage.

479
00:25:17,338 --> 00:25:20,138
KANG JUNSEONG: Compared to
other teams' songs,

480
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:22,038
KANG JUNSEONG: this song,
90's Love, lets us show a cute side

481
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:23,905
KANG JUNSEONG: as well as
a bright, cheerful side, right?

482
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:29,238
(Key point: cheeky and playful)
I wanted to show off a cheeky, playful feeling.

483
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,338
KANG JUNSEONG: While reviewing
the last team member selection mission,

484
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:34,671
KANG JUNSEONG: I watched everyone's
singing and dancing videos

485
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:39,338
(90's Love Team formed by JUNSEONG's PICK)
and chose one person who fit best for each team.

486
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,768
(Getting the hint)
So, you got everything I said, right?

487
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,123
(This team has three Japanese members)
Got it, everyone?

488
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,472
(Japanese member 1) (Japanese member 2) (Japanese member 3)
- Japanese. - No.

489
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:51,504
(Huh?)
Japanese.

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,296
(Can speak Korean) (Can speak Korean)
Japanese.

491
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:54,864
What I just said.

492
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:56,792
I'm sorry.

493
00:25:57,685 --> 00:25:58,767
(Smiling brightly)
Japanese

494
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,720
- It's okay.
- I don't know.

495
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:03,938
IKUTO: I started studying
Korean after it was decided

496
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,571
IKUTO: that I would be on this audition,

497
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:10,871
so it's only been about two weeks.

498
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:14,638
(Picking the leader before practice)
Okay, let's choose our leader.

499
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:17,138
PARK JUNHYEOK: Who
wants to be the leader?

500
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:18,571
(Leader candidates)
- Raise your hands. - Who wants to be the leader?

501
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:20,771
(Leader candidates: PARK JUNHYEOK, AI, JANG HUIGWANG)
- Hands. - Yes.

502
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,205
(3 candidates 3 voters)

503
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:27,105
(Their personal league,
full of eager anticipation)

504
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:29,667
(PICK)

505
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:32,280
(PARK JUNHYEOK elected as the leader)

506
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,176
- Thank you in advance.
- Thank you in advance.

507
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,167
(Bowing)
- Please take good care of us. - Okay!

508
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:36,605
(Bowing)
Please take good care of us.

509
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:38,205
Oh, yeah.

510
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:41,671
(Abuse of power 3 seconds after election)
- Leader, now. - Okay, fighting.

511
00:26:42,138 --> 00:26:46,736
PARK JUNHYEOK: First
of all... I won't slack off.

512
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:50,571
PARK JUNHYEOK: Every practice
session, I'll stay completely focused

513
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:52,905
PARK JUNHYEOK: because
it's not a solo competition.

514
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,744
(Watching the video first to assign parts)
- Let's listen to it first. - Okay.

515
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,665
Wow, alright.

516
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Wow.

517
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:01,371
(Overflowing swag from the beginning)
Wow, unbelievable.

518
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:04,652
(Flawless choreography)
Wow, it's really...

519
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:10,712
(Choreography creation section)

520
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,416
- Choreography creation.
- We just need to create it.

521
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:16,152
(Sudden mission)
- Have to make choreography. - Huh?

522
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:18,792
- Have to make it, making...
- Really?

523
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:20,671
All: Wow.

524
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:23,120
(Clapping contrasts bold dance)
Wow.

525
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:25,752
(Choreo creation, no way)
No way.

526
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,056
(Sudden mission and sudden Japanese)
No way.

527
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,976
(Sudden mission and sudden Japanese)
No way.

528
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:30,005
It doesn't make sense.

529
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,766
Ha...

530
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,871
JANG HUIGWANG: Normally,
three days practicing,

531
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,538
JANG HUIGWANG: the full
dance is hard enough,

532
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:40,671
JANG HUIGWANG: but with
choreography creation added,

533
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:44,005
JANG HUIGWANG: the schedule
feels even tighter.

534
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:47,440
(Looking for someone)
PARK JUNHYEOK: Anyone who has created choreography before?

535
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,871
Luckily,

536
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:50,800
I want to create
the choreography myself.

537
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,648
(Cheers erupt)
Main dancer.

538
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,105
(Cheers erupt for the talented one's arrival)
The main dancer is here.

539
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:55,738
Trust me!

540
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:57,136
Okay, great.

541
00:27:57,136 --> 00:28:02,605
AI: I've done choreography
creation before,

542
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:05,238
AI: so I think I can help the team.

543
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:07,638
AI: The concept is like
playing at school?

544
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:10,505
AI: With the feeling
of having fun together,

545
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:13,438
AI: I created the choreography
with that in mind.

546
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:16,005
(Choreo done in a flash)
Let's begin with the choreography...

547
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:17,808
Right away? Right away? Is it okay?

548
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:19,171
Yes.

549
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:21,905
(Teacher AI demonstrating immediately)

550
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:25,208
(Like this)

551
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,552
(Like this?)

552
00:28:26,552 --> 00:28:27,605
One, two.

553
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:32,505
(AI's dance class without
language barriers)

554
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:36,705
PARK JUNHYEOK: Since AI has
been dancing since childhood,

555
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:37,984
PARK JUNHYEOK: he has
a deep understanding of dance

556
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:40,705
PARK JUNHYEOK: and a great sense
because they listen very well

557
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:41,905
PARK JUNHYEOK: to the song's
content and interpretation.

558
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:42,744
Make the movement in a straight line.

559
00:28:42,744 --> 00:28:44,792
Oh.

560
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:45,592
Good, good.

561
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:47,440
(Filling each other's shortcomings)
How do I do this?

562
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,032
(90's Love Team building step by step)
Boom, tap, ha.

563
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:51,544
Oh.

564
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:55,605
(That's right)
KANG JUNSEONG: It's getting harder.

565
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:59,505
HARUTO: AI is really good at dancing,

566
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:03,205
HARUTO: so I thought he was
good at creating choreography.

567
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:06,992
(Everything is going smoothly
for the 90's Love Team)

568
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,880
(But...)

569
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,538
Ah, it was here just now?

570
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:13,438
(90's Love team taking a short break)

571
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:15,760
(Other B:GINNERs are resting)
This time the MR

572
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,008
(IKUTO practicing alone)
is like this.

573
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,248
Don't worry.

574
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:24,438
IKUTO: I haven't learned that
much dance or singing yet,

575
00:29:24,438 --> 00:29:27,338
IKUTO: so sometimes it's
tough because my skills

576
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:34,471
IKUTO: haven't improved
as much as I expected.

577
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:36,536
(Frustrated)

578
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:43,478
(IKUTO has a hard time
memorizing Korean lyrics)

579
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:51,097
IKUTO: I'm always
putting in a lot of effort

580
00:29:51,097 --> 00:29:55,144
IKUTO: because I believe
I need plenty of practice

581
00:29:55,511 --> 00:30:02,711
IKUTO: to stay on par in
both dance and singing.

582
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:04,844
(Mid-check)
Alright,

583
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,944
(Time for the 90's Love Team's check)
the next team is Old School, 90's Love.

00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:14,111
(Efforts visible in
the synchronized dance)

585
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:15,125
(Wow)

586
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,049
(Not bad?!)

(Relief)
Yes.

- as we guide you through it.
- Yes.

to the full song a few times,

the parts we wanted.

620

(How the parts were divided)
Doesn't seem like the right way.

621

(How the parts were divided)
Doesn't seem like the right way.

622
00:31:43,978 --> 00:31:45,825

I think the part distribution wasn't right.

623

(Common opinion of the masters)
We're asking because that way doesn't feel right.

this repeatedly earlier.

(Gently bringing up the issue)
The part we changed together.

I recommend JUNSEONG for that.

(Giving up his part isn't easy)
During vocal lessons,

665

IKUTO: Master JINHO
suggested that JUNSEONG

666
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:54,205
IKUTO: might suit my part better,
and maybe we should switch parts.

667
00:33:54,205 --> 00:34:01,505
IKUTO: But this is the part
I'm least willing to give up.

668

(When initially distributing the parts)
We were planning to

decide it later.

841
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:12,663
NCT TEN: from what I feel,
the dance and singing

842
00:41:12,663 --> 00:41:13,796
(Skill)
NCT TEN: still have

843
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:15,494
(Seems lacking in skill)
NCT TEN: a lot of room for improvement.

844
00:41:15,622 --> 00:41:18,694
NCT TEN: The dance isn't bad, but

845
00:41:18,694 --> 00:41:19,814
NCT TEN: what's lacking right now

846
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:20,774
NCT TEN: is the basics.

847
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:23,430
(Pros see a lack of basics)
NCT TEN: If you practice the fundamentals

848
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,530
NCT TEN: more and polish
your movements, I think

849
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,438

better going forward.

YUJU: Basics...

853
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,063
PENTAGON JINHO: Basics are definitely
hard to build in just a few weeks.

854
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:42,950
YUJU: We've seen the B:GINNERs
gradually improve,

855
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,230
YUJU: so we feel proud, but

856
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,014
YUJU: when they first watch these stages,
they might notice a lot of shortcomings.

857
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:48,063
PENTAGON JINHO: Since it's their own
song, it's only natural that

858
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:50,696
(High standards) - YUJU: That's right.
- PENTAGON JINHO: their standards would be high.

859
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:55,063
NCT JUNGWOO: Above all,
I want to give extra credit

860
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:57,126
NCT JUNGWOO: because
the 90's Love team members

861
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,163
NCT JUNGWOO: showed
great harmony and spirit.

862
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:00,796
NCT JUNGWOO: The only downside

863
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:05,330
NCT JUNGWOO: is that
I think you guys could pay

864
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,454
(Understanding B:GINNERs more than anyone)
NCT JUNGWOO: a bit more attention to their vocals.

865
00:42:08,454 --> 00:42:11,963
(A cautious piece of advice) NCT JUNGWOO: Of course,
I understand, but I think if you improve on those parts,

866
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:15,963
NCT JUNGWOO: you'll all
grow even more impressively.

867
00:42:16,296 --> 00:42:17,930
NCT XIAOJUN: I think the hardest
part of being a singer

868
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,830
(Composure on stage is still challenging)
NCT XIAOJUN: is probably having composure.

869
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:26,246
(Next year is his 10th debut anniversary, he's keeping calm)
NCT XIAOJUN: I'm still working on it myself, but I truly believe that

870
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:30,762
NCT XIAOJUN: once you gain
composure, you can do everything well.

871
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,130

of time ahead. Just keep working hard.

well, so keep fighting.

873
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:45,096
PARK JUNHYEOK: It was really
disappointing. Of course, I expected that

874
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,563
PARK JUNHYEOK: the skills
might drop compared to practice,

875
00:42:47,563 --> 00:42:48,596
PARK JUNHYEOK: but I still felt like

876
00:42:48,596 --> 00:42:52,496

a glimpse of their potential.

the B:GINNERs working alongside me

working hard and growing,"

879

focusing more on the future than the present,

905

LEE YUNSUNG: we decided to focus
on a bold and energetic vibe.

906
00:44:27,463 --> 00:44:29,630
LEE YUNSUNG: Because most
of us are tall, we thought

907
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,030
LEE YUNSUNG: if we all brought
that atmosphere together,

908

that YUNSUNG...

SEO JUNHYEOK: LEE YUNSUNG, the B:GINNER,

914

SEO JUNHYEOK: had gathered
tall and handsome B:GINNERs.

915
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:53,496
LEE YUNSUNG: I thought that since I was
able to pick the beginners I envisioned,

916
00:44:53,496 --> 00:44:58,096
LEE YUNSUNG: if we prepare hard,
we'll be able to deliver a great stage.

918
00:45:02,263 --> 00:45:06,406
(Team average height: 184 cm)
LEE YUNSUNG: so I focused on the taller members.

tall, so even though I'm a bit like

since they're all taller than me,

924

of feel like the youngest.

I'm not considered short

926

but here, I was counted among the shorter ones.

about how the overall picture would look.

00:45:56,966 --> 00:46:00,563
- SEO JUNHYEOK: A is totally just...
- LEE YUNSUNG: Rather than main vocal...

940
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,863
WILLIAM: It feels like the center
when you take the A part.

941
00:46:03,863 --> 00:46:04,902
WILLIAM: Oh, A.

942
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:05,930
SEO JUNHYEOK: Ah, A.

943
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,430
SEO JUNHYEOK: We really
need to think carefully about

944
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,996
SEO JUNHYEOK: who should take the A part
and choose someone who can do it well.

945
00:46:11,996 --> 00:46:15,046
(A part that has everything)
SEO JUNHYEOK: Main dancer, center.

946
00:46:15,046 --> 00:46:16,838
- LEE YUNSUNG: So it's all...
- SEO JUNHYEOK: killing part.

947
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:18,530
(Looks so desirable,
The A part that has it all)

948
00:46:18,602 --> 00:46:19,814
(Starting part distribution)
WILLIAM: Can I speak first?

949
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:20,742
- LEE YUNSUNG: Yes.
- SEO JUNHYEOK: Yes.

950
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,339
(Part distribution begins)
WILLIAM: Ah, my top priority is

951
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:24,362
WILLIAM: definitely the A part

952
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:27,498
WILLIAM: since it now includes rap.

953
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:28,586
LEE YUNSUNG: That's right.

954
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:30,854
WILLIAM: Because there's a lot of English,

955
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,262
WILLIAM: diction seems very important.

956
00:46:33,414 --> 00:46:37,306
WILLIAM: Hello, I'm William,
a 20-year-old from Australia.

957

WILLIAM: and I lived in Australia from when I was 4 until my first year of high school.

959
00:46:44,206 --> 00:46:47,239
WILLIAM: I think
the killing part in Kick It

960
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,772
WILLIAM: is the New Thangs section.

961
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:53,072

WILLIAM: Since that
part includes the intro,

WILLIAM: chorus, and dance break,

969
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:10,566
WILLIAM: I ended up feeling more ambitious than usual.

970
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:12,939
LEE YUNSUNG: I believe having that kind

971
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:15,072

is natural in an audition.

was better than expected.

this kind of energy was exactly what they wanted to see.

a relief, and I thought,

really has great energy."

LEE YUNSUNG: The level of
completion had improved a lot,

1048

change everything was mentally very tough.

anxious, but even though the flow

01:04:20,472 --> 01:04:27,705
HIROTO: Since there won't be another day when
the same five of us perform the Hero stage together.

1250
01:04:27,705 --> 01:04:32,472
HIROTO: Thinking about that made me a bit sad.

1251
01:04:32,472 --> 01:04:35,063
- Why's he like that? Why's he crying?
- Don't cry.

1252
01:04:35,063 --> 01:04:36,128
Why's he crying again? Don't cry.

1253
01:04:40,936 --> 01:04:43,295
- We can't be together anymore.
- You did great. Why's everyone tearing up?

1254
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:49,472
WILLIAM: I was worried if we could
do well as a five-member group,

1255
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:52,338
WILLIAM: but since we were able
to deliver satisfying performances,

1256
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:56,720
WILLIAM: all the built-up emotions
seemed to come out at once in tears.

1257
01:04:56,848 --> 01:04:59,738
LEE YUNSUNG: Right after
our first performance,

1258
01:04:59,738 --> 01:05:02,538
LEE YUNSUNG: I think the team members
were the first thing that came to mind.

1259
01:05:03,296 --> 01:05:05,990
(A stage we completed thanks to our trust in each other)
LEE YUNSUNG: Great job, guys.

1260
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:09,088
LEE YUNSUNG:
Since we didn't have much time,

1261
01:05:09,088 --> 01:05:12,000
LEE YUNSUNG: the first
thing that came to mind

1262
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,654
LEE YUNSUNG: among the team was, "We
did it. We worked hard and made it happen."

1263
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:21,254
(The name Kick It, born from
the trust of five members)

1264
01:05:21,926 --> 01:05:24,582
(1st round
"NCT Concept Battle" ends)

1265
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:26,560
MIYEON: Yes, congratulations

1266
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:32,160
MIYEON: to all 30 B:GINNERs who
completed the first-round stage of B:MY BOYZ.

1267
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:37,280
(NCT completes TOP PICK selection)
MIYEON: Top Idol NCT has finished evaluating all teams in the first round.

1268
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,160
MIYEON: How was the B:GINNERs'
concept battle stage?

1269
01:05:41,694 --> 01:05:43,727
NCT JUNGWOO: It feels really
special. This is actually

1270
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:46,927
NCT JUNGWOO: the first time
our song has been evaluated like this,

1271
01:05:46,927 --> 01:05:49,894
NCT JUNGWOO: so I think
I was a bit nervous too.

1272
01:05:50,027 --> 01:05:54,494
NCT JUNGWOO: Thank you once again
for delivering such a polished

1273
01:05:54,494 --> 01:05:57,427
NCT JUNGWOO: and complete
performance on stage.

1274
01:05:57,694 --> 01:06:03,260
NCT TEN: Today is the first round,
so even if you made mistakes on stage

1275
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:07,660
NCT TEN: or aren't fully satisfied with
yourselves yet, that's perfectly okay.

1276
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:12,860
NCT TEN: After today, take some time
to reflect on what mistakes you made

1277
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,560
NCT TEN: and what you can improve.

1278
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:19,360
NCT TEN: Keep fighting and continue
showing even better performances ahead.

1279
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,727
MIYEON: Then from now,

1280
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:26,560
(The moment to announce the TOP PICK has arrived)
MIYEON: I'll announce NCT's TOP PICK.

1281
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,994
(What must come has come)

1282
01:06:29,994 --> 01:06:32,494
MIYEON: The team that
took first place in this round,

1283
01:06:32,494 --> 01:06:35,227
MIYEON: along with one member
chosen by NCT from each team,

1284
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,927
(Only 10 people are NCT's Top Pick)
MIYEON: a total of 10 people, will become NCT's TOP PICK.

1285
01:06:39,238 --> 01:06:42,760
MIYEON: All TOP PICK
B:GINNERs will survive

1286
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,926
- MIYEON: regardless of their ranking.
- Seriously, please.

1287
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:56,608
MIYEON: Then please unveil who is the Top Pick team
of the first round concept battle.

1288
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,992
NCT's TOP PICK team is...

1289
01:07:02,694 --> 01:07:06,246
(Hip-hop concept "Baggy Jeans")

1290
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,870
(showing off carefree swag)

1291
01:07:09,827 --> 01:07:12,460
(The Baggy Jeans Team received praise)
I think the energy was really good.

1292
01:07:12,827 --> 01:07:17,894
(for their performance but criticism for their vocals)
If the dancing is at this level, then the singing matches this much.

1293
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,327
(The charisma concept "Fact Check")

1294
01:07:22,894 --> 01:07:26,194
(with perfect teamwork
and powerful performance)

1295
01:07:26,194 --> 01:07:29,260
(High praise for teamwork)
I got a strong sense that the teamwork seemed really good.

1296
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:34,374
(But the vocals were lacking)
I think the vocal power could be stronger.

1297
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,494
(The sexy concept "Love Talk")

1298
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,118
(with a soft and sweet charm)

1299
01:07:42,427 --> 01:07:46,494
(Overall atmosphere was good but)
The performance captured the atmosphere well so I enjoyed it.

1300
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:53,260
(Love Talk Team lacked individual abilities)
I felt a bit like each person didn't fully show their roles.

1301
01:07:53,894 --> 01:07:56,727
(The old-school concept "90's Love")

1302
01:07:56,727 --> 01:08:00,512
(full of sporty and newtro vibes)

1303
01:08:00,512 --> 01:08:06,694
(Impressive to see them enjoying on stage)
Seeing them enjoy on stage made me also enjoy it.

1304
01:08:06,694 --> 01:08:12,360
(But the vocals were lacking)
I think it might be worth paying a bit more attention to the vocals.

1305
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:17,798
(The powerful concept "Kick It")

1306
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:20,966
(that dominated the stage
with intense energy)

1307
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,724
(Kick It Team showed strong confidence)
I was a bit curious about how it would be

1308
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:26,194
(Kick It Team showed strong confidence)
if the composition was slightly tighter.

1309
01:08:26,427 --> 01:08:31,194
(and received feedback on their new formation and concept)
The way you confidently delivered your performance was impressive.

1310
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:36,800
(NCT, carefully discussing and pondering)

1311
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,792
(over the tight competition)
Overall, I think it was really good.

1312
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:42,118
(over the tight competition)
Then you picked well. They really synced well together.

1313
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,160
(NCT discussing cautiously)
That's right.

1314
01:08:43,694 --> 01:08:45,734
(And the TOP PICK team chosen by NCT is...!)

1315
01:08:45,734 --> 01:08:46,694
Then, the first-place team.

1316
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:49,670
I've decided in my heart in my heart.
Then, the first-place team.

1317
01:08:50,194 --> 01:08:52,227
- Should we say it together on three?
- Shall we?

1318
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:53,606
- One, two, three.
- That's a relief. We all chose the same team.

1319
01:08:56,678 --> 01:09:01,727
(Unanimously selected top pick team)
- This team had great balance, and each member had their parts well divided. - Exactly.

1320
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,427
I will announce.

1321
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:06,246
NCT's

1322
01:09:07,174 --> 01:09:09,127
TOP PICK team is...

1323
01:09:09,594 --> 01:09:15,794
(All nervous)
- Please. - Please.

1324
01:09:15,794 --> 01:09:16,860
(Everyone tenses up)

1325
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:23,430
It's the charisma team Fact Check,
congratulations!

1326
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:32,998
- Wow, you worked hard.
- You did great.

1327
01:09:33,194 --> 01:09:35,464
(Even the masters acknowledge)
- Fact Check. -Did Fact Check team come in first?

1328
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,000
They had a high level of completeness.

1329
01:09:37,894 --> 01:09:38,927
- LIA KIM: As expected...
- They definitely deserved to come in first.

1330
01:09:38,927 --> 01:09:42,344
LIA KIM: As expected, the team formed
by the surprise mission winner.

1331
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,384
- As expected.
- That's right.

1332
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:47,227
(Proud KAI)

1333
01:09:47,494 --> 01:09:49,027
KAI: That was truly the moment

1334
01:09:49,027 --> 01:09:50,827
KAI: we wanted the most.

1335
01:09:50,827 --> 01:09:53,926
We showed it, we really showed it.

1336
01:09:56,727 --> 01:09:59,294
NCT TEN: The combination of all
the members is really really good.

1337
01:09:59,294 --> 01:10:03,660
NCT TEN: When your team
performed, each one stood out.

1338
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:07,334
NCT TEN: I think everyone
fulfilled their roles well.

1339
01:10:07,334 --> 01:10:11,027
NCT TEN: Overall, it
really feels like a team.

1340
01:10:11,027 --> 01:10:13,638
(Their stage left a strong impression on NCT)
NCT TEN: So we chose your team.

1341
01:10:13,638 --> 01:10:15,334
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1342
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,960
KIM JEONGHOON: All the hard
times were recognized,

1343
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:21,260
KIM JEONGHOON: and it felt like
the results came back to us.

1344
01:10:21,606 --> 01:10:23,488
KIM JEONGHOON: So I felt really good.

1345
01:10:23,488 --> 01:10:29,127
LI ZHIWEI: I felt that
the effort wasn't in vain.

1346
01:10:29,127 --> 01:10:31,827
LI ZHIWEI: I was so happy.

1347
01:10:31,942 --> 01:10:35,686
The Fact Check Team
selected as TOP PICK all survived.

1348
01:10:36,518 --> 01:10:41,094
Now, all the B:GINNERs except
for the first-place team are at risk of elimination.

1349
01:10:42,022 --> 01:10:45,190
But, there's still one
last chance to be saved

1350
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:47,334
from elimination regardless of ranking.

1351
01:10:48,794 --> 01:10:54,994
Now, I'll announce the TOP PICK B:GINNERs
from the remaining four teams.

1352
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:01,827
(Revealing from the Baggy Jeans Team)
I'll announce the TOP PICK of the Baggy Jeans Team.

1353
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,460
YANG HYEONBIN: I thought either
JUNMYEONG or JAEIL would receive it.

1354
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,646
LEE YEONTAE: For dance
performance, will it be JAEIL,

1355
01:11:08,646 --> 01:11:11,227
LEE YEONTAE: or
the well-balanced JUNMYEONG?

1356
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:15,142
(Who will be the TOP PICK of the Baggy Jeans Team?)
The TOP PICK is...

1357
01:11:15,378 --> 01:11:17,242
(Next Episode)

1358
01:11:17,242 --> 01:11:18,944
The B:GINNER who will be eliminated is...

1359
01:11:18,944 --> 01:11:20,320
(Crossing fates of the B:GINNERs)
I had no confidence in surviving.

1360
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,638
Could be me, huh?

1361
01:11:21,638 --> 01:11:23,638
(What will be
the surprising outcome of Round 1?)

1362
01:11:24,888 --> 01:11:26,528
(After the war-like Round 1，)
Wow, let's go.

1363
01:11:26,528 --> 01:11:27,439
(the B:GINNERs are thrilled for their outing)
This is great.

1364
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:28,512
Coming to the training camp

1365
01:11:28,512 --> 01:11:30,105
has me really, really pumped.

1366
01:11:30,105 --> 01:11:32,448
(A fun-filled training camp life)
Since we're off today.

1367
01:11:33,312 --> 01:11:35,584
(A ringtone that rings when they're off guard)

1368
01:11:36,032 --> 01:11:37,894
- I think I'm getting PTSD.
- I'm scared.

1369
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:40,192
The TOP IDOL of Round 2 is MONSTA X.

1370
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:42,720
The theme of Round 2 is Team Deathmatch.

1371
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,654
(Run and fight)
We've got to enjoy this.

1372
01:11:43,654 --> 01:11:45,280
(Run, fight, and take them down)
I truly believe I can win no matter what.

1373
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,528
(Hurt or fall,)
In the Team Deathmatch,

1374
01:11:46,528 --> 01:11:47,994
(but no grit means elimination)
any team not chosen by the TOP IDOL

1375
01:11:47,994 --> 01:11:50,912
will become candidates for elimination.

1376
01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:53,280
We won't lose, no matter what.
