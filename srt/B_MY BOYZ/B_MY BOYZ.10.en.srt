55
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:40,933
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Due to what the song's like,
it could leave people feeling a bit let down.

56
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:45,029
TVXQ! U-KNOW:
I think it's quite a risky song.

57
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:49,504
TVXQ! U-KNOW: If I don't feel any gap, then
I'll think the people here are really impressive.

63

- It's too scary, U-KNOW.
- That's...

64
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,775
Hearing that might make me more nervous.

65
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:08,034
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Which B:GINNER
choreographed the intro part?

66
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:11,386
Intro choreography by
B:GINNER KIM JEONGHOON.

67
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,883
TVXQ! U-KNOW: So, what concept

68
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:15,808

will you show us?

69
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:18,939
(Keep Your Head Down Team's intro concept is Dynamism)
We've chosen the keyword 'dynamism' for now.

70
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:23,087
To express this kind of dynamism,
instead of a powerful choreography,

71
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,800
we aimed to create contrast

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,064
by starting with a lyrical dance
to highlight the dynamism.

73
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,875
KIM JEONGHOON: We wanted to show
a distinctive difference from other teams.

74
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:35,136
KIM JEONGHOON: So, I intentionally
made the intro with a lyrical feel.

75
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,965
(Maximized dynamism, a lyrical intro
contrasting the powerful 'Keep Your Head Down')

76

looking forward to it.

we enjoy the stage now.

(K-POP Legend Match, second stage,
'Keep Your Head Down')

82
00:03:54,336 --> 00:04:02,203
KIM JEONGHOON: We think our choreography
and the song show anger, sadness, and hate.

83
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:04,443
KIM JEONGHOON: We would appreciate it
if you focused on those aspects.

there's a lingering sensation left.

787
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:47,597
HYO: Performing together
as the same team was so much fun.

788
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:53,230
We aimed to make
a great stage together rather than compete.

789
00:39:53,275 --> 00:40:00,164
Singing together feels like debuting
as group members under the name B:MY BOYZ.

00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:02,587
(The 'HUG' stage where we forgot about competition)

00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:04,283

for the B:MY BOYZ 4th round K-POP Legend Match.

840
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:54,395
(TOP PICK Selection Method)
From the TOP PICK TEAM that took first place, select two members.

841
00:42:54,395 --> 00:42:57,691
And from the remaining teams,
one member each is chosen.

842
00:42:57,691 --> 00:43:01,659
These two B:GINNERs are then decided
as the TOP PICKs of the 4th round.

843
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:05,179
The B:GINNERs from the TOP PICK TEAM
that took 1st place

844
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:10,624
will receive an additional 100 points
added to their individual on-site votes.

845
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:15,297
(TOP PICK TEAM)
Now, let's reveal the TOP PICK TEAM where two TOP PICK B:GINNERs emerged.

846
00:43:15,297 --> 00:43:17,897
TVXQ! U-KNOW: All three teams
gave amazing performances,

847
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:21,231
TVXQ! U-KNOW: so choosing just
one team isn't an easy decision.

848
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,197
TVXQ! U-KNOW: But everyone,
this choice isn't everything.

849
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:27,231
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Even if you're
not chosen, don't be discouraged.

850
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:32,231
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I hope you'll work hard for a day
when you stand on the same stage with each other.

851
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:33,387
Yes.

852
00:43:33,915 --> 00:43:35,163
Then, I will announce.

853
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:38,897
(Finally, it's time to announce
the TOP PICK TEAM)

854
00:43:38,897 --> 00:43:40,797
KANG JUNSEONG: Please...

855
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:46,231
The TOP PICK TEAM I chose is...

856
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:50,240
TVXQ! U-KNOW: The team whose performance
was noticeably different before and after going on stage

857
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,999
was actually the Rising Sun team.

858
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:58,272
(The 'Rising Sun' team
showcased strong charisma)

859
00:43:58,272 --> 00:44:00,027
(In contrast to the tense appearance before the stage)
I wondered if it might be a bit stiff.

860
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:05,307
(The Rising Sun' team sufficiently showcased their charm)
But your team actually showed a lot of strengths in the strong song.

861
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:08,497
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I really had
a hard time with two to three members.

862
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:11,771
(First candidate: HYO
with his intense rapping)

863
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:17,722
(Second candidate: the adorable
PARK SECHAN)

864
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,003
(Third candidate: explosive energy AI)
I thought that if B:GINNER AI polished up,

865
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,488
TVXQ! U-KNOW: it would be really fun.

866
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:26,416
Keep Your Head Down
team members are really good, too.

867
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:29,590
When they said they would
show their own poetic side...

868
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:33,103
The next part was too strong,
but Keep Your Head Down team...

869
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,707
Actually, JEONGHOON did well all around.

870
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:37,248
(Vocal, dance, choreography creation,
KIM JEONGHOON was outstanding in all areas)

871
00:44:37,248 --> 00:44:38,395
But, KAI's charm is
just on another level.

872
00:44:38,395 --> 00:44:39,279
(But KAI, a bundle of charm,
overwhelms everything)

873
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:40,643
KAI has so much charm.

874
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:48,331
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Exactly KAI,
and JEONGHOON got my attention.

875
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:50,400
They even sang together.

876
00:44:50,716 --> 00:44:54,112
The Mirotic team was different
from what was expected.

877
00:44:55,104 --> 00:44:56,913
Actually, I guess I had
higher expectations.

878
00:44:56,913 --> 00:44:59,456
Actually, they were a bit frozen.

879
00:44:59,456 --> 00:45:03,166
But, what's confusing is that during
HUG they completely messed it up.

880
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:07,822
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I immediately
chose one person based on potential.

881
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:09,622
TVXQ! U-KNOW: And I'm really
struggling with another one.

882
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:12,736
Actually, it's about looking at YEONTAE,
as YEONTAE also has a lot of charm.

883
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,800
But, JAEIL also has charm.

884
00:45:16,992 --> 00:45:19,500
So, both of them are quite capable,

885
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:25,222
TVXQ! U-KNOW: I think it's right to
choose the team with more charm.

886
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:29,116
Wait a moment, wait a moment.

887
00:45:29,536 --> 00:45:32,512
Just a minute, just a little
more time, I'm still unsure.

888
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:37,856
(U-KNOW becoming cautious)
Our B:GINNERs' lives are also on the line, so I think we need to think very carefully.

889
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,559
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Can I
just check it once more?

890
00:45:45,216 --> 00:45:47,776
Let me see it one more time.

891
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,962
Let me hear it just once more
as the last time.

892
00:45:52,313 --> 00:45:56,416
(After much careful consideration,
what will U-KNOW's choice be?)

893
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,328
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Then, I'll announce it.

894
00:46:00,973 --> 00:46:05,600
The TOP PICK TEAM I chose is...

895
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:07,789
LIM JIHWAN: Rising Sun...

896
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:09,489
KANG JUNSEONG: Keep Your Head Down...

897
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,856
KIM JEONGHOON: I'm much
more nervous than usual.

898
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:19,584
HYO: This time, I think
I'm the most nervous.

899
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:21,522
MOON JAEIL: I guess
I was secretly hoping for it.

900
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:25,056
(The TOP PICK TEAM chosen by TVXQ! is?)

901
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,317
Mirotic team.

902
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,593
Mirotic team.

903
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:34,063
We made it.

904
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,000
(Mirotic team earned 100 bonus live vote points)

905
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,600
(Congratulations)

906
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,816
What a shame.

907
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:41,504
(Masters are surprised by the historic
neck-and-neck 4th round results)

908
00:46:41,504 --> 00:46:43,616
(But, an understandable choice)
Oh, really?

909
00:46:43,616 --> 00:46:44,889
As expected...

910
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:49,922
TVXQ! U-KNOW: Honestly, all three teams have
such different charms that I was very conflicted.

911
00:46:49,922 --> 00:46:52,224
(TVXQ!'s evaluation points, potential)
I wanted to bet a bit on the potential.

912
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:54,592
(The intensity of Mirotic)
Mirotic song and...

913
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:58,400
(The softness of HUG)
Wasn't the gap the biggest?

914
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:01,888
(The Mirotic team showed
two different charms well)

915
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,976
(Stages that showcased the potential
to highlight various charms)
Thank you.

916
00:47:03,912 --> 00:47:05,103
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

917
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:05,791
No, no, it's nothing.

918
00:47:07,056 --> 00:47:08,656
YANG HYEONBIN: Oh, it was really great.

919
00:47:08,656 --> 00:47:12,489
YANG HYEONBIN: I felt like I could
just jump up to the second floor.

920
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:13,622
Oh, I was so happy.

921
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:17,756
KIM BOHYEON: It was just so thrilling because
it was the first time our team won in all four rounds.

922
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:21,289
KIM BOHYEON: Wow, had I really not
felt this before? It was just so thrilling.

923
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:23,279
KIM BOHYEON: While being
on this B:MY BOYZ,

924
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:29,089
I wanted to win at least once
and finish the program.

925
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:34,022
KIM BOHYEON: It feels like we're being rewarded
for all the practice we've worked hard on...

926
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:37,316
Thank you so very much
for granting that small wish.

927
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:41,756
Now, we'll reveal the two
TOP PICK B:GINNERs of the HUG team.

928
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:46,560
TVXQ! U-KNOW: The Mirotic team's
TOP PICK B:GINNER I chose is...

929
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,738
JAEIL, or JUNHYEOK.

930
00:47:48,738 --> 00:47:51,136
KIM BOHYEON: First, I was
sure JAEIL would make it.

931
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:54,560
KIM BOHYEON: I did wonder
who the other person would be.

932
00:47:54,735 --> 00:47:57,635
MOON JAEIL: Of course,
I wished for it.

933
00:47:59,161 --> 00:48:00,465
B:GINNER MOON JAEIL.

934
00:48:02,777 --> 00:48:03,699
B:GINNER BAN DANIEL.

935
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:10,669
Oh, thank you.

936
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:11,776
BAN DANIEL.

937
00:48:11,776 --> 00:48:13,977
(Surprised)

this BAN DANIEL's first time?

944
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:25,935
I'm curious about your reason
for selecting him as TOP PICK.

945
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:29,849

B:GINNER BAN DANIEL for the potential.

946
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:32,704

However...

948
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:39,289
Standing alongside
such talented and impressive seniors,

949
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:41,071
(BAN DANIEL who showed his own stage enough)
I wondered if he could show his own thing,

950
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:43,982
and I was amazed by his determination.

951
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:45,962
Thank you.

952
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:47,705

he played a pivotal role through his performance.

to be recognized for that part.

be picked as TOP PICK...

958
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:08,235

expecting it at all.

who held the center dance-wise.

in Round 3, I thought it might be tough.

1029
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,959

HYO: This time, I didn't get the bonus,

1072
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:56,892

Having put in so much effort
and persevered,

1203
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,639
I will definitely make it to debut.

1204

Since this road is not the end,

1205
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,455
there will be opportunities
to show my cooler sides in the future,

1206
01:03:33,455 --> 01:03:35,959
and I want to show them to you.

1207
01:03:36,544 --> 01:03:41,373
So, I think you can raise your
expectations of me even more.

1208
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,373
I will enjoyably participate in the show,

1209
01:03:43,373 --> 01:03:46,743
with other contestants.

1210
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:50,799
I will write our own
story while competing.

1211
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:53,088
Still, during each round,

1212
01:03:53,088 --> 01:03:56,783
I was really happy because I felt
like I ended each round without regret.

1213
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:59,439
To my B:GINNER friends,

1214
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:02,340
I hope you'll shine even
brighter for my share,

1215
01:04:02,479 --> 01:04:06,767
and I was happy to be part
of the journey in B:MY BOYZ.

1216
01:04:07,215 --> 01:04:09,304
If you think you can, you can.

1217
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:13,911
Don't give up until the end and do your
best with what you've been given and more.

1218
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:19,127
Even though time has passed,
I still find myself thinking about

1219
01:04:19,695 --> 01:04:22,359
the regrets from each stage.

1220
01:04:22,927 --> 01:04:25,943
However, because I was able to
show my growth little by little,

1221
01:04:26,383 --> 01:04:27,759
I've gained confidence.

1222
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:30,423
I want to be remembered as the B:GINNER

1223
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:32,823
who grew the most and also as the one

1224
01:04:32,823 --> 01:04:35,855
who felt the most like an older brother.

1225
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:40,471
Even when it's tough, I won't give up.
Even when I'm happy, I won't get arrogant.

1226
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:44,303
I'll write my story in a way
that brings strength

1227
01:04:44,335 --> 01:04:46,707
and a smile to others.

1228
01:04:46,707 --> 01:04:48,495
I believe this was a step

1229
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:52,273
that allowed someone like me to grow.

1230
01:04:52,303 --> 01:04:57,832
I've shown a lot over time, and because
there are people who've loved that side of me,

1231
01:04:58,095 --> 01:05:00,717
I feel like I've been
happy because of it.

1232
01:05:02,927 --> 01:05:06,373
(Another farewell is approaching
before the final round)

1233
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:11,319
(As they've journeyed through four
towards the same dream)

1234
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:13,847
I wasn't going to cry,
but thinking of each one...

1235
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:15,373
I know.

1236
01:05:15,373 --> 01:05:16,439
I'll miss you a lot, too.

1237
01:05:16,439 --> 01:05:18,119
I can't help but cry.

1238
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,847
Don't cry.

1239
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:25,607
(A feeling of regret because
they can't be together anymore)

1240
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,839
Why leave first?

1241
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:32,064

the producing master who has led you until now.

1281

(Buzzed-about PENTAGON members)
It's legendary, feels like a dream.

1291
01:07:43,784 --> 01:07:49,015
My first song was created by Master HUI.

1292
01:07:49,015 --> 01:07:52,591
It's really Master HUI,
who is like a father to us.

1293

It's our song, what should we do?

1319
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:11,984
MC DEX: The second song is At an Angle.

1320
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:13,751

of acting in a unique way in a uniform world)

1321
01:09:19,751 --> 01:09:20,584
KIM BOHYEON: It's hip-hop, right?

This has a lot of highlights.

1329
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:46,651

(Deep deliberation)

1347
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,075
