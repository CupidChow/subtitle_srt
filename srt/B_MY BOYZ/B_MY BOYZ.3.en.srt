Let's begin B:MY BOYZ' first round.

Who is your boy?

3
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:06,984
B:MY BOYZ.

00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,533
(The concept battle of Round 1)

12
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,536
(Followed by praise from top idol NCT)
I think it's been great so far. Watching it,

13
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:36,032
I found myself enjoying it too, and the performance
really set the mood and pulled me in.

14
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,424
(and harsh criticism that came)
Great dancing, but the singing fell a bit short.

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,075
It made me think vocals could
use more focus. Just a little.

16
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,633
(And, the highly anticipated TOP PICK)
I'm about to announce NCT's top pick.

took first place in this round,

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,900
MC MIYEON: along with one member
chosen by NCT from each team,

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,520
(Only 10 people are NCT's TOP PICK)
10 people in total will be NCT's TOP PICKs.

Wow.

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,733
(Which team will be NCT's top pick?)
NCT's top pick team is...

24
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:09,856
Fact Check, the charismatic team.

25
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:11,104
(Charismtic, Fact Check)

26
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:13,120

30
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:26,336
are elimination candidates.

31
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:31,399
But there's still one last chance
for elimination candidates to be saved,

32
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:32,864
regardless of their rankings.

33
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:38,057

35
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:49,216

will be either JUNMYEONG or JAEIL.

36
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:52,466
LEE YEONTAE: As for dance
performance, it could be JAEIL,

37
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:55,199
LEE YEONTAE: but overall balance
might favor JUNMYEONG...

38

NCT TEN: You already
have a great vocal tone,

43
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:14,799
NCT TEN: and your dancing
is very clean overall.

44
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,699
NCT TEN: I think if you
discuss with the masters

45
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,224

your skills and practice a lot,

46

say I've already earned the crown.

50

a promise to work even harder

51

(The fate of two teams divided by the Masters' choice)
- But the match seems worth watching. - That's right.

00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,162
(It's a shame)

805
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:47,131
Okay, okay.

806
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:48,633
Okay, okay.

807
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:56,813
LEE YUNSUNG: I love MONSTA X's
song "Love Killa" so much, so...

808
00:38:57,846 --> 00:39:01,313
LEE YEONTAE: I like and am confident

809
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:02,764
LEE YEONTAE: in facial acting,

810
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:06,279
LEE YEONTAE: so it would be
great if the song is "Love Killa".

811
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:10,113
YANG HYEONBIN: Ah, this is bad...
I felt like we got snatched away.

812
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:13,246
(MONSTA B: "Shoot Out"/
MY MONSTAZ: "Love Killa")

813
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:16,114
PENTAGON HUI: The next battle event,
deciding the priority

814
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:18,946
PENTAGON HUI: for the vocal match
song selection,

815
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:22,988
(This competition is for
the vocal match selection priority)

816
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,746
PENTAGON HUI: is a team
jump rope competition.

817
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:26,892
- It's really...
- Ah.

818
00:39:26,988 --> 00:39:28,268
That would be difficult.

819
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:29,713
KANG JUNSEONG: Team spirit is key here.

820
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:31,513
WILLIAM: This is a game
that really shows teamwork.

821
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:34,804
(One chance only)
So, the rules for the team jump rope are pretty simple.

822
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:37,676
The team that succeeds with more jumps

823
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:39,146
(The winning team chooses 1 of 4 songs)
than the other team earns priority

824
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:40,460
(B:MY BOYZ, 2nd ROUND, 13 vs 13 death match)
for the vocal match song selection.

825
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:44,076
(The winning team chooses 1 out of 4 songs)
Practice, and we'll regroup in 5 minutes.

826
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,092
(MY MONSTAZ team's practice)
JUNMYEONG, please lead the chant.

827
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,479
Five, six, seven, eight.

828
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:51,500
(In alignment with JUNMYEONG's chant)
One, two, and three, four.

829
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,268
(MY MONSTAZ perfectly in sync)
Six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six.

830
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,420
Seven, eight.

831
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,252
Okay, okay.

832
00:39:58,252 --> 00:39:59,646
(Taking it easy to save energy by finishing early)
Like this, like this.

833
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:00,780
Great job, team.

834
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,421
Okay.
On purpose...

835
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:03,692
Why are they doing
private lessons there?

836
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,965
Looks like they kept
tripping over their feet.

837
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:07,113
(Meanwhile, MONSTA B team is...)
One, two, three, four.

838
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:10,828
Who was it!

839
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:12,779
(SUTHASCHAI sneakily checking)
Are we done?

840
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:16,364
(Caught right on the tip of the foot)

841
00:40:16,364 --> 00:40:17,847
Two, three, four.

842
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:19,451
Oops.

843
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,348
I am sorry.

844
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:24,524
(B:GINNERs switch seats)
Shall we switch AI and SUTHASCHAI for now?

845
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:26,839
Can you make the front
seat a bit wider? Just a little.

846
00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:29,004
One, two, three, four.

847
00:40:31,884 --> 00:40:33,632
(Wait, who was it?)
Wait...

848
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,885
Did someone trip in the middle?

849
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:36,908
(It's SUTHASCHAI, again)

850
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:39,692
I think it would be better
to place SUTHASCHAI in the middle.

851
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,868
(The easiest spot to pass the rope is the center)
Okay, let's put SUTHASCHAI in the middle, alright? Okay.

852
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:44,780
Uh?

853
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,411
Camera.

854
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:48,652
Ah.

855
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:49,484
(This time again?)
Hey, what is it?

856
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:50,668
(Again? SUTHASCHAI)
SUTHASCHAI just barely tripped at the end.

857
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:51,648
What a shame, what a shame.

858
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:52,428
- Three.
- Three.
(MONSTA B can't get past three jumps)

859
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:54,092
I'm sorry.

860
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:56,620
Yes, I'm sorry.

861
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,252
(Solo special training)
Three, four.

862
00:40:58,252 --> 00:40:59,084
Jump.
SUTHASCHAI!

863
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:00,524
Ah.

864
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,547
(OMG)
SUTHASCHAI.

865
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:05,131
(Oh my God)
SUTHASCHAI.

866
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:07,916
(Unbelievable reality)

867
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:08,709
SUTHASCHAI.

868
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:17,644
SUTHASCHAI: Everyone said it was okay, but their
fierce looks made me think we were in big trouble.

869
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:23,746
SUTHASCHAI: I was too nervous.

870
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:26,028
(Now the real match!)
Let's start with the MONSTA B.

871
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:26,912
Fighting.
Just a moment.

872
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:28,108
(SUTHASCHAI is taking off shoes?)
Okay, SUTHASCHAI.

873
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,676
KAI, do your best.

874
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:30,750
Take it off, take it off.

875
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:32,679
(Quickly put down his
shoes and came back)

876
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,279
(Just grateful? Opponent team leader)
You are doing well. Just keep it up like before.

877
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:38,604
(Will the barefoot fighting spirit shine through?)
MONSTA B, fighting!

878
00:41:38,604 --> 00:41:39,971
Okay. SUTHASCHAI, let's go.

879
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,180
(Nervous)

880
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,996
Ah, please, please, please.

881
00:41:45,996 --> 00:41:46,924
Alright, let's start.

882
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:49,712
(Second match: Priority for the vocal match song selection, team jump rope)
One, two, three.

883
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,313
(MONSTA B)
One.

884
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:53,346
Two.

885
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:54,346
Three.
Four.

886
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,012
One.

887
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:58,713
(Holding the person in front's shoulders to sync jumps)
Two, three, four.

888
00:41:58,732 --> 00:41:59,507
- Oh.
- Nine.
Ten.

889
00:42:00,428 --> 00:42:01,132
Seven.
Now.

890
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,156
Five.
Now.
Six.

891
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:03,532
Now.

892
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:06,046
(First time clearing 5 jumps in the real round)
Now, now.

893
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:06,636
Ten.
Now.

894
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:07,646
Eleven.
Now.

895
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,880
Now.

896
00:42:10,124 --> 00:42:10,713
Now.
Ugh.

897
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:12,652
(Anxious MY MONSTAZ)
Why are they so good?

898
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:13,196
Ugh.
Ah.

899
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:15,788
Now.

900
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:16,369
Okay.
- Now.
- Ah...

901
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:17,932
Okay.
Now.
Sixteen.

902
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:19,276
Now.
Sixteen.

903
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:20,777
(MONSTA B finishes with 17 jumps)

904
00:42:20,777 --> 00:42:23,500
Alright, seventeen.

905
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,621
Ah, satisfied, satisfied!

906
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:28,972
(Unexpected situation)
What should we do?
Hey.

907
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:30,417
We can do it, we can do it.
Seventeen.

908
00:42:31,372 --> 00:42:32,588
Ah, they did way too many.

909
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:34,569
I think seventeen is a lot?

910
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:35,692
(Well done, SUTHASCHAI)

911
00:42:35,692 --> 00:42:36,748
Looks like we did a great job.

912
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:38,254
SUTHASCHAI, are you happy?

913
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:39,266
I'm really happy.

914
00:42:41,836 --> 00:42:42,395
So happy.

915
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:43,692
Okay, then next team?

916
00:42:43,692 --> 00:42:44,405
- Yes.
- Alright.

917
00:42:45,853 --> 00:42:47,788
(MONSTA B's pup coming
to fetch the shoes)

918
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:48,620
Thank you.
Ah, so cute.

919
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,667
(Guys, I did well, right?)

920
00:42:54,395 --> 00:42:55,788
(Jumps in for a big hug)

921
00:42:55,788 --> 00:42:56,908
(SUTHASCHAI is happy with all his body)

922
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,272
Ah.

923
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:02,891
(Now it's MY MONSTAZ' turn)
Alright, MY MONSTAZ team.

924
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,713
(Unseen fierce effort from the opposing team)
I didn't see this fearsome side during practice,

925
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:12,846
HYO: but if they perform
this well in the real match,

926
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:15,468
HYO: they'll be
intimidating on stage too...

927
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:17,276
Wow, we're in trouble.

928
00:43:17,276 --> 00:43:22,246
PARK SECHAN: Suddenly,
they hit 17 jumps... please...

929
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:26,421
(MY MONSTAZ)
One, two, three.

930
00:43:26,946 --> 00:43:29,946
(Will they beat MONSTA B's 17 jumps?)
One, two, three.

931
00:43:29,946 --> 00:43:31,113
Four.

932
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:32,046
Five.

933
00:43:32,046 --> 00:43:33,113
Six.

934
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:34,046
Seven.

935
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Eight.
Nine.

936
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:36,716
Ten.

937
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:37,946
Eleven.

938
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:38,680
Twelve.

939
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:39,713
Thirteen.
Fourteen.

940
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:42,813
Fifteen.

941
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:43,480
(Please)
Fifteen.

942
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,548
Fifteen.

943
00:43:45,548 --> 00:43:46,413
Sixteen.
Seventeen.

944
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:49,680
(The crucial moment,17 jumps)
Seventeen.

945
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:53,004
Sixteen.

946
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:54,074
Seventeen.

947
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:56,076
(Surpassed 17 pieces)
Eighteen

948
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:57,894
Eighteen.

949
00:43:57,894 --> 00:43:58,771
(No)
Nineteen.
Twenty.

950
00:43:59,397 --> 00:44:00,140
Eighteen.

951
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,152
Nineteen.

952
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:01,964
Twenty.
Twenty-one.

953
00:44:02,713 --> 00:44:03,913
Twenty-two.

954
00:44:03,913 --> 00:44:04,680
Twenty-three.
(During a trick)
Twenty-seven.

955
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:06,641
Twenty-eight.

956
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:07,840
Twenty-nine.

957
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,412
(MY MONSTAZ succeeded with 29)

958
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:11,660
Okay.

959
00:44:13,836 --> 00:44:15,092
Not easy.

960
00:44:15,724 --> 00:44:19,116
The priority for the vocal match song selection

961
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:21,004
goes to MY MONSTAZ team.

962
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,550
Two wins in a row.

963
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:26,746
(MONSTA B sinking into a two-loss slump)

964
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:28,321
So, please put a sticker

965
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:30,572
on the song that our B:GINNER

966
00:44:30,572 --> 00:44:31,337
BAN DANIEL wants.

967
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:33,495
(Whisper, go tease)
Go tease, go tease.

968
00:44:35,564 --> 00:44:36,309
What are you doing?

969
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,196
What are you doing?

970
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:39,538
(Tap, tap)

971
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:40,687
(Stunned and speechless)

972
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:43,884
As the youngest...

973
00:44:43,884 --> 00:44:44,618
So,

974
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:45,996
(Which vocal song will MY MONSTAZ choose?)
BAN DANIEL, you can

975
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:50,848
Take your time choosing, no rush.

976
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:55,080
YANG HYEONBIN: I really love
"You Were Beautiful."

977
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,380
YANG HYEONBIN: I'm a huge fan of DAY6.

978
00:44:57,452 --> 00:45:00,768
LI ZHIWEI: I used to really love the song
"You Were Beautiful" and listened to it a lot.

979
00:45:00,768 --> 00:45:06,280
LI ZHIWEI: So, when I saw this song,
I got super excited and hopeful.

980
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,172
(What song will he choose?)
Take your time choosing, no rush.

981
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,460
(MY MONSTAZ chose
BTS's "Spring Day")

982
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,580
Well done, well done.

983
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,308
They chose BTS's "Spring Day"

984
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,612
as their vocal match battle song.

985
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,524
YANG HYEONBIN: Fortunately,
they picked "Spring Day,"

986
00:45:24,524 --> 00:45:26,220
YANG HYEONBIN: which I actually liked.

987
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:28,913
PENTAGON HUI: What song will
Team MONSTA B choose?

988
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,046
(MONSTA B chooses DAY6's
"You Were Beautiful")

989
00:45:37,046 --> 00:45:38,988
So, with that, Team MONSTA B has chosen

990
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:42,580
DAY6's "You Were Beautiful."

991
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,094
Now?

992
00:45:44,613 --> 00:45:45,740
PENTAGON HUI: It might even be more important.

993
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,680
We'll now proceed with the final battle to decide the stage order.

994
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:52,844
What's the final event?

995
00:45:52,844 --> 00:45:54,546
It's arm wrestling.

996
00:45:55,852 --> 00:45:57,676
Oh, this is bad.

997
00:45:57,676 --> 00:46:00,460
We've got this. HARUTO and PARK JUNHYEOK are on our side.

998
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:02,316
But this is...

999
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:06,021
(3 vs 3 all-kill arm wrestling)
One by one, players come out for arm wrestling.

1000
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:09,068
If you beat all the opposing
team members, you win.

1001
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:11,692
(First match: Stage order priority)
We'll start with the first round. First challengers, please come out!

1002
00:46:11,692 --> 00:46:13,467
JUNHYEOK, let's go.

1003
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:14,892
(MONSTA B, No.1 PARK JUNHYEOK)

1004
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:16,328
He's taking off his
watch before starting.

1005
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:19,068
Treasured item, treasured item.
(MY MONSTAZ, No.1 WILLIAM)

1006
00:46:19,628 --> 00:46:21,228
He's strong.

1007
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:24,346
Oh, hey.

1008
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:25,484
He's taking the lead, setting the pace.

1009
00:46:25,484 --> 00:46:26,590
Show the power of Australia.

1010
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,231
(Ready)

1011
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,140
Start.

1012
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:33,090
MONSTA B.

1013
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:34,755
MONSTA B.

1014
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:36,364
(In one shot)

1015
00:46:36,618 --> 00:46:38,668
(What?)

1016
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:40,748
(MONSTA B's PARK JUNHYEOK wins)
Wow, we won.

1017
00:46:40,748 --> 00:46:45,036
Now, our MONSTA B, MONSTA B.

1018
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:47,052
(MY MONSTAZ, No. 2)
Next B:GINNER, please come out.

1019
00:46:47,052 --> 00:46:48,652
Our B:GINNER YUNSUNG and...

1020
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:49,100
YUNSUNG.

1021
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,156
B:GINNER JUNHYEOK.

1022
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:52,689
Alright, ready,

1023
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:55,372
start.

1024
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:56,812
(This time it's a close match)

1025
00:46:56,812 --> 00:46:57,836
- Wow.
- MONSTA B.

1026
00:46:57,836 --> 00:46:59,148
(MONSTA B's JUNHYEOK tries to pass,)
MONSTA B.

1027
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:00,268
- LEE YUNSUNG.
- MONSTA B.

1028
00:47:00,353 --> 00:47:01,324
(while MY MONSTAZ' YUNSUNG holds firm)
LEE YUNSUNG.

1029
00:47:01,324 --> 00:47:03,436
- LEE YUNSUNG, LEE YUNSUNG.
- MONSTA B.

1030
00:47:03,564 --> 00:47:06,624
(But)
LEE YUNSUNG.

1031
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,948
(Straining)
LEE YUNSUNG!

1032
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:13,796
(Wining)

1033
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:17,164
(After a close match, MY MONSTAZ's
LEE YUNSUNG wins)

1034
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:18,988
Cut, cut, cut!

1035
00:47:18,988 --> 00:47:20,844
YUNSUNG, you're
doing so well, so well.

1036
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:23,372
Let's go.

1037
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:24,546
(MONSTA B, No. 2 LI ZHIWEI)
Let's go.

1038
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:27,020
Relax your shoulders, shoulders.

1039
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,388
Okay, massage, massage.

1040
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,316
Cheer up, cheer up.
Massage.

1041
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:31,884
Thai massage.

1042
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:36,671
(The majesty of the original)

1043
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:37,872
(Bursting out laughing)
Thai massage.

1044
00:47:39,978 --> 00:47:41,208
(The effect was amazing)

1045
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,541
(Laughing)

1046
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,020
Alright, are you ready?

1047
00:47:45,901 --> 00:47:46,444
(MONSTA B empowered by massage)

1048
00:47:46,444 --> 00:47:48,826
Oh, it's really neck and neck.

1049
00:47:51,276 --> 00:47:52,278
Alright, let's go.

1050
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,940
Let's go.

1051
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,156
Start.

1052
00:47:54,156 --> 00:47:57,580
(A fierce battle without a single retreat)
MONSTA B, MONSTA B.

1053
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,436
- More, more.
- MONSTA B.

1054
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:01,548
- MONSTA B, MONSTA B.
- Win.

1055
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:02,417
(Forearm clenched)

1056
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:04,012
More, more.

1057
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,540
A little more, a little more.

1058
00:48:06,668 --> 00:48:08,812
(Keep going! Keep going!)
LI ZHIWEI, LI ZHIWEI.

1059
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:10,028
(Gradually leaning towards MY MONSTAZ YUNSUNG's side)
You can do it,

1060
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:11,907
you can do it.

1061
00:48:11,907 --> 00:48:14,124
(Time over)
Ah.

1062
00:48:14,988 --> 00:48:15,670
- Our...
- Good job, good job.

1063
00:48:16,683 --> 00:48:18,834
Victory for B:GINNER YUNSUNG!

1064
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,996
I'm proud of you.

1065
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:23,417
(The desperate MONSTA B)
Wow, YUNSUNG is strong.

1066
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,383
Bro.

1067
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:25,471
Let's go.

1068
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:29,146
HARUTO: I thought, "I should compete."

1069
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,492
HARUTO: I felt like
we lost because of me,

1070
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:35,456
(MONSTA B's last HARUTO)
so I was determined that I absolutely had to win.

1071
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,390
From first year of elementary school
to 6th grade, I played baseball.

1072
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,406
I think I am strong.

1073
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:44,166
I'm confident.

1074
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:44,870
Just let it go.

1075
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,278
Our HARUTO will do well.

1076
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:47,302
If he wins, it's truly legendary.

1077
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:48,294
Shall we start?

1078
00:48:48,294 --> 00:48:50,141
(MONSTA B will have a 3-match losing streak if they lose this time)
They say good things come in small packages, right?

1079
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:51,539
(Can he write a comeback story?)
If one person loses strength, the other opponent wins.

1080
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:52,550
Ready.

1081
00:48:52,582 --> 00:48:53,376
Show us.

1082
00:48:54,157 --> 00:48:55,622
Start.

1083
00:48:55,622 --> 00:48:59,206
- MONSTAZ, fighting.
- HARUTO, fighting.

1084
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:01,131
Start.

1085
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:04,583
(But wait, what's this?)
MONSTAZ, fighting.

1086
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:07,382
(Easily)

1087
00:49:10,546 --> 00:49:13,382
(Ace collapsed helplessly)

1088
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:13,446
Wow...
That's it.

1089
00:49:14,438 --> 00:49:16,576
HARUTO's victory!

1090
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,302
It's shocking.

1091
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:20,390
He's so good.

1092
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:25,286
(Only the last player of each team remains)
Will HARUTO finish it right here? Get ready.

1093
00:49:26,886 --> 00:49:30,310
(MY MONSTAZ's final player, LEE YEONTAE)

1094
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,219
(Last match)
Let's go, let's go.

1095
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:33,446
Start.

1096
00:49:36,038 --> 00:49:36,964
HARUTO!

1097
00:49:36,964 --> 00:49:38,022
Fighting!

1098
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:40,957
LEE YEONTAE!

1099
00:49:40,957 --> 00:49:42,694
(Their muscles are going crazy!)
Lee Yeontae!

1100
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:46,310
HARUTO!

1101
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:51,814
So fast!

1102
00:49:52,352 --> 00:49:57,155
Okay! The winner of this game
is MONSTA B team.

1103
00:49:57,664 --> 00:49:59,034
(MONSTA B wins the priority for stage order)
Team MONSTA B.

1104
00:49:59,034 --> 00:50:01,300
(MONSTA B wins the priority
for stage order)

1105
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,406
Ah, he's strong, really strong!

1106
00:50:02,406 --> 00:50:04,646
Please put a magnet on the order

1107
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:05,766
(First? Second? MONSTA B's choice is...)
that you choose

1108
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:07,907
- for the stage sequence, JAEIL.
- Alright.

1109
00:50:08,345 --> 00:50:10,367
We won't go with the obvious
choice for our team.

1110
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:11,967
(It's obviously not going second, right?)
If it's obvious, it's no fun.

1111
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:13,867
If it's obvious...

1112
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,790
then it's not being an idol

1113
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:17,766
If it's obvious, then
it's not being an idol.

1114
00:50:18,734 --> 00:50:20,500
But we are B:GINNERs, after all.

1115
00:50:22,697 --> 00:50:24,467
Going first? No way, going first?

1116
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,606
You have choose, JAEIL.

1117
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:26,822
JAEIL.

1118
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:31,467
Ah, going with second.

1119
00:50:31,686 --> 00:50:33,267
(2nd round, going first: MY MONSTAZ)
- Actually, that's good. - Good.

1120
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:34,834
You have to go first...
I can't remember.

1121
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,216
(MY MONSTAZ: going first / MONSTA B: going second)
All the battle songs have been chosen

1122
00:50:37,216 --> 00:50:38,982
(MY MONSTAZ: going first / MONSTA B: going second)
and the stage order decided.

1123
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:44,966
(B:MY BOYZ first night of training camp,
that night, MY MONSTAZ's House)

1124
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:46,630
IKUTO: I'm tired, I'm tired.

1125
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,280
(MY MONSTAZ's House)
Hey guys, whoever's going to wash up, hurry up.

1126
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,110
We don't have much time.
There are too many people.

1127
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:52,134
Can I wash up?

1128
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,568
(B:MY BOYZ... nothing is easy)
Survival isn't easy.

1129
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,235
KIM JEONGHOON: What are
you making for breakfast?

1130
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:01,301
KIM JEONGHOON: Are you going
to make something for breakfast?

1131
00:51:01,301 --> 00:51:02,501
WILLIAM: No, I can't cook!

1132
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:03,735
KIM JEONGHOON: Ah, I can't either.

1133
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:04,704
LIM JIHWAN: I'm quite good at cooking.

1134
00:51:04,704 --> 00:51:06,560
- Cook for me!
- Okay.

1135
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,068
(The savior of MY MONSTAZ appears)
LIM JIHWAN: Please make French toast for tomorrow.

1136
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:10,879
KIM JEONGHOON: French toast,
there's also sliced ham.

1137
00:51:12,128 --> 00:51:18,101
SEO JUNHYEOK: Will you
make breakfast tomorrow?

1138
00:51:18,335 --> 00:51:21,481
SEO JUNHYEOK: Make tomato
and eggs, Chinese style, please!

1139
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:22,656
Tomato and Egg?

1140
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:23,509
SEO JUNHYEOK: Yes.

1141
00:51:23,903 --> 00:51:24,703
Okay.

(Meanwhile, MONSTA B's House)

00:58:41,635 --> 00:58:43,468
LI ZHIWEI: and walked for
a really long time like that.

1309
00:58:43,538 --> 00:58:45,312
(Embarrassed)

1310
00:58:45,312 --> 00:58:48,416
(LI ZHIWEI and SUTHASCHAI
returning from just a walk)

1311
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:50,918
(But the table is already empty
as everything has been eaten)

1312
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:51,859
SUTHASCHAI.

1313
00:58:55,495 --> 00:58:57,203
Oh? Thank you.

1314
00:59:00,423 --> 00:59:01,203
I want to eat.

1315
00:59:01,203 --> 00:59:03,315
(Rice left for SUTHASCHAI and LI ZHIWEI)

1316
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,286
Good.

1317
00:59:06,374 --> 00:59:08,582
(Breakfast finished
with the last person)

1318
00:59:10,572 --> 00:59:12,496
(The real start of 13 vs 13 team dance match)
- Let's go! - Yes!

1319
00:59:12,496 --> 00:59:13,530
(This round's big homework)
One, two...

1320
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:14,816
(Choreography Creation)
Three, four...

1321
00:59:14,816 --> 00:59:16,522
(The biggest duty: JAEIL vs JEONGHOON)
- Again. Five, six, seven, eight. - Now,

1322
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:19,690
(Supreme leader JAEIL)
my body is used to it.

1323
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:21,690
- Again. One more time.
- Okay.

1324
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:23,552
Again. What's wrong?

1325
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:24,122
Focus!

1326
00:59:24,122 --> 00:59:25,984
(Full charging in the most important 24H)

1327
00:59:25,984 --> 00:59:28,672
(Every member is tired)
The bounce seems difficult for everyone.

1328
00:59:28,672 --> 00:59:31,834
(MONSTA B mismatching crisis)
I am so disappointed at myself.

1329
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,370
Da-ra-ra-da.

1330
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,370
If I do something weird,
I get more tense

1331
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,370
Focus, please! Focus!

1332
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,370
I am the leader,

1333
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:41,370
but this is not good.

1334
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,266
(What's the destiny of this dance match?)

1335
00:59:42,266 --> 00:59:43,374
Ah... We are in trouble.

1336
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:46,874
Still, I have a team.

1337
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:51,706
If we do this well,
we can twist the fate.

1338
00:59:51,706 --> 00:59:52,794
We are overwhelming...

1339
00:59:52,794 --> 00:59:54,041
We will definitely win.

1340
00:59:55,744 --> 00:59:56,762
LEE JUNMYEONG: He is very good.

1341
00:59:56,762 --> 00:59:57,786
(The unpredictable match)

1342
00:59:58,272 --> 00:59:59,130
(MONSTA B)
(MY MONSTAZ)

1343
01:00:00,634 --> 01:00:02,586
(In the end...)
This stage will be done perfectly.

1344
01:00:02,586 --> 01:00:04,928
(All survive)
All 13 members will move forward.

1345
01:00:07,616 --> 01:00:10,714
(After the show's trasmission
3 rounds ov online voting will start)

1346
01:00:10,714 --> 01:00:23,104
(First round voting results)
