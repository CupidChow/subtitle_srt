Hello, I'm Dance Master Lee Yoo Jung.
Nice to meet you.

180
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,210
We finally get to see everyone.

181
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,420
We missed you so much!

182
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,660
- Same.
- So good to see you.

183
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,020
- We only saw you on the monitors.
- I know.

184
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,700
You really look like a celebrity right now.

185
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,580
A celebrity?

186
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,130
We've only seen you onscreen,

187
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,750
saying, "He's so cool. She's so pretty."

188
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,430
- Same.
- We've been watching you, too.

189
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,020
Today is the finals, finally.

190
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,120
Is there anything you want to tell the B:GINNERS?

191
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,170
B:MASTER Lia Kim, could you say a few words?

192
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,600
Yes. B:GINNERS, how are you feeling today?

193
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,330
Good!

194
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,500
You've been preparing for so long.

195
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,920
In a way, I wouldn't be exaggerating
if you said this whole process was for today.

196
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,100
All the skills you've been working on so hard,

197
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,020
let it all out onstage today with no regrets.

198
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,070
I hope you do well.

199
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,560
You're already so prepared and so good.

200
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,510
Trust yourselves. I know you'll be great onstage.

201
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,640

202
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,950
B:MASTER Lia Kim.

203
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,210
That was great advice coming
from someone so experienced.

204
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,380
I heard for this final round,

205
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,740
B:MASTER Hui prepared a very special round.

206
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,580
What is the special thing?

207
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,490
For the finals, I gifted the
B:GINNERS two new songs.

208
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,400
You gifted them yourselves?

209
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,940
Yes. I wrote them myself.

210
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,830
"Knockin' on Heaven," and "Sideways."

211
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,840
I presented them with two songs.

212
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,210
They're two songs with very different colors.

213
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,710
I think it will be fun to watch.

214
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,700
Also, the B:GINNERS grew
so much during this process.

215
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,110
I hope the B:inUS watch them
with excitement. Thank you.

216
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,390
Actually, we listened to a bit of the songs,

217
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,700
and they were so good and addictive.

218
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,380
I think they're perfect for the B:GINNERS.

219
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,610
I'm excited to know we'll be
hearing B:MASTER Hui's songs.

220
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,040
I see more familiar faces here.

221

222

223
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,640
Good to see you!

224
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,420
They made the time to come here today

225
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,300
to cheer for the other B:GINNERS.

226
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,260
That must be so encouraging, right?

227
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,130
Now, let's see the performances

228
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,890
from the 13 B:GINNERS who made it to the finals.

229
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,610
They are in two teams of six and seven

230
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,010
and will perform B:MASTER Hui's new songs,

231
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,190
"Knockin' on Heaven" and "Sideways."

232
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,570
Make some noise!

233
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:50,850
Sounds good. We live and breathe
by the B:inUS' applause.

234
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,110
As this final round is live,

235
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,670
I think this performance will have
a big impact on the vote.

236
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,450
Did the B:GINNERS do a good job preparing?

237

at the first surprise mission]

There was no announcement.

We just started.

253
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,950
That was the first performance,
so that was the most memorable.

[The surprise mission was
full of surprise and anxiety]

255
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,770
I was so surprised.

256
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,840
It felt so good to perform for the first time.

257
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,190
I understood why this is my dream.

258
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,180
The moment I stepped onstage...

259
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:13,530
the fans had written "Ai"
on sketchbooks for me to see.

260
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,770
I wanted to give them fan service.

261

I always give them a heart at least.

262
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,430
I have a memory from the Signal Song video shoot

263
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,620
that I don't think I'll forget until I die.

It's so hot.

267
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,730
I thought I was going to die.

268
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,820
But it was nice to go somewhere to shoot together,

269
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,690
and I don't think I've ever had more fun.

270
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,870
Round 3.

271
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,810
That was a round where I broke through, I think.

272
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,960
Back then, it was embarrassing
to make facial expressions.

273
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,300
But my expressive skills improved
exponentially after that.

down his wall of expression]

to write this song.

315

356
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,200
That was Team Knockin' on Heaven's performance.

357
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,190
B:inUS, what did you think?

358
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,080
Wasn't that fantastic?

359
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,140
B:MASTERS, this must be the first time
you're seeing them perform onstage.

360
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,700
I'm curious what you thought.

361
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,130
First, B:MASTER Hui, who wrote this song.

362
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,690
What did you think of Team Knockin' on Heaven?

363
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,820
This is a challenging song.

364
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,840
During practice, we knew it wouldn't be easy.

365
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:30,030
But what you showed us onstage was 100% perfect.

366
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,480
The highest praise.

367
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,140
First of all, thank you for singing my song so well.

368
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:42,990
These B:GINNERS have always grown
so much in such short periods of time.

369
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,080
Even after you debut, you will grow
to be amazing artists.

370
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,950
I'm excited to be a colleague alongside you.

371
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,490
Thank you.

372
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,350
Thank you!

373
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,320
B:MASTER Lia Kim, what did you think?

374
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,060
B:GINNERS, when did you grow so much?

375
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,970
I was so surprised.

376
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,450
The performance today was so great,
and it felt almost like...

377
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,960
a professional group that already debuted.

378
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,750
The song wasn't the only thing that was hard.

379
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,910
The dance was also so tough and challenging.

380
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,230
The fact that you can sing and
deliver such high-quality

381
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,030
is tremendous, I think.

382
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,240
I could see the character
of every single B:GINNER.

383
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,250
It was a fantastic performance. Great work.

384
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,900
Thank you!

385
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,520
B:MASTER Lia Kim, isn't the choreo a bit too hard?

386
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,140
I kept hearing them breathe.

387
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,120
Next, B:MASTER Lee Yoo Jung. What did you think?

388
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,540
I really feel like I'm a mother watching.

389
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,370
I've been watching them perform from up close,

390
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,290
but I loved today's performance, because...

391
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,750
I felt like these guys were really
dancing in their own style.

392
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,790
That was so moving.

393
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,390
This is a very high-concept song. That sexiness...

394
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,700
I loved how you made it your own.

395
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,800
- Guys, good job!
- Thank you!

396
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,400
How about you, B:MASTER Jinho?

397
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,390
I mean...

398
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,430
they're basically my kids now.

399
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,410
I feel really weird, honestly.

400
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,590
These past few months...

401
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,510
We may not have been

402
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,970
but I remember being tough on them.

403
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,310
I regretted not doing more for them, too.

404
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,140
But watching their performance
today, I see professionals.

405
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,400
I hate this system.

406
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,370
I hate the fact that I have to vote.

407
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,530
It was perfect. It was great. Good job, guys.

408
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,250
Thank you!

409
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,650
Like you said, I see hearts
pouring out of your eyes.

410
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,780
Lastly, B:MASTER Yuju.

411
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,000
What did you think?

412
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,180
I remember during practice,

413
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,950
I'd scold them by saying,
"Don't do it like you're auditioning."

414
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,820
But now, this is a performance
you would see on a live music show.

415
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,840
Also, seeing this performance,
I can tell that each of you

416
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,050
saw each other's strengths
and learned from one another.

417
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,930
That part was really nice to see.
Good work, guys.

418
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,020
Thank you!

419
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,280
B:MASTERS, thank you for your warm comments.

420
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,160
B:GINNERS, that was your last performance match.

421
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,120
How do you feel now that you're done?

422
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,550
Let's hear it from B:GINNER Kim Bo Hyeon first.

423
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,980
Hello, I'm B:GINNER Kim Bo Hyeon.

424
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:58,700
First, I am honored to have
spent the last four months

425
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:04,900
making memories with
these amazing B:GINNERS.

426
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:10,850
By being on a survival program,
I learned the value of competition.

427
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,850
I was able to grow through that competition.

428
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,320
It motivated me.

429
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,650
I will not lose the mindset and fortitude
I earned from this program

430
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,820
and become Kim Bo Hyeon,
who works harder. Thank you.

431
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,570
- I'm sure it's hard not to cry.
- I know.

432
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,770
The other B:GINNERS are already crying.

433
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,730
Next, B:GINNER Hyo.

434
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,100
Yup!

435
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,490
Hello, I'm Hyo.

436
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,480
For me, this is my second attempt.

437
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,220
I wanted to leave no regrets
and dash until the end.

438
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,400
Still, there's a lot I can improve on.

439
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:03,470
I learned so much about mindset
from these B:MASTERS

440
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:08,610
as well as through talking with these B:GINNERS.

441
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,460
I'm glad I was able to show you growth.

442
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,090
Also, the fact that the last performance we shared

443
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:22,770
is a song that B:MASTER Hui wrote for us

444
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,500
is so cool, and makes me happy.

445
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Thank you.

446
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,690
Call me later, okay?

447
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,230
Okay! Thank you!

448
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,190
Next, B:GINNER Park Se Chan.

449
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,940
Yes.

450
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,690
Realizing that B:MY BOYZ,
a program I love and cherish,

451
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,220
is coming to an end...

452
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,500
I'm sad and disappointed.

453
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,000
There were sad and hard
moments during B:MY BOYZ,

454
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,710
but they became memories and
a foundation for this performance.

455
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,900
The next time I see you, B:inUS,

456
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,740
I want it to be as a debut artist. Thank you!

457
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,840
Next, B:GINNER Ai.

458
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,480
Hello, it's Ai.

459
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,510
First, thank you for watching our performance.

460
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:19,090
I came here from Japan with
dreams of being a K-pop idol.

461
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:26,230
Thank you for rooting for me and supporting me.

462
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,520
The performance I gave today

463
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,690
was my favorite among the ones
I've done, so I'm happy.

464
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,090
I will keep working harder. Thank you so much.

465
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,130
Next, B:GINNER Yang Hyeon Bin.

466
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,240
I spent my summer as a 20-year-old
with B:MY BOYZ, and now, it's over.

467
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,460
There was so much fun stuff,

468
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,870
moving and sad stuff.

469
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,820
For me...

470
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,900
this was an unforgettable memory.

471
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,560
The prime of my life. Thank you!

472
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,970
Lastly, B:GINNER Seo Jun Hyeok.

473
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,490
Hello, I'm Seo Jun Hyeok.

474
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,370
I came on B:MY BOYZ after failing once,

475
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,380
thinking this is my last opportunity.

476
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,790
Through B:MY BOYZ, I think
I met different sides of myself

477
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,390
that I didn't even know about, so I am thankful.

478
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,200
I also want to say thank you
to my B:MY BOYZ friends

479
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,710
and the B:MASTERS who always guided us.

480
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:43,040
Lastly, thank you to everyone
who has watched and supported me.

481
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,570
Keep watching me be a shining star. Thank you.

482
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:56,670
I can feel your true hearts in every
single word from each B:GINNER.

483
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,570
Team Knockin' on Heaven, great work.

484
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,790
Thank you!

If you're the next team, what do you do?

486
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,860
Looking at this team...

487
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,370
Team Sideways must be nervous

488
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,660
and be burning up with competitive spirit.

489
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,530
I'm curious to see what kind
of performance they've prepared.

490
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,290
That's right. Next, another new song
from B:MASTER Hui.

491
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,980
How did Team Sideways prepare?

One, two, three!

501

The moment I remember the most...

502
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,210
was the first shoot, the "Get a Guitar"
surprise mission.

503
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:09,070
We had to step onstage all of a sudden and start.

504
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,030
I was so surprised.

505
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:18,660
I thought I had to show them everything I have now.

506
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,430
I was able to be confident.

That is still my most memorable moment.

511
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,920
Round 2 itself was so sudden.

512
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,650
We started with the theme of having 13 people.

513
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,610
I was the leader of those 13.

514
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,630
While being a leader, I represented others.

515
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,890
I matured in that respect.

516

I almost cried. They were so good.

527
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,890
I was sad that friends I trained
with were eliminated.

528
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:38,160
I became determined to work harder.

529
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,280
The most memorable moment
for me was the Signal Song mission.

530
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,430
Forty-eight hours begin now.

531
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,250
[48 hours Signal Song surprise mission]

532
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,800
I remember teaching Ikuto the
choreography as I was trying to learn it.

533
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:01,680
That was the first time I taught anyone anything.

534
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,200
Jae Il was always teaching it to me very easily.

535
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,560
But doing it myself was hard.

536
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,880
That's when I felt it.

537
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,260
One of the most memorable moments
from B:MY BOYZ was...

538
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,820
when I became Round 4's Top Pick.

539
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,050
B:GINNER Moon Jae Il.

540
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,460
[B:GINNER Moon Jae Il was Top Pick in Round 4]

541
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,040
Jae Il, you have such great lines.

542
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,720
[He captured U-Know Yunho's heart
with Korean traditional dance]

543
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,790
It was a moment where I lost faith in myself.

544
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,760
But getting Top Pick restored my self-esteem and

545
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,970
pushed away negative thoughts.

546
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:41,900
It was a moment where I could be more confident.

547
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:48,040
As I came up to Round 4, I felt that in Round 1,

548
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,050
I didn't know what camera to look
at or how they would film me.

549
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,360
I couldn't figure anything out.

550
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,870
I didn't know how to use my face.

551
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,980
But after each round,

552
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,530
I felt more relaxed than before.

553
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,930
I felt more like the idol I dreamt of being.

554
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,200
I feel like I've grown a lot.

555
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,910
Sometimes, before I go to sleep,

556
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:19,170
I dream of performing in front of numerous fans.

557
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,870
If I don't become an idol, I think I'll regret it.

558
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,830
So if I debut this time,

559
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,690
I want to give a performance of
our own with a song of our own.

560
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,650
That's the kind of idol I want
to be. I want to debut.

[Our first song, "Sideways"]

562
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,910
This song, "Sideways,"

563
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,930
is about following the rules
of a performance, a song,

564
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,120
but at the same time, letting
each person's character come alive.

565
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,110
I wanted to make a song where
they can party onstage.

566
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:08,880
It's a song with a rebellious, naughty message.

567
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,250
I want the B:GINNERS to party freely onstage.

It's the end, so I want to finish it off well.

I'm curious what the B:MASTERS thought
of the "Sideways" performance.

601
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:13,250
Let's hear B:MASTER Hui's
thoughts first. Did they do well?

602
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,740
Gosh, they shredded.

That's how well they performed.

607

When we first started working on this song,

608
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,350
and throughout the progress checks,

609
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:36,960
I was concerned about their stamina.

610
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,590
But they practiced so hard,

611
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,660
that they almost seem relaxed now.

612
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:50,400

that they can have a relaxed attitude now.

I'd especially like to praise the dancers,

00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:29,570
You're sitting sideways.

646
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,170
You're so into it.

647
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,230
That's how much I got into it.

648

I opened the voting window,

653

but I couldn't vote. It was so heartbreaking.

654
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,940
Everyone was perfect.

655
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,000
And they're my babies, so I couldn't vote.

656
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,890
But I hope everyone votes. Got it?

657

What did you think of the "Sideways" performance?

664
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:28,170
I feel like today's performance
was art, not a contest.

665
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,890
I didn't feel the need to
evaluate the performance.

666
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,790
I simply had fun.

667
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,080
And this is just my personal opinion, but

668
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,870
I think the best performances
are the ones you want to replay.

669
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:48,740
I bet a lot of people will replay
this "Sideways" performance.

670
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:54,900
You remember when we first met, right?

671
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,600
You are totally different people
now, in a good way.

672
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,550
That's all for now. Such great work.

673
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,590
Thank you!

674
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,710
You must've worked really hard to improve so much

675
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,390
in such a short time, enough
for the B:MASTERS to notice.

676
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:16,020
And lastly, let's hear from Team Sideways

677
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,130
on how they feel now that the
final performance has ended,

678
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,980
starting with B:GINNER Kang Jun Seong.

679
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,530
First, B:GINNER Kang Jun Seong. How was it?

680
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,800
Well, first of all, as B:GINNER Kang Jun Seong,

681
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,940
I'd like to thank the B:MASTERS.

682
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,880
From the first to fourth round thus far,

683
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,970
and throughout the surprise missions,

684
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:44,910
you have given us great feedback
and cheered us on.

685
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:50,080
As a result, we were able
to deliver great performances.

686
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,290
We were all able to learn
valuable lessons together,

687
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:59,210
which is how we were able to perform so well.

688
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:03,490
I'm so proud that I was able
to deliver a performance

689
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:07,440
that people would remember
until the day they die, like I vowed.

690
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,140
Thank you.

691
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,970
It was truly a performance without any regrets.

692
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:16,960
Next, B:GINNER Moon Jae Il.

693
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,890
First of all, thank you to the team
members I shared the stage with,

694
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:26,120
and the B:MASTERS, who helped
us be our best selves.

695
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:32,760
I started with Round 1,
and now I'm here in the final round.

696
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:38,070
I'm proud of myself for growing bit by bit.

697
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:44,970
We ground ourselves to the bone,
preparing for this final performance.

698
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:48,380
And we also had fun preparing.

share good energy with B:inUS. Thank you.

701
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:04,280
Yes, you're at the level now
where you can enjoy performing.

Well,

704
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,660
it feels like I started
on B:MY BOYZ just yesterday.

705
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:18,120
I can't believe we're nearing the end.

706
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,630
I feel like we are wrapping things up
nicely with a good performance.

707
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,030
I'm relieved.

708
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:28,460
Thank you to B:inUS,

709
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:33,220
because although you didn't see it on the show,

710
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:38,740
we worked day and night to

711
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:42,880
get this amazing result at the final.

712
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,110
Also,

713
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:49,900
thanks to B:GINNERS, B:MASTERS,

714
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:54,800
and my fellow teammates,
for going on this journey together.

715
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,520
I will continue working and growing,

716
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,970
and become an awesome Yeon Tae. Thank you.

717
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:05,920
Yes, everyone knows how hard the B:GINNERS worked.

718
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,120
Next, B:GINNER Haruto.

719
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,510
Yes.

720
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,260
Slowly. It's okay to go slow.

721
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:25,000
I was so happy to perform

722
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:35,000
a song "Sideways" that was
written just for us here.

723
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,280
Let's give him a round of applause!

724
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,810

725
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:57,180
Imagining this is my final
performance makes me sad.

726
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:06,280
I think we delivered a performance
with no regrets, so I'm satisfied.

727
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,620
I hope there will be

728
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:21,600
more opportunities to perform
onstage like this in the future.

729
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,220
So...

730
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:31,420
B:inUS, don't forget Haruto. Remember me.

731
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,500
Thank you!

732
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:39,250
Haruto has been imprinted not only
in the minds of B:inUS but also in many more.

733
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,730
Don't worry.

734
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,510
Next, B:GINNER Kai.

735
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,970
Yes. Hello, I'm B:GINNER Kai.

736
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:59,210
I can't believe that this is my last
performance with this team.

737
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:05,440
When I came to Korea, my dream
was to create and showcase

738
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,080
amazing performances like this.

739
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:14,880
Thank you so much to the team
members for your collaboration,

740
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,100
and the B:MASTERS, for their help.

741
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:26,770
And thank you for being there for us, B:inUS.

742
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:31,770
I hope to show you more amazing
performances in the future.

743
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:33,550

Next, B:GINNER Ban Daniel.

746
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,200
I think I grew a lot since I arrived in B:MY BOYZ,

747
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,000
through all the performances.

748
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,260
Thank you to the B:MASTERS for
helping me grow and to the other B:GINNERS.

749
00:57:53,260 --> 00:58:00,540
We worked so hard preparing
for this performance,

750
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:06,210
and I'm glad that our hard work paid off.

751
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:12,250
I hope to become an amazing idol
and show you great performances.

752
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,680
Thank you!

753
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:19,620
B:GINNER Ban Daniel, you were amazing onstage.

754
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,540
Lastly, B:GINNER Lee Yun Sung.

755
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:34,560
First of all, I am so grateful that we had
fun performing without making mistakes.

756
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,800
Jae Il went through a lot during the process.

757
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,150
Thank you for all your help.

758
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,400
And thank you to the B:MASTERS for your teachings.

759

Thanks to the fellow B:GINNERS that
I worked with to prepare.

760

Going from Round 1 to the final round,

761
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:58,760
I had a lot of fun, and I also went
through a lot of tough times.

762
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,920
Looking back, there was more fun.

763
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,370
I made fun memories I'll remember
for the rest of my life.

764
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,670
Thank you to B:inUS for cheering us on always.

765
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,680
Thank you for liking me!

766
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:20,420
I hope B:MY BOYZ stays a memory
for the rest of your lives, B:GINNERS.

767
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,720
I almost cried listening to your reflections.

768
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,530
Team Sideways, great work.

769
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,500

Our B:GINNERS did so well, right?

777
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:05,150
Did you like "Knockin' on Heaven"
or "Sideways" better?

778
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,720
Both!

779
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,670
We heard big cheers for both teams.

780
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:16,010
Yes, it's tough to tell who did better.

781
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,390
That's right.

782
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,970

783

786
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:33,420
and only the Top 8 will debut.

787

The live voting of B:MY BOYZ final
round will soon close

788

Such a brutal question, right?

794
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:04,480
Should we just debut all of them?

795
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,480
Right?

796
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:12,960
Gosh, we're so sad that we can't debut all of them.

797
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,490

so many fans already.

01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:49,890
Congratulations again. B:GINNER Kai,
please step up to the debut zone.

1220
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:52,090
Congratulations.

1221
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:07,990
Next, announcing the 4th place B:GINNER.

1222
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:12,150
I'm so nervous.

1223
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:14,200
Right?

1224
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,500
Should I announce it now?

1225
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:32,810
Before we announce,

1226
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:36,470
let's see how the B:MASTERS feel

1227
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:39,440
as they watch the debut members get announced.

1228
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,250
B:MASTER Lia.

1229
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:43,760
How do you feel?

1230
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,530
I can't watch.

1231
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:47,140
Same.

1232
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,400
Every time a name is called,

1233
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,480
I feel like my heart drops.

1234
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,110
Gosh, how can I watch this till the end?

1235
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:57,800
I understand.

1236
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:04,860
I really believe that every single B:GINNER here

1237
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:08,660
really deserves to debut.

1238
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:13,810
I'm sure you want to

1239
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:17,390
see the result you want to see,

1240
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:21,100
but regardless of the result,
they're already so cool.

1241
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:27,950
So, I hope you don't worry too much about it.

1242
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:30,890
You're already the best, everyone.

1243
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:35,480
I'm sure it's thanks to the
teachings of the B:MASTERS.

1244
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,040
B:MASTER Hui. How do you feel?

1245
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:44,110
They competed with the songs
you created for them during the finals.

1246
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:48,680
And now, you're watching the names
get called after the performances.

1247
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,380
How do you feel?

1248
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:54,300
Having gone on the journey together
from the beginning till now,

1249
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,980
there is so much love.

1250
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:59,590
Love among all of us.

1251
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:02,280
I'm so nervous, too.

1252
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,440
Every time B:GINNERS would step onto the stage,

1253
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,990
from backstage, we'd cheer on, saying,
"Don't be nervous, it's okay."

1254
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:13,320
Sorry, guys. It's very nerve-racking.

1255
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:18,360
B:GINNERS worked so hard thus far.

1256
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:22,470
And they grew so much during this time.

1257
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:25,980
After this time,

1258
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:30,410
whether they debut here or not,

1259
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm sure they'll be able to
show B:inUS amazing things.

1260
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,390
I hope they continue to work hard.

1261
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,530
What I really want to say is

1262
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:48,230
we, the five B:MASTERS, including myself,

1263
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:57,230
want to continue with the journeys
of B:GINNERS. All of us.

1264
01:32:57,230 --> 01:33:03,320
We hope we can stay close
and stay relaxed. You worked so hard.

1265
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,160
Fighting!

1266
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,240
B:MY BOYZ is not the end.

1267
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:13,610
The industry veteran has shared warm words

1268
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:17,950
acknowledging them as industry
colleagues from now on.

1269
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:19,380
Yes.

1270
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:24,310
B:MASTER Yuju, could we hear your thoughts?

1271
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:30,830
We spent a lot of time with the B:GINNERS.

1272
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:33,560
The thing that upset me the most was

1273
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:37,030
that the B:GINNERS are often
so consumed with worry.

1274
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:40,770
They're so young, yet they worry about their age,

1275
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:42,850
and they worry about tomorrow's matters.

1276
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:45,290
They're so consumed with worry.

1277
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:48,200
I'm thinking more about the B:GINNERS

1278
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:52,170
who don't make it into the debut team,

1279
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:54,810
in case they blame themselves.

1280
01:33:54,810 --> 01:34:01,460
B:inUS who are gathered here today,
I hope you clap both for B:GINNERS

1281
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:04,810
who make the debut team and those who don't.

1282
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,650
That's all I'm hoping for today.

1283
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:09,540
Everyone, great job.

1284
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:14,890
It would be great to debut today,

1285
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:16,830
but even if you don't,

1286
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:22,310
you have the chops to debut one day.

1287
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:23,640
That's right.

1288
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:29,440
Next, announcing the 4th place B:GINNER.

1289
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:36,260
The B:GINNER that has solidified
their debut in 4th place...

1290
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,790
is B:GINNER Kim Bo Hyeon. Congratulations!

1291
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,940
B:GINNER Kim Bo Hyeon has joined the debut team

1292
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:24,370
with a final ranking of 4th place. Congratulations.

1293
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:28,210
Please share how you feel.

1294
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:36,820
[4th: Kim Bo Hyeon - 92,400 points]

1295
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:41,130
It's okay! You can cry now.

1296
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:44,030
You've been holding it back all this time.

1297
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:53,250
I was just a regular student and a youth.

1298
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:56,810
Thanks to the B:inUS' cheers and support...

1299
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:59,880
It's okay. Please give him a round of applause.

1300
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:06,530
B:inUS are tearing up, too.

1301
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:12,930
B:GINNER Kim Bo Hyeon must
be inundated by the memories thus far.

1302
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:15,770
I got to dream such a sweet dream.

1303
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,820
Thank you for all the boxes and support you sent.

1304
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:24,600
And thank you for coming all this way today.

1305
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:28,780
I don't think that I got here alone at all.

1306
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:31,870
The entire crew who worked
so hard on the show, and

1307
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:36,550
hair, make-up, and wardrobe
specialists, and the B:MASTERS...

1308
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:39,060
Thank you so much.

1309
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:45,720
And thanks to the 30 or so
young peers, I learned so much.

1310
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,300
I grew so much.

1311
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:52,380
I want to thank you for the last four months.

1312
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:58,260
Lastly, coming up to Seoul and joining this show,

1313
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:02,130
I didn't share anything with my mom and dad.

1314
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:08,340
Look at you, finally breaking down.

1315
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:12,250
I told my parents when I got to the finals.

1316
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:17,350
My mom, with her aching leg,
is here with my older sister.

1317
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:22,680
Thank you, Mom, for giving me
life and showing up today.

1318
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,690
Thanks for raising me so well.

1319
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:27,370
Thank you so much!

1320
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:30,310
Like B:GINNER Kim Bo Hyeon said,

1321
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:33,560
it's no longer a dream. The dream has come true.

1322
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,240
Congratulations again, B:GINNER Kim Bo Hyeon.

1323
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:45,770
It was such a brief time,
but they must've grown so close.

1324
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:50,990
I'm getting chills, and I'm so moved.

1325
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:56,500
Only four spots remaining

1326
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:01,400
in the debut zone.

1327
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:06,950
Which B:GINNER will debut in 3rd place?

1328
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:10,080
I'm so nervous.

1329
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:15,060
Announcing the 3rd place B:GINNER.

1330
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:23,680
The B:GINNER who has solidified
their debut in 3rd place...

1331
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:34,560
Who do you think it is, B:inUS?

1332
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,730
Shout it out loudly!

1333
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:38,300
Who could it be?

1334
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:42,690
I heard it.

1335
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:46,420
I heard his name.

1336
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:58,770
I'll announce it.

1337
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:02,090
The B:GINNER who has solidified
their debut in 3rd place is...

1338
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:06,320
B:GINNER Moon Jae Il!

1339
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,150
Congratulations.

1340
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,210
I said I heard it.

1341
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:22,150
B:GINNER Moon Jae Il has become a debut
member with a final ranking of 3rd place.

1342
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:23,940
Congratulations again.

1343
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,840
Congratulations.

1344
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,160
Please share how you feel.

1345
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,740
Gosh, first of all, thank you.

1346
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:47,650
To B:inUS for your support, and the
B:MASTERS for helping me get here.

1347
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:52,010
And to all my B:GINNER friends, thank you.

1348
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:55,310
I'll continue to showcase amazing things,

1349
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:58,120
so please keep watching.

1350
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:04,810
You don't have anything else to say?

1351
01:40:04,810 --> 01:40:07,190
You don't think you'll regret it?

1352
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,400
You're okay?

1353
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:15,630
Are there family members who came
to cheer for B:GINNER Moon Jae Il?

1354
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:16,700
Is there anyone?

1355
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:17,810
They must've been busy today...

1356
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:20,560
There they are.

1357
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,690
It must be his mother.

1358
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:28,060
B:GINNER Moon Jae Il, better say
something to your mother.

1359
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:31,320
Apparently, it's his sister. Sorry.

1360
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,290
I couldn't see well. It's so dark.

1361
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:36,060
And you're wearing a hat. So sorry.

1362
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,510
I couldn't see her face.

1363
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,050
In the direction of 11 o'clock.

1364
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:44,960
She's waving her wand.

1365
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,680
In the direction of 11 o'clock.

1366
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:52,870
You see her there? In a red hat?

1367
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:54,250
Just say something in that direction.

1368
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,920
She's saying she's just a fan.

1369
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,830
Thank you.

1370
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:02,640
Anyway, please say something
to your family who must be watching.

1371
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,360
Oh, yes...

1372
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:13,780
Please say something to your family or to B:inUS.

1373
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:18,200
My little sister came a long way here.

1374
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:23,540
Thank you for coming all this way to cheer me on.

1375
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:25,950
Fighting.

1376
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,000
B:GINNER Moon Jae Il, congratulations again.

1377
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,840
Please move to the debut zone.

1378
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,350
He must be very shy.

1379
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:39,800
We're nearing the end.

1380
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,250
That's right.

1381
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:45,680
Global idol, created by B:inUS' choice.

1382
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:50,060
Only three debut spots remain.

1383
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:54,540
Out of the eight B:GINNERS
who have not been called yet,

1384
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:57,800
which B:GINNER will fulfill their dream of debut?

1385
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:05,000
Now, revealing the two B:GINNERS
who are first-place candidates.

1386
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:14,070
The B:GINNER candidates
who may receive the honor of

1387
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,780
first place winner are
B:GINNER Lee Yeon Tae and Hyo.

1388
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,800
B:GINNERS Lee Yeon and Hyo are

1389
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:40,150
first and second places of B:MY BOYZ.

1390
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:44,100
Please stand in your place.

1391
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:48,880
These two B:GINNERS have solidified their debut

1392
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:53,650
after receiving a high number of votes
in early voting and live voting.

1393
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:58,400
Which B:GINNER came
in first place out of these two?

1394
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,970
We'll announce it right away.

1395
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:17,370
The first place B:GINNER with
the most votes from B:inUS is...

1396
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:24,280
B:GINNER Hyo. Congratulations.

1397
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,490
Congratulations.

1398
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:27,270
By just a hair,

1399
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:31,710
B:GINNER Lee Yeon Tae will debut in 2nd place.

1400
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:36,220
Starting with B:GINNER Hyo, debuting in 1st place,

1401
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:39,560
let's hear a few words.

1402
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:44,430
Hello, I'm Hyo.

1403
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:53,380
Firstly, thank you to the B:inUS
who are here today.

1404
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:58,490
Also, I actually was...

1405
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:06,720
on a different survival program two years ago.

1406
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:15,060
The results were so disappointing that time,
and I have disappointing memories.

1407
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:19,540
This time, I wanted to leave no regrets

1408
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:23,680
and dash to my debut until the end.

1409
01:44:26,370 --> 01:44:27,890
Thank you.

1410
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:32,250
Now, I'm here...

1411
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:37,830
I have friends who will cry for me.

1412
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:41,220
I have so many good friends now.

1413
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:52,150
This was such a happy and
meaningful challenge for me.

1414
01:44:54,690 --> 01:45:04,750
And thank you to the teachers
and family at the dance studio

1415
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:13,130
that I attended for two years while working a job.

1416
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:18,170
And thank you to my friends.

1417
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:28,820
Thank you to the B:GINNERS
and the B:MASTERS who are here.

1418
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:33,970
And any final words for your parents?

1419
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:37,940
And over here...

1420
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:42,780
to my mom and dad who are here...

1421
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:45,250
Please raise your hands, mom and dad!

1422
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:47,010
Dad, Mom...

1423
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:49,930
Thank you for coming today.

1424
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:51,890
Thank you!

1425
01:45:57,690 --> 01:46:02,510
I'm really happy to be able to show you
my performance on stage.

1426
01:46:02,510 --> 01:46:07,720
Now that I can continue to show you what I can do,
I will do my best.

1427
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:13,600
Korea may be a little far away, but I'll be happy
if you can come see me once in a while.

1428
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:20,240
And to everyone in Japan, thank you for your support.

1429
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:24,120
I will continue to work hard as a member of YUHZ.

1430
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:28,450
To all of you in Japan, I'm officially employed!

1431
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:32,000
He thanked his parents for believing in him,

1432
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,270
and thanked his Japanese and Korean fans,

1433
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:38,940
saying he'll work hard here in Korea.

1434
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:41,060
Thank you so much!

1435
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,850
B:GINNER Hyo, congratulations
on coming in first place.

1436
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:52,400
2nd place B:GINNER Lee Yeon Tae,
please share how you feel.

1437
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,840
Hello, I'm Lee Yeon Tae.

1438
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:00,990
Honestly, when I first started on the show,

1439
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:05,000
I was unsure if I'd make it to the Top 8.

1440
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,190
In the beginning, I felt like I scored
low and wasn't very popular.

1441
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:16,800
Thank you to B:inUS for letting me
come in 2nd place and for maintaining it.

1442
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:23,700
Thanks to my B:GINNER peers
for helping me by my side.

1443
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:32,340
I can't name them all, but all the staff,

1444
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:36,780
writers, and camera team members, thank you.

1445
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:41,280
Friends, thanks for cheering me on.

1446
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:45,800
My parents are here today.

1447
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:49,000
My mom, cousins, and auntie.

1448
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,070
Please raise your hand, family.

1449
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:52,900
There they are.

1450
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:59,340
Even last night, you told me to just keep going

1451
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:03,830
the way I have been, and the relax.

1452
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:06,820
I just relaxed and kept going.

1453
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:08,570
Thank you.

1454
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:12,520
Thanks to his solid foundation,

1455
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:18,500
B:GINNER Lee Yeon Tae was able
to focus and do well.

1456
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:22,800
Lastly, please say a word to B:inUS.

1457
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:30,800
Thank you for voting for me and
supporting me, B:inUS. Thank you!

1458
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,080
Let's give him a round of applause.

1459
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:37,490
B:GINNERS Hyo and Lee Yeon Tae, congratulations.

1460
01:48:37,490 --> 01:48:41,190
Please move to the debut zone.

1461
01:48:49,700 --> 01:49:00,630
We have thus revealed B:GINNERS from
1st to 7th place as chosen by B:inUS.

1462
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:03,130
How many spots do we have remaining?

1463
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:05,790
Three spots?

1464
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:11,300
One spot remains.

1465
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:17,200
We only have one B:GINNER, who has
solidified their debut in 8th place.

1466
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:23,450
B:GINNERS that haven't been named yet are

Ban Daniel, Ai, and Lee Yun Sung.

1469
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,960
Out of these six B:GINNERS,

1470
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:41,150
who is the B:GINNER whose dream
of debut will come true in 8th place?

1471
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:46,690
The 8th place B:GINNER,
who has solidified their debut

1472
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,320
on B:MY BOYZ is...

1473
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,490
[To be continued]

1474
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:56,340
We will reveal shortly!

1475
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:03,080
Who's your boy? B:MY BOYZ!

1476
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:06,230
The live-broadcast final round.

1477
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:08,540
We only have the remaining

1478
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:13,230
the announcement of the final debut
member chosen by B:inUS.

1479
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:15,670
Yes, that's right. Out of these six B:GINNERS,

1480
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:18,630
the final one who will debut as part of

1481
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:22,500
the global idol YUHZ is...

1482
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:27,030
It's...

1483
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:07,600
B:GINNER Haruto! Congratulations!

1484
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:14,070
B:GINNER Haruto.

1485
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:18,140
Your dream of debut has come
true as the final member.

1486
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:28,020
How do you feel?

1487
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:40,510
[8th: Haruto - 74,900 points]

1488
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:41,800
It's okay. Take it slow.

1489
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,180
Yes...

1490
01:51:48,330 --> 01:51:54,840
I thought I'd be eliminated if I didn't

1491
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,860
get called around 7th or 6th place.

1492
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:03,690
I was just cheering the others on.

1493
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:11,070
Thanks to B:inUS,

1494
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:17,230
I was able to make it to the last spot. Thank you.

1495
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:29,120
I'm still quite imperfect,

1496
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:34,940
but I'll work on my Korean,
my dancing, and my singing.

1497
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:42,420
I'll work hard to...

1498
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:49,000
be a member who deserves to be a part of YUHZ.

1499
01:52:50,010 --> 01:52:53,230
Please cheer me on.

1500
01:52:56,490 --> 01:53:05,450
And my family and company staff are here today.

1501
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:07,910
I'd like to...

1502
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:10,700
Please raise your hands.

1503
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:14,640
Don't cry.

1504
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:17,240
His parents are crying tears of pride.

1505
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,960
Really, I...

1506
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,980
I suddenly... I was still attending college

1507
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:28,620
when I suddenly told you that I wanted to come to Korea.

1508
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:32,970
I know it was selfish of me,

1509
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:37,030
but thank you...

1510
01:53:37,030 --> 01:53:41,370
for believing in me and supporting me till the end.

1511
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:45,310
He thanked them for believing
in him and cheering him on.

1512
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:48,640

Congratulations.

1515
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:02,520
These eight B:GINNERS
who have solidified their debut

1516
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:07,680
may now put on their debut jackets.

1517
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:10,650
It's yours! Wear them!

1518
01:54:18,690 --> 01:54:25,390
The long yet short B:MY BOYZ journey
thus comes to an end.

1519
01:54:25,390 --> 01:54:30,370
Watching them put on the debut jacket

1520
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:32,840
brings back memories.

1521
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:40,610
Please wear it already. I want to see.

1522
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,890
It's okay.

1523
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,660
One, two, three.

1524
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:57,020
Let's give them a round of applause!

1525
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:59,440
Gosh, it looks so good on them.

1526
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:04,470
Your YUHZ has been born!

1527
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:06,700
By your very own hands.

1528
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,990
[Please keep cheering on the
new global idol group YUHZ]

1529

We hope you continue
to cheer on and pay attention to

1534

the B:GINNERS who didn't
become a debut member today

1535
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:41,120
but showcased amazing things thus far.

1536
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:45,320
Let's give a round of applause
to these other B:GINNERS.

1537
