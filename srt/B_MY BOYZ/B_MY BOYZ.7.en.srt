WANNA ONE LEE DAEHWI: 'Energetic' is

157
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:42,805
WANNA ONE LEE DAEHWI: the song that first
introduced us WANNA ONE to the public.

158

it's a really thankful song to us.

159
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:48,338
WANNA ONE LEE DAEHWI: Since
it's a song that HUI gave us as a gift,

160
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:50,805

feels even more meaningful now.

a song that received more love even overseas.

165
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:05,871
WANNA ONE PARK WOOJIN: It is also
one of the few lyrical songs of WANNA ONE.

166
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:08,938

are very precious to us.

they'll be very nervous.

172
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:20,605

of responsibility, I guess?

second verse of 'Energetic' and

00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:58,294
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: When B:GINNER
KIM BOHYEON came out the energy was really good.

620
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,903
Thank you.

621
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:03,194
When B:GINNER BOHYEON
came out, I think...

622
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:04,927
(B:GINNER KIM BOHYEON who captured WANNA ONE's attention)
I think it definitely drew attention.

623
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:08,260
(B:GINNER KIM BOHYEON
who captured WANNA ONE's attention)

624
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,927
(A stage that showed definite energy
and mood shift in the bridge part)

625
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,427
Good.

626
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:16,927
HUI: BOHYEON could become
the TOP PICK here, right?

627
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,727
KIM BOHYEON: I felt
like, 'I can do this,'

628
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:22,394
KIM BOHYEON: and I'm happy that

629
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:23,727
I was able to show the effort I put in.

630
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,929
And the Beauty+Zetic team chose this song

631
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:29,694
because you all wanted to, right?

632
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,627
(Beauty+Zetic team frozen by the sharp question)
- Right? - Yes, that's correct.

633
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:36,127
WANNA ONE LEE DAEHWI: I actually
feel like Energy+Full team did well...

634
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:38,560
I wonder if it was a lack of practice?

635
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,385
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: When I felt it,
the overall group choreography seemed a bit messy.

636
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:45,994
(Beauty+Zetic team's group dance overall was out of sync)
♪Make me feel so high, so other guys can't look at you♪

637
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:48,433
(A lot of bows/less bows)

638
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:49,895
But, the angle is not right.

639
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,794
That gaze angle is not right.

640
00:30:51,794 --> 00:30:53,711
The ending is disappointing.

641
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:55,227
So, it was a bit disappointing...

642
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:55,921
(There was an individual who was praised,
but the overall team was lacking)

643
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,194
It made me think like that.

644
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,761
Wow, but the feedback
is a bit intense today.

645
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:00,560
Because...

646
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,227
LEE YUJEONG: The Beauty+Zetic team chose
the song themselves, but saying 'Did you pick it?'

647
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:07,441
LEE YUJEONG: and that Energy+Full
team did better is really heartbreaking.

648
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:09,162
(Oh, right...)
That's right.

649
00:31:09,841 --> 00:31:10,481
Opinions are...
If opinions are divided like this...

650
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,817
In the Beautiful stage...

651
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,521
That's right.

652
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:16,827
(In Beautiful stage, they can only try harder)
They might just pump each other up and get more energized.

653
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:18,060
(Right)

654
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,760
WILLIAM: Ah, we absolutely have to
win this. We can't lose, seriously.

655
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,027
HIROTO: We just have
to do 'Beautiful' well.

656
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:29,360
HIROTO: It's not saying our team
ended with 'Energetic'.

657
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,794
First! We'll focus on 'Beautiful'.

658
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:35,327
HYO: 'Beautiful' is where
the other team does the first verse.

659
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,294
HYO: So, our team's impact
might be weakened, right?

660
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:41,860
Want to focus and show a better stage.

661
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,648
(The B:GINNERs finished the first stage,
what will the next stage bring?)

662
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,176
MC DEX: Following 'Energetic', the two teams
are about to perform 'Beautiful'.

663
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:49,792
This song, unlike the others,

664
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:53,920
(Must express emotions in 'Beautiful')
requires emotional expression.

665
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:57,152
(Q: How did you interpret 'Beautiful'?)
I wonder how you interpreted this song.

666
00:31:57,152 --> 00:31:59,392
The story we came up with is about

667
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:04,576
KIM BOHYEON: being close friends
who can no longer meet,

668
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:09,745
(A story about longing for an estranged friend)
and now feeling the longing for a distant friend.

669
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:11,978
WANNA ONE LEE DAEHWI: They
even created a story?

670
00:32:11,978 --> 00:32:13,678
(Admirable)
They created a story.

671
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:16,711
Yes, our team reinterpreted
the song 'Beautiful'

672
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:22,645
(A story longing for memories with friends we were with)
as a story about missing the memories.

673
00:32:22,778 --> 00:32:23,872
(Both teams came up with a story through friendship)
It's about friends, both teams, huh?

674
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:25,053
Friendship.

675
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:27,645
(How will the friendship story
created by both teams turn out?)

676
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:28,878
(Round 3 competition D-15,

(Beauty+Zetic team)

678
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,088
('Beautiful' first verse, point is the intro)
The point is the first intro.

679
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:34,845
(Agree! Intro)
Intro.

680
00:32:35,178 --> 00:32:38,678
(Let's finish at the first verse!)
Feeling like we finished it.

681
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:40,045
(From now on 'Beautiful' only exists in the first verse)
Really cool.

682
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,345
'Ah, this team is the best',
this kind of feeling?

683
00:32:42,345 --> 00:32:49,445
HIROTO: The way to win is to think, 'We
have to satisfy them with the first verse.'

684
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,878
KIM BOHYEON: Because 'Beautiful'
was a song I wanted to do,

685

well in the given part...

be the last stage with these friends,

LIM JIHWAN: so I prepared
with a sense of urgency.

977
00:47:05,945 --> 00:47:09,012
LIM JIHWAN: Because we were in sync emotionally,
I feel like we were able to create a sense of unity,

978
00:47:09,612 --> 00:47:12,345
a memory that we can never
go back and change.

979

of the B:GINNER friends who have left.

I sang with all my heart,

B:GINNER JIHWAN shed tears,

988
00:47:42,912 --> 00:47:44,778
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG: it
reminded me of the past,

989
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:49,412
WANNA ONE BAE JINYOUNG: and I think
I became deeply immersed in the moment.

remembered my old days a lot,

were singing with understanding of the song.

997

empathizing with the storylines,

998
00:48:24,352 --> 00:48:25,952
(A stage where everything was well shown)
definitely emotional expression as well...

999
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:29,431
Gestures, facial expressions,
all these things were a bit...

1000
00:48:29,568 --> 00:48:32,945
(A stage like a single team)
The team came together, and it felt special. I really enjoyed watching it.

1005
00:48:44,245 --> 00:48:48,578
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: I want to mention
is that HYO, as the leader, really kept things together,

(Energy+Full team that created the best stage)
WANNA ONE HA SUNGWOON: which made the stage even better.

of the song each team took on.

1091

Our Boomerang team

1092

took on Boomerang's Verse 2
and Burn It Up's Verse 1.

1093
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:37,945
Our team took on Boomerang's Verse 1
and Burn It Up's Verse 2.

1094

(Looking forward to it)

1095
00:53:39,945 --> 00:53:42,945
Is there anything you feel
challenged by each other?

1096
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:44,352
PARK SECHAN: In the other team,
KAI is...

1097
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,976
(Doubt my ears)
Oh.

1098
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,545
PARK SECHAN: There's a part where KAI
does in Boomerang as a highlight...

1099
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:53,984
PARK SECHAN: When I hear it,
it gives me chills, so I chose KAI.

1100
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:55,678
Wow, even though
they're the opposing team,

1101

they're so impressive
that it gives me chills.

1102
00:53:58,245 --> 00:53:59,712
(Totally agree)

1103
00:53:59,712 --> 00:54:01,245

makes sense to be wary of.

1104

(Laughing)

1107
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:09,112
BAN DANIEL: It's a bit of a challenge,
but as we are cool, I think we can win.

1108
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,778
I think we can win because we are cool.

1109
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:14,312
(Confidence overflowing
from the gallantry)

1110
00:54:14,312 --> 00:54:16,078
BAN DANIEL: I think the only thing

1111
00:54:16,078 --> 00:54:18,078
BAN DANIEL: the other team
is better at than us is dancing.

1112
00:54:18,078 --> 00:54:19,778
BAN DANIEL: I'll get
my revenge on JAEIL,

1113
00:54:19,778 --> 00:54:21,376

(MOON JAEIL who dominated
the stage with dance alone)

1117
00:54:26,144 --> 00:54:27,451
Also, there's JUNMYEONG.

1118
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:28,288
(All-rounder LEE JUNMYEONG)
He is good at dancing and singing.

1119
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:32,345
YEONTAE is a main rapper.

1120
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:35,488
They're members
with high-level skills, so honestly,

1121
00:54:37,212 --> 00:54:38,812
I think we're
basically like the Avengers team.

1122
00:54:38,812 --> 00:54:41,612
LEE JUNMYEONG: I'm glad because it seems
like the team I envisioned was formed.

(B:MY BOYZ Avengers
team has been formed)

1124

LEE JUNMYEONG: JAEIL learns
choreography really fast.

1125
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:52,478
PARK SECHAN: It's amazing how he can watch a video
once and the choreography comes out in just one second.

(Quite satisfied from the first harmony)
Wow.

to acknowledge as the Avengers team)

1129
00:55:09,645 --> 00:55:13,545
KAI: We can't take it easy
with practice from now on.

1130

harder than we are right now.

lacking and have the others focus on different practices,
