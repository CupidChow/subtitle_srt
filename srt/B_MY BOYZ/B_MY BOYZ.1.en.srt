1
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:14,533
Someone once said,

2
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,033
'Dreams belong to those
who truly long for them.'

3
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:26,566
The world always shines on
someone's earnest dream.

4
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:31,424
Here stand 30 B:GINNERs,
who are once nameless trainees,

5
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,233
now taking their
very first step to become

6
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,433
someone's one and only.

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,433
(An excited first step
towards the Grand Audition stage)

8
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:49,533
Thirty B:GINNERs stand on stage.

9
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,266
The moment has come

10
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:56,800
for their voices to find
their way into your hearts.

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,720
And here are five masters who will guide

12
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:05,200
these 30 B:GINNERs on their journey.

13
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:12,160
(Dance Masters)

14
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:14,048
Did you do your best?

15
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:15,616
You're a bit full of yourself.

16
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:16,384
(Overflowing charisma)

17
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:18,656
(K-pop Dance's Center and Pride, LIA KIM)
Sure you're ready for the stage?

18
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:19,560
(A boundary-breaking artist)

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,352
(with no limits to genres)

20
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,528
That means you haven't practiced enough.

21
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:24,416
(K-pop Representative Choreographer, LEE YUJEONG)
The dance lacks impact.

22
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,240
(Vocal Masters)

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,040
You don't seem all that likable.

24
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,541
(Sincere advice from an experienced idol)
If you don't want to go home,

25
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,461
(YUJU)
you have to do it right.

26
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:30,720
(A dazzling solo performer)
I'm not sure what this stage is.

27
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:32,958
(and top-class vocalist, PENTAGON JINHO)
Too conspicuous in a bad way.

28
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:33,952
(Producing Master)

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,520
(K-pop's ultimate all-rounder)
This stage is gonna be a mess.

30
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,951
(who's proven to be more than an idol, PENTAGON HUI)
You should probably get a little nervous.

31
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:42,216
(B:MASTERs,
ready to lead with B:MY BOYZ)

32
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:48,388
And today, join
K-pop fans around the world.

33
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:50,256
And join the journey of B:MY BOYZ

34
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:53,989
and help make the B:GINNERs'
dreams come true.

35
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:55,902
We are B:IN US.

36
00:01:57,216 --> 00:02:00,456
Your choices can make
someone's dream come true,

37
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:02,623
create a boy group,

38
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,798
and shape the future of K-pop.

39
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:08,574
Among the B:GINNERs
who challenged themselves

40
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:11,776
to achieve their dreams,
who will fulfill their debut dream?

41
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:16,030
Who is your boy this summer?

42
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,054
Who is your boy?

43
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:18,489
B:MY BOYZ

44
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:20,192
is starting now.

45
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:25,022
(On a lush early summer day...)

46
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:32,827
(PARK SECHAN, 16, Korean)

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,616
(LEE YUNSUNG, 19, Korean)

48
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,255
(KANG JUNSEONG, 20, Korean)

49
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,992
(An invitation carrying 30 dreams)

50
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:41,920
(has been delivered)

51
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,912
What is this?

52
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:48,789
You are invited? B:MY BOYZ.

53
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,224
A hot and dazzling summer
towards dreams.

54
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,208
Boy who are shining brightly...

55
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,189
You're invited to B:MY BOYZ.

56
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,040
You're invited to B:MY BOYZ.

57
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:00,789
You're invited to B:MY BOYZ.

58
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,040
(Like the clear summer sky,)

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,855
(the B:GINNERs are running toward you
with 30 dreams in their hearts)

60
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:10,222
(A few days later,
at the SBS HQ in Mok-dong)

61
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,841
(Welcome)

62
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:14,688
(The B:GINNERs' first journey starts)

63
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,497
(B:MY BOYZ: The first B:GINNER arrives)

64
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,648
Hello.

65
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
I'm KAI from Japan.

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,022
Oh, it's so pretty.

67
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,655
As soon as I arrived, it was
exactly the kind of vibe

68
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,496
I had imagined,

69
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:34,496
so I thought, "This is
going to be so much fun."

70
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:39,922
To be honest, walking into
a completely empty space

71
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:44,389
made me nervous,
and I was actually a little scared.

72
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:55,072
(Just at the time, the second B:GINNER
with strikingly long legs arrives)

73
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,409
(With confident, brisk strides)

74
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,289
I've completed my military service.

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,155
I am JANG WON, born in 2002.

76
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,472
I have modeled for a school
uniform commercial.

77
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:08,992
I appeared as a model in the music video

78
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,989
for Haha's song titled "Gap."

79
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,792
I think I was feeling nervous.

80
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,065
There was just one person,

81
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,808
so it felt like the calm
before the storm.

82
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,640
(How will the B:GINNERs'
first meeting be?)

83
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:28,992
(Struggling to find his spot)

84
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,544
(Oh, there it is.)

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,222
(Narrowed vision, heading straight to
his spot without making eye contact)

86
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:41,792
(The two share a tense silence)

87
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,922
(Recharging courage)

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,144
How do you feel?

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,625
My heart... is pounding fast.

90
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:53,825
Who will come next?

91
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:58,560
(The next B:GINNER shyly appears)

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,616
Name!!!

93
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:00,512
Name.

94
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:03,617
Name.

95
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:05,527
Name.

96
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:07,455
(This feels like playing
hide-and-seek all alone)

97
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,664
(After murmuring 'name'
six times, finally found it)

98
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:12,865
(The B:GINNER who was only searching
for his name, what's his name?)

99
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:16,661
Hello, I'm AI,
who wants to be your love.

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,628
AI was so cute,
taking his time finding his seat.

101
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,628
It did take some time.

102
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:26,254
(B:GINNER AI, who came to B:MY BOYZ)
I came here to challenge myself

103
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:29,632
in B:MY BOYZ
because I want to do what I love.

104
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,861
(The next B:GINNER, full of curiosity
and busy looking around)

105
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:34,761
It's amazing.

106
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:35,661
Hello.

107
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:38,528
I'm BAN DANIEL, 15 years old.

108
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,495
You said you're still
growing taller, right?

109
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:43,200
You might even end up taller than
the much older B:GINNERs someday.

110
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,928
Yeah.

111
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,695
Would you like to say
a few words to them?

112
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:48,861
(Just imagining it makes him happy)

113
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:52,161
Now, I'm a little taller.

114
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:54,766
(Restless)

115
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:57,128
Just move a little to the side.

116
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:59,661
(The youngest who still needs the help)

117
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,361
(Another B:GINNER toddling over)

118
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,022
(Hello.)

119
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:07,028
Hello, I'm PARK SECHAN,

120
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:10,561
the second youngest
in B:MY BOYZ, 15 years old.

121
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,918
(Staring at him)
When SECHAN came in, he was so cute.

122
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,095
(Earned the older B:GINNERs'
top pick at the first meeting)

123
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:22,228
(A very nervous B:GINNER, PARK SECHAN)

124
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:24,461
KANG JUNSEONG?

125
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:28,961
Even as a man, I think he is so handsome
that one could almost fall in love with him.

126
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:31,961
This might sound awkward

127
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,861
or even annoying,

128
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,695
but I want to say a few words to myself.

129
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:36,910
"You're really cool."

130
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,158
(Can't hold back the laughter)

131
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:40,428
Oh, I'm embarrassed.

132
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:44,014
(As more and more B:GINNERs gather)

133
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,454
Who will come next?

134
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:52,161
Oh, the B:GINNER next to me is coming.

135
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,262
(Whispers and buzzes filled with
curiosity, who's the next B:GINNER?)

136
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:55,214
- He's handsome.
- He's so handsome.

137
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,128
Hello.

138
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,184
I am MIYAKE HARUTO.

139
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,795
(B:GINNER HARUTO
hesitantly looking for his spot)

140
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:06,254
Where's my spot?

141
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:08,846
(Lost but greeting brightly)
Hello, hello.

142
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,254
So cute.

143
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:12,795
Wait a moment, where exactly is my spot?

144
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:14,934
(No skipping the greeting)
Hello, hello.

145
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,742
Here's your spot.

146
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:18,926
(My neighbor, come)
Hello.

147
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:20,814
Hello.

148
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,861
(B:GINNER HARUTO finally finds his spot)

149
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,128
(Pure happiness)

150
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:28,302
- Oh.
- Next to it...

151
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:30,990
You have to stand next to it.

152
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,895
(That's right, just stand like that)

153
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:35,195
(Somehow makes him
want to take care of him)

154
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:40,461
(Performing tricks for tired HARUTO)
Ta-da.

155
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:42,190
Are you okay?

156
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:46,496
(Look forward to the sweet duo:
JUNSEONG and cute big bro HARUTO)

157
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,495
How many people are here right now?

158
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:50,862
It's finally the last one.

159
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,832
(At last, the final B:GINNER is here)
He's coming now.

160
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:54,892
Where? Oh, it's the last one.

161
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,358
You are right.

162
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,061
(Spotlight on, who's the B:GINNER
that stole everyone's attention?)

163
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:02,244
He's tall.

164
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:04,673
Hello.

165
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,361
Hello.

166
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,495
I'm 20-year-old refreshing
boy, LEE YUNSUNG.

167
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:09,664
Nice to meet you.

168
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:12,430
Wow, he's so handsome.

169
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:13,902
YUNSUNG is

170
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:16,928
tall and so so handsome.

171
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:18,400
I was so surprised.

172
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,028
(Finally, all the B:GINNERs
gathered in one place)

173
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:23,528
(A little bit)
Are you excited?

174
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:28,032
All 30 B:GINNERs, welcome.

175
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:30,528
All 30 B:GINNERs, welcome.

176
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:32,061
It startled me.

177
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,228
I wondered what was happening.

178
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:35,712
What's going on?

179
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:40,366
You are invited to the journey
to become B:MY BOYZ.

180
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:46,222
I felt a strong thrill and hope
as it was finally time

181
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,598
for my name to be revealed.

182
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:53,150
Now, I'll explain the selection process
for the debut group of B:MY BOYZ.

183
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:56,544
B:MY BOYZ will determine its debut group

184
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,784
through a total of four missions

185
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,390
and a final live broadcast mission.

186
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,310
In the final mission,

187
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:03,648
the top 8 contestants...

188
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:04,999
The top 8 contestants

189
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,795
will debut.

190
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:09,369
Out of 30 contestants,
only 8 will debut?

191
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,993
I couldn't help but wonder,
'Could I really be one of them?'

192
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,413
That's when I made up my mind.
"I have to debut, no matter what!"

193
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:21,925
I thought to myself, "Is the MC going
to come up from below the stage?"

194
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,128
- Wow.
- Cool.

195
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:27,168
- It looks pretty.
- It's pretty.

196
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:32,327
This jacket is the debut jacket given
only to the 8 members of B:MY BOYZ.

197
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:33,741
Debut jacket.

198
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:40,448
B:GINNERs must become
the owners of this jacket

199
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,272
through their own skills,

200
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,875
charm, and hard work.

201
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,210
I thought, "Wow, that's so cool.
That jacket is mine."

202
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:51,914
I also thought about debuting
while wearing that jacket.

203
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:56,448
Before we start, please share
your passion and commitment

204
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:58,000
toward your dreams on a postcard.

205
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:05,556
Post card?

206
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:10,765
(B:GINNERs putting their
personal resolve into words)

207
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,031
(B:GINNERs' Post Box
for keeping the postcards)

208
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:14,565
The message written
on the postcard is...

209
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,598
'LI ZHIWEI, you can absolutely
make it this time, right?'

210
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:18,144
'This time, I absolutely have to debut.'

211
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:21,231
I put it in the post box thinking,

212
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:23,072
'Will I be reading it again
in the future?'

213
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,231
'More fun than anyone else,
cooler than anyone else.'

214
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:28,631
'I will debut no matter what.'

215
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:31,328
I wrote, 'Do your best to the fullest'

216
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:33,465
'and leave with no regrets.'

217
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,498
I felt that dropping the post card

218
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:41,298
in the post box was how I
shared my heart with everyone.

219
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:42,698
Whether I'll be eliminated or debut,

220
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:45,131
I will present a stage I won't regret.

221
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,831
I wrote the letter with this thought.

222
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,665
(With their heartfelt letters sent,)

223
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,798
(the B:GINNERs come
together at the photo wall)

224
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:06,280
Here begins the unexpected mission
for B:MY BOYZ's B:GINNERs.

225
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,065
Already?

226
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:09,184
Wow.

227
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:11,498
Huh?

228
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:14,865
(Suddenly opened photo wall)

229
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:19,165
What's happening?

230
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:21,198
Wow.

231
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:25,896
Wow.

232
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:27,031
- Wow, what is it? Oh my.
- Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

233
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:31,431
(The audience secretly waiting
behind the photo wall)

234
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:35,265
(I'm not sure who you are, but... 'hello')

235
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:36,776
(So funny)

236
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,088
(Nice to meet you)

237
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,232
(Eyes wide in surprise)

238
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,408
Suddenly, the audience...

239
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,594
The audience?

240
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,236
- Oh my.
- Really?

241
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:56,328
(Masters appearing out of nowhere?)

242
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:58,656
(Five minutes before the surprise stage)

243
00:11:58,888 --> 00:11:59,856
I'm looking forward to it.

244
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:04,532
Anyway, today we meet
like this for the first time.

245
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:07,098
And it's our first time seeing
the B:GINNERs like this,

246
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:09,332
so we've been really
looking forward to it as well.

247
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,456
How do you think the atmosphere will be?

248
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:13,160
So these guys, I mean...

249
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,592
They came here without
knowing there'd be an evaluation,

250
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:18,376
and now suddenly they
have to get on stage?

251
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:21,864
Wow, isn't this too cruel?

252
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:23,976
Survival shows really are brutal, huh?

253
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,960
From the first round of competition...

254
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,568
It's really...

255
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:27,304
B:GINNERs?

256
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,512
(Masters observing them)
Looks like they're coming in now, huh?

257
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,272
So they don't know about it now, huh?

258
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:32,424
Still innocent.

259
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,432
They probably thought
it was a press conference.

260
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,872
- Ah, suddenly...
- What a sudden shock!

261
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:47,264
- It's really too sudden!
- Something's opening behind.

262
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,532
There's audience.

263
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,765
Wow, they did it like this?

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,261
(So cruel)
Really...

265
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,896
As someone who's already debuted,
this would still surprise me.

266
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:00,898
Let's go.

267
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,065
This is seriously scary...

268
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,200
(B:GINNERs making their way
to somewhere)

269
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,498
(Feeling puzzled)
Wow, amazing.

270
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,765
What is this? What's happening?

271
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:11,665
Oh, amazing.

272
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,632
Oh, I'm getting goosebumps.

273
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:17,465
'Oh, what should I do?
What can I show them right now?'

274
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,698
I got goosebumps so much
that I couldn't think of anything.

275
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,865
Wow, this is seriously tough...

276
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:25,732
I was so flustered that

277
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:27,165
I couldn't think of anything at all.

278
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:29,532
Suddenly, I feel nervous.

279
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:32,424
The mission begins now.

280
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:35,232
Pardon?

281
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,160
(What?) (Evaluation?)

282
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:40,432
(Stage lights off)

283
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,898
(Just like this, right away?)
This kind of situation...

284
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:44,198
How can they do it right away?

285
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,198
- Not easy.
- How can the B:GINNERs handle this?

286
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:49,576
No matter who it is,
wouldn't this be confusing?

287
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:50,760
They've only got five seconds.

288
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,728
(Starting the 5-second countdown)

289
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,032
Ah, what's happening?

290
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,665
Wow, really?

291
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,398
For real?

292
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:18,465
(B:GINNERs reacting
instinctively as the music starts)

293
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:21,768
They know it, so they jump right in.

294
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,144
They're doing it right away.

295
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:30,986
Keep cool, keep cool.

296
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:36,765
(The reason they could perform
immediately despite the surprise is...)

297
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:44,265
(The B:GINNERs, waiting to record
the song they practiced all week)

298
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:49,480

complete their first surprise mission?)

the judges is complete,)

recall the choreography.

If it were me...

366
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:31,498
I wouldn't focus on
the choreography at all...

367

369

It's one thing to practice
in the rehearsal room,

but suddenly performing in front of
audience and locking eyes with them

371
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:40,498
can be really overwhelming.

372
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:41,952
Their ability to adjust instantly
to that kind of setting

I didn't think I'd get 4th place.

404

I voted because it was evident
he danced hard and put in effort.

405
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:16,298
I picked B:GINNER LEE YUNSUNG

406
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,298
because right from his appearance,

407
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:20,896
he made sure to connect with
every fan with great fan service.

408
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:23,332
I chose him because I truly believe
he has the ability.

409
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,598
It was such a great feeling
to be acknowledged

410

419

and he really gave off a true idol vibe.

I believed I worked
the hardest on this song

00:26:37,002 --> 00:26:39,403
to the next round
regardless of your ranking.

519
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,771
(New concept, huh? Sounds fun)
Oh, that's new and sounds fun.

520
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:43,883
Wow, this is it.

521
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:46,539
(Except for the first-place team,)
Even if they're not the first-place team,

522
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,363
(one from each team is selected)
three members from each team can be

523
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:52,075
(TOP PICK B:GINNER)
Top Picks and survive regardless of ranking.

524
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,771
(10 people directly
advance to the 2nd round)

525
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,115
So ruthless, as expected.

526
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,536
Of course, it's great
if the whole team survives,

527
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:03,002
but I think aiming for Top Pick
is also a good strategy.

528
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:05,702
If I shine within the team,

529
00:27:05,702 --> 00:27:08,936
even if we don't get first place, I can
still survive when things don't go well.

530
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:10,379
(This round is both team and individual)
I'll give it my all.

531
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:15,881
(The first top idol who holds their fate)
Now the top idol for the first round.

532
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:22,537
The top idol of the first round is...

533
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:24,901
NCT.

534
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:28,843
(The top idol with K-POP's first-ever)

535
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:32,331
(infinite expansion system
and various units)

536
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:37,451
(NEO CULTURE TECHNOLOGY)

537
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:39,688
(NCT)

538
00:27:41,102 --> 00:27:45,202
(Round 1 TOP Idol NCT)

539
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:46,955
(The ultimate dream
team for the B:GINNERs)

540
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:48,309
- They look so cool.
- I love you guys.

541
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:52,043
Let us introduce ourselves.

542
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:53,682
Two, three.

543
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,659
Hello, we're NCT.

544
00:27:56,011 --> 00:27:57,799
(NCT JOHNNY, NCT JUNGWOO)

545
00:27:58,197 --> 00:28:00,104
(NCT WayV TEN, WayV XIAOJUN)

546
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:04,848
What mindset will you have while
watching the B:GINNERs' stages today?

547
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:13,131
For me, I'm curious and excited to see
how they've made our stages their own.

548
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:17,636
I think the basics are
singing and dancing, but

549
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:23,969
I'm looking forward to seeing how they
internalize and make the song their own.

550
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:25,547
Alright, now let me introduce

551
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:29,238
the 1st round with eliminations.

552
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:31,769
The theme for the first round is...

553
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:33,969
It's a concept battle.

554
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:36,769
(Charismatic, sexy, hip-hop, powerful,
old-school, 5 NCT concept battles)

555
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:39,414
Through a surprise mission,

556
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,539
the top-ranked B:GINNERs directly
chose their team members and concepts.

557
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,659
I'll choose charismatic concept,
Fact Check.

558
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:55,466
(KAI's choice, charismatic concept,
Fact Check)

559
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:58,653
I choose PARK SECHAN and LIM JIHWAN.

560
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:03,903
HYO, LI ZHIWEI, KIM JEONGHOON.

561

(Charismatic concept, Fact Check HYO, KIM JEONGHOON,
PARK SECHAN, KAI, LIM JIHWAN, LI ZHIWEI)

562
00:29:07,106 --> 00:29:08,990
I'll choose the old-school concept,
'90s Love.

563
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:18,569
(B:GINNER KANG JUNSEONG's choice,
old-school concept, NCT U's 90's Love)

564

(Old-school concept, 90's Love, IKUTO, PARK JUNHYEOK,
KANG JUNSEONG, AI, JANG HUIGWANG, HARUTO)

565
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,625
Thank you.

566
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:25,227
I'll choose

567
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,706
hip-hop concept, Baggy Jeans.

568
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:37,769
(MOON JAEIL's choice,
hip-hop concept, Baggy Jeans)

569
00:29:40,036 --> 00:29:42,836
(Hip-hop concept, Baggy Jeans, LEE JUNMYEONG, MOON JAEIL,

570
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:46,493
I'll choose powerful concept, Kick it.

571

573
00:29:59,436 --> 00:30:04,836
(Sexy concept - WayV's Love Talk)

574
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:08,169
(A group of 6 who couldn't choose)
We have to pose? We should pose.

575
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:09,984
(SUTHASCHAI KIM BOHYEON JANG WON)
We can stop practicing at night.

576
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:12,369
(DIDI, CHOI YOHAN, YANG CHENGXI)
We can stop practicing at night.

577
00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:16,555
(Charismatic, sexy)
The concept battle tests B:GINNERs' ability

578
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:20,928
(Hip-hop, old-school, powerful)
to adapt to different songs and styles.

579
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,702
Is there a concept you're excited about?

580
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:24,555
I'm

581
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:27,595
(The concept I'm most excited about is...)
looking forward to

582
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:29,483
Kick It.

583
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:30,635
Let's do our best.

584
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:35,136
(WayV-Love Talk)
I'm looking forward to our song the most.

585
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:36,177
Oh my god.

586
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:38,333
My nerves are through the roof.

587
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:39,531
This is serious.

588
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:42,379
Then, let's start the first round of

589
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:43,915
B:MY BOYZ now.

590
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:45,569
Who is your boy?

591
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:47,270
B:MY BOYZ.

592
00:30:56,994 --> 00:30:58,013
(Expectation)
I'm looking forward to it.

593
00:30:58,923 --> 00:30:59,531
(The masters are nervous too)
Oh, no.

594
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:00,640
- What do we do, our boys?
- You all have to do well!

595
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:01,707
They need to do well.

596
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,718
The first performance
is really important.

597
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:09,936
Let's watch this team's performance,
to be judged by NCT and the B:IN US.

598
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,256
(Who's the first team in
B:MY BOYZ's concept battle?)

599
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:17,969
(Expecting/Trilling
Which one is the first team in the concept battle?)

600
00:31:17,969 --> 00:31:19,969
Wow, here they come!

601
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:22,436
(The masters get nervous too)
First team?

602
00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:23,467
- Who is it?
- Have they come out?

603
00:31:24,569 --> 00:31:27,302
(First team, hip-hop concept,
Baggy Jeans)

604
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:36,736
It's the first team. I'm curious to see
how they'll show their hip-hop swag.

605
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:39,536
This is hip-hop concept,
Baggy Jeans Team.

606
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:41,002
We've come this far.

607
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:42,102
So we can't settle for...

608
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,302
Anything less than first place.

609
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:49,336
It feels kind of cool.

610
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,435
As soon as I saw Ten's face,

611
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:53,736
I was like, "Whoa!"
and got totally surprised.

612
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:56,683
Because I've taken on
many aspects of TEN,

613
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:58,975
I think I was more nervous.

614
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:03,136
Since we had to perform
their song in front of them,

615
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:06,236
the tension suddenly shot up.

616
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,469
May I ask why you chose this song?

617
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:12,331
I chose Baggy Jeans because

618
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,776
it's my favorite track
by the NCT seniors.

619
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,169
Is your favorite member
in this group too?

620
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:21,355
Personally, my favorite is JOHNNY.

621
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,619
(Happy)
0h, thank you.

622
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,739
I am that JOHNNY!

623
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,203
I am.

624
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:31,269
Were there any difficulties
during practice?

625
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:35,002
Baggy Jeans has so much swag

626
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:38,763
and a laid-back vibe, but since
we're still inexperienced,

627
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,643
it's hard to fully show that swag,
so we decided to go for

628
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:44,636
a more kitsch and fun style,
something that fits us better,

629
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:48,402
and express it in our own way.
So we worked hard on that.

630
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:52,160
(TEN jokingly easing the tension)
I'm expecting a vibe that's hipper and cooler than ours.

631
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,921
Thank you.

632
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:57,736
Your attitude is really energetic.

633
00:32:57,736 --> 00:33:00,736
The way of speaking
and gestures are really cool.

634
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:02,536
Thank you.

635
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:06,269
Hello, I am LEE JUNMYEONG.

636
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:08,069
The reason I started as an idol is

637
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,969
because I really loved Big Bang's music,

638
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,136
and they were just so cool.

639
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:14,859
♪Nothing ever♪

640
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:16,302
♪Lasts forever♪

641
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:17,636
I thought, "I have to be

642
00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:21,636
on that stage too, no matter what,"
so I just

643
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,891
(He became a trainee at the same agency)
went for auditions and got into YG.

644
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,707
(as his admired seniors)
That's where my real trainee life began,

645
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:27,595
and that's how I started my journey.

646
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:34,869
What felt definitely different
was that the training

647
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:38,402
included many classes reflecting
the company's unique style,

648
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:41,102
focusing more on hip-hop
than clean, precise dance.

649
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,102
JUNMYEONG's walk was
unusual from the start.

650
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:45,435
(How was the walk?)

651
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:46,802
It was cool.

652
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:50,336
He truly suits the leader role,
just screams hip-hop.

653
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,363
(The hip-hop leader, LEE JUNMYEONG)

654
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:55,435
Then, I'll really look forward
to the stage.

655
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:56,843
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

656
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,371
- Yes, show us.
- Go for it.

657
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,048
(Hip-hop, Baggy Jeans)

658
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:03,936
It'll be fun.

659
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:05,969
Are they starting now?

660
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:07,115
I'm really looking forward
to Baggy Jeans.

661
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:11,236
But if they don't nail this song,
it can really fall flat.

662
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:12,395
Right, exactly.

663
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,802
(It splits sharply depending on skill)
If done well, it's wow!

664
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:18,475
I just thought, "This is who I am!"

665
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:20,587
"Let's just show what I can do!"

666
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:24,136
I've been dancing and singing
for years to stand on a stage like this.

667
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:27,069
I thought it would be fun.

668
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:30,469
(The waiting room is filled with tension)
Oh, I'm also nervous.

669
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,736
Ah, do well, guys!

670
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:35,369
Baggy Jeans?! It seems
they got most of the attention.

671
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:37,002
Everyone's skills are excellent.

672
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:41,836
I had high expectations because
the right people were gathered for it.

673
00:34:41,836 --> 00:34:44,843
Because JUNMYEONG is the leader
of Baggy Jeans team,

674
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:46,187
I'm a little excited.

675
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,502
(D-17, the practice room
of Baggy Jeans team)

676
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:50,536
JUNMYEONG became the leader.

677
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:54,336
- We will definitely get first place!
- Applause.

678
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:55,402
(Q. Why was he chosen as the leader?)
Because JUNMYEONG

679
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:56,769
(Q. Why was he chosen as the leader?)
is naturally

680
00:34:57,069 --> 00:34:58,436
(JUNMYEONG is Hip Hop!)
hip-hop all the time.

681
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:00,939
(How's hip-hop leader's dance?)
This is the vibe.

682
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:04,331
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

683
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,393
Oh!

684
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:13,836
(Swag from the hip-hop powerhouse)

685

(The second runner MOON JAEIL)

686
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:23,369
(Surprised)

687
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:28,402
JAEIL is really good at beatboxing
and definitely dances well.

688
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:30,436
Since I like dancing,

689
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:33,402
I am studying Korean
traditional dance at Arts High School.

690
00:35:33,402 --> 00:35:36,369
I love dancing so much

691
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:39,569
I've even practiced 18 hours a day.

692
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,302
I'm confident in my dance.

693
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:49,569
(Baggy Jeans team
is full of talented dancers)

694
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:53,636
He dances so well.

695
00:35:53,636 --> 00:35:56,302
I thought in terms of performance
we wouldn't lose to other teams.

696
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:59,136
- Let's watch the choreography video.
- Yes.

697

(Focus)

(Baggy Jeans, by NCT U)

699
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:11,169
I think it will be fun
since we're practicing for the stage.

700
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:19,502
I'm excited to see the performance
on stage when we match the dance.

701
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,046
If the formation is rushed, we'll need
to choreograph everything together.

702
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,536
(Choreography Creation Section)

703
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:25,902
Choreography creation section?

704
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:28,674
(Another mission: choreography
creation segment)

705
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:31,143
Each team created about 30 seconds

706
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:33,936
of original choreography
for every mission song.

707
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:37,195
(Round 1 criteria: concept interpretation)
Please pay attention to their abilities

708
00:36:37,502 --> 00:36:40,869
(and choreography creation)
to interpret the concept and choreograph.

709
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:44,349
Suddenly, the choreography
creation section

710
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:47,766
appeared in big red letters

711
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:51,415
on the transition part,
and my heart just dropped.

712
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:55,373
I think I totally freaked out.
That's when the meltdown really started.

713
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,475
To be honest, I felt a bit lost too.

714
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:00,523
I had confidence.

715
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:03,031
If we kill this part,

716
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:04,715
we can totally dominate.

717
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,755
(Starting choreography creation)
Since there are a lot of us right now,

718
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:10,091
JAEIL, me, and SEONGIN too,

719
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:12,669
how about we split it up and each
work on a part of the choreography?

720
00:37:13,227 --> 00:37:13,675
- Yes.
- Good.

721
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:16,683
I think it's okay to fill it in a bit
with some formations.

722
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:21,355
(Choreography Part A, JUNMYEONG
takes the lead in choreography creation)

723
00:37:23,802 --> 00:37:27,636
It felt like JUNMYEONG
was taking the lead,

724
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:32,747
and the vibe was a laid-back kind
of hip-hop,

725
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:35,269
so I thought, "Ah, this is hip-hop?"

726
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:37,903
(JUNMYEONG's Hip-Hop School: B:GINNER No.1 Disciple, LEE SEONGIN)
Yes. I'm studying.

727
00:37:37,903 --> 00:37:39,168
Like this?

728
00:37:39,168 --> 00:37:40,261
(Team B for the choreography creation)
Like we're having fun?

729
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,176
More like going hard and easing into it.

730
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,531
Like easing in, then hitting hard,
then easing out again.

731
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,011
That kind of vibe.

732
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:44,811
This part is all self-choreographed.

733
00:37:45,802 --> 00:37:49,269
Only HYEONBIN and I were
doing it together and then,

734
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:54,469
BAN DANIEL was running around next to us

735
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:56,302
like a puppy playing.

736
00:37:59,595 --> 00:38:01,169
I wasn't just playing around them.

737
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:03,169
I've always loved dancing,

738
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:06,936
so I was thinking, "What kind of
cool moves could I come up with?"

739
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:08,363
But,

740
00:38:08,715 --> 00:38:09,769
when we were planning the choreography

741
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:10,936
he helped us a lot.

742
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:13,502
Whenever JAEIL and I got stuck,
we looked at BAN DANIEL and thought,

743
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,802
"This is good," and used it
to create our moves.

744
00:38:15,802 --> 00:38:16,235
That seems nice.

745
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:16,907
Right?

746
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:19,307
(The unsung hero of choreography creation)
There were some great moves,

747
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:21,963
so I think we gained a lot from DANIEL.

748
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:29,902
To create a great performance,
I take the lead a bit,

749
00:38:29,902 --> 00:38:33,969
but JAEIL watches as I watch too,
and I think the leader is

750
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,036
someone who gathers
all those colors into one framework.

751
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:39,636
I will definitely make

752
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:41,483
this team number one!

753
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:44,369

755
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:48,811
(Expectation)
Okay.

756
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,702
I'm looking forward to this song.

757

(Under everyone's high expectations,
how's the skill of Baggy Jeans Team?)

(Baggy Jeans Team's
Choreography Creation Section)

759
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,636
The two main dancers really bring

760
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:14,802
such intense power
that their faces practically scrunch up.

761
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:16,936
(They are good)

762
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,619

764
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:33,291
(is shaky in the vocal part)

765
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:45,702
I think the leadership
in the dance performance

766
00:39:45,702 --> 00:39:46,969
(The creation section was led by)
was really good.

767
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:49,336
(MOON JAEIL and LEE JUNMYEONG)
Both JAEIL and JUNMYEONG.

768
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:51,802
But if you go on stage like this,

769
00:39:51,802 --> 00:39:52,969
it could be a disaster.

770
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:57,902
Overall, the vocals

771
00:39:57,902 --> 00:39:59,702
aren't coming through.

772
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:02,869
It doesn't feel like you guys
were better in practice.

773
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:03,736
It seems you guys

774
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:04,736
have struggled all along.

775
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,869
My singing was really bad.

776
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,902
Honestly, I felt very sorry
towards the team members.

777
00:40:11,169 --> 00:40:13,936
As a leader, did you not
notice the members

778
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:16,136
struggling with their singing?

779
00:40:17,436 --> 00:40:19,102
- I kind of had a feeling.
- Yeah.

780
00:40:19,102 --> 00:40:21,227
To someone,

781
00:40:21,227 --> 00:40:22,236
parts should be distributed

782
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:24,928
just enough to feel unfair
to someone. It's normal.

783
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:27,836
I think this is the leader's duty,
from my perspective.

784
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:31,536
Honestly, I think
it's the leader's responsibility

785
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:34,869
- to speak up about uncomfortable things.
- Right.

786
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:39,936
I thought the part distribution
I chose would work well,

787
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,002
but in the end,
I think it was my mistake.

788
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:45,675
(Vocal Class)
Hello.

789
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:47,148
Hello.

790
00:40:47,502 --> 00:40:49,702
Well done on the mid-evaluation stage.

(Embarrassed)

792
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:52,945
First,

793
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:55,336
I figured out
what's wrong with this team.

794
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:58,763
There's no vocal in this team!

795
00:40:59,787 --> 00:41:01,669
There's no vocal in this team.

796
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:04,203
Great dance and rap, but

797
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:06,236
(Vocal skills lagging behind)
no strong lead vocalist.

798
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:10,403
(Their dance and rap!)
So that's a big issue right now.

799
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:15,392
(SEONGIN, handling the vocal part of team)

00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:28,043
SEONGIN, you can't carry a tune!

803
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:29,906
The pitch fell off like this.

804
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:30,969
I'm bad at singing,

805
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:33,802
so I feel like I'm hurting the team,

806
00:41:33,802 --> 00:41:35,469
and I really dislike that situation.

807
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,147
SEONGIN's key vocal parts,

808
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:40,971
especially high notes,

809
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:44,107

"What should I really do..."

814
00:41:50,602 --> 00:41:52,769
That's what I thought at that time.

815
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:54,603
(Vocal part changed)
Okay, vocals go to JUNMYEONG for now.

816
00:41:54,603 --> 00:41:55,736
Honestly, it was very disappointing.

817
00:41:56,569 --> 00:42:00,569
Since it's because of my lack of skill,

818
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:04,602
I'm determined to nail

819
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:06,443
even the parts I have,

820
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:08,651
so I'll keep practicing.

821
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:16,075
(B:GINNER LEE SEONGIN, humbly improving)
Honestly, I'd love to bring more to the table,

822
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,211
(and moving toward his dream)
but I'm not ready yet, and

823
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:21,547
that makes me frustrated with myself.

824
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:24,811
I think I need to work hard

825
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:26,202
to be remembered,

826
00:42:26,202 --> 00:42:30,302
even just a little,
among the six members.

827
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:35,269
First, a major overhaul is needed,

828
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:38,836
and it's true we
struggled with live vocals.

829
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:40,769
But saying 'there are no vocals'

830
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,702
feels a bit harsh...

831
00:42:42,702 --> 00:42:43,902
It hurts our confidence.

832
00:42:43,902 --> 00:42:45,899

So I hope we get a chance

833

(fired up to bounce back)
to prove ourselves and make a comeback.

834
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:50,336
Hey, we can do this, right?!

835
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:54,636
There are always variables
in any situation,

836
00:42:54,636 --> 00:42:57,069
so adapting is my role!

837
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:02,443
(There's no such thing
as defeat in hip-hop!)

838
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:04,803
If there is feedback,

839
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:07,103
I think we should accept feedback.

840
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:09,936
The mid-check results were
shocking, but they've motivated us

841
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:11,536
and could become our driving force.

842
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:15,503
I want to prepare with all my
heart and give it my all on stage.

843
00:43:15,503 --> 00:43:17,451
It was a little disappointing,

844
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:19,851
but how can we hesitate and
not keep pushing forward?

845
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:20,903
Isn't a journey of growth

846
00:43:20,903 --> 00:43:22,403

937
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:05,995
(Baggy Jeans Team did well)
They did really well.

938
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:08,843
Watching it made me nervous too.

939
00:48:10,669 --> 00:48:12,651
We were all a little excited

940
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:13,903
and nervous too.

941
00:48:13,903 --> 00:48:16,736
But overall, I think we
did well and enjoyed it.

942
00:48:16,736 --> 00:48:19,636
I think we had fun with it.

943
00:48:20,436 --> 00:48:22,969
It was a hip-hop concept
Baggy Jeans team's stage.

944
00:48:23,851 --> 00:48:27,769
(What's NCT's evaluation?)
I'm really curious how NCT members saw it.

945
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:30,369
First of all, thank you
for your hard work.

946
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:34,469
I can really see how hard you prepared.

947
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:37,103
The choreography
creation part was a little...

948
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:45,169
(The choreography creation section that
delivered an impressive performance)

949
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:50,836
I really liked how it strongly showed
your own unique interpretation.

950
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:53,969
B:GINNER JUNMYEONG,
you're the leader, right?

951
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:55,269
Yes, that's right.

952
00:48:55,269 --> 00:49:00,103
JUNMYEONG showed
a lot of composure on stage.

953
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:07,636
(B:GINNER JUNMYEONG delivered a stage
that was both stable and confident)

954
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:10,203
The performance was
also really impressive.

955
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:12,235
(High praise from top idol group NCT)
Thank you.

956
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:16,303
Ten, who directly participated
in Baggy Jeans, please share your opinion.

957
00:49:16,303 --> 00:49:20,269
From what I saw, I thought
the energy was really great too.

958
00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:22,803
It's your first time now,
but I honestly think

959
00:49:22,803 --> 00:49:26,003
you guys can do much better
in the future.

960
00:49:26,003 --> 00:49:30,347
I think if you guys focus more on
basics like movements and timing,

961
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:34,736
(Candid feedback from Ten)
you'll dance even better going forward.

962
00:49:35,169 --> 00:49:36,503
I think it kind of hurts.

963
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:40,003
Those who have done it will understand.

964
00:49:40,003 --> 00:49:42,003
But it really hurts.

965
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:45,103
(Masters with a motherly heart)
That's right, even about the performance...

966
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:47,736
The members themselves
are still very young.

967
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:49,643
At this level, I honestly think

968
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:51,736
you all did a really great job.

969
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,355
But probably...

970
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:57,103
I think maybe you skipped
vocal practice quite a bit.

971
00:49:57,355 --> 00:49:58,699
Right?

972
00:49:58,827 --> 00:50:01,169
Baggy Jeans is a really difficult song.

973
00:50:01,355 --> 00:50:02,155
(That's right)
It is.

974
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,203
It seemed like the dancing and singing

975
00:50:05,355 --> 00:50:09,003
(Vocals fell short of the dancing)
didn't quite complement each other.

976
00:50:10,795 --> 00:50:13,603
We're saying all this

977
00:50:13,603 --> 00:50:15,769
because you really seem
full of potential.

978
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:20,169
That's why we're pointing
things out one by one.

979
00:50:20,169 --> 00:50:23,336
It was a really cool stage.

980
00:50:23,336 --> 00:50:24,768
Thank you.

981
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:28,395
(Excited for Baggy Jeans
Team's future growth)

982
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:33,303
It's disappointing, but all the more
reason to work harder, right?

983
00:50:33,303 --> 00:50:36,403
Honestly, it would be
a lie to say I'm satisfied.

984
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:37,669
It's really disappointing.

985
00:50:37,669 --> 00:50:39,703
If I could do it once more,
I would like to do more.

986
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,869
As the leader, I aimed
for first place, but

987
00:50:43,869 --> 00:50:47,236
our performance didn't
match my confidence,

988
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:48,715
which is really disappointing.

989
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:50,059
Whithout regrets.

990
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:50,859
Cheerfully.

991
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:52,469
- Cheerfully.
- Cheerfully.

992
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:54,769
Because it was again very
disappointing this time,

993
00:50:54,769 --> 00:51:00,103
I hope we can show
a better stage next time.

994
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:02,803
(The very act of persevering without
giving up, that was hip-hop)

995
00:51:02,803 --> 00:51:04,769
(The stage that marked the beginning
of Baggy Jeans team's story)

996
00:51:05,336 --> 00:51:07,936
(Which team is preparing for the next stage?)
Next team, please come to the stage.

completely different people.

- The teamwork is great. - Thank you.

1020
00:51:50,928 --> 00:51:54,528
I'm curious why and how KAI chose

1021
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,061
these team members.

1022
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:03,094
Each of our team members
has their own unique style

1023
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,528
and charisma, so I chose them.

1024
00:52:07,784 --> 00:52:10,976
So, in the surprise mission,
KAI picked the members,

1025
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,208
and currently, HYO is the leader, right?

1026
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:15,456
(He formed the team)
KAI gathered all the members,

1027
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:17,632
(but failed to become the leader)
but in the end, you didn't become the leader, right?

1028
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,904
KAI, didn't you want to be the leader?

1029
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,824
Actually, I thought HYO had
the leader vibe, so I chose him.

1030
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:29,376
Then among the charismatic members,
he's the most charismatic one, huh?

1031
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:30,496
(KAI's pick, the charisma of charisma)
I think so.

1032
00:52:30,656 --> 00:52:35,480
(KAI's big picture included the leader role)
That's quite a grand plan.

1033
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:38,684
Was there any difficulty
practicing with that in mind?

1034
00:52:39,328 --> 00:52:45,184
(How was the practice process for them?)
We're the members KAI picked...

1035
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:50,017
(On the first day of practice)
We're the number one, let's work hard!

1036
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:53,696
Let's watch and assign parts.

1037
00:52:53,696 --> 00:52:54,240
Okay.

1038
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,288
(Intense rap opening)

1039
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:01,655
(This part's so tempting)

1040
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:05,555
Wow, this part is really cool.

1041
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:08,719
(Eyes locked)

1042
00:53:11,695 --> 00:53:14,799
(Choreography creation section)

1043
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:23,288
(What did we just see?)
- What is that? - In just three days...

1044
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:27,251
(And even a dopamine-boosting
high note section)

1045
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:29,992
(I'm really craving it)

1046
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:36,245
Later, KAI told me that
he watched my audition video

1047
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:38,712
and thought my vocal was good

1048
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:41,579
and I could take charge of
the vocal for this song.

1049
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:45,212
Thank you so much for choosing
me after hearing my vocal.

1050
00:53:45,845 --> 00:53:50,845
I won't let you down.
Let's stay together till the end.

1051
00:53:51,245 --> 00:53:53,812
- By the way, every part is cool.
- Right.

1052
00:53:54,112 --> 00:53:57,245
(So many parts I want)
It's full of tempting parts.

1053
00:53:57,445 --> 00:54:02,112
Like an audition, let's call out
the parts we want and decide.

1054
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:09,875
♪I'm a mystery, check that, check that,
go ask the world and check that♪

1055
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:12,339
(Presenting the pass necklace)
Nice.

1056
00:54:12,595 --> 00:54:15,912
(Challenge of vocal applicants)
♪Raise question, question, question marks in everywhere♪

1057
00:54:15,912 --> 00:54:20,288
(Reaching high pitch)
♪I engrave myself endlessly and bloom anew♪

1058
00:54:20,288 --> 00:54:21,845
(Satisfied)
Wow!

1059
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:24,145
I think LI ZHIWEI can handle
the high notes better.

1060
00:54:24,645 --> 00:54:28,312
(Smoothest part distribution ever)
HAECHAN's part goes to LI ZHIWEI.

1061
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:31,845
The team's balance is
way better than expected.

1062
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:35,279
Both in rap and vocal,

1063
00:54:35,512 --> 00:54:41,612
KAI picked the team with
the overall completeness in mind,

1064
00:54:42,163 --> 00:54:45,427
(KAI had it all planned out)
so it's no surprise we're the top team.

1065
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:47,411
(And the infamous choreography creation)
Then, let's try creating the choreography.

1066
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:48,339
Yes, understood.

1067
00:54:48,595 --> 00:54:50,451
(Most members lack choreography experience)
It's really just about having ideas.

1068
00:54:50,451 --> 00:54:51,059
Yes.

1069
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:51,955
Let's try it once.

1070
00:54:52,812 --> 00:54:58,078
Actually, even someone creating
for the first time today can do well.

1071
00:54:58,078 --> 00:55:02,445
So let's each come up with a bit of
choreography for about 15 minutes.

1072
00:55:02,963 --> 00:55:05,843
(Each member presents
their original choreography)

1073
00:55:06,451 --> 00:55:08,435
(1. KAI's created choreography)

1074
00:55:10,547 --> 00:55:12,499
(2. HYO's created choreography)

1075
00:55:14,419 --> 00:55:17,011
(3. KIM JEONGHOON's
created choreography)

1076
00:55:18,216 --> 00:55:20,776
(Next B:GINNERs' original choreography?)
Actually, like this...

1077
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:23,272
We need to get the posture!

1078
00:55:23,784 --> 00:55:25,960
(Some kind of busy preparing posture)
LI ZHIWEI, please sit down like this.

1079
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,464
I sat down.

1080
00:55:27,464 --> 00:55:28,104
Who is...

1081
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:29,288
Sit down, sit.

1082
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:30,056
Just a moment.

1083
00:55:30,056 --> 00:55:30,760
How is it? How is it?

1084
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,776
(Mysterious big heart)
It's done, it's done, it's done.

1085
00:55:32,776 --> 00:55:33,608
How is it?

1086
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:35,240
Is this choreography?

1087
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:36,616
(Choreography title: Heart of Apology)

1088
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:37,128
Why can't you see it?

1089
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:37,800
Heart of Apology.

1090
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,208
(Randomly breaks into song)
♪Check the facts, go check that♪

1091
00:55:39,432 --> 00:55:41,160
♪Check the facts, go check that♪

1092
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,832
What's that?

1093
00:55:41,832 --> 00:55:44,488
(This can't be real)
What is this?

1094
00:55:45,224 --> 00:55:48,936
(Why did they send a Heart of Apology...?)
This is the first time my mind's gone blank.

1095
00:55:48,936 --> 00:55:50,088
Please.

1096
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:54,088
(Blank...)

1097
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:59,254
It takes me a week just
to learn choreography.

1098
00:55:59,254 --> 00:56:01,654
I genuinely couldn't think of anything.

1099
00:56:01,672 --> 00:56:04,808
(Decided to apologize in advance)
That's when I started thinking about apologizing.

1100
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,416
(Internal conflict on the first day)
We are a team, aren't we?

1101
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:10,536
(The guilty have no words)
We're not about to fight, right?

1102
00:56:10,536 --> 00:56:11,368
Is this a troublemaker showdown?

1103
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,968
Everything you said is right.

1104
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:16,187
Shall the three of us then
create choreography together?

1105
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:17,320
Shall we keep learning the choreography?

1106
00:56:17,928 --> 00:56:18,888
I'm confident in learning it.

1107
00:56:19,624 --> 00:56:20,456
(Epic 3v3 teamwork for the win)
Fighting.

1108
00:56:20,456 --> 00:56:21,160
Okay.

1109
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:27,354
Shall we start by thinking about
which movements match charisma?

1110
00:56:27,808 --> 00:56:28,744
Glance?

1111
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:33,254
Actions that show
expressions well, like...

1112
00:56:33,254 --> 00:56:34,354
Shall we cover our mouths once?

1113
00:56:34,888 --> 00:56:37,672
(JEONGHOON copying KAI's move)
Like this.

1114
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:39,208
(Nice)
Use the expression like this.

1115
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:40,387
Oh, cool.

1116
00:56:40,387 --> 00:56:41,928
Let's stop the move here.

1117
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,048
You hit it like this...

1118
00:56:43,144 --> 00:56:44,296
(Ideas added one by one)
How about like this?

1119
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:46,687
It's good to do it this way.

1120
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:48,776
After the one, two, the move will follow.

1121
00:56:49,032 --> 00:56:50,152
- Then, you...
- Oh, it's nice.

1122
00:56:50,632 --> 00:56:51,400
I think this is better.

1123
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:56,787
Everyone had surprisingly
creative ideas, so I think

1124
00:56:56,787 --> 00:56:59,354
we managed to choreograph
something satisfying.

1125
00:56:59,354 --> 00:57:06,387
The team is doing even
better than I expected,

1126
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:11,187
so with enough practice, I think
we can put on a great performance.

1127
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,808
(Mid-check)
Charisma Team, back straight.

1128
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:14,216
(Fact Check Team stepping up boldly)
Let's get it.

1129
00:57:14,216 --> 00:57:15,400
Let's go.

1130
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,680
Okay.

1131
00:57:16,987 --> 00:57:18,621
(Surprise Mission 1st Place)
It's the team with B:GINNER KAI.

1132
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:20,168
(The masters' interest is on KAI)
He's the fifth one in the row.

1133
00:57:20,168 --> 00:57:24,454
KAI, you came in first in
the surprise mission, right?

1134
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:25,000
Yes.

1135
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:26,792
How did you feel back then?

1136
00:57:26,984 --> 00:57:30,376
I thought we could make a legendary team.

1137
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:33,160
(The masters' expectations
have risen even higher)

1138
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,184
He's confident.

1139
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,720
Shall we take a look then?

1140
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,904
Okay, good.

1141
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,872

1149
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:23,821
(Hesitant to speak out)

1150
00:58:25,388 --> 00:58:26,376
You did work hard!

1151
00:58:26,888 --> 00:58:27,816
You've worked hard.

1152
00:58:27,816 --> 00:58:29,480
To be honest, I might've
expected too much

1153
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:32,232
since you guys were
kind of the top team.

1154
00:58:32,584 --> 00:58:34,536
That thought did cross
my mind while watching.

1155
00:58:34,536 --> 00:58:36,552
Honestly, I felt a bit disappointed.
As I had such high expectations

1156
00:58:36,552 --> 00:58:38,632
(Fell short of masters' expectations)
since you guys were the top team,

1157
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,712
but there were quite a few
things that felt lacking.

1158
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:45,921
You should bring a charismatic energy
that really matches this music.

1159
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:48,520
Looks like you really need to
prepare properly, everyone.

1160
00:58:49,888 --> 00:58:52,552
(The choreography class continues)
Let's start with our Charisma Team...

1161
00:58:53,288 --> 00:58:54,888
Your team concept is "charisma", right?

1162
00:58:54,888 --> 00:58:55,304
Right.

1163
00:58:55,304 --> 00:58:55,816
Right.

1164
00:58:56,168 --> 00:58:58,216
(But)
Why does this team lack charisma?

1165
00:58:58,216 --> 00:59:00,392
While watching, I kept wondering

1166
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,240
(Critique on lacking charisma)
why there was no charisma.

1167
00:59:04,872 --> 00:59:05,768
It's like

1168
00:59:05,768 --> 00:59:07,080
cute little kittens

1169
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,024
trying to act like tigers, right?

1170
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,528
So I feel like you really need

1171
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:13,864
to think, "I am a real tiger."

1172
00:59:13,928 --> 00:59:14,856
- Right.
- Right.

1173
00:59:16,254 --> 00:59:20,154
(From us)
I realized how much charisma we lacked.

1174
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:25,454
It made us question if we are
able to pull off this concept,

1175
00:59:25,454 --> 00:59:28,328
which caused doubts and worries.

1176
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:33,512
(The day after the check)
Yesterday, we got feedback

1177
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:35,848
from our masters for the first time,

1178
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:37,954
and they said our biggest problem

1179
00:59:37,954 --> 00:59:42,588
was not showing enough charisma.

1180
00:59:42,632 --> 00:59:43,368
That's true.

1181
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:48,104
But honestly, does anyone

1182
00:59:48,621 --> 00:59:49,154
really know

1183
00:59:49,154 --> 00:59:52,154
what "charisma" means?

1184
00:59:52,232 --> 00:59:53,064
(Probably none)
No.

1185
00:59:54,568 --> 00:59:55,496
What should I say?

1186
00:59:56,296 --> 00:59:57,640
(Perfect chance to look it up)
Shall we check out

1187
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,240
what it means?

1188
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,288
If we know exactly...

1189
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,554
Oh, really?

1190
01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:04,872
It's quite different, huh?

1191
01:00:05,128 --> 01:00:07,784
(A captivating charm)
Charisma is the ability to captivate...

1192
01:00:08,424 --> 01:00:09,320
A captivating charm?

1193
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:10,504
Captivating...

1194
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:13,736
I don't think charisma means

1195
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:14,721
(Newly discovered definition of charisma)
always frowning

1196
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:16,392
or looking tough.

1197
01:00:16,392 --> 01:00:17,192
More than I thought.

1198
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:18,587
Let's check out

1199
01:00:18,587 --> 01:00:21,896
how the senior NCT members
show charisma.

1200
01:00:22,336 --> 01:00:23,196
Alright.

1201
01:00:28,072 --> 01:00:30,024
(An expression full of composure)

1202
01:00:30,521 --> 01:00:32,021
(On the verge of being
sucked into the screen)

1203
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:38,024
(Piercing gazes breaking
through the screen)

1204
01:00:38,056 --> 01:00:39,112
(Continuous admiration)

1205
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,136
It is.

1206
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:40,808
It's different.

1207
01:00:40,808 --> 01:00:42,554
(Senior NCT members captivated them)

1208
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:45,621
They completely blend into this song.

1209
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:51,554
Their expressions and gestures show
they are cool, and different from ours.

1210
01:00:51,554 --> 01:00:54,121
They completely blend into this song.

1211
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,821
I felt that we have to express charisma.

1212
01:00:56,968 --> 01:00:58,184
(To find our unique charisma)
Let's practice hard.

1213
01:00:58,184 --> 01:00:59,272
- Right.
- Right.

1214
01:00:59,272 --> 01:01:02,632
Fighting, charisma team!

1215
01:01:02,984 --> 01:01:06,080
(Charisma special training starts)
- Hey, okay. - Keep it up.

1216
01:01:07,016 --> 01:01:07,912
Let's do it just once.

1217
01:01:08,488 --> 01:01:08,808
Okay.

1218
01:01:08,808 --> 01:01:10,216
(Charisma Boot Camp 1, Performance Check)
Okay, please take a look.

1219
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:11,944
Seven, eight.

1220
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:21,787
Align the timing after you've
finished all the steps.

1221
01:01:24,424 --> 01:01:25,064
Again.

1222
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:32,616
(Success)

1223
01:01:34,408 --> 01:01:37,921
(Then the next move)
One, two, three, four.

1224
01:01:38,088 --> 01:01:40,616
Five, six, seven.

1225
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:41,640
- Eight.
- Stop.

1226
01:01:41,704 --> 01:01:42,216
Stop.

1227
01:01:42,287 --> 01:01:44,021
(Why this time?)

1228
01:01:44,254 --> 01:01:47,387
There are people who just stretch out
like this, and others who push like this.

1229
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:48,424
The feeling of pushing?

1230
01:01:49,064 --> 01:01:51,016
- You gotta push.
- Push from this position.

1231
01:01:51,121 --> 01:01:56,821
To show charisma, we need to coordinate
the choreography well as a team

1232
01:01:56,821 --> 01:02:01,321
and make sure each person
can focus on their own part.

1233
01:02:01,654 --> 01:02:04,621
(Recording with the camera)
After that, we'll film with the camera.

1234
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:11,368
(Details gradually coming together)
So if you do A part, it's this move?

1235
01:02:12,168 --> 01:02:13,576
(Fully motivated)
We can sync the moves even better.

1236
01:02:13,928 --> 01:02:16,104
How should this hand be like?

1237
01:02:16,104 --> 01:02:17,992
How should we do this hand?

1238
01:02:17,992 --> 01:02:18,984
Should we touch the face like this?

1239
01:02:18,984 --> 01:02:21,544
(Everyone is sincere about details)
Let's go.

1240
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:22,504
Stop here.

1241
01:02:23,688 --> 01:02:25,544
(If it doesn't work, keep
trying until it does)

1242

(Staggering)

1243
01:02:28,296 --> 01:02:29,064
I think it will work.

1244
01:02:30,024 --> 01:02:31,921
(Endless repetition, legs
gradually loosening up)

1245
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:34,587
Since we're singing while dancing,

1246
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:38,454
it's really tough to keep up
the energy until the song ends.

1247
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,754

it exactly as we imagined.

Practice slowly but keep
gestures and expressions sharp.

Consider how to show it.

HYO did it well.

1376

Why are they cute? They're cute.

1377
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,552
Great job.

(Scream)

1379
01:09:53,576 --> 01:09:55,176
That was pure charisma.

1380
01:09:55,176 --> 01:09:56,424
The choreography was perfectly in sync.

1381
01:09:57,064 --> 01:09:57,896
(The masters are satisfied, too)

1382
01:09:57,896 --> 01:09:59,112
Oh, the ending was good.

1383
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,072
Well done.

1384
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:04,173
It really looked like a performance
that showed great teamwork.

1385
01:10:04,173 --> 01:10:05,896
(Acknowledged)
I could tell they practiced a lot.

1386
01:10:06,696 --> 01:10:09,640
Now I'm curious to hear
what NCT thought.

1387
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:11,048
(Their evaluation of the performance)
Could we hear your thoughts?

1388
01:10:11,688 --> 01:10:15,106
As I was watching, one thing
immediately came to my mind.

1389
01:10:15,106 --> 01:10:16,744
As expected, it's the charisma team.

1390
01:10:16,744 --> 01:10:18,312
As expected, it's the charisma team.

1391
01:10:21,448 --> 01:10:22,376
You did well.

1392
01:10:23,336 --> 01:10:25,544
(Even the masters couldn't stop smiling)
They really said they had charisma.

1393
01:10:25,544 --> 01:10:26,728
- Wow, that's high praise.
- They finally heard it.

1394
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:33,832
They said we had a lot
of charisma this time.

1395
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,592
I was honestly so happy.

1396
01:10:35,592 --> 01:10:38,728
(Finally solved the unsolvable problem)
It was like they told us,

1397
01:10:38,728 --> 01:10:41,320
"You've finally solved it."

1398
01:10:41,406 --> 01:10:43,973
Maybe it means they pulled off
their own interpretation well?

1399
01:10:43,976 --> 01:10:48,673
(One with a different vibe from NCT)
You interpreted it in your unique way.

1400
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:52,440
You guys really nailed the details,

1401
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,573
knowing when to add a touch
and when to pull back.

1403
01:10:57,384 --> 01:11:00,936
Every single move was so precise,
with angles all carefully refined.

1404
01:11:00,936 --> 01:11:02,376
I really want to praise that.

1405
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:05,352
(The teamwork stood out a lot)
I got a strong impression that

1406
01:11:05,352 --> 01:11:06,664
your teamwork was really good.

1407
01:11:07,144 --> 01:11:12,392
Seeing you perform with confidence
was great, and it's beyond just skill.

1408
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:16,273
You guys pulled it off so well,
and I genuinely enjoyed watching it.

1409
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:17,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1410
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,040
I think we were able to express
everything we wanted

1411
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,673
because we had loyalty to each other.

1412
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,720
It felt like we were all in it
together until the end.

1413

I'm really thankful and so happy.

1416
01:11:42,623 --> 01:11:44,320
let's watch the next team's stage.

1417
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:45,389
(Old school, sexy and powerful)
Go for it.

1418
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,592
I think this team will do the best.

1419
01:11:46,592 --> 01:11:48,032
I can't wait to see your performance.

1420
01:11:48,032 --> 01:11:49,280
(Feeling nervous)
I feel nervous watching them perform.

1421
01:11:49,366 --> 01:11:50,560
Hope they do well.

1422
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,872
(A performance with elimination at stake)
Let's keep it up.

1423
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:52,744
We've got to do well.

1424
01:11:52,753 --> 01:11:54,359
At this rate, nobody's going
to make it to the stage.

1425
01:11:54,621 --> 01:11:56,832
(The struggles along the way)
Loving the way.

1426
01:11:56,832 --> 01:11:58,784
Touch me, tease me, feel me up.

1427
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,576
I told you not to turn this way.

1428
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:02,065
(Their practice is a total mess?)

1429
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:02,880
Sorry.

1430
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,952
The same details, the same
feedback, and the same mistakes.

1431
01:12:05,952 --> 01:12:08,000
I just felt a bit frustrated.

1432
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,688
You have to push yourself
to the absolute limit in practice.

1433
01:12:10,688 --> 01:12:13,088
I felt like you guys weren't familiar
with how to practice properly.

1434
01:12:13,088 --> 01:12:14,560
I feel like I struggled a lot.

1435

(Will B:GINNERS break
down under the pressure?)

1436
01:12:19,392 --> 01:12:21,248
Even so, I made up my mind to succeed.

1437
01:12:21,248 --> 01:12:22,240
Let's keep it up.

1438
01:12:23,232 --> 01:12:24,928
(Put everything into it)

1439
01:12:25,856 --> 01:12:28,070
Who knew he had this kind of charm?

1440
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,847
(The real thing begins now)

1441
01:12:32,654 --> 01:12:34,432
(We are, indeed, YOUR BOYZ)

1442
01:12:34,752 --> 01:12:37,088
Alright, time to show this side as well.

1443
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:40,944
Their energy just spiked.

1444
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,192
Wow, they're killing it.

01:12:44,672 --> 01:12:46,304
Good, good.

1446
01:12:46,304 --> 01:12:49,728
All the B:GINNERS picked as
NCT's top picks will survive.

1447
01:12:49,728 --> 01:12:50,944

Please, please.

1450
01:12:54,112 --> 01:12:56,928
The B:GINNER who will
be eliminated is...

1451
01:12:58,828 --> 01:13:00,704
I hoped it wasn't the reality.

1452
01:13:00,704 --> 01:13:01,952
I thought I might get eliminated.

1453
01:13:01,952 --> 01:13:03,520
This program is truly merciless.

1454
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,096
(What will the results
of B:GINNERS' first round be?)
