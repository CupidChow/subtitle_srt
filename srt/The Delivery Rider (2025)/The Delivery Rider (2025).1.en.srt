1
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,546
Here's the order.

2
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,051
Merry Christmas to you.

3
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,678
Take care.

4
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,765
Hey, Santo!

5
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,977
- Santo! Santo! Santo!
- Santo! Santo! Santo!

6
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,522
- Papa! Papa!
- Papa! Papa!

7
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,149
- Santo! Santo!
- Santo! Santo!

8
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,371
Hey, Santo.

9
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,707
Did the heavens tell you
it will rain today?

10
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,669
Don't you see how sunny it is.

11
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,963
It's so hot!

12
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,590
Santo, you're insane!

13
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,592
You're the man!

14
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,052
He's crazy.

15
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,638
- Let's go.
- I'll go ahead!

16
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,134
Here's your order.

17
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,553
Hi. Thank you!

18
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:05,560
For your next delivery,
use the coupon code ODM25

19
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,855
for a special Christmas treat
from Ondamove.

20
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,940
Okay.

21
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,943
Picture, please.

22
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,202
Thank you, ma'am.

23
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,670
Hey, Santo!

24
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,051
Santo, let's spar.

25
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,264
Your delivery's here.

26
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,892
What a coincidence, you got my order.

27
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,228
Wait for me.

28
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,278
You haven't been here for a month.

29
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,157
You're enjoying being a rider
a little too much.

30
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,285
I'll come by this Thursday.

31
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,124
Coach, proof of delivery.

32
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,545
Coach, is this Santo?
The guy you said was special?

33
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,215
Yes. This is Santo.

34
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,010
His father used to be my coach.
There, see?

35
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,346
He was a champion.

36
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,644
Santo used to be a sweeper here.

37
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:36,066
But during the pandemic,
he found a job as a delivery rider.

38
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,487
He enjoys riding the motorcycle.
Plus, the pay is better.

39
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,991
Let's do that later, Santo.

40
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,201
You can come back here.

41
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,996
I'll find you an opponent
and you'll earn well.

42
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,497
Don't waste your talent.

43
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,334
I've been trying out for so long,
you haven't given me a match.

44
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,044
But you'll do that for him?

45
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,796
Hold on. How about...

46
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,173
you spar... with Santo?

47
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,342
Game!

48
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,554
- Coach, proof of delivery. Picture.
- Go, Santo! Fight!

49
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,016
Later, Santo. Let's do this first.

50
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,601
Do this fight. I keep bragging about you.

51
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,770
You can do it, Santo.

52
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,940
- You can do it!
- Your stance!

53
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,151
Raise your arms!

54
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,530
- Go, Santo!
- Fight, Santo!

55
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,456
Santo, you can do it. Stand up!

56
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,876
Fight!

57
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,545
Santo, fight him!

58
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,255
Fight!

59
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,556
Will this guy fight back?
You said he's good.

60
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,891
Santo, get up.

61
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,184
He's a wimp!

62
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,477
Santo, get up.

63
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,978
Get up, Santo! Get up!

64
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,896
Fight!

65
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,898
Come on!

66
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,233
Coach?

67
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,485
- What now?
- Why not move?

68
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,903
Will you fight?

69
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,614
- Fight me then!
- Arms up!

70
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,491
Wimp!

71
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,130
Santo, get up!

72
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,299
Fight!

73
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,262
When someone picks on you,
use all that I taught you.

74
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,682
The world isn't kind to people like you.

75
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,976
If they hurt you,

76
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,812
fight back!

77
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,733
If they hurt you,

78
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,860
fight back!

79
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,821
Punch!

80
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>Observe your opponent!</i>

81
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,461
Watch my movements.

82
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,839
Predict my move.

83
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,592
Jab! Straight!

84
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,987
Choke him!

85
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,873
<i>I can't be there for you your whole life.</i>

86
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,503
Your mother gave up on you.

87
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,839
She left us.

88
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,731
You have to be strong.

89
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,904
You need to keep going
even if you're like that.

90
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,418
Go on!

91
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,382
That's it!

92
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,219
That was fast!

93
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,971
Great job!

94
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,858
Got him!

95
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,693
Go on!

96
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,238
Slam him!

97
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,909
That's it, go on!

98
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,328
Don't let go of him!

99
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,497
Go on!

100
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,797
Time out!

101
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,757
<i>Father.</i>

102
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,386
Father!

103
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,638
- Father!
- Santo, what's happening?

104
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,683
- Father!
- Santo!

105
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,767
Father!

106
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,935
- Father!
- Jowell?

107
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,437
Father!

108
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,522
Stop.

109
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,191
Stop!

110
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,569
He's done for.

111
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,405
- Go!
- Go on!

112
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,532
- That's it!
- Great job!

113
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,867
Santo, you're the best!

114
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,621
I told you!

115
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,291
He's a great MMA fighter
even though he's autistic

116
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:49,421
because people like him can focus
and anticipate the opponent's moves.

117
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,381
Coach, this kid is good!

118
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,217
This kid is good!

119
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,180
You're so good, Santo!

120
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,684
He's so good.
His opponent was no match for him.

121
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,247
- Hey, Santo!
- Santo.

122
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,585
Thank you very much.

123
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,129
Aunty Maring!

124
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,005
Hey!

125
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,633
Santo!

126
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,968
How was your day?

127
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,345
It was okay.

128
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,014
Very good, you stayed dry.

129
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,977
Remember, do not let your sweat
dry up on your back.

130
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,063
Okay.

131
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:54,612
I always get a gift from you
every Christmas.

132
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,782
Thank you!

133
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,706
Thank you! I'll go ahead.

134
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,543
I'll go ahead, Aunty Maring.

135
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,613
You came right on time.
Let's eat. Come on.

136
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,073
How was the hospital today?

137
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,785
As usual, we had a lot of patients.

138
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,372
It was tiring,
but of course I can handle it!

139
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,791
Daddy Santo!

140
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,421
I have a surprise for you.

141
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,464
Wow!

142
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,424
I'll eat this later.

143
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,468
I also have a surprise for you.

144
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,970
- Really?
- A new move.

145
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,138
That's great!

146
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,431
One more!

147
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,225
That's enough. You might get hurt!

148
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,062
Miro, you just had a bath.

149
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,607
Hold on. Dad, wait.

150
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,358
Dad, hold on.

151
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,068
Hold on.

152
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,781
Is your rating on Ondamove
still five stars?

153
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,582
You know what?

154
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,709
Too bad you missed seeing me

155
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,212
- fight at the gym.
- What?

156
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,671
I did great.

157
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,089
I wish you had seen it.

158
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,799
Really? You fought someone?

159
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,344
You didn't take me with you, you cheater.

160
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,888
- What do you mean "cheater"?
- I was great.

161
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,016
I don't like the words coming out of you.

162
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,519
Hey, come on, stop that guys.

163
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,645
Stop that!

164
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,938
You're stinky!

165
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,814
I just took a bath!

166
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,694
- I just took a bath.
- See, you're stinky again. Come let's eat.

167
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,156
You should stop spending on us.

168
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,243
Didn't I tell you to save money?

169
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,247
You don't have to worry about Miro and me.

170
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,419
Two months, three days

171
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,257
and one hour since you came here.

172
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,592
That's right.

173
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,886
You're no bother.

174
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,598
I know, but what I'm saying is...

175
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,434
I've got a surprise for you two.

176
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,311
What is it, Dad?

177
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,983
We're going to a theme park on New Year!

178
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,693
Yay!

179
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,944
Really, Dad?

180
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:27,073
Yes. We've been wanting to go
for a long time, right?

181
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,077
I'm excited to ride a roller coaster!

182
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,831
- I'm so excited.
- 'Cause it gets interrupted.

183
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,752
Nichelle, remember, when we were kids,
we dreamed we'd go there?

184
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,047
Now, we're doing it.

185
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,343
I want to go now, Dad.

186
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:53,349
Santo, we need to talk later, okay?
I just need to tell you something.

187
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,394
- I want to go now.
- Okay.

188
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,106
Have some more.

189
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,321
Here, for your household expenses.

190
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,324
I don't need it.

191
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,911
You know I won't take no for an answer.

192
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,205
Just take it. Don't be stubborn.

193
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,042
All right.

194
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,544
I'm going to use it for...

195
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,545
New Year's eve feast.

196
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,631
Don't do that!

197
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,050
Save it.

198
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,219
You need it.

199
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,099
You'll need it once Miro and I leave.

200
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,937
You're leaving?

201
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,650
Santo, I've accepted the offer
in New York.

202
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,737
We're leaving right after New Year.

203
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,497
Santo, did you hear what I said?

204
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,002
After New Year,

205
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:07,257
you will leave. On January 1,
you will go to New York and live there.

206
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,808
Santo, I'm sorry
I couldn't tell you sooner.

207
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,478
Will you be all right?

208
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,900
Will you be with Bernard?

209
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,074
Yes.

210
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,246
Don't you worry.
Nichelle asked me to look after you.

211
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,291
I'll take care of you
just like before, okay?

212
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,506
Santo, listen to me carefully.

213
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,383
Always take care of yourself,

214
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,013
especially when you're doing
your deliveries.

215
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,060
You've memorized
all your emergency contacts, haven't you?

216
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,982
Don't forget them, okay?

217
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,116
Dad, let's eat.

218
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,536
Come on.

219
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,293
Dad, come eat.

220
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,046
Dad.

221
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,802
Miro...

222
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,596
come here.

223
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,518
Son, let's eat first.

224
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,105
Give Santo some space, okay?

225
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:32,194
You know he won't stop
until he finishes something he's started.

226
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,743
Happy New Year.

227
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,430
Thank you for choosing Ondamove.

228
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:08,146
On your next delivery,
use the coupon code ODM31.

229
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:14,236
You'll receive a special New Year treat
from Ondamove.

230
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,199
Can I take a picture?

231
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,211
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

232
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,933
Hey, come in.

233
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,311
Daddy Santo.

234
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,063
- Nichelle?
- Yes?

235
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:56,361
You're leaving later.
Can I take Miro with men now?

236
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,742
We'll go to Timezone, then to the mall,
then we'll eat ice cream.

237
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,622
Promise, by 5:00 pm, we'll be back here.

238
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,208
I want to go, Mom.

239
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,542
It's too dangerous now.

240
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,004
A lot of people
are lighting fireworks in the streets.

241
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,298
You can play here, at home.

242
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:23,180
And, son, I already promised your father
that we'll visit your grandmother.

243
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:28,810
Mom, it's already our last day here,
but you still won't let us go out.

244
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:34,565
It's not that I don't want to,
but I already promised your father.

245
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,860
Why won't you just let me go?

246
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,447
You've already said that, Miro.
Your grandmother is expecting us.

247
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,909
How do I explain it if we don't visit?

248
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,203
You're the only one
who wants to move there.

249
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,288
Maybe you should go by yourself.

250
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,292
Just leave me here with Daddy Santo.

251
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,087
Miro!

252
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,188
Hey! Miro!

253
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,275
- Daddy!
- What are you doing here?

254
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,780
I have a loaded Timezone card.
We can play there, Dad!

255
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,491
We can also eat ice cream!

256
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,130
- Wow!
- Wow!

257
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:51,643
- Yay! I'm first!
- I'm second.

258
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,108
- 2,000! Amazing!
- Wow!

259
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,819
You're good!

260
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,327
Dad, lift me up so I can win this.

261
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,460
- Yes! Champion!
- Yes!

262
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,544
Let's strike this one here.

263
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:22,965
- Yes! High five!
- High five, Dad.

264
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,384
There's more!

265
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,311
Do you still want to play?
Mine's still got credit.

266
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,913
I still wanna play!

267
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,588
Dad, let's play this.

268
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,593
- Yes!
- 500!

269
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:13,099
- I won a lot, Dad! It keeps going.
- Wow!

270
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,145
- Wow!
- We got so many tickets, Dad.

271
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:34,079
Dad, why can't you come with us
to America?

272
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,500
I'll miss you, for sure.

273
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,003
How will you live without us?

274
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:52,222
Dad, you can tell Mom
that I don't want to go with her.

275
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,438
Dad... won't you miss me?

276
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,451
Of course I'll miss you.

277
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,416
You know what?

278
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:26,214
When I first met you, you were this small.
You were like a doll.

279
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,926
But now,

280
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,681
you're this big.

281
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,851
You've gotten so heavy.

282
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,231
Your mother said

283
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,109
that the schools are better there.

284
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,404
Don't you want that?

285
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,033
You'll also be with your real dad.

286
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,078
Dad...

287
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,416
you're my only father.

288
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,837
You are my only father.

289
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,805
No one else.

290
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,357
Don't cry anymore, Dad.

291
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:41,623
Dad, even when I'm in America,
you need to keep your five stars, okay?

292
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,046
And you, once you're in America,
don't get bullied, okay?

293
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,883
If they hurt you, fight back!

294
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,970
Fight back!

295
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,432
Dad, let's take a picture
so you won't forget me.

296
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,113
Dad, let me see.

297
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,365
Oh, no, I accepted an order.

298
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,575
- Oh, no.
- It's okay, I can cancel it.

299
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,703
No, Dad. Don't!

300
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,039
You might lose your five stars.

301
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:29,337
Let's just deliver this together.

302
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,466
What's his order?

303
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,635
Let's go.

304
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,659
After this delivery, let's go home.

305
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,914
Your mother might get mad at us.
We need to be home by 5:00 pm.

306
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,209
You hand the delivery over, okay?

307
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,545
Yes, Dad.

308
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,309
What the... Who is this guy?

309
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,811
Hey, stop!

310
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,230
What are you doing here?

311
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,026
Ondamove delivery for Ben Marquez, sir.

312
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,779
That idiot!
He actually ordered a delivery!

313
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,864
Give him this.

314
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,409
- Delivery, sir.
- Fine, give that to me.

315
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,453
Okay. Leave!

316
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,704
That's 240 pesos, sir.

317
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,831
Not paid yet?

318
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,791
Cash on delivery, sir.

319
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,667
That's cash on delivery.

320
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,836
Fine then, wait here. I'll be back.

321
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,381
- Cash on delivery, sir.
- Cash on delivery.

322
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,175
Stay here. I'll be back!

323
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,806
Dad, let's follow him.
He might make a run for it.

324
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,225
He said to wait here.

325
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:10,355
Dad, let's follow him.
He might not come back with our money.

326
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,900
- Okay.
- Let's go.

327
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,491
That moron, Ben.
Why did he book a delivery now?

328
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,285
Hey!

329
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,038
Didn't I tell you to stay there?
Why did you follow me?

330
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,290
Cash on delivery, sir. 240 pesos.

331
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,043
Listen, go wait there
while I get your money.

332
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,297
- I'll come back.
- Cash on delivery. 240 pesos.

333
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,384
Unbelievable. Here, I'll pay for it.
Take this.

334
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,469
- Leave now.
- Here's your change.

335
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,554
Keep it.

336
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,723
Just keep it and leave.

337
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,893
Go away now. Hurry up.

338
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,854
Picture, please.

339
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,025
We're done, already. It's paid!

340
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,320
Come on, sir. It'll be quick.

341
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,865
- Quickly!
- Here you go.

342
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,662
What the heck? Who is that?

343
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,456
Thanks for choosing Ondamove.

344
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,791
Dimwit! Follow him!

345
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,461
- What are you waiting for? Get him!
- Follow them!

346
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,715
...ODM31 for a 10% discount.

347
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,926
Brother, go ahead.
Lana is waiting for you.

348
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,222
I'll take care of this freaking rider.
Just go.

349
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,314
- That can be used as evidence.
- Yes, brother.

350
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,942
Don't just stand there, move!

351
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,616
Make sure there's no evidence left.

352
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,138
Dad, what was that?

353
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,182
Did they shoot that man?

354
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,189
Dad, hurry, we might get killed here.

355
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,359
- Hey!
- Come back here!

356
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,446
Relax, Miro. Just hold on!

357
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,782
Hey!

358
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,076
Come back here!

359
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,661
Go after them!

360
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,830
There! Faster!

361
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,642
Dad, faster!

362
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,530
Hurry up!

363
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,867
Boss, we couldn't find him.

364
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,494
Shit! You're all idiots!

365
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,247
Check all the exits,
down here and up there.

366
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,832
What are you waiting for?

367
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,749
Yes, boss.

368
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,294
- Let's go!
- Shit!

369
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,506
You want to play, huh?

370
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,552
You idiot. Just wait until I catch you.

371
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,643
Dad, it's blocked! Let's go this way.

372
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,812
Hey!

373
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,346
You idiot!
I won't lose to someone like you!

374
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,559
Lucky bastard!

375
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,059
Miro.

376
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,269
Miro?

377
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,398
Miro?

378
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,274
Miro!

379
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,317
Miro, wake up!

380
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,154
Miro!

381
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,156
Miro, wake up!

382
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,033
Your mother will get mad.

383
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,869
Your mother will get mad!

384
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,622
Miro, wake up!

385
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,422
You idiot.

386
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,369
Boss, we need to go back.

387
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,126
Why?

388
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,629
Your brother...

389
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,464
was killed.

390
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,887
Shit, bro. To hell with Marco.

391
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:02,557
If it were me, I'd blow his brains out
after beating the crap out of him.

392
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,850
Like this!

393
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,145
Arnel, not everything can be solved
using brute force.

394
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,897
We'll reach our goal.

395
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,151
We'll get our family's money back in full.

396
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,320
Brute force? I just can't wait, brother.

397
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:19,574
I'm going to beat that bastard
once I meet him.

398
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:23,495
That freaking asshole.
He wants to be a state witness?

399
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,622
I can't believe that bastard!

400
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,667
If I were you, I'd burry him alive.

401
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,087
I'm excited, brother. Where is he?

402
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,381
Are we there, yet?

403
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,884
You know what? If Dad were still alive,

404
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:41,430
he'd have hit you already
for being such a hothead.

405
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,060
- Excuse me.
- Okay, brother.

406
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,728
- Hello, Lana.
- I'll practice.

407
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,356
Yes, of course.

408
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,235
Okay, Lana.

409
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,070
Shit!

410
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,363
I can take this one.

411
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,031
Perfect timing, bro.

412
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,992
I'll take care of the rest.

413
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,454
I'll kill him, just like you taught me.
Like this!

414
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,459
He wants to play,

415
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,795
so we'll play with him.

416
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,549
I told you to calm down.

417
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,302
- Don't show any emotion.
- Of course not!

418
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,846
- I'm going to kill that Marco.
- Relax!

419
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,807
Relax? Here we go!

420
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,810
I have to wait for 30 minutes more?

421
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,605
What's 30 minutes?

422
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,275
My order from Ondamove.

423
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,195
You really ordered a delivery here?

424
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,199
Why? I'm hungry. Is there a problem?

425
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,373
- Ben, my idol!
- Sir!

426
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,416
Ben.

427
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,626
Sir.

428
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,753
How are they?

429
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,214
Here, sir.

430
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:05,388
I can freaking get back at you!
You son of a bitch, Marco!

431
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,766
Fuck you, Roden.

432
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,935
Face me fair and square!

433
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,686
Fuck you!

434
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,233
Don't you talk down to my brother!
You shithead! You asshole!

435
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,319
Acting all high and mighty
when you're just an idiot!

436
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,240
High and mighty? Idiot?

437
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,157
Fuck you!

438
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,743
You're in the way.

439
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,039
Marco.

440
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,836
What now, you shithead?

441
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,548
Finally, I'll get my revenge!

442
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,343
This piece of shit.

443
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,972
Come on, fight back!

444
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,558
What do you say, bro?
I'll kill this guy now.

445
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,060
What now, Marco?

446
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:56,022
Trying to escape? You can never escape!

447
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,275
Go on, try!

448
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,318
Bro.

449
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,446
- This shithead!
- That's enough.

450
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,662
You got lucky, Marco.

451
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,706
If it were up to me,

452
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,917
- I'd burry you alive. Fuck you!
- Relax.

453
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,170
Shithead, let me go
and I'll be the one to burry you.

454
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,965
- Shithead, what did you say?
- Relax.

455
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,091
That's enough.

456
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,635
- Brother.
- Relax.

457
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,346
That's enough.

458
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,057
Come on, brother.

459
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,356
Marco,

460
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,277
I made sure our transactions
went smoothly,

461
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,279
but then you had to double cross me.

462
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,406
What's this?

463
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,950
You even brought cops.

464
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,077
Marco,

465
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,621
our business isn't doing so well
because of you.

466
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,124
Roden...

467
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,210
just kill me.

468
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,214
Because you won't get anything from me!
Shithead!

469
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,969
What's the hurry?

470
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,222
Marco,

471
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:15,311
just tell me where my 200 million is
and maybe...

472
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,105
I'll give you a chance...

473
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,483
to come to your senses.

474
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,404
Just tell me, Marco.

475
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,205
Dumbass!

476
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,582
Dumbass?

477
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,335
That's enough.

478
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,047
Fuck you, Marco!

479
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,634
You want to be state witness, huh?

480
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,762
Be grateful, you fool!

481
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,433
Marco,

482
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,064
this is what I'll do to you
if you don't talk to me.

483
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,067
Watch this.

484
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,882
You're really testing my temper, Marco.

485
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,360
Are you ready to talk?

486
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,209
Yes, untie me.

487
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:03,794
I'll speak.

488
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,839
Go ahead, untie him.

489
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,174
Brother, hold on!

490
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,844
- Are you letting that traitor go?
- Arnel!

491
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,140
Brother?

492
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,809
Untie him.

493
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,188
Brother!

494
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,523
Brother, hold on!

495
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,699
Marco, don't you dare hurt my brother!

496
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,783
Brother, help me.

497
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,202
- Brother, help.
- Marco!

498
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,953
- Brother, help me.
- Marco!

499
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,079
Brother!

500
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,248
Marco!

501
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,292
Brother!

502
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,418
Brother, help me.

503
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,920
- Brother!
- Nobody move.

504
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,005
- Brother, help.
- Stop following us.

505
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,174
Brother!

506
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,967
Don't follow us.

507
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,844
Nobody move!

508
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,845
Drop your guns.

509
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,348
- Let me go!
- Shut up, you son of a bitch.

510
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,599
Shut up!

511
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,892
Drop your guns!

512
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,310
Drop them now!

513
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,521
Put your guns down.

514
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,231
Shit!

515
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,649
I don't want to die.

516
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,859
Drop it!

517
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,865
- Brother!
- Be quiet! Fuck you!

518
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,575
Fuck you, Roden!

519
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,536
Let's see how brave you are.

520
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,206
Your idiot brother's life is in my hands.

521
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,582
Get back inside.

522
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,085
- Get back!
- Brother!

523
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,878
Brother, help me!

524
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,838
Brother! Brother!

525
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,423
Brother!

526
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,094
Brother, help me! Bro!

527
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,138
Brother.

528
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,891
Brother!

529
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,687
Brother.

530
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,571
Motherfuckers!

531
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,870
Arnel.

532
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,831
Arnel!

533
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,833
Arnel?

534
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,294
Arnel?

535
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,462
Arnel.

536
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,299
Arnel!

537
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,596
Are you okay? Did you get hit?

538
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,182
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay, sorry.

539
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,728
You sure you didn't get shot?

540
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,896
Where is he?

541
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,190
He went that way.

542
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,236
Come on.

543
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,215
Thank you for choosing Ondamove.

544
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,063
Find the bastard who killed my brother.

545
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,399
Bring him to me.

546
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,985
Alive.

547
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,908
Miro!

548
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,954
Miro, wake up!

549
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,791
Miro!

550
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,044
Hey! There he is!

551
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,589
Go get them!

552
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,843
They went there, quickly!

553
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,428
Stop!

554
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,637
Hey!

555
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,847
Stop.

556
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,974
Stop!

557
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,272
- Yes, it's me again.
- Nichelle!

558
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,482
I need to know if Miro's there.

559
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,276
Why aren't you packed yet?

560
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,361
Nichelle!

561
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,573
We have an appointment with Mom.
We can't be late for our flight.

562
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,617
- We still have to meet her.
- I'm sorry for calling.

563
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,163
- I need to check--
- Where's Miro? Nichelle!

564
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,167
Bernard, Miro is...

565
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,931
Miro!

566
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,193
If they hurt you, fight back.

567
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,827
Miro?

568
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,955
Miro!

569
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,421
Miro!

570
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:40,941
Miro?

571
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,693
Miro?

572
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,322
Miro?

573
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,242
Miro!

574
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,620
Miro?

575
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,290
Miro?

576
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,250
Miro?

577
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,751
Where are you, Miro?

578
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,504
Miro, where are you?

579
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,680
Ben!

580
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,601
What happened to that kid?
Why is he unconscious?

581
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,648
Hide him. He'll look for him, for sure.

582
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,735
All right, bring him here.

583
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:32,326
Miro?

584
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,525
Miro?

585
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,368
Miro!

586
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,502
Miro!

587
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,422
Miro!

588
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,218
Miro!

589
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,973
Fuck! Get up! Get up!

590
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,985
Miro!

591
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,406
Miro!

592
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:03,625
You want to play? All right, let's play.

593
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,260
Miro!

594
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,431
Miro!

595
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,020
Miro!

596
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,573
Miro!

597
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,618
Miro!

598
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,622
Miro!

599
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,625
Miro?

600
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,507
Miro?

601
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,094
Miro?

602
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:03,560
Miro!

603
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,024
Miro!

604
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,114
Miro?

605
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,682
You want to play, huh?

606
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,638
What?

607
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,990
Why are you calling him? Is Miro with him?

608
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,117
I don't know.

609
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,452
What happened was
he asked to take Miro out

610
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,831
because it was our last day here.

611
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,873
And you let him?

612
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:55,959
No.

613
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,587
Nichelle, my God. That guy isn't normal.
He could've kidnapped my son.

614
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,549
He's not like that, Bernard.

615
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,759
I don't know.

616
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,137
I just don't trust that guy.

617
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,681
Well, I trust Santo.

618
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:14,560
If the two of them are together,
then by 5:00 pm, they'll be here.

619
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,061
How can you be so sure?

620
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,438
'Cause he's Santo.

621
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,275
If he says 5:00,
they'll be home at 5:00 sharp.

622
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,028
Miro.

623
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,323
Miro.

624
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,453
Miro.

625
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,460
Miro.

626
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,674
Miro?

627
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,677
Miro?

628
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,971
Miro?

629
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,432
Miro!

630
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,477
Miro!

631
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,564
Dad.

632
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,362
Come on, Miro. Let's get out of here.

633
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,702
Are you okay?

634
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,351
Come with me.

635
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,396
No.

636
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,273
No!

637
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,733
No, please no.

638
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,860
Come with me.

639
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,194
No, please no.

640
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,989
- Come with me.
- Run, Miro!

641
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,018
Miro!

642
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,492
Dad, let's hide there.

643
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,508
Are you okay?

644
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,550
Does it hurt?

645
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,677
I'm okay, Dad.

646
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,306
We should've listened to your mother.

647
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,350
It's okay, Dad.

648
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,102
What's important is we're together.

649
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:47,231
Dad, where Mom and I are going,

650
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,817
will there be lots
of bad people there too?

651
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,362
My father told me

652
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,533
that many won't be kind to people like me.

653
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:58,868
But you're

654
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,702
not like me.

655
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,580
You're normal, brave

656
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,707
and smart.

657
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,449
Show yourself!

658
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,210
Are you ready to die?

659
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,756
You'll see, I'll kill you myself.

660
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,275
Boss, it's us!

661
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,795
Hey!

662
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,688
Ben?

663
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,815
Are you okay?

664
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,114
Hey!

665
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,534
Just leave him! Let's go!

666
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:25,472
There's no signal! No signal!

667
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,724
Just wait, Dad.

668
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,393
Just wait for the signal.

669
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,229
There's no signal!

670
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:42,657
It's 5:10. I've had enough.
I'll report that autistic to the police.

671
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,912
You have no right
to talk badly about Santo.

672
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,831
You don't know him.

673
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,669
What's your problem?

674
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,422
What's my problem?

675
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,633
Why? Have you forgotten?

676
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,887
Didn't you leave us to go to New York?

677
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,931
Who do you think stayed with us?

678
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,267
It's Santo, right?

679
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,770
Who acted as your son's father?

680
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,480
It was him.

681
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,108
Everything you lacked,

682
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,403
everything you couldn't give Miro,
he provided!

683
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,991
Maybe you're forgetting
that you chose not to go with me.

684
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,119
Don't act like we owe Santo any favors

685
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,415
because he benefitted
from you taking care of him.

686
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:37,879
And for sure, he also benefitted
from all the money I sent you!

687
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:39,756
Isn't that right?

688
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,340
Isn't that right, Nichelle?

689
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,845
It wasn't like that! It wasn't, Bernard!
You're wrong!

690
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,018
Or maybe

691
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:59,901
you're just pretending
to worry about Miro being missing,

692
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,572
but, deep inside,
you actually wanted Santo to hide him.

693
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:11,788
you don't want to go
and leave that autistic behind!

694
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:22,798
What the heck?

695
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,802
Whether you come or not,
I'll wait at the airport.

696
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,839
Come on. Let's go there.

697
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,680
There! The message got sent!

698
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,431
Dad, what are we going to do?

699
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,600
We'll escape.

700
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,562
- Here!
- What are we going to do?

701
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,147
- Dad?
- We'll go down here.

702
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,483
I can't do it! I really can't, Dad!

703
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,360
- You can do it, Miro!
- No, Dad!

704
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,070
- No, I can't, Dad!
- Miro!

705
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:30,240
You can! Just be brave so we can go home!

706
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:34,829
- You can! Be brave! Let's go!
- No! I can't do it!

707
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,249
- Face your fears!
- I can't!

708
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,377
- I can't, Dad.
- You trying to escape?

709
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,338
- Stop!
- Please don't.

710
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:48,550
- Don't shoot, please. Don't.
- Dad!

711
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:52,095
- Don't shoot, we'll go home now.
- Dad!

712
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:55,223
Don't hurt us, please! Don't hurt us!

713
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,268
- We just want to go home!
- Dad.

714
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:02,731
- We're going home, don't hurt us!
- Dad.

715
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,735
- We're going home!
- Dad.

716
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,029
Don't!

717
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:13,159
Don't hurt us, please! Don't hurt us!

718
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:18,706
We're going home!

719
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,960
Miro!

720
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,545
Come on! Hold on to me!

721
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,840
Miro! Come on! Hurry up!

722
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:32,928
Okay, slowly!

723
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,304
Dad!

724
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:37,016
Don't be afraid. I'm right behind you.

725
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:45,650
Hold on.

726
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,575
Ben, did you see them?

727
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,118
No, they weren't there.

728
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,704
- What's over there?
- Nothing. I checked.

729
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,582
Come on. Let's go down.

730
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,635
Wait!

731
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,012
Come here.

732
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,554
Come down!

733
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,640
Wait.

734
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,892
I hear something over there.

735
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:21,852
Let's go.

736
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,045
Over here! Come on, hurry! Let's go!

737
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:51,590
Run, Dad!

738
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,058
Wait!

739
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,937
Go hide! Hide yourself!

740
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,273
Hurry! Run!

741
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,860
Run, Miro!

742
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:18,409
Stop! Get his cellphone!

743
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,496
Don't take my cellphone!

744
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,750
My cellphone!

745
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,336
That's my phone!

746
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:38,304
Hey! We have the kid. Bring him to boss!

747
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:24,720
Dad!

748
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:31,602
Miro!

749
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,928
Dad.

750
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,097
Dad!

751
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:10,391
Miro.

752
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,226
Miro.

753
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:18,857
Miro.

754
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,568
Miro!

755
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,745
Miro?

756
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,634
Dad!

757
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,473
You killed my brother.

758
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,642
Now,

759
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,227
I'll kill your son!

760
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:57,312
No, Please, don't!

761
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,271
Dad!

762
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,898
- No! No!
- Dad!

763
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:05,611
Kill me, instead! Kill me!
Hurt me! Don't hurt Miro!

764
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,907
- Dad!
- Don't hurt Miro! Don't hurt him!

765
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,410
Dad!

766
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,579
I'm begging you! Don't hurt him!

767
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,415
Please, don't!

768
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,584
Spare Miro!

769
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,253
- Please not Miro!
- Dad!

770
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,257
Don't hurt Miro! Hurt me instead!

771
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,011
Not Miro! No, please don't!

772
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:33,515
Miro! Don't hurt him, please!

773
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:43,067
Don't hurt Miro!

774
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,069
Don't hurt him!

775
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,037
Miro!

776
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:07,674
Daddy.

777
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,052
Daddy!

778
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,391
Daddy!

779
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,102
Daddy!

780
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:29,321
Miro!

781
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:27,795
Where's Miro?

782
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,590
You killed my brother!

783
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,286
Where is Miro?

784
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:44,206
Where's Miro?

785
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,863
Where is Miro?

786
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,077
Daddy!

787
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:06,079
Miro?

788
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:08,247
Daddy!

Daddy!

797
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,195
<i>We've received breaking news just now.</i>

798
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:43,491

They might catch us.

Let's hurry to the stairs.

01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:44,570
Let's go, Dad!

842
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:47,073
Let's go, Dad. We don't have time.

Dad!

846

It's locked!

847
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,533
Dad!

848
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,619
Dad!

849
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:47,968
Ben!

Lana, let's go!

851
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,530
Sir.

852
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,616
Sir, my son is inside!

853
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:19,451
We saw them on the news.

854
01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:21,078
I just want to see my son.

855
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,246
I saw him on news.

856
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,581
My friend is also inside.

857
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:28,877
I can prove it to you.
Look at my phone, sir.

858
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:30,921
No one may enter.

859
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:33,298
I'll show you proof that I'm his mom.

860
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:35,592
- Sorry, you can't go in.
- Take a look.

861
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,219
Sir, please, let me in.

862
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,054
- Sir, I'm begging you.
- Sorry.

863
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:40,264
Sir, could we not...

864
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,432
We're truly sorry.

865
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,600
Don't let them in.

866
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:45,478
Stay back! Everyone, stay back!

867
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,523
Someone's dead!

868
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,819
Sorry, you have to stay back.

869
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:55,863
We really can't let you in.

870
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,490
Sir, please, I beg you.

871
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,622
- Sir, please, I'm begging you!
- Nichelle! Nichelle!

872
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:07,750
- Step back!
- Miro? Miro!

873
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,419
Miro! Sir! That's my son!

874
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,797
Miro!

875
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,092
Mommy!

876
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:19,554
Son!

877
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,599
My son!

878
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:25,268
Miro!

879
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,815
Nichelle!

880
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:40,365
- Mom!
- Nichelle!

881
01:24:40,366 --> 01:24:41,618
Santo!

882
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:14,817
Miro!

883
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:17,236
I'm here at the zombie's. Where are you?

884
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:21,281
I'm here in Zone A. Where are you?
I'll come to you.

885
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:22,658
Okay.

886
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:24,577
Run, Dad! Run!

887
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,122
Dad, look for a diffuser.

888
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,874
I'm dead! I'm dead, Miro! I'm dead!

889
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,544
Look for a diffuser.

890
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,843
Here's your healing kit.

891
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:42,553
Have a bite first.

892
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:43,846
Here's more kit.

893
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,224
Here, eat first.

894
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:56,109
Santo, that's enough.
You need to get to work.

895
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:00,487
<i>How's the hospital?</i>

896
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,865
- Hi.
- It was good.

897
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,033
How are you?

898
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,827
The usual, lots of deliveries to do.

899
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,831
Aunty Maring is always giving me stuff.

900
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:16,629
By the way Santo,
we'll come home this Christmas.

901
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,426
<i>I'm saving up</i>

902
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,721
for my Christmas gift to you two.

903
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:29,474
Dad, I have a surprise for you.

904
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:32,979
A really, really big jigsaw puzzle!
