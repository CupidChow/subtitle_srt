1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,100
In the Western , fruit has never been just food

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,000
it has also been a symbol of desire

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,400
The apple represents original sin

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,800
in the legend of Adam and Eve.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,700
Grapes symbolize prosperity and celebration.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,400
And the peach became a symbol of the body.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,000
Seduction

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,900
Linguistic studies suggest that

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,700
“peach” has long been used as a term for a beautiful lover.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
Desire

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,200
In today’s digital world

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,500
the peach emoji

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
has evolved into a coded symbol of lust

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,700
and the buttocks, as everyone understands

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,600
The question is

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
When someone sends you a peach emoji

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Does he simply mean fruit

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,000
or is he making an offer that could change your life forever?

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,900
I look at the growing balance in my account with satisfaction

20
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,000
My bold decision to raise the commission rate for this job

21
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
It received a very positive response from clients.

22
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,300
As the work quality increased

23
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,100
higher returns were only to be expected

24
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,699
I’ll be moving out of here soon

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,300
and leave this country

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
a country I no longer know who I’m staying here for

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,000
Tonight’s dinner is convenience store microwave food again

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,500
I’m not trying to save

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,300
I’m just too tired to go far

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I worked all night

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,500
And then there was the wait for the writer to make revisions

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Before I knew it, it was afternoon

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,600
If I drove into the city to eat right now, I’d probably fall asleep at the wheel

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,700
After dealing with the tasteless microwave food

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,500
Then I spent some time letting it settle before taking a shower

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,200
while accepting a new job from a regular client

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,800
Most are from publishers I’ve done cover work for

38
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,400
They’re getting books ready for the book fair season

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,200
Just watch

40
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,600
there’ll be tons of covers by me this time

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,600
Now that I think about it, there’s been a surge in BL novel cover jobs

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,200
I understand it’s a genre that’s gaining popularity

43
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,400
And just look at the briefs I’ve been getting

44
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,200
the bodies

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Muscles everywhere

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,200
Every image the writer attached

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
They left my mouth dry, my throat suddenly tight

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
They really knew how to pick them

49
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
You’re really cute, Peach

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,800
He always starts his videos like this

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Peach Lover

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,000
A popular account on a gay adult website

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,700
Followed by hundreds of thousands

54
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,600
He calls his partner

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,700
Peach

56
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,300
Even though it’s only a nickname

57
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Do you like it, Peach?

58
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,600
I like it

59
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Want me harder?

60
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Harder, please

61
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Damn!

62
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,200
Who the hell?

63
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,700
This is such a mood killer

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
Hello , everyone

65
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
It’s been a long time, hasn’t it?

66
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
Have you guys forgotten me?

67
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,400
The reason I disappeared

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
because I broke up with Peach

69
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,900
Broke up

70
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,500
How did they break up?

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But I’m coming back

72
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
the reason I’m back today

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,900
because I’m now accepting applications for new Peach

74
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,300
If you’re interested, all the details are in the description under the video

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Opening up for new Peaches?

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,500
So

77
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,700
the chosen one

78
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
actually get to meet him… for real

79
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
skipping the shower!

80
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
My name’s… Po

81
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I’m a novel cover artist

82
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,700
let them choose me

83
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,500
Please

84
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,900
Forget the work!

85
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,600
Meeting him tomorrow… really?!

86
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,300
Hello

87
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,100
Hello

88
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,900
I need to go up to room… 1403

89
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,600
Alright, sir. Just a moment, please

90
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,100
Yes

91
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
You’re Po, right?

92
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,800
Yes , I'm Po

93
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,500
Please, take a seat in this room for a moment

94
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,400
Yes

95
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,100
Wait…

96
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,300
May I ask you something?

97
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Sure...

98
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,300
but I can’t promise I’ll have an answer

99
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,500
Your boss

100
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
is he a nice person?

101
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,900
It’s better if you, decide for yourself.

102
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Fianlly

103
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,900
I'm going to meet the real Peach Lover

104
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,800
So

105
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,700
Am I excited… or scared?

106
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
He’s here…

107
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,400
I’m finally seeing his face

108
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,400
I didn’t expect

109
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,400
Peach Lover would do it like this

110
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
Hello

111
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,600
H..Hello

112
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,100
What are you thinking?

113
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,700
I’m thinking…

114
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
You…

115
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,400
have got an amazing body

116
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,500
Love it

117
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,100
Your name’s Po, right?

118
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,200
Yes

119
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,500
I'm Po

120
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Are you sure

121
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,100
to be my new Peach?

122
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,700
Yes, I’m sure

123
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,400
Why not try another path?

124
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,100
You’re good-looking

125
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Me? Good-looking?

126
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,500
In my whole life

127
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,200
no one’s ever told me I’m good-looking

128
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,000
How could anyone call me handsome

129
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,600
you’re the one with the sweet face

130
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,500
But you have to be on camera

131
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,900
Are you okay with that?

132
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,600
I'm okay

133
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,700
Are you sure?

134
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,500
I'm sure

135
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,400
You’re really a strange one

136
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,200
Then...

137
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,400
I think I’ll have to taste you

138
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,700
To help me decide

139
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
Take your shirt off for me

140
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,500
You…

141
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,500
Truth is…

142
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,400
I’ve never been with anyone

143
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,300
Sasom!

144
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,100
a person I’ve seen on billboards

145
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
TV

146
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,000
Every time I see him

147
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,400
I feel like he’s someone out of my reach

148
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,700
I used to think… what if Peach Lover showed his face?

149
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,700
It would probably be someone...handsome

150
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,000
But it’s not the person in front of me… it’s not him

151
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,500
Why...?

152
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,300
Why do I always stop… and stare whenever I see him?

153
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,700
The moment I knew it was him… my heart nearly stopped

154
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,800
In

155
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
takes Po back

156
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,400
Yes

157
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Where should I call the car to, Po?

158
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Po

159
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,800
Po

160
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,300
Here, please

161
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,600
Thank you

162
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,800
Wait..Po

163
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,000
What?

164
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,100
My boss… he’s kind of pitiful

165
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,100
What do you mean?

166
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
When you asked me

167
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,000
If my boss is a nice person

168
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,200
Actually… he’s really a pitiful person

169
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,100
So...

170
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Please keep his story a secret

171
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,100
I’m not going to reveal Peach Lover’s secret, anyway

172
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,600
okay

173
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,700
Even if anyone’s watching, there’s nothing to worry about

174
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,800
handsome

175
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,300
so damn handsome

176
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,400
So clean… must shower ten times a day

177
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,900
Just by smiling… or not smiling

178
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
He’s like a whole different person

179
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,100
But his eyes…

180
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,100
fierce

181
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,400
It’s frightening

182
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
:01
draws you in

183
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,300
Yes

184
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,400
This is the one who kissed me with a burning tongue

185
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,000
He’s been well-known since he was a teen… and now he’s at the top

186
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,900
Damn… I shouldn’t have

187
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,100
I shouldn’t have ripped off his mask

188
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,400
A body like that

189
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,800
My Peach Lover

190
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,200
The one I’ve always dreamed about

191
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,300
It's crezy

192
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,400
I’m going crazy because of that man

193
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,000
I’m crazy about you

194
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,100
I’m so in love it’s driving me crazy, and I don’t know what to do with my heart anymore

195
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
Sasom...

196
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,100
You make me feel lost

197
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,300
But I don’t even want to find my way out

198
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,600
Damn it

199
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,000
I never thought I’d be this unable to stop watching

200
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,700
Sasom is such a great actor

201
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,100
His acting feels so natural

202
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,800
Everything looks perfect

203
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,500
It’s no surprise he’s earned so many awards

204
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,300
Stay here, In

205
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,200
Yes

206
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,700
Sasom

207
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,400
Who?

208
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Sasom

209
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,300
May I come in

210
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,700
Sure

211
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,300
Did I act well? it was really fun filming it

212
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,400
Alright

213
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,500
But I like your series on iQIYI more

214
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,300
you’ve already finished that series?

215
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,200
I’ve only seen half of it

216
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Yes

217
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,000
It’s finished

218
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So

219
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,100
Am I bothering you

220
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,900
No

221
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,700
I was just about to take a break

222
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,400
Sorry

223
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,600
What are you apologizing for?

224
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,900
About that day I sent you back

225
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,900
No problem

226
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,200
It was my fault

227
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,300
I shouldn’t have taken your mask off

228
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,800
This isn’t a competition to find a winner

229
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,700
Yes

230
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,700
Would you like to sit down first?

231
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,700
Good

232
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,000
Honestly

233
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,500
I was really shocked that day

234
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,100
The moment I realized you were still a virgin

235
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,100
It's...

236
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,900
really that bad?

237
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,699
It’s not like that

238
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,100
I just didn’t think you were still a virgin

239
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,699
That’s why I was shocked

240
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,100
Think about it

241
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,800
you actually filmed with me

242
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,199
and even dared to show your face on camera

243
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,000
Who would’ve thought you’d have no experience yet?

244
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,199
but...

245
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,000
I’m curious

246
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,800
You

247
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Why did you come here

248
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,300
First

249
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,300
I'm here to say sorry

250
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,800
and...

251
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,100
the second?

252
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
second

253
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,800
I just want to ask you

254
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Do you still want to be my Peach?

255
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Yes, I do

256
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,300
but

257
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,400
Can I ask you something?

258
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,300
How did you become Peach Lover…?

259
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,400
I mean

260
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,700
I’m not saying it’s a bad thing

261
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,900
but

262
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,800
you’re a well-known star too

263
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
So many people love you

264
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,200
That doesn’t seem like you

265
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,900
Not like me?

266
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,700
Or not like the image people expect me to have?

267
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,700
Peach Lover not by chance

268
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
It’s a place I chose myself

269
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,900
Could have been anyone

270
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,500
Could have been to love anyone

271
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,200
the way I wanted

272
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,400
I’m just…

273
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,600
a person born into a family where my parents never loved me

274
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,200
Everything was just about money

275
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,400
Even my name…

276
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,900
was an investment

277
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,900
A life forced

278
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,800
pushing me to find an escape

279
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,200
But in the end there was no escaping

280
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,100
That’s why

281
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,200
I need a place where I feel safe

282
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,700
and Peach Lover

283
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,800
that my safe space

284
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,900
The only place that makes me happy

285
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,000
I...

286
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,200
feel the same

287
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,400
I’ve never told anyone I like guys

288
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,500
Every time I think about it

289
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,500
I feel guilty

290
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,900
I feel like there’s something wrong with me

291
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,700
But when I saw Peach Lover through the camera

292
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,700
It was like someone was telling me

293
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,300
What I am

294
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,700
It’s not wrong

295
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,200
That’s why

296
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,900
I’m here

297
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,200
It’s not because of the money

298
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,000
Or… it’s not because I like trying strange things, either

299
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,200
I just...

300
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,400
want to understand my own feelings

301
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,000
more

302
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Sasom

303
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,200
if you’re free

304
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,300
could you teach me?

305
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,900
Sure

306
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,500
I’ll teach you myself

307
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,500
All this time

308
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,300
I’ve been able to guess what you want almost every time

309
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,800
But today… it’s different

310
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,100
Staying the night here

311
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,000
with someone I just met?

312
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,500
Po

313
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,000
don’t seem ordinary

314
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,800
Take it off

315
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,100
Anything I’ve decided to do

316
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,600
I’ll never change my mind.

317
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,000
I’ll make you feel better

318
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,900
You’re my new Peach… from now on

319
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,500
I never imagined

320
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,000
a Peach Lover would take care of me like this

321
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,500
Because you’re my Peach

322
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,000
Who the hell did you sleep with?

323
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,000
Can I ask you something?

324
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,200
Do whatever you want

325
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,100
but don’t mess with your dad, okay?

326
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,000
When I was a kid

327
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,300
I used to think my feelings were wrong

328
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,100
ผมโตมาในบ้านที่พ่อไม่เคยมองหน้า

329
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,600
A home where shouting happened every day

330
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,200
A house where I couldn’t tell anyone

331
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,400
that I liked men

332
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,300
So I grew up with silence

333
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,200
in dark rooms

334
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,000
the only place

335
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,600
where I could hide what my heart truly felt

336
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,600
I never felt like I had any worth

337
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,000
Until someone

338
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,200
ooked at me like no one had looked at me before

339
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,300
My taste isn't sex

340
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,000
But it's my wish

341
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,400
That there will be people seeing me in the dark side

342
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,000
On the day I was the most empty-hearted

343
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,700
Today

344
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,000
I don't have to hide anymore

345
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,100
everyone think I'm perfect

346
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,800
But no one

347
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,300
saw that the child

348
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,600
I've been caught standing in front of the camera since I can remember

349
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,300
No one asked what I wanted to be

350
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,800
What do you want to like

351
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,000
What do I want to be ?

352
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,200
My name

353
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,400
is still the name my father gave me

354
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,800
to be able to sell

355
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,300
I never choose anything on my own

356
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,800
So I had to create my own safe space

357
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,600
Where I don't have to be a product

358
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,100
don't have to smile on command

359
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,200
Where I can be a normal person

360
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,500
A place that has the same needs as everyone else

361
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,600
My taste is not in control

362
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,200
But it was freedom for the first time in my life

363
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,700
The first time I got to choose for myself

364
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,700
Who do I want to see?

365
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,200
I wanted to love someone

366
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,400
and I chose him

367
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,800
You are listening to the program

368
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,800
"Our Hearts"

369
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,800
Weekly advice session from a psychiatrist

370
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,800
Today the doctor will talk about

371
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,200
The impact of the love we never received since childhood

372
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,000
in psychology

373
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,400
Children growing up in an unstable environment

374
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,600
They often create their own safe space

375
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,500
Whether it's a work of art

376
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,800
games

377
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,400
online society

378
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,200
or some secret channel

379
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,400
It's not wrong

380
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,800
But it is a survival mechanism of the mind

381
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,600
Some people may have different love styles

382
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,900
like confidence

383
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,000
I like being seen

384
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
or feel safe

385
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
When you have control over your own situation

386
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,400
This kind of taste

387
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,700
is not perversion

388
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,200
It's not a dark secret

389
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,300
But it's an echo

390
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,700
of emotional wounds

391
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,600
that needs acceptance

392
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,500
As long as the relationship is based on consent

393
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,800
Respect and Integrity

394
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,600
It's a form of love

395
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,400
That has a meaning that is no different from anyone else's

396
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,300
And sometimes meeting someone

397
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,100
who understands our wounds

398
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,300
It helps heal the whole heart

399
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,300
and help us dare to be ourselves more

400
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,500
Because in the end, love is safe

401
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,100
It's not perfect love

402
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,300
But it is love that makes us...

403
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,600
No need to hide who we are anymore

404
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,900
I saw it in your application

405
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,200
Do you draw pictures too?

406
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
Yes

407
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,400
I really want to have friends as a artist

408
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,700
So...can you be a model for me?

409
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,600
In case you have an artist as a friend

410
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,900
Can I ask you somthing?

411
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,800
You can do anything

412
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,600
But don't you dare disrespect your father
