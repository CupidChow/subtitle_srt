00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,470
Hello , Everyone

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,910
The reason I came back today

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,910
to open applications for a new Peach

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,620
Are you sure?

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,630
about becoming my new Peach?

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm sure

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,440
I’m curious

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,950
How did you become Peach Lover ?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,290
Peachlover

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,620
isn’t by chance

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,920
it’s the place I chose for myself

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,580
Do you still want to be my peach?

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,930
Have you ever

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,090
tried the taste of a peach?

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,730
The taste of a peach doesn’t just mean the fruit

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,980
But it’s also a symbol of happiness

17
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,200
Sweetness

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,340
and satisfaction

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,550
in both physica

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,760
and emotionally

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,250
They say

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,400
when a peach is perfectly ripe

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,380
its sweetness

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,310
will be stuck in my heart

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,230
so anyone who tastes it

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,120
will never forget

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,370
All of my life

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,370
I never imagined I’d experience something like this

29
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,600
From a simple artist

30
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,380
in my own space

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,150
in my own

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,470
I finally met Peach Lover

33
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,310
Sasom

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,800
Someone I thought I could never reach

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,590
Sasom

36
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,940
I'm not hurt

37
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,980
Both...

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,110
happy

39
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,280
surprised

40
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,530
and afraid

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,390
but the most obvious thing

42
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,430
I'm so damn happy

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,790
I don't know what tomorrow will be

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,550
He might hurt me

45
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,710
or make me happier

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
But I chose it

47
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,530
to walk this path with him

48
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,770
This is my first memory

49
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,340
and it won’t be the last

50
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,210
no matter what happens from here on

51
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,820
So let’s see

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,950
from now on

53
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,570
What will I have to face ?

54
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,230
I went over my limit last night

55
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,300
So soft

56
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,320
So intoxicating

57
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,130
Maybe because he’s new

58
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,050
still fresh

59
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,060
untouched

60
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,550
You’re mine now

61
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,350
Hello , In

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,270
Come pick me up

63
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,270
I’ll be late for the fitting

64
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,240
I’m waiting out front already

65
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,340
You really get me, man

66
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,330
What’s wrong with me?

67
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,210
Just put it wherever

68
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,440
ID - SM - 7831 Add me

69
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,020
A peach the sweetest, most fragrant of fruits

70
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,390
At the first bite

71
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,570
its juiciness fills the heart

72
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,000
And it becomes even sweeter

73
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,950
when you know it’s the first of the season

74
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,060
one no one has ever tasted before

75
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,960
A Peach

76
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,350
sweet because it’s fresh

77
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,920
and because it exists for only one season

78
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,360
You look so happy today

79
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes

80
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,820
I’m so really happy, In.

81
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,570
Is this about Po?

82
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,350
Do you know, In?

83
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,300
I asked Po

84
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,590
if he was going to tell anyone about me

85
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,360
Do you know what his answer was?

86
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,000
What was his answer?

87
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,690
What would I gain, other than ruining your life?

88
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,290
I really liked that.

89
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,830
Time to go

90
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,530
Today was brighter than I thought

91
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,480
I figured I’d end up hurting

92
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,790
or at least worn out and exhausted

93
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,980
But that wasn’t it

94
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,300
I wasn’t hurting

95
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,900
I wasn’t aching

96
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,910
It felt like

97
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,550
Sasom was always inside me

98
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,780
ID - SM - 7831 Add me

99
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,760
I smiled

100
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,570
I didn’t even notice when I started smiling

101
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,510
Right now, I can still feel… you inside me

102
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,920
Your name is Sasom

103
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,570
I really want to be your keepsake

104
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,490
Excuse me

105
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,870
Would you like a tote bag?

106
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,900
The design is really beautiful

107
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
It’s only 89 baht

108
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,710
No, thank you

109
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,840
Hmm…

110
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,080
You really don’t want one?

111
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,240
Here take a look first

112
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,840
Uh… how many designs are there?

113
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,600
Hmm, there are four designs to collect

114
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,150
So..

115
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,780
I’ll take all of them

116
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,800
Hmm… you must be a Sasom fan too

117
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
right?

118
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,310
Alright

119
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,390
I’ll wrap them up for you

120
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:36,890
Thank you

121
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,760
Put some love into it, okay

122
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,110
Sure

123
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,700
Hello, Mr. Po

124
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,270
How’s the project I briefed you on coming along?

125
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,740
It’s nearly finished

126
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,370
Okay, Mr. Po

127
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,630
In that case, could you please help speed it up a bit?

128
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,270
Thank you

129
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,870
I’m almost at your house

130
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,030
Okay

131
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,430
“Could you open the door and wait for me?

132
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,410
I’m afraid someone might see me

133
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
That way, I can go straight in when I get there

134
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,090
Alright. I’ll leave the door open for you

135
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,850
Hmmm..

136
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,660
You haven’t had dinner yet?

137
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,230
Not yet

138
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,250
I was waiting for you

139
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,490
Hmm… then let’s eat together

140
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,589
Okay

141
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,000
Were you busy today?

142
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,630
I’ve been waiting ages for your reply

143
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,150
Are you upset with me?

144
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,230
I’m not upset. I’m just…

145
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,000
annoyed?

146
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,520
No.

147
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,780
So

148
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,960
what did you do today?

149
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,690
Hmm…today

150
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,770
I had a fitting in the morning

151
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,040
Then an interview later on

152
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,140
From noon until five

153
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,620
I had drama reshoots

154
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,040
The schedule was crazy

155
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,150
Wow… then make sure you eat a lot

156
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,150
Aren’t your parents home?

157
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,130
No

158
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,920
Actually, I used to live with just my mom

159
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,830
But she passed away a long time ago

160
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,450
My dad...

161
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,860
he lives in another house now

162
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,660
With his new wife

163
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,220
even before he threw my mom and me out

164
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,500
I’m sorry about that

165
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,470
It’s okay

166
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,000
I’m fine now

167
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
That was her decision

168
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,530
Her life

169
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
isn’t mine

170
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,990
You’re really talented

171
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,620
I saw it on your application

172
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,170
You draw as well, don’t you?

173
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,660
Yes

174
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,380
amazing

175
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,440
Thank you

176
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,900
I wish I had a friend who’s an artis

177
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,470
So

178
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,370
would you like me to be your friend?

179
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,370
So… you’d have an artist as a friend

180
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,360
Being my friend isn’t easy, you know

181
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,630
Why?

182
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:39,020
My parents won’t let me hang out with anyone who isn’t famous

183
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,670
Even friends of mine who are actors

184
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,240
if they’re not popular

185
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,350
I’m not allowed to see them

186
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,120
Hey… but I am famous, you know

187
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,970
If you don’t believe me

188
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,250
go ask anyone in the book industry.

189
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,230
No one there doesn’t know

190
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,820
Japo

191
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,540
I’m really serious

192
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,890
Please believe me

193
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,990
I believe you

194
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,490
But my parents don’t know you

195
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,130
Ouch… that hurts

196
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,520
So

197
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,770
would you model for me?

198
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,670
Maybe I’ll become a famous artist

199
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,130
Famous enough

200
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,330
for your parents to know me

201
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,200
Could you take your clothes off for me

202
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,980
No… keep it on

203
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,870
Take off your pants too

204
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,220
Let me draw you first

205
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,020
I actually like it

206
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,790
It just bothers me a little

207
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,870
Look

208
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,170
the real thing is larger

209
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,540
So

210
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,480
you’re not going anywhere

211
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,180
You’ve got to learn

212
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,050
from your mistakes first

213
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,310
See? The real thing

214
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,820
you didn’t even draw half of it

215
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,550
Hello

216
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,300
Today, agricultural scientists

217
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,500
shared an interesting study about peaches

218
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,290
a popular fruit known not only for its sweet, juicy flavor

219
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,390
but also for the hidden meaning behind its size

220
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,180
really?

221
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,330
The meaning of size?

222
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,770
Yes. It’s said that

223
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,980
big, plump peaches that fit perfectly in your hand

224
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,980
are considered ready

225
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,880
and ideal for tasting

226
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,920
Unlike smaller peaches

227
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,530
which may not be fully ripe

228
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,580
or simply not ready yet

229
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,630
Wow… listening to this it almost sounds like you’re talking about something

230
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,230
more than just fruit

231
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,540
That depends on how the listener interprets it

232
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,180
But one thing researchers are certain about

233
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,240
the taste of a fully grown, large peach

234
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
is something people never forget

235
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,290
no matter how long it’s been

236
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,540
Hey, why are you smiling to yourself?

237
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,970
What’s up with you?

238
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,810
Nothing, man. I was just thinking about something

239
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,910
Hey you’re smiling again

240
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,400
What’s wrong with you?

241
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,740
What’s wrong with me?

242
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,380
So

243
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,740
what made you

244
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,190
come see me at the shop today?

245
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,800
I want to rent your place for an exhibition

246
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,640
Both floors

247
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,040
When are you free?

248
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,870
Finally, huh?

249
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,270
You kept me waiting

250
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,020
Things like this

251
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,530
Shouldn’t I wait for a bit of inspiration?

252
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,800
Inspiration?

253
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,640
‘inspiration’

254
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,950
So what is this?

255
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,060
A lot of things, man

256
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,400
can I ask you something?

257
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah?

258
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,300
Do you really like peaches?

259
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,410
Or are you just using them as a comparison for your partners?

260
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,240
Both, actually.

261
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,930
What about you?

262
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,930
Have you ever had a peach?

263
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,000
Not yet

264
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,460
Then you really should

265
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,590
They’re fragrant

266
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,420
Sweet

267
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,050
and super juicy.

268
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,140
It’s the flavor and the feeling that I really love

269
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,800
you’re making me want one right now.

270
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,960
If you were me

271
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,710
you’d have tried it by now

272
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,090
Uh…

273
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,780
Huh?

274
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,880
You seriously didn’t know?

275
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,639
Know what?

276
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,690
When I eat a peach

277
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,920
and when I eat you

278
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,179
the taste is exactly the same

279
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,230
Sweet

280
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:20,250
Fragrant

281
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,850
I can’t stop

282
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,610
So…

283
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,330
I’ll use that as my exhibition title

284
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,810
Which one?

285
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,350
Peach Lover

286
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,780
Of course

287
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,000
why not?

288
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,880
Just hearing the name

289
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,880
already makes me want to go

290
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,350
Hey

291
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,540
Hey!

292
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,650
Hey!!?

293
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,380
What?

294
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,020
Are you even listening to me?

295
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,120
You’re zoning out again

296
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,180
Just say it

297
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,330
What’s wrong with you?

298
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,760
You’re not usually like this.

299
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Nothing’s wrong

300
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,940
You can lie to anyone, Po

301
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,510
but not to me

302
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,180
I’ve known you for years

303
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,240
You don’t usually space out like this

304
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,000
You don’t sit there smiling to yourself

305
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,050
What’s wrong with you?

306
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,370
What do you want me to do about it?

307
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,060
I think…

308
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,340
You are

309
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,170
in love

310
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,830
Oh

311
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,000
You’re talking crazy

312
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,870
Damn, why’d you hit me so hard

313
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,660
Just think, dude

314
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,240
How many things

315
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,710
can really inspire someone

316
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,660
this much?

317
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
You’re smiling to yourself

318
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,390
thinking about him

319
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,050
Come here

320
00:35:59,050 --> 00:35:59,780
Show me his picture

321
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,600
That’s enough

322
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,550
I wanna see it

323
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,570
Stop talking nonsense

324
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,690
I wanna see

325
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,860
I don’t have one

326
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,810
Fine. Then you don’t

327
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,240
But when you’ve got problems

328
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,130
don’t come running to me

329
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,680
Uh…

330
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,000
Can I ask you something?

331
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,150
Yeah

332
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,600
What if one day

333
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,510
a sex tape of mine got leake

334
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,280
would you still be my friend?

335
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,000
A sex tape?

336
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,170
Who the hell did you sleep with?

337
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,430
I’m just asking

338
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,640
would you still be my friend?

339
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,400
Dude

340
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,460
who did you sleep with?

341
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,420
Meen , listen to me

342
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,080
Who did you sleep with?

343
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,920
Man, your place...

344
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,580
and...

345
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,950
so many flies

346
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,680
You let him film you?

347
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,200
So

348
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,670
when’s the place free?

349
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,240
Don’t change the subject

350
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,530
You wanna be a porn star?

351
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,570
What the hell did you record?

352
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,190
Let me sum it up for you

353
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,770
You slept with someone

354
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,050
You let him film you

355
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,610
And now you wanna be a porn star

356
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,560
Po

357
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,120
Can I ask you something?

358
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,130
You can do whatever you want

359
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,490
but don’t do this just to spite your dad, okay?

360
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,590
My dad

361
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,230
If he died

362
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,040
I wouldn’t even go to his funeral

363
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,350
Why the hell would I be doing this out of spite?

364
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,930
uh..

365
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,610
So

366
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,410
you’re treating me to everything, right

367
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,380
Of course

368
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,930
My best friend’s here

369
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,100
You’re adorable, man

370
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,720
You take care of me like we’re married

371
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,960
Hello

372
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,850
You

373
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,260
I miss you so much

374
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,000
I miss you too

375
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,800
You

376
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,270
Do you want to stay over at my place tonight?

377
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,210
I’ll be working late

378
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,520
You can sleep first

379
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,790
Okay

380
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,050
Good luck

381
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,870
Uh..

382
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,380
Okay

383
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,930
Hello

384
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,250
What would you like?

385
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,470
I’ll have…

386
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,760
an espresso, please.

387
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,520
One espresso?

388
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,700
Sure

389
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
Please wait a moment

390
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,130
Here you go

391
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,400
One espresso

392
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,870
I made it strong

393
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,380
Take it slow

394
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,680
It might be a bit bitter

395
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,740
The coffee here

396
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,660
smells really good

397
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,200
So…

398
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,350
the coffee

399
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,740
or me?

400
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,440
I was just kidding

401
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,330
Next time, you should try a latte

402
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,850
You might like it more than an espresso

403
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,820
It’s less bitter

404
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,730
Sit

405
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,830
Give me your hand

406
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,440
Hand

407
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:53,840
Sit

408
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,200
Excuse me

409
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,660
Are you

410
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,030
going to keep sitting in front of the shop for long?

411
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,300
Uh…

412
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,090
I didn’t mean it

413
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,240
You’re kind of strict.

414
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:48,880
Hey…

415
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,480
I was just joking

416
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,980
You’re

417
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,390
still here?

418
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,040
That’s cute

419
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,540
hey you

420
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,990
Didn’t you say you’d be working late today?

421
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,490
I thought...

422
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,260
you weren’t coming

423
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,140
It’s just that…

424
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,950
the director’s wife is about to give birth

425
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,040
So they wrapped up the shoot early

426
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,310
Where are you off to?

427
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,620
Minimart?

428
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,390
farther than that

429
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,680
I was thinking of getting something to eat near the indie theater.

430
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,530
I never been there

431
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,820
Is there anything good around there?

432
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,900
I’m not really sure

433
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:51,890
But…

434
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:54,890
around here

435
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,980
I’m the highlight

436
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,210
So

437
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,000
I’m asking

438
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,120
what’s good around there?

439
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,010
Uh…

440
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,750
There are lots of things

441
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,100
Mostly

442
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,490
cheap street food

443
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,240
But…

444
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,050
you probably can’t go with me, right?

445
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,140
Why not?

446
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,010
Hmm?

447
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,800
Actors are just people

448
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,250
Sometimes

449
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,770
I just want good food

450
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,610
I mean…

451
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,000
if we go together

452
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,120
and someone sees us

453
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,990
So

454
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,500
I don’t think we’d be able to eat in peace

455
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,850
and also

456
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,490
if any photos got out

457
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,940
what would you tell your family?

458
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,790
Follow me

459
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,420
Where are we going?

460
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:27,910
Hey

461
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,050
Are we switching from dinner

462
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,000
to something else now?

463
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,940
Hmm?

464
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,550
What are you doing?

465
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,230
That’s nice

466
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:34,790
Hey

467
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,980
are you sleepy?

468
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,970
No.

469
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,200
I’m just resting my eyes

470
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:46,800
If you’re tired

471
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,580
you can rest first

472
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,420
I’ll buy something and bring it back for you

473
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,160
No

474
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,640
I want to go with you

475
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,290
Then

476
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,440
change your clothes quickly

477
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
So we can go

478
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,990
Here

479
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,620
You want me to disguise myself?

480
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,290
And most importantly

481
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,460
wear a mask

482
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,870
Hey

483
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,090
What are you doing?

484
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,410
I’m getting changed

485
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,600
So we can go soon

486
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,060
Uh...

487
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,070
Let me help you

488
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,420
I’m really falling for you

489
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,220
How about we do something first?

490
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,010
Hmm?

491
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,580
Let’s go eat first

492
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,990
Please don’t leave, Ton

493
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,410
Let me go

494
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,830
I’ll handle this on my own

495
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:54,620
No!

496
00:54:58,350 --> 00:54:59,610
I want you to remember this

497
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,980
you’ve ruined my life

498
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:05,250
Lek

499
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,060
You’ve killed me inside

500
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,320
Hello

501
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,960
Tonight, on Inside the Human Heart

502
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,200
I’d like to talk with you about something

503
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,810
we don’t usually talk about very often

504
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:48,910
Love

505
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,120
and sexual orientation

506
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,530
which vary from person to person

507
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,000
And it’s not abnormal the way many people think

508
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,410
From a psychological perspective

509
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,550
attraction between men

510
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:04,740
or between women,

511
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,070
It’s not a matter of choice

512
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,030
but it’s about chemistry

513
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,730
and the heart’s true nature

514
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,140
Like a scent

515
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,490
that makes your heart race

516
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,310
without you knowing why

517
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,890
Love between two men

518
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,970
is no different from any other kind of love

519
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,620
It has doub

520
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,190
fear

521
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,840
sweetness

522
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,830
and the same questions in the heart

523
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:37,870
Sometimes,

524
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:39,690
sexual orientation

525
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,610
or what makes us feel safe

526
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,110
doesn’t come from sexual desire

527
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,100
it comes from experiences in childhood

528
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,590
Some people crave warmth

529
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,730
A need to be seen

530
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,680
Some just want to feel valued

531
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,370
by someone

532
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,900
This isn’t wrong

533
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,690
It’s how the human heart works

534
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,020
wanting love

535
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,410
in a way that makes us feel at ease

536
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,660
being who we truly are

537
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,650
When attraction begins

538
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,390
the body releases different chemicals

539
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,370
Dopamine

540
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,020
Oxytocin

541
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,850
Serotonin

542
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,580
These chemicals make our hearts race

543
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,490
our hands shake

544
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,190
or make you smile without noticing

545
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,570
It’s just natural chemistry

546
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,410
It doesn’t matter what gender you are

547
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:38,990
or who you’re in love with

548
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:43,140
It is the language of the heart

549
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,610
spoken before the mind has time to think

550
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,620
And in the end

551
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,220
love, in any form

552
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,540
Whether it’s man and man

553
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:53,810
man and woman

554
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:55,470
or anyone with anyone

555
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,470
they all hold equal value

556
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,710
As long as the love creates a safe space

557
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,200
and gives us the courage to be seen

558
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,040
for who we truly are.

559
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,790
You are listening to

560
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,190
The Art of Meaning Scene

561
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,710
the art of being seen

562
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:19,580
by someone

563
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,580
May your heart

564
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,550
find gentle rest tonight

565
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,000
Sasom

566
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,300
your father would like to see you.

567
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,870
If you become the brand ambassador

568
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,450
I’ll give you Tonnam's address

569
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,670
If you don’t agree

570
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,930
You’ll never see him till you die

571
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,240
What the hell is this about, Lek?

572
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,230
Do you get it now?

573
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,690
why I need Peach Lover as a safe place?

574
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,580
Can I help you with anything?

575
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,010
Call me DADDY!
