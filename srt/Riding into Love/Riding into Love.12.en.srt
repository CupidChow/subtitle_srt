1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,600
Qingtian.

3
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,560
What's wrong?

4
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,240
Your dad just left.

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,360
You are my only family in the world.

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,320
Please calm down.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,400
I hired a doctor for Qingtian.

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
She's fine.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,640
She's the best doctor in the country.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,720
Who are you?

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,720
My name is Ren Haoming.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,080
Qingtian's boyfriend.

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,120
Boyfriend?

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,760
My daughter has a boyfriend.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,080
needs my permission.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,039
If Dawang doesn't play,

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,360
if Dawang doesn't play cards.

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,840
You have a point.

19
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,360
I've been wanting to visit you

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,000
to get closer to you.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
But Qingtian said she would wait for her arrangement.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,720
We're from a small family.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,400
My daughter

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
is afraid you'll look down on us.

25
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,120
She has no plans.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,640
Fine.

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,120
He even broke off the engagement.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
This marriage

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,479
must not be anxious.

30
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,800
You must be careful.

31
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,720
Maybe...

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,039
I mean maybe.

33
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,120
maybe I wasn't considerate enough

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,040
and made Qingtian misunderstand.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,960
But actually,

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,480
my parents passed away.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,520
I also know that Qingtian's father is gone.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,720
I've always wanted to take you

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,120
to me and Qingtian.

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,320
After all,

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,360
the only old man beside me and Qingtian.

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
Besides, Qingtian and I are both young.

43
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,240
We need someone

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
needs a leader.

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,720
The chief will keep his word.

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,040
You are the most suitable one.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Do you mean it?

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,360
If I marry my daughter,

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,400
if I marry my daughter.

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,720
To be honest,

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
Now someone offers three million.

52
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,320
I told them.

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,640
My daughter is not a commodity.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,240
I can't sell my daughter.

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,360
Of course.

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,160
You brought her up.

57
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,960
Of course.

58
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,160
She's your precious daughter.

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,800
I've already prepared

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,160
the betrothal gifts.

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,040
Five million.

62
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,640
Five million.

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Really?

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,280
Five million.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,920
I'll get it when the doctor comes.

66
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,800
Mrs. Jiang, I gave you

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,720
to you alone.

68
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,400
I won't tell Qingtian.

69
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
All right, we won't say anything.

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,760
Why do I look more and more handsome now?

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,360
He's really good.

72
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,320
Hurry up.

73
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
How is the patient?

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,640
Show my daughter.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,320
Show it to my daughter.

76
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,520
So small.

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,240
Boss, you're so stingy.

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,920
Yes, boss.

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,480
As you,

80
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,320
This ring is a little small.

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,520
As much as you want.

82
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,160
You can donate as much as you want.

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,920
But I believe that

84
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,520
doesn't care about the amount.

85
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,520
Because she cares about my heart.

86
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,760
You're right.

87
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,000
Miss Ruan

88
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,480
is simple.

89
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,480
Very simple.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,800
and kind-hearted.

91
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,560
You two have to help me with my proposal.

92
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,800
Okay.

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,720
Uncle.

94
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,560
Haoming.

95
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,240
What are you doing?

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
Uncle, I kneeled

97
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,400
for your kindness to my father.

98
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,800
Get up.

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,640
Uncle, I want to tell you

100
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm getting married.

101
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
But the bride is not your daughter.

102
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,600
What did you say?

103
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,360
Say that again.

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,520
Sir.

105
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,120
I know you want me to be your son-in-law.

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
But in this world,

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
love is not about interests.

108
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
and fate.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,680
I know I'll let you down.

110
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,560
So please forgive me.

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,880
Don't talk so much.

112
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,720
I won't forgive you.

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,280
I only have one daughter.

114
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,240
If anyone hurts her,

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,480
if anyone hurt her.

116
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,760
Uncle, have you thought about it?

117
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,840
I don't love Xiaoxiao.

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
Even if I marry her,

119
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,200
will she be happy?

120
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,240
Of course.

121
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,000
Because she likes you.

122
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
As long as she gets you,

123
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,760
she will be happy.

124
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,040
I'm her father.

125
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,920
I only care about my daughter.

126
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
I'll do everything for my daughter.

127
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,200
So you have your choice.

128
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,480
I have my own choice.

129
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,560
Uncle.

130
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,000
Stop it.

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
Choose to marry my daughter

132
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
or your racecourse.

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,560
From the day you married someone else,

134
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,640
you have no clients.

135
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,440
You have absolute initiative in these two things.

136
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
Think about it.

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
This is the couple

138
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,400
with your husband.

139
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,920
look familiar.

140
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,400
You know him?

141
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,760
No.

142
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,160
The other party's family proposed a complaint.

143
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,080
Report?

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,480
This is really strange.

145
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,040
How dare they make a complaint?

146
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,840
Is there justice?

147
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,200
Is there justice?

148
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
Is this what they should do?

149
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,600
The reason they gave is

150
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,640
your husband Ruan Bin

151
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Without the master's permission,

152
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,560
without permission.

153
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,960
Nonsense!

154
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,480
My husband must be

155
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,240
to order clothes for them.

156
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,159
Let me tell you.

157
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,280
They want to make a high-end one.

158
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,560
and they don't want to pay.

159
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,120
My husband is a hard-to-find man.

160
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,440
You don't believe me? You...

161
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,080
Go out and ask around.

162
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,400
My husband

163
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,160
never got angry with anyone.

164
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,800
By the way,

165
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,880
he often goes to the orphanage

166
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,200
in the orphanage.

167
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,840
Let me tell you.

168
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,520
How is that possible?

169
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,880
He's a very nice person.

170
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Calm down.

171
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,920
I believe you.

172
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,560
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

173
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,159
Okay.

174
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,200
What is this?

175
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,400
Hwan, Hwan, where are you?

176
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Hayate!

177
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
It's back!

178
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
Yes.

179
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
To cure it,

180
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,200
to cure it.

181
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,800
This is for you.

182
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,960
For me?

183
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,600
Didn't you say

184
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,240
for the girl you've been having a crush on?

185
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,720
You little fool.

186
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
That person has always been you.

187
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,120
Now that we're exposed,

188
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll just say it.

189
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,360
Qingtian.

190
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,480
We've been through

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
along the way.

192
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,760
Especially after your accident,

193
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,280
I realized

194
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,840
how fragile life is.

195
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,280
how fragile we are.

196
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,920
So,

197
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
I cherish every moment with you.

198
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
I want to be with you every day.

199
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,240
Qingtian.

200
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,440
I love you.

201
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,880
Will you marry me?

202
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,800
Marry him! Marry him!

203
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,880
Marry him!

204
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,920
Marry him!

205
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,040
Marry him! Marry him!

206
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,280
I do!

207
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
Great!

208
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,880
Good. Congratulations.

209
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,840
Be happy.

210
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,520
Yes.

211
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,920
Be happy and grow old together.

212
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,960
I envy you so much.

213
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,880
Auntie.

214
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,720
This is my betrothal gift.

215
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,960
It's for you.

216
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,680
The password is Qingtian's birthday.

217
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Don't call me auntie.

218
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm going to change my name.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,480
or you?

220
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,200
Just be happy.

221
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
But Ren Haoming,

222
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,280
I have to make three rules with you.

223
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,480
First,

224
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,880
Don't beat my precious daughter after marriage.

225
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,480
Second,

226
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,240
don't look for a mistress outside.

227
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,360
And third,

228
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,160
Don't disrespect the elderly.

229
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,080
I'll do as you say.

230
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
It seems

231
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,720
my mom

232
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,280
care about her daughter's happiness.

233
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,600
My dear daughter.

234
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
Of course.

235
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,880
But we don't have much time.

236
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
I don't have time to get the marriage certificate.

237
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,720
Let's hold a wedding first.

238
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,600
and then get married in a wedding dress.

239
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
I think it's quite romantic.

240
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Sure.

241
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,320
Okay.

242
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,560
I'll listen to my daughter.

243
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,080
You're the boss.

244
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm the boss.

245
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,240
As long as you two are happy.

246
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,480
Long time no see.

247
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,920
Boss, do you need a phone?

248
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm talking about the food.

249
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,360
Hold it for me.

250
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,240
Wealth, what are you doing?

251
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
800 people are waiting for you.

252
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,640
I want to put my boss's phone in the cabinet.

253
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
Leave it to me.

254
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,920
Thank you.

255
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,040
Let's go.

256
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,120
Groom.

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,520
Do you have anything

258
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,720
to our guests?

259
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,600
First of all, thank you all

260
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,600
to witness our love.

261
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,880
Next,

262
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,760
is our most important part.

263
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,040
Do you have anything to say to our bride?

264
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,440
Ruan Qingtian, will you marry me?

265
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,160
It's too loud.

266
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,640
Can you hear it? No.

267
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,360
Nope. Louder.

268
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,960
Boss can't hear

269
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,600
Can't hear me Louder

270
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,360
Groom, say it again.

271
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,520
Shout out loud.

272
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,440
Ruan Qingtian, will you marry me?

273
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,160
Yes. Wait.

No, no.

284
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,760
