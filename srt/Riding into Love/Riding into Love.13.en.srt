1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief producer.

2
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,080
I found out this morning

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,040
Ruan Qingtian is Ruan Bin's daughter.

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,240
I was afraid the information was wrong.

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,600
So I took

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,040
with Ruan Qingtian's photo

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,240
and verified it there.

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,240
Then I texted you right away.

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,760
I guess your phone was with Wealth.

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,760
My phone was with Wealth.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,680
So I hurried here.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
All the information is here.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr Ren.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,200
I've been working

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,800
for ten years.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,240
I have responsibilities and obligations.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,200
to tell you all the important things

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,640
when you make the most important decision in your life.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,800
All right, I'm hanging up.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm leaving.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
I sincerely wish you happiness.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,720
Haoming! Haoming!

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,640
Haoming, where are you going?

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,920
Why didn't you answer the phone?

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,040
Haoming.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
Why didn't you answer the phone?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Daughter.

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,040
Who is it? What a mess.

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,000
Seriously.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,440
Look.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,160
I can't get married today.

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,480
It's so comfortable today.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,880
Go back first

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,720
I don't know.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,600
Sweetie.

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,480
Did you get through?

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Haoming is missing.

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,120
Mom.

41
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,880
Something must have happened to him.

42
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,520
It's a big deal.

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,160
Otherwise, he wouldn't be like this.

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,920
Look.

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
I don't know what he has drugged you.

46
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,040
If it were his cousin, Qiang,

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,440
He loves you wholeheartedly.

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,400
How could this happen?

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,240
No.

50
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,560
You're making my daughter suffer.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,440
Not only did you suffer,

52
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,520
It's a great insult.

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,440
I'll go find him.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,760
Stop messing around.

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm not messing around.

56
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm doing this for your own good.

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,440
I know you care about me.

58
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,240
but he must have

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,360
he had no choice.

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,560
Mom.

61
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
As his lover,

62
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,160
no matter what happens in the future,

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,120
I will face it with him.

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
No matter what the reason is,

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,840
to leave you alone at the wedding.

66
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,520
It's not like he killed his father.

67
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,920
Anyway, if he runs away like this,

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,160
He's a scumbag.

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,560
Stop it!

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,800
Stop it.

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,640
Mr Ren, Miss Ruan has left.

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,959
I see. You stay outside.

73
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't let her in.

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,040
Okay.

75
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
Mr Ren.

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Come in.

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
How is it?

78
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,920
I just got the news that

79
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,160
Ruan Bin had a first love who almost got married.

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,680
Ruan Bin gave her all the family heirloom jewellery.

81
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,320
This is the jade jewelry.

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,360
Your mother wore it

83
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,520
she wore it.

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,600
My mom often wears this set of jade.

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
You can't go in.

86
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm here to bring him food.

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,240
He hasn't eaten for a day.

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,240
Miss Ruan.

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,840
Listen to me.

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,240
Why don't you just

91
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,560
just fire me?

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,360
Mr Ren said

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,040
if you go in,

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,720
I'll just go home.

95
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
After all, you two didn't get married.

96
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,440
You're not his wife.

97
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,280
Fine.

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,840
Since he doesn't want to see me,

99
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,920
he must have his reasons.

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,040
Give this to him.

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,440
Make sure he eats it.

102
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,560
and tell him

103
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,280
even if the sky falls,

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,640
I'll hold on with him.

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,200
No matter what happens,

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,880
I will stand by his side.

107
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Thank you.

108
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Boss.

109
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,280
Haoming.

110
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,600
Haoming, are you hungry?

111
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,360
I brought you your favorite food.

112
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
What's wrong, Haoming?

113
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Haoming.

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,640
What happened?

115
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,840
You can tell me.

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,760
Let's call off the wedding.

117
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Luckily,

118
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,080
we didn't get married.

119
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,760
You mean

120
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,480
the wedding is not postponed.

121
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,520
It was cancelled.

122
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Why?

123
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,720
What happened?

124
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
Haoming, don't be like this.

125
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,720
What can I bear with you?

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,280
Since I chose to marry you,

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,480
I'll walk the same path with you.

128
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,680
Let's work together

129
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't care

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,159
I don't care.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
As long as we are together,

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,280
is the happiest.

133
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,040
Enough, stop it.

134
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,320
I just don't want to get married.

135
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,600
This is my decision.

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,240
Haoming, no matter what happens,

137
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
no matter what happens,

138
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,120
it doesn't matter.

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
I don't care.

140
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,960
We can sleep on the floor together.

141
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,520
I can make you instant noodles.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,960
I can arrange flowers.

143
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,720
I can make a lot of money.

144
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,080
I can support you.

145
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,840
Ruan Qingtian.

146
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Ruan Qingtian.

147
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,040
Can you stop crying?

148
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't want to see you like this.

149
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,920
Get out!

150
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,720
I don't want to see you now.

151
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,680
No, Haoming. I'm not leaving.

152
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
Get out.

153
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,920
I'm not leaving.

154
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,760
Get out.

155
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,040
Haoming.

156
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,360
You haven't eaten much lately.

157
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,840
I prepared some side dishes for you.

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,120
Eat more.

159
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,360
I'll peel another egg for you.

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,320
I don't need you.

161
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,520
I'll peel it for him.

162
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,160
Haoming ignores you.

163
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,400
What are you doing here?

164
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,280
This is between us.

165
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,920
You're an outsider.

166
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
What a joke. He didn't marry you.

167
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
You're not an outsider.

168
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,240
Haoming, this is the porridge I made for you. Try it.

169
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,120
Ren Haoming.

170
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,560
At the wedding,

171
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,480
You left me

172
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,080
And now you ignore me

173
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,560
At this moment,

174
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,440
and having breakfast

175
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,680
with a single woman.

176
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,800
What do you mean?

177
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
Did I offend you?

178
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,600
Or did my moral defect

179
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,240
to ignore me?

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,240
Ruan Qingtian, I don't want to talk to you now.

181
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,120
You're so shameless.

182
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,200
He doesn't even want to talk to you.

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,520
Stop pulling and pulling.

184
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,120
Ruan Qingtian.

185
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,200
Listen.

186
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm engaged to him.

187
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
This is my house.

188
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,680
Get lost!

189
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,200
What marriage?

190
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,360
You're trash.

191
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
A piece of trash that no man wants.

192
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,120
Ruan Qingtian.
