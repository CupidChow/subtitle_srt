1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Director.

2
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,920
Later,

3
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,840
when you leave this door,

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,480
you take another elevator.

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,240
Wait for me at B3.

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,680
Okay.

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,960
I'll move the car at B2.

8
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,640
After that,

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,080
I'll go to B3 to find you.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,240
Let's meet at B3.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,160
Got it?

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,040
Can you do it?

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,960
No problem.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,360
Hurry up.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,400
Don't panic.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,440
Where are we going?

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,160
Honey!

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,360
Calm down.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,520
Calm down.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,200
It's not what you think.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,160
Let me explain.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,640
Let me explain.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Have you been

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,039
behind my back?

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,240
It's been so long.

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,759
I didn't know.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,080
I'll beat you to death!

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,720
I'll kill you!

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,479
Who cheated on you?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's not what you think.

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,759
You bastards!

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,960
Hit me!

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,039
I'll kill you two!

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,200
You bitch!

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,920
Let go!

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,840
I'll strangle you to death.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,160
Let the wind blow and let the grass green.

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,720
Let the heart

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,920
Let warmth slowly

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,079
I, Ruan Qingtian,

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,840
will say goodbye

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,680
with my past.

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,520
When I take over the big farm,

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,840
I'll take my parents over.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,120
Ruan Qingtian.

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,240
I finally got you.

47
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,520
Ruan Qingtian.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
You're finally here.

49
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
But don't worry.

50
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,880
This time,

51
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,960
I will never fall in love with you.

52
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,840
Wake up.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,720
Wake up.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Who are you?

55
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
Is this my prize?

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,640
My prize.

57
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
It's really a farm.

58
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,040
I love this place.

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,880
Miss.

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,520
Let me tell you.

61
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
I have that certificate.

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm the owner of this farm now.

63
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,200
I'll find it for you.

64
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,960
Stop, Miss.

65
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,480
No strangers are allowed to enter our farm.

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,360
Get out!

67
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,840
Let go!

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Who are you?

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,920
Who are you?

70
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,680
Xiaoxiao.

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
I don't know where he came from.

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,000
Aren't you the one

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,840
at the auction last time?

74
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,280
Why are you at our farm?

75
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,320
Isn't this Yonhwa Farm?

76
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,840
It's mine now.

77
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,080
I have a certificate.

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,400
Oh, right.

79
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,000
I found your thing that day

80
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,240
and dropped it at the auction.

81
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,040
and found this you missed.

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,040
Here.

83
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,600
What are you doing?

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,040
Why did you tear my certificate?

85
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,760
Why did you tear my certificate?

86
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,200
Just tear it.

87
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,400
Don't...

88
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,880
How dare you bite me?

89
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,920
I'll kill you.

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,800
What are you doing?

91
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,440
Stop fighting!

92
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,360
How dare you bite me!

93
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,960
Stop fighting!

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,200
What are you doing?

95
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,160
Go down.

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,080
Stop! I'll strangle you!

97
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,720
Xiaoxiao!

98
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,640
Let go of me!

99
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,680
What are you doing?

100
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,760
Get down!

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,800
You hit me first.

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,160
Let me tell you.

103
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,120
I told you long ago.

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,440
Stop fighting.

105
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,400
What are you doing? This woman is quite bold.

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,840
Let go of me! I’ll kill you!

107
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,720
Xiaoxiao.

108
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,240
What are you doing?

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
Younian.

110
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
Let me introduce.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,480
This is Ruan Qingtian, the new owner of Yuhua Farm.

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
What?

113
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
You are Ruan Qingtian?

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,360
So you're here.

115
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,040
Is this a gift from God?

116
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
Not Haoming.

117
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm the general manager of this racecourse.

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,520
I brought all the clients here.

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
Why should I give her an outsider?

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,920
That's right.

121
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,000
Because I won the prize.

122
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
This farm is mine now.

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,760
I've completed the transaction procedure.

124
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Let me tell you.

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,360
If you don't go easy on me,

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,320
I'll fire all of you.

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,840
You...

128
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,920
Fired?

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,200
Do you know what you're talking about?

130
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,720
Mr. Ren is the owner of this 200 mu farm.

131
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,240
One hundred and ninety mu is a double-armed farm.

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,120
Ten mu is Yanghua Farm.

133
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,920
Miss Xiaoxiao's father

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,920
is one of the shareholders of YUA Farm.

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,400
You mean

136
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,880
this farm belongs to Mr. Ren.

137
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,200
If I win the award, it will be mine.

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,320
Mr. Ren is always doing good deeds.

139
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,160
He donated countless things.

140
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,920
Haoming.

141
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
Did you know her long ago?

142
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
Did you leave with her at the last auction?

143
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,560
I've been asking you.

144
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
You refused to tell me.

145
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,480
That horse

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,640
was sold to them by her husband.

147
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,480
You're crazy.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,360
What?

149
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,320
The horse was killed.

150
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,200
Stop playing dumb.

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Aren't you

152
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,120
the new wife of Mr. Qian?

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,200
What birthday?

154
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Nonsense.

155
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
You bought the champion horse

156
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,760
for biochemical medicine.

157
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,159
He will be punished sooner or later.

158
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,159
No, he spent so much money on horses.

159
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,760
How could he kill a horse?

160
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,520
Is money crazy?

161
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,600
You're all bad guys.

162
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,720
Many calls are strange to you.

163
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,080
Alright.

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,960
Wealth.

165
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,280
Take Miss Ruan to her place.

166
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,240
I have something to deal with.

167
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,520
There must be something urgent. You should...

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,680
Haoming.

169
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,120
Good.

170
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,400
It's not fun just drinking.

171
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,760
Shouldn't we find two girls?

172
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
Yes.

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She said she would come.

174
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,120
Did you send the horse to the anatomy room?

175
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Why did you lie to me?

176
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,240
Why did you send the horse to the anatomy room?

177
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,040
That's a champion horse.

178
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,880
That's why we need to dissect it.

179
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,760
If we don't dissect it,

180
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,720
Should I dissect a silly horse?

181
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,400
He asked me to do this.

182
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,040
I just asked you for a small favor.

183
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,360
Is it that serious?

184
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,040
You took a penny.

185
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't think about that.

186
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,440
Your mother can come to me if she needs money.

187
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,200
Come on.

188
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Sit down and have a drink.

189
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,840
You asked me to take a horse for you that day.

190
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,120
I didn't say I was going to send it to an autopsy.

191
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,360
You...

192
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,760
Are you a human?

193
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,040
You're a jerk.

194

229
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
When did I seduce a man?

230
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,360
I told you to check your place,

231
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,160
but you went to the old bastard.

232
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,400

I went to fight with him.

235
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
He lied to me.

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,800
Why can't you trust me?

237
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
Why should I?

238
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,920
You went in and out with that scoundrel.

239
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,000
Everyone calls you Mrs. Qian.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
but you are not Mrs. Qian.

241
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,320
You took his money, right?

242
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,760
Tell me how much you are now.

243
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,720
I don't want to talk to you right now.

244
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Let me go.

245
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,760

Come down and have a look.

263
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,560
