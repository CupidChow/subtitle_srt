1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief producer.

2
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,440
What are you making?

3
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,600
Is it for people

4
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,040
It's for people.

5
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,680
But I don't know if you're human or not.

6
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,440
If I'm not human,

7
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,479
then what are you?

8
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,639
Maid Ruan.

9
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
Haoming doesn't like this dish.

10
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,800
Do it again.

11
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,680
Ruan Qingtian.

12
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,880
Don't forget our contract.

13
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,720
You're a nanny in this farm.

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,800
Mind your position.

15
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
Xiaoxiao.

16
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Don't go too far.

17
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,200
What's wrong?

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,040
I asked my babysitter to cook.

19
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,760
Are you angry?

20
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,240
Your farm?

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,560
I have more shares than you.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,920
This farm

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,800
it has to be our farm.

24
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,640
Qiang, you're just protecting her.

25
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,480
Yes, I'll protect her.

26
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,600
Not only did I protect her,

27
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,240
I'm also on the side of logic.

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,760
I won't eat this meal.

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,480
Goodbye.

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,120
Whatever.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,360
Whatever.

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,840
Qingtian.

33
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,920
Sit down.

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
I can't stand her smug face.

35
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,840
She used chicken feathers as an order arrow.

36
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,320
Thank you.

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,520
How about I make another dish for you?

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Okay.

39
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,280
Here.

40
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,160
It smells good.

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Try this.

42
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
You're so pretty.

43
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
You do it first.

44
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,200
You eat first.

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,360
I'm not eating.

46
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
You eat it.

47
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,720
How is it?

48
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
It tastes great.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,800
That's it.

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,400
If you like it,

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,040
I'll make more in the future.

52
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,080
Let me feed you.

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,240
You eat.

54
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,880
No need.

55
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
Why are you so angry?

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,440
You didn't even eat.

57
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
I asked Hwan to prepare some for you.

58
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,040
I don't want to eat.

59
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
Haoming, stop torturing yourself.

60
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,120
You're no longer with Ruan Qingtian.

61
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
Stop interfering with your cousin.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,440
I'll always be by your side.

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,800
I'll always be with you.

64
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,280
Xiaoxiao.

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,320
We're just partners.

66
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,520
Don't cross the line.

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,560
Why? Am I not good enough to you?

68
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,760
What's so good about Ruan Qingtian?

69
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Why are you all

70
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
love her so much?

71
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,840
If you love her so much,

72
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,080
why did you use me to hurt her?

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,480
I used you, Xiaoxiao.

74
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,120
If you think I used you,

75
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
it must be my fault.

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,000
I apologize.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
I don't need an apology.

78
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,240
I just need you to love me.

79
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,159
I'll tell you an unexpected news.

80
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
Qiang took your Ruan Qingtian

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,520
to a romantic place.

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,280
Qiang wants to propose to Ruan Qingtian.

83
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
What?

84
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,040
If you can make it in time, you can witness

85
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,120
Qingtian.

86
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
Let go!

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll leave.

88
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,040
Okay, wait a moment.

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,880
Wait for me.

90
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
Surprise, Qingtian.

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
Today is the first weekend

92
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400
with you.

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
I want to give you a different surprise.

94
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,240
What do you think?

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,960
Do you like it?

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,720
Qingtian.

97
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,680
Marry me.

98
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
I know everything came too fast.

99
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,159
But I've been waiting for this moment

100
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,960
for this moment.

101
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,880
I've been waiting since college.

102
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,440
Marry me, Qingtian.

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,720
I'll make you the happiest woman

104
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,200
in this world.

105
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,960
You can't be with him.

106
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,640
Can you be with Qingtian?

107
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,080
She hasn't said anything.

108
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,640
What are you doing?

109
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,080
Let go of me!

110
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,480
Do you know who I am?

111
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,280
Let go of me!

112
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,920
Let go!

113
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,240
Let go!

114
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
I have nothing to do with you.

115
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,920
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

116
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,640
Qingtian.

117
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,880
Haoming.

118
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,760
Haoming.

119
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,960
Haoming. Haoming.

120
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
Okay.

121
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,240
The medicine can't stop.

122
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,159
Don't get wet. Okay. Okay.

123
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,080
Doctor.

124
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,200
Should I cook some ribs for him?

125
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,560
No need.

126
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,720
Mr. Ren doesn't lack calcium.

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,960
He lacks love.

128
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,920
My love.

129
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,920
I’m leaving if there’s nothing else.

130
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,880
Miss Xiaoxiao,

131
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,440
Call me if you need anything.

132
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Okay.

133
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,320
Thank you, Dr Li.

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,440
This way, please.

135
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,000
Haoming.

136
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,520
Do you still have me in your heart?

137
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,840
I can feel your feelings.

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,640
I still love you.

139
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,320
No matter what happened in the past,

140
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,880
let's not be against the past.

141
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,880
Don't be hard on the past.

142
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,200
And don't go against your heart.

143
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm going against you.

144
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
Get out of here!

145
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,840
I'm right if you don't reply.

146
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,280
I won't give up.

147
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,520
Get out of here!

148
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,480
Get out!

149
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,120
Who's there?

150
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,560
I heard that little Hayate is sick.

151
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,120
Little Hayate?

152
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,440
Haoming.

153
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,480
Why are you here?

154
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
Haoming. Haoming.

155
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,960
Can we talk?

156
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,960
If you don't want to see me,

157
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,760
I can only ask you out in this way.

158
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,040
Haoming.

159
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
I know you still love me.

160
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,240
Otherwise, you wouldn't get hurt because of me.

161
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,400
Let's be together again, okay?

162
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,240
Haoming, I can't sleep every night.

163
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,680
When I open my eyes, it's all about you.

164
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,960
You can call me a lovesick

165
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,760
or a psycho.

166
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,600
But...

167
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,200
But I really want to be with you.

168
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
Haoming, I...

169
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,760
I...

170
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,440
Ruan Qingtian.

171
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
There are things

172
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,400
can't be forced.

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Don't say these to me anymore.

174
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
Don't cry anymore.

175
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Haoming.

176
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,280
Mr Ren, your wine.

177
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,560
This is the bear blanket I made for you.

178
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,800
Flowers and cooking are my favorite.

179
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,520
You are also my favorite.

180
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,320
Haoming, can we be together again?

181
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,480
Xiaoxiao.

182
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,960
Come and taste the food Ruan Qingtian made for us.

183
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,960
Coming.

184
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,400
Thank you for cooking for us.

185
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,280
Let me introduce

186
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,840
This is my boyfriend, Ren Haoming.

187
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,360
Ren Haoming.

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
I want to ask you one last time.

189
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,800
Why did you leave me on the wedding day?

190
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,440
Is it related to that photo?

191
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,640
Yes.

192
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,360
