1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief producer.

2
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,480
Mr. Ren.

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,120
The man who fell off the building

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,040
his family filed a lawsuit against us.

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,320
and asked us for 2 million compensation.

6
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,480
The reason for the lawsuit

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,760
What an eye-opener.

8
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,440
You came to my house

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
and killed my parents.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,320
How dare you ask me for compensation?

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
What a jerk.

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,760
Do you think we should settle in private

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,200
or the court?

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,280
Why should we settle?

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,039
But appeal

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,600
I don't think it's a good idea.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,520
We can't expand the influence.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,120
How about this? Go to the other party

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
to see if there is any other way

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,280
to negotiate with each other.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,480
Okay, I'll negotiate as soon as possible.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,440
Put your hands down.

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,440
Your hands will stain their photos.

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,680
Xiaoxiao, I was about to explain to you.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Explain what?

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,120
Explain why Haoming is with you.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,240
Explain why Wealth

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,800
lying on the same bed with me.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,039
No.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,039
Ren Haoming already knew.

31
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,680
He's prepared.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Ruan Qingtian.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,120
I underestimated you.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,400
You planned all this.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,160
You wanted to see me

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,640
You want to make a fool of me and get what you want?

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
Stop pretending.

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,120
When I see you now,

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
the angrier I look at you.

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,640
Why isn't my office door closed?

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,360
Qingtian.

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,480
Why did you push me?

43
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,880
What's wrong?

44
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,120
Are you okay?

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,000
It hurts.

46
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,160
Are you okay?

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,880
Come on.

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
Haoming.

49
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,480
I wanted to persuade Qingtian not to leave.

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,920
You were so nice to her.

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,079
Who knew

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,760
she pushed me down for no reason.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,240
Xiaoxiao.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
Why are you lying with your eyes open?

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,760
Stop being a green tea.

56
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,079
Is Haoming not good enough to you?

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
Who is the green tea?

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,680
You're the green tea.

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,960
How did he treat me well?

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,160
Xiaoxiao.

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,600
Are you okay?

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,960
Are you hurt?

63
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,800
I'm fine.

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,640
Ruan Qingtian.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Since you think I'm not good to you,

66
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
you don't need to drink

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,480
I prepared for you.

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,079
I don't need you to make me poisoned chicken soup.

69
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,280
I don't need it.

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,079
Get out.

71
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,760
I don't want to see you.

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,960
Get out.

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,680
What are you doing?

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
What are you doing?

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,760
What are you doing?

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,240
This is where you should be.

77
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,960
Ren Haoming, you're a devil.

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
I don't want to see you.

79
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
You don't want to see or feel annoyed?

80
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
I'll help you.

81
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,680
What are you doing?

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you leaving me here again?

83
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,840
There's only one thing you can do now.

84
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,079
That is to wake my cousin up as soon as possible.

85
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,640
Fine.

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,880
It's all because of you.

87
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,640
It's like I owe you.

88
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
Let me tell you.

89
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,360
If it weren't for

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,720
you were lying here and slapped me,

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
I wish I could...

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,320
Don't you dare!

93
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
If you dare to hurt Qiang,

94
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,760
I’ll kill you.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
Lee Hwan-hwan

96
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,800
cares about Qiang so much.

97
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,240
How about...

98
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,600
Qiang.

99
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,320
What's wrong, Qiang?

100
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,440
Are you okay?

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,120
Wake up!

102
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,400
Ruan Qingtian, are you crazy?

103
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,120
Don't be happy, Qiang.

104
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,520
Ruan Qingtian, what are you doing?

105
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,680
Qiang.

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,640
Ruan Qingtian.

107
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,720
Qiang, don't go.

108
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,600
Mr Ren, look at her.

109
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,520
Qiang.

110
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,200
Ruan Qingtian.

111
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

112
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,720
Qiang.

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Don't let go.

114
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,680
Stay still!

115
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,720
Let go of me!

116
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,520
Keung!

117
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,760
Qiang!

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,800
Come out!

119
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,240
I'll be back, Qiang.

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,760
I'll be back.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,560
Qiang.

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,160
Qiang.

123
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,360
Come on.

124
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,880
Ruan Qingtian.

125
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,360
Do you really like Qiang that much?

126
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,640
Yes, I like him.

127
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,760
He's good in everything.

128
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,560
Everything.

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,400
How is he better than me?

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
You want to know?

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,280
Do you want to learn? Can you?

132
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Oh, right.

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,440
I remember.

134
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,280
When you were in school,

135
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,360
you were not as good as your brother.

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,640
Get to work.

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
Fine.

138
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,360
Be careful.

139
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,120
Someone is hit. Let’s go and have a look.

140
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
Mr. Ren, are you okay?

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,840
Ruan Qingtian.

142
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,360
Can't you behave yourself?

143
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,520
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,960
I hurt you.

145
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
Are you hurt anywhere?

146
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,000
Let me take a look.

147
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,720
It hurts.

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,040
This...

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you doing?

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,640
Take off your clothes

151
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,680
I have to take off my clothes too.

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,760
Are you a Gu mi ho?

153
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,800
Can you get it without taking off your clothes?

154
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,040
You'll break it if you pull it like this.

155
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,760
Stop dawdling.

156
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,840
I can't wait.

157
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,760
It's swelling.

158
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,640
Let me help you.

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,480
Does it hurt?

160
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Be gentle.

161
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me blow on it for you.

162
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
Hang in there.

163
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,160
Change a pose.

164
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,240
Blow it.

165
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,720
What are you doing sneakily?

166
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
Stop talking.

167
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,800
Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?

168
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,560
Calm down.

169
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,200
freedom is precious.

170
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,120
Crime is not worth it.

171
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Stop pretending.

172
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
I asked the doctor.

173
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,360
Your leg is fine.

174
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,680
It's Ren Haoming who forced you to put the cast on.

175
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,600
Don't thank me.

176
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,160
I just don't want you to pretend to be pitiful anymore.

177
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,360
Well done, Ren Haoming.

178
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,040
How dare you lie to me!

179
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,800
I'll teach you a lesson.

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,520
Qingtian.

181
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,480
Look what I brought you.

182
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,559
Why are you covering your legs?

183
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,919
Are you cold?

184
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
My leg.

185
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,040
It's gone.

186
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
Fine.

187
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,760
How dare you lie to me now?

188
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,760
Look, my legs are fine.

189
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,920
I don't want to

190
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,120
to stay here

191
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,920
in this world.

192
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,080
I don't want to stay any longer.
