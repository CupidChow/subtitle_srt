1
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,800
Director.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,120
Hello.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
Zhang Wook.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,120
Rouge.

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,120
Apologize to her mother.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,520
No.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,400
Then leave the racecourse.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,680
My racecourse is full of people who never change.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,000
Haoming.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,520
If I leave,

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,480
they won't know how to bully you.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,840
Mom, what are you talking about with the banner?

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,360
I didn't say anything wrong.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,880
Go back first.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,640
I can handle the money myself.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,080
Don't cause any more trouble, okay?

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,480
Daughter,

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
Mom, I beg you.

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,720
Just go.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm really tired.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,680
Go home first.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,520
When I'm done,

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,720
I'll go home and accompany you.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,800
Okay?

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,080
Go back to the house

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,480
and my home.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,240
I caused you trouble again.

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,520
But I'm doing this for your own good.

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,960
I really don't want

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
When my daughter got married,

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,160
his mother had gambling debts.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,759
You shouldn't take his money.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,680
He... He's marrying my daughter.

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,080
If I don't want it from him,

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,360
Who should I ask for it from?

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,800
Alright.

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,479
I'm hanging up.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,160
I'll get you a better one.

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
What stupid farm owner?

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,640
Mom, I don't want to get married anymore.

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,520
I just want to take good care of you.

42
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,320
and run this farm well.

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,400
I'll pay you back.

44
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,320
Daughter.

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,560
Alright, go.

46
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,960
Go.

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's go.

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,560
Miss Ruan, don't be sad about something.

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
I'll get some food for Mr. Ren.

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Five million.

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,720
Five million.

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,920
Where can I get the 5 million?

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,440
Here.

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,920
Why are you giving me this?

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,360
I know everything.

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
Give this back to him.

57
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,200
I'll take care of my own business.

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,840
But thank you.

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,160
Are you still blaming me?

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,640
I know.

61
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,040
I made a mistake.

62
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,800
I won't defend myself.

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,200
The hurt I hurt you

64
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,440
doesn't disappear easily.

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,240
But I want to tell you

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
I've always liked you.

67
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,480
The first time I saw you in college,

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,600
when I first saw you in college.

69
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,120
Especially your dimples.

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,600
Everything I did to you before

71
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
because I like you.

72
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,920
But

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
when I found out your relationship with Haoming,

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,000
I was so jealous.

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,800
That's why I made those irreparable mistakes.

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,600
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,240
Let bygones be bygones.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,760
Take the card and return it to him.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,440
That's different.

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,480
I won't take your money.

81
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,000
I will

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,600
the money I owe him.

83
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,600
I can’t owe others money

84
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,480
because I have to pay him back.

85
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Okay.

86
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
I respect you.

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
But I hope I can be with you one day.

88
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
It's impossible.

89
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,000
Haoming, as you know,

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,360
Ruan Qingtian is always paid.

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
That's a different matter.

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,480
to apologize.

93
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,240
What about your mom?

94
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
What do you want?

95
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,200
Apologize to your mom.

96
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,200
No need. My mom has left.

97
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,600
I shouldn't scare your mom with scissors.

99
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't accept her apology.

100
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,640
My mom did something bad to you.

102
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,640
I apologize on behalf of my mom.

103
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,120
You're quite popular.

104
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,680
Someone even helped you pay the betrothal gifts.

105
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,520
Tell me, what do you want?

106
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,640
Let me ask you.

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,520
Did you steal the photo?

108
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,200
What photo?

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
I remember.

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,800
What photo?

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
If you say I stole it,

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm suddenly curious.

113
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,080
What kind of photo is it?

114
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
to frame me for stealing?

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,720
Forget it. Since you didn't take it,

116
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
I won't ask.

117
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,640
You can leave.

118
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,840
Give me back the money you owe me first.

119
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you know that I have nothing

120
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
I have nothing.

121
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,680
Ren Haoming, what do you mean?

122
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,440
I thought you didn't know.

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,320
Didn't your mom say I've tarnished your innocence?

124
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,000
Are you going to exchange your innocence

125
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,520
with your innocence?

126
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,320
Shameless!

127
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
What are you doing?

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,800
You owe me.

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600
You're still so arrogant.

130
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,840
Ren Haoming.

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
You two work together

132
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,240
to insult me, right?

133
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Haoming, what's wrong with you?

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
What?

135
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,160
The person who assaulted you is here again.

136
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,720
Haoming, do me a favor.

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,880
That's all for now.

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
I'll pay her back, okay?

139
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,640
What dignity?

140
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,800
You used my trust in you

141
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,480
with my trust in you,

142
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,720
or again and again.

143
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,960
I admit that you are my cousin.

144
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,600
But you've trampled on my bottom line.

145
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,000
Ruan Qingtian, sign this for me.

146
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,320
When can you leave

147
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,800
you can leave.

148
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,680
Haoming, are you treating Qingtian as a nanny or a maid?

149
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,040
Ren Haoming, do you have any humanity?

150
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,240
It's only right to pay your debt.

151
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,320
What's wrong with paying for the loss?

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160
Shut up!

153
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
It's okay.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
It's just housework.

155
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,559
hour labour and horse farm cleaning, right?

156
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll do it.

157
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,880
Yes.

158
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,240
I can only count on you.

159
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,960
Otherwise, how can I let my parents down?

160
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,840
Qingtian.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
What's wrong, Qingtian?

162
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Are you hurt?

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,040
Here, Qingtian.

164
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,080
Be careful.

165
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,840
Slowly.

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,560
Are you hurt?

167
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,960
Are you stupid?

168
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,720
I've been working hard all day.

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
I have to work at the farm at night.

170
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,080
How much energy do you have?

171
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,240
Do you want to die?

172
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,680
When can we clear the stable?

173
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,160
Why do you have to come in the middle of the night?

174
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,520
If you get infected,

175
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,520
the horse will get sick.

176
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,240
No.

177
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,440
Slow down.

178
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,760
Stop it.

179
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,840
It's okay, Qingtian.

180
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,800
What are you doing?

181
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,360
Qingtian, you...

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,160
Go to bed early.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,120
He fainted just now.

184
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,200
Stop it

185
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,200
Slow down.

186
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
Listen to me, Qingtian.

187
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,280
You should go back.

188
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,320
Qingtian.

189
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,040
Can you stop working so hard?

190
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,520
Not bad.

191
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
You should go back and rest.

192
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,920
