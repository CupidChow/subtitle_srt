1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Director.

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,520
Be careful.

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,120
Don't break it.

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Okay. Don't worry.

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,800
This is the fifth branch

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,040
of our boss, right?

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,000
Of course.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,000
I heard the sixth family is getting ready.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,800
I have no choice.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,760
Our boss's good taste and design

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
are unique.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,120
She works so hard.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,040
If she doesn't make money, who will?

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,360
Alright, stop flattering me.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,360
Get these flowers on the shelf.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,640
Okay.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,920
Hurry up.

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,960
Welfare home

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,560
Congratulations.

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,280
Good day.

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,560
Thank you.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,840
Thank you.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,120
Please support us in the future.

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,720
Why are you here?

25
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,640
The place where your mother and Ruan Bin often meet.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,720
I found it.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,840
Let's go.

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,000
Why is he leaving?

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,520
What's going on?

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,000
You're leaving right after the opening?

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,080
Where are you going?

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,080
Hello, Dean.

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,680
Hello.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,960
My name is Ruan Qingtian.

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,479
Ruan Bin's daughter.

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,600
I came here to see it for my father.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,920
So you're Ruan Bin's daughter.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,240
Your father is a good man.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,320
All the kids here like him.

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,760
My father passed away a while ago.

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,800
Hello, Dean.

42
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,320
Hello.

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,440
Let's go in and have a look.

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,720
Okay, thank you.

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,960
Please come in.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,079
Please come in.

47
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,920
Mr Ren, this is it.

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
I'll park the car first.

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Hello.

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,800
Are you here for an event

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,079
Yes.

52
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,400
Is this your first time here?

53
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,480
Relax.

54
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,600
We are here for charity activities.

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,000
Help the kids here.

56
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,079
Won can relax

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
It's my first time here too.

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,960
But my mother used to come here often.

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
Your mother is...

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,760
Chunci.

61
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
You are Ms. Chun’s son?

62
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,080
Chris's mom

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,440
is really kind.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,240
He often comes to our school

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,680
to do charity work for the kids.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,560
So the kids like her.

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,320
Do you mean

68
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,040
Chunci.

69
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,600
She and your dad met here.

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,360
They often come here to accompany the kids.

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,280
and send them cakes and toys.

72
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,040
Sir, are you talking about Ruan Bin's father?

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,160
Ruan Bin's dad hasn't visited us this year.

74
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,240
I like Ruan Bin's dad very much.

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,800
Thank you for remembering Ruan Bin's father.

76
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,720
From now on,

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,120
I'll take care of you for Mr Ruan.

78
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,240
Okay?

79
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,720
You're as emotional as your dad.

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Your dad has a hard life too.

81
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,960
How did he die?

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,280
He accidentally fell off the building.

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,000
Your dad loves your mom so much.

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,520
Your mom can't accept the shock.

85
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Hello, Mr. Bai.

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,200
Hello, Ms. Bai.

87
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,680
Every time your mother comes here,

88
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,400
every time she comes here.

89
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
and bring them clothes.

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,960
and cook.

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,480
These kids

92
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
call you Mommy

93
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,760
Ms. Bom.

94
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,320
My mom comes often.

95
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
But I don't know anything.

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Am I a failure as her son?

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,040
Don't talk nonsense. Your mother always thinks

98
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
you are the best child in the world.

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
Sometimes she often bragged to us

100
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,640
how young and promising her son is.

101
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,480
She is proud of you.

102
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,440
She always said she was afraid that you would get hurt

103
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,400
so she put you in the basketball court.

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,159
That's why you're very introverted.

105
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
You are very autistic.

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,120
That's what she regret the most.

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,000
My mom always keeps everything in her heart.

108
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
I don't know that.

109
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,200
Thank you, Aunt Bai.

110
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Don't mention it. When I see your mom next time,

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,160
I'll talk to her.

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
and see how she raised

113
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
such a good kid.

114
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,920
My mom can't come.

115
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,800
Is she afraid of being caught by your dad?

116
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
My bad.

117
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,680
Why do I remember this now?

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Aunt Bai.

119
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Do you know

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
She's running away from home with someone else?

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,480
Let's go.

122
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,600
Qingtian, this is Ms. Chris's son.

123
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,760
Is Chris's mom Ren Haoming's mother?

124
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
Chunci.

125
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,040
Haoming.

126
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,600
This is Qingtian.

127
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Her dad and your mother are best friends.

128
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
They are indeed here.

129
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
They actually knew each other

130
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,880
20 years ago.

131
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,720
At that time,

132
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,080
your father and Chunci

133
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,200
often come here to show love.

134
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,480
Your parents fell in love with each other here.

135
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,600
But Chunci’s family went bankrupt.

136
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,080
Chunci’s father

137
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,200
married ChunCi to your father.

138
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,480
Your father Ruan Bin got married after that.

139
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
After each other had their own families,

140
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,920
they stopped seeing each other.

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,200
Ruan Bin has always come to the orphanage to show his love.

142
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
and has never stopped.

143
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,560
Chunci came here since last year.

144
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,960
They met again.

145
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,640
Hold on.

146
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,560
This is their group photo.

147
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
or last year's photos?

148
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,840
Back then, they were a perfect couple.

149
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,640
They came from a good family

150
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,600
and kind.

151
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,000
If Chunci’s family hadn’t gone bankrupt,

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,160
they would have been together.

153
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,640
What a coincidence.

154
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,080
When Ruan Bin came,

155
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,480
Chunci was here.

156
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
They are old friends.

157
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,400
to catch up.

158
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,600
But

159
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,760
Chunci accidentally tripped by the kid.

160
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
and showed her wounds.

161
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,400
We all know

162
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
how hard she has been these years.

163
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,480
Xiao Ruan said she felt sorry for Chunci.

164
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,159
If she had persisted,

165
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
Chunci wouldn’t have married your dad.

166
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,480
Chunci said he wanted to live his own life

167
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,960
and wants to live her life.

168
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,560
Please help her.

169
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,840
Is it that simple?

170
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,800
Your mother.

171
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,960
Do you still suspect her?

172
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,640
She's such a proud person.

173
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,720
cares about you so much.

174
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,200
How could she elope with someone else?

175
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,440
Thank you, Dean.

176
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Thank you, Auntie Bai.

177
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,600
I believe my mom.

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,680
If she knows,

179
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,000
she will be very happy.

180
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
I misunderstood.

182
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,559
I'm sorry to Uncle Ruan.

183
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,120
It's all in the past.

184
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,800
You just let her go?

185
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,120
What can you say if she stays?

186
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,840
Cousin

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,680
Cousin, why are you here?

188
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,240
You are only allowed to enter the final.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
How can we compete on the court?

190
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,240
What?

191
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,120
