1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief producer.

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,240
Ruan Qingtian, why did you call me here?

3
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,960
Why?

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,160
Because this is where I fell in love with you blindly.

5
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,880
I still remember that day when I was taking photos here,

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,880
You almost hit me on a horse.

7
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,800
Get out of my way.

8
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,360
That was the first time I saw you.

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,320
I felt like I saw a god.

10
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,960
What are you waiting for?

11
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,200
Luckily, I'm good at horse riding.

12
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,640
I feel sick seeing you now.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,920
Are you done?

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
Of course not.

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,280
Then you can't hit me anymore.

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,759
Do you know why I hit you?

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,479
Because you owe me.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
because of this, right?

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,840
You knew?

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If I hadn't found my dad's email,

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,280
I would never have known it.

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
or even until I die.

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,400
why you did this to me.

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,240
Ren Haoming.

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,640
Do you think

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,240
everything you do is right?

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,600
I think my dad

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,800
was the third person who ruined your family.

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,760
You even think your parents died because of my dad.

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,640
right?

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,560
That's why you did that to me.

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,760
and tortured me.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,920
Ren Haoming.

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,320
You're a coward.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
Why didn't you ask me directly?

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,800
What should I say?

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,400
At my wedding,

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,720
I found out that I was going to marry a woman.

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,240
the daughter of your enemy?

40
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,360
Do you really think so?

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
Am I wrong?

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
Of course not.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Your mom is the third person.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,680
Your mom seduced my dad.

45
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,520
My dad went to your house.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,480
If your mom didn't give me his address,

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,079
why would my dad go to your house?

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,079
If your mom didn't open the door for my dad,

49
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,440
my dad wouldn't have entered your house.

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,040
and fell off the window.

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,680
So your mom seduced my dad?

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,760
It's written clearly.

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,200
your mother sent my dad to your house.

54
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,840
Take a good look.

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,480
My dad's phone doesn't have any call records.

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,440
My dad and your mom used an email.

57
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,920
That's impossible.

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
My mom is not like that.

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,480
My parents have a harmonious marriage.

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,680
How is that possible?

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,520
My mom asked your dad to take my mom away.

62
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,600
Your dad must have made it up.

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Ren Haoming.

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,080
You're so pitiful.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,600
You've always been like this.

66
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,160
and deceiving yourself.

67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
Show me your dad's email.

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,440
I beg you.

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
Why?

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,959
Why should I let you check my dad's email?

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,839
Don't ever think about it.

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,600
give up.

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Ren Haoming, let me tell you.

74
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
I don't want to see you again.

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,080
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
Please leave.

77
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,080
Tell me your dad's email password and I'll leave.

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,840
No way. Please get out.

79
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,240
Tell me the password.

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
No way. Are you going out or not?

81
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
I'll leave if you don't.

82
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,800
What are you doing?

83
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,200
Let go of me!

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,240
What are you doing?

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,159
Tell me the password of your email.

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,400
I'll let you go.

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,640
No way, Ren Haoming!

88
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,400
You won't let go, right?

89
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,159
Fine, I'm not leaving. I'm going to sleep.

90
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,760
Okay.

91
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,880
If you don't tell me the password,

92
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,040
I won't let you sleep.

93
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,480
What?

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,160
Qingtian.

95
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,120
My employee is here.

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,960
Qingtian.

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,480
Let go of me!

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
My employee is here.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,320
Tell me the password of your email.

100
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,120
I won't do it.

101
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,360
Oh my god.

102
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Wait.

103
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,920
Go on.

104
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,680
I just came back to get a charger.

105
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Call the police.

106
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,760
What?

107
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,520
Let go of Qingtian.

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,920
I'll call the police if you don't.

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,880
Let go of her!

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,480
Fine.

111
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,240
You're not even afraid of calling the police now, are you?

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,960
I have nothing now.

113
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,920
What am I afraid of?

114
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,040
Fine.

115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,360
Then let's watch the news tomorrow.

116
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Just say the ex-fiancée

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,480
broke up with their parents.

118
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,640
Do you still want to repay me?

119
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
Let's go. Wait.

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,640
All right.

121
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,680
What's the rush?

122
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,360
Why must you call me through the door?

123
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,920
Why are you here?

124
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Tell me the password.

125
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,840
I'll leave right away.

126
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,360
No way. You'll never get it.

127
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,240
What are you doing?

128
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,760
Get out.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,080
I'll call security.

130
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
Go ahead. I used to live here.

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,880
They all know me.

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,840
So what?

133
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,640
This is my home.

134
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,320
Ruan Qingtian.

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,080
Don't force me to do it.

136
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,320
Don't you always do it directly?

137
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,520
Then I'll do it.

138
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,560
Let go of me!

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,720
Let go of me!

140
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,240
Why is it so noisy?

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,080
What?

142
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,360
Wang, Wang, come here.

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,960
Come here.

144
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,280
What's wrong?

145
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,680
He bullied my daughter.

146
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
Uncle Wang.

147
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Haoming, why are you here?

148
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,640
You know him?

149
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,240
He's my neighbor for years.

150
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
Why don't I know him?

151
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,440
Of course I do.

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,240
Get rid of him now.

153
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,960
What's wrong, Qingtian?

154
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,919
What's going on?

155
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,159
Mom, why don't you go back first?

156
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,919
Uncle Wang, let my mom go in first.

157
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,840
I'm not leaving.

158
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,960
My dumplings.

159
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,520
Hurry up.

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,280
I'll take care of this.

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,280
I'll take care of it.

162
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,920
Let go of me.

163
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,880
I'll give you a satisfactory answer.

164
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,400
I'll do it myself.

165
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Uncle Wang.

166
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,640
You and my parents have been neighbors for so many years.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
What happened to them?

168
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
Do you know?

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,360
I can't tell you that.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Wang.

171
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I heard you're here.

172
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
Why are you here?

173
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,000
It's been a long time

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,480
for a long time.

175
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,240
I came to see you today.

176
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,000
Besides,

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,880
your neighbor

178
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,400
I didn't take the test report.

179
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,120
This time,

180
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
this time.

181
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
What's the test report?

182
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,720
The report of domestic violence.

183
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm the patient's son.

184
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,120
Give it to me.

185
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,880
I can't hide it anymore.

186
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,400
Your parents and I have been neighbors for years.

187
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,920
Your dad used to like drinking.

188
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Every time he got drunk, he would fight with your mom.

189
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,960
How could I not know?

190
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,400
Your mother didn't want you to know.

191
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,200
One time, at the door of the building,

192
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,080
at the door of the building.

193
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,600
I’m fine. Don’t worry about me.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Chunci.

195
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120
Why are you always here?

196
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,840
Wang.

197
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,920
What happened to your face?

198
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,960
Your husband drank again.

199
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Let's go. I'll take you to the hospital.

200
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
No, I'll be fine after a rest.

201
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
You're injured.

202
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,880
You have to go to the hospital.

203
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,360
I can't let Haoming know.

204
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,520
Haoming has grown up.

205
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,280
He has the right to know

206
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,800
how his mother is living.

207
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,200
Okay.

208
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
I'll take you to a private clinic

209
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,400
my friend runs.

210
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,480
I won't let anyone know.

211
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,800
Wang, as a lawyer,

212
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,920
I have something to say.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
I don't care.

214
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,240
Back then,

215
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,040
she had many setbacks.

216
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
There are still unfinished wounds on her.

217
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,040
Why?

218
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
Why did my mom lie to me?

219
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,000
You can't blame your mom.

220
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,400
Your mom is a very prideful person.

221
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,720
Everyone says she's doing well.

222
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,280
Her husband is a decent man.

223
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,680
She said her son is good at studying

224
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,960
Handsome

225
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,840
She

226
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,440
living in the cage she knitted.

227
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,680
I dare not walk out.

228
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,960
No wonder when I was young,

229
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,600
when I was little.

230
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,400
She was hiding that from me.

231
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,440
Why hasn't mom come yet?

232
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm sleepy

233
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,560
Is that Mom's voice?

234
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,560
What's wrong with her?

235
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
I'm going to see her.

236
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,520
But Mom said

237
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,320
it's time to hide-and-seek after 10 p.m.

238
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,800
Don't go back if anything happens.

239
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,440
Son.

240
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,960
Mom.

241
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,920
Are you still playing?

242
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,360
Mom.

243
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,120
Good boy.

244
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,080
Why are you wearing a scarf?

245
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,800
I caught a cold.

246
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm not feeling well.

247
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,000
Dad is drunk.

248
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,400
and vomited everywhere.

249
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,840
So tonight,

250
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,520
you have to sleep in the guest room with Qiu Qiu.

251
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,520
But I want to stay with you.

252
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,280
Qiu Qiu will be unhappy.

253
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,400
Okay.

254
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay, go to sleep.

255
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,040
Good night, baby.

256
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Good night, Mom.

257
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,480
Good night.

258
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,160
I don't care much about my mom.

259
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,240
She must have suffered a lot.

260
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
My mom lied to me for so many years.

261
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,840
Actually, your mom did it to protect you.

262
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,040
Your mom was abused.

263
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,440
and went to my dad.

264
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,120
I want my dad to take her away.

265
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,280
This is the answer you want.

266
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,520
Satisfied?

267
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,760
That's why my dad isn't the third person.

268
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,080
Your mom is.

269
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,600
Don't say that about my mom.

270
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,760
Uncle Wang.

271
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,480
