1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell it. Okay.

2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,520
You want to sell the horse farm?

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Are you sure you can give up everything

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,400
to leave?

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,480
I'm sure.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,960
If you give up now,

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,360
when you want to come back,

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
it won't be that easy.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,880
I always think of my parents' death here.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,880
Every time,

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,320
I can't control

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,760
I want to cause trouble for Ruan Qingtian and her mother.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,760
I hate Ruan Bin.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,959
He ruined my parents' marriage.

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,280
If it weren't for him,

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,600
my parents would still be alive.

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,120
I hate Ruan Qingtian more.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,560
Why would she be Ruan Bin's daughter?

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
So you knew it.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,880
No wonder you keep doing this to me.

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,200
I hate you.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,800
Your mother killed my dad.

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,720
Don't you care about the racecourse?

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,240
Do you care about horses?

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,440
I'll get them little by little.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,400
But they are all victims.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,840
And I still can't let go of Ruan Qingtian.

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,880
Every time I was at the racecourse,

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
I miss her like crazy.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,840
I want to leave here.

31
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,840
Okay.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,039
I see.

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,479
Then I'll go find a manager for the horses in the Ma factory.

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,639
Cousin.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,640
I want to tell you something.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,680
What is it?

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,440
I want to sell the horse farm.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,240
What?

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,720
Are you selling the horse farm?

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,680
No.

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,040
Are you crazy?

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,800
I don't agree.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,000
You used to guard the racecourse strictly.

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,880
Even my cousin with shares

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,760
has no right to manage.

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,200
You don't want it anymore?

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,280
What's wrong?

48
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,280
Calm down.

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm just a little tired.

50
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
I don't want to stay in China.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,880
I want to go abroad.

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,440
Are you willing to give up your horses?

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,240
I've lost my parents.

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,840
and my lover.

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,560
It's okay to lose more.

56
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,800
Just be pretentious.

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,320
How much are you going to sell it?

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
Do you want to buy it?

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
I won't worry if I sell it to you.

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,200
Do you think I have that money?

61
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,120
My money is in the stock market.

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,160
The last item today is a pure-blooded horse.

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
It's a pure horse.

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
We have to take a photo.

65
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,440
The starting price is 1 million.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,240
It starts now.

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,920
1.2 million.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,440
No.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,560
1.3 million.

70
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,320
This gentleman has

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
1.3 million.

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,000
Are there any other guests going to raise the price?

73
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,240
1.5 million.

74
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,960
OK.

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,079
1.5 million.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,200
You sold the horse farm.

77
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,240
Why did you take a photo?

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,520
1.5 million going once.

79
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,160
1.5 million going twice.

80
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
1.8 million.

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,880
Okay.

82
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,160
This lady has taken

83
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,480
1.8 million.

84
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,280
Is there any more guest?

85
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,440
Qingtian.

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,240
Why is she here?

87
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,400
Long time no see.

88
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
Anything else?

89
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Maybe she likes it.

90
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,120
After all,

91
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,400
she has been taking care of horses for so long.

92
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,440
She has feelings for horses.

93
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,720
1.8 million going twice.

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,160
1.8 million three times.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Deal.

96
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,360
Congratulations.

97
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
Congratulations.

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,000
Why did you give up?

99
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,400
You're right.

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,560
I don't want to run the racecourse anymore.

101
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,160
Why should I buy it?

102
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't grab it when it's time.

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,040
What do you think?

104
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,280
It does look good.

105
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,680
It suits you well.

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,280
You have good taste.

107
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,360
We need to talk.

108
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Me?

109
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,120
Who else is here?

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,240
Let's go.

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Qingtian.

112
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,320
What is it?

113
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,240
I want to buy shares of the racecourse.

114
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,560
What? A horse farm?

115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,320
Ren Haoming wants to sell a horse farm. I want it.

116
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,360
Are you still not over him?

117
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,240
Yes.

118
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,880
All I can't let go is hatred.

119
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Can you help me?

120
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,760
I'll definitely help you.

121
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,000
Not to mention buying Haoming's part for you,

122
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,560
even if you want my share,

123
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,080
I can give it to you.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,800
It's bad for him.

125
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,480
He's bad.

126
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,880
All I know is

127
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,000
you have a reason to do this.

128
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,640
And Haoming has something.

129
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,280
After all, he got the money.

130
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,320
Are you really going to sell the horse farm?

131
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,360
I did.

132
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,200
It's the partner Qiang found.

133
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,920
Who do you think I am?

134
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,560
You didn't discuss this with me.

135
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
After all, I'm the general manager of this racecourse.

136
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,920
Although I signed a shareholder agreement with you,

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,240
it doesn't mean the shareholders have no right to know.

138
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,880
I just don't want you to suffer like me.

139
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,720
Ren Haoming, you have no heart.

140
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,640
If I don't know about this,

141
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,960
when will you tell me?

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,480
Just like Ruan Qingtian

143
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,600
came to me

144
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,560
like a farm contract?

145
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,360
Stop talking about her.

146
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
Why not?

147
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,320
You're nice and bad to her.

148
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
I used to envy her.

149
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,480
After all, you care about her.

150
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,120
I pitied her after that.

151
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,360
After all, her father killed your parents.

152
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,640
Shut up.

153
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,960
You're so embarrassed.

154
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,480
Ren Haoming, you're a coward.

155
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,880
I'm sorry, okay?

156
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,000
I fell in love with you because I was blind.

157
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,680
Qiang.

158
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,200
Your partner is quite presumptuous.

159
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,640
Why do you want to change the plaque?

160
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,880
After all,

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,520
we need to

162
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
new look.

163
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
It's just a handover ceremony.

164
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,640
Do you have to be so grand?

165
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
After all, it's about exposing the world.

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
Unlike someone

167
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,920
who doesn't say anything.

168
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,280
I'm the last person

169
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,480
who knows it.

170
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,480
Xiaoxiao, why are you here?

171
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Why don’t you let me come?

172
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,080
Sorry.

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm just here.

174
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,360
I'd like to see

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,240
who the owner of this racecourse is.

176
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,440
Okay.

177
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,120
When does it start?

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,880
Coming soon

179
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,480
Coming.

180
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,800
The new boss is quite powerful.

181
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,480
Qingtian.

182
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,600
Why are you here?

183
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,840
Congratulations. Bingo.

184
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,040
How is it?

185
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,360
Are you satisfied?

186
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,720
I don't agree.

187
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,480
Haoming, stop it.

188
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,720
This is a ridiculous opening.

189
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm not selling it.

190
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
It's not up to you.

191
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,120
After all, I meet

192
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,520
in your contract.

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,680
It's good for horses and the racecourse.

194
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,800
These are all suitable for me.

195
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,960
After all, I've sweated a lot here.

196
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,280
and made a lot of efforts.

197
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
Qiang, did you do it on purpose?

198
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,560
You know that.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,280
I can't refuse her.

200
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,520
Besides,

201
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,320
selling the horse farm to Qingtian

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,480
is better than outsiders.

203
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,040
Alright.

204
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560

Step aside.

213
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,440
Ruan Qingtian, you've gone too far.

214
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
What's wrong?

215
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,520
I'm the owner of this racecourse now.

216
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,400
If my name is not Ruan,

217
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,360
Or Ren?

218
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,520
What are you doing?

219
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't stop him.

220
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,520
Let him open it. The whole racecourse is mine anyway.

221
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,640
I want to get a few plaques and a few plaques.

222
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,160
Take them down.

223
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,840
Ruan Qingtian.

224
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,320
Do you have to go this far?

225
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,400
Who's going to do this?

226
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm just

227
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,240
the right of a horse farm owner.

228
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,040
Forget it.

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
Just talk.

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,240
Don't fight.

231
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,520
Please help Miss Ruan.

232
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,680
Let's talk somewhere else.

233
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,160
Is there

234
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,160
between us?

235
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Thank you.

236
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,040
Come on.

237
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
Let me send you home.

238
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,520
I need to talk to him.

239
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,800
Come in, please.

240
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,480

Mr. Ren.

246
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,840
I bought it. I spent money.

247
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
Why can't I do that?

248
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Ruan Qingtian, don't force me.

249
