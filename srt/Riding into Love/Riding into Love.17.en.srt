1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Hello.

2
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,840
Ren Haoming.

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,880
Let go of me!

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,080
What are you doing?

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,280
Aren't you bored?

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
Do more work if you're free.

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,600
and plant trees.

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,160
and plant

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,800
in that area.

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,040
Are you crazy?

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,720
If you want to eat fruits, go to the fruit shop.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400
Why bother me?

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,840
Besides, who would plant fruit trees at the racecourse?

14
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,000
Someone

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,120
wants her own orchard.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,360
Mom, this place feels so empty.

17
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,880
It's my dear mom

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,480
I also think this place is bald.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,760
If we can plant a fruit tree,

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,120
she wants to plant a fruit tree here.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,480
So every spring,

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,920
I can take you here to see the flowers bloom.

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,120
I'll take you here for a summer vacation.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,880
I can take you here to pick fruits in autumn.

25
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,680
Mom.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,320
Let someone plant it.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,160
No

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,840
Your dad said

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
there are some fruit trees here.

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,720
It will make the horse look ugly.

31
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,120
When I grow up,

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,520
when I grow up.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Good girl.

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,000
Who is it? Let her grow it herself if she wants to eat it.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,120
Why are you making fun of me?

36
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,759
It's a hint from the photo again, right?

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,760
It's someone in the photo.

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,440
Did he ask you to plant trees for her?

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
That's why you're bothering me.

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,360
You stole the photo.

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,960
It's the photo again.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,760
I thought I stole it.

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
Okay, Ren Haoming.

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,480
Think whatever you want.

45
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,360
Thank you for protecting me.

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,640
But I didn't take the photo.

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,680
Put me down.

48
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
One million.

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,160
What?

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll give you one million after I plant this.

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
You pay me back.

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
I asked you to plant trees

53
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,440
to let you apologize

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,960
and my parents.

55
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,400
Okay.

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,600
It's just planting trees.

57
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,720
Fine, whatever you do is not doing.

58
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,400
I'll plant it.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,600
Mom.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,120
Let her fulfill your wish.

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,440
This is atonement,

62
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
and punishment.

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,560
It's just planting trees.

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,920
Just plant them.

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,839
One million for planting trees

66
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,200
One million to plant trees.

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,440
Qingtian, stop digging.

68
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,000
Stop digging. How can you do such heavy work?

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,320
Leave me alone.

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,840
How could Haoming do this to you?

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,960
I'll go find him.

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,040
No, I volunteered.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,440
Here.

74
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
The assault is here to help again.

75
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,720
Haoming.

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,360
What are you doing?

77
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,120
Nothing.

78
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,560
I'll spend one million to plant a tree.

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,160
I want to eat fruits.

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,320
What? You have a problem?

81
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,440
One million.

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,640
Alright, Qiang.

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,240
I did it voluntarily. Leave.

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,640
I'll take her away.

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,080
Try it.

86
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,440
She's mine now.

87
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,040
What's wrong with her?

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,080
Can you be reasonable?

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,160
Can you stop arguing?

90
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,520
Qingtian!

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,760
Qingtian!

92
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,240
Are you okay?

93
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Qingtian.

94
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,120
Qingtian!

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,040
Qingtian.

96
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
Dad, Mum, I'm sorry.

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,520
I can't do anything to her.

98
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,840
She's the person I love.

99
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,840
but also the daughter of your enemy who killed you.

100
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
A father's debt for a daughter.

101
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,200
I hope the tree she planted

102
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,040
can make you feel better.

103
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
What are you doing?

104
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
What are you doing?

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,520
You've done half of your work.

106
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,680
I can't just

107
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,920
watch the seedlings die here.

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
You're so kind.

109
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,120
Why are you here?

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,360
The doctor said you need more rest.

111
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
I promised you to plant it.

112
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,840
I will plant them all.

113
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,920
I won't go back on my word like you.

114
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,880
Go away.

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,240
Do you want to die?

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840
None of your business.

117
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,040
Let go of me!

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,240
Come on, have some soup.

119
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,800
You must get caught in the rain.

120
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,200
What are you doing?

121
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,920
I'm cold.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Thank you.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
What a loser.

124
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,640
I'm so unlucky to have a mother like you.

125
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,160
I can't even afford a bucket of instant noodles.

126
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,400
I just eat your instant noodles.

127
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,680
Are you serious?

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,520
I'll give you ten boxes when I win the grand prize.

129
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
I think your dream is faster.

130
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,120
Shut up.

131
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,640
It's the award.

132
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,200
What does it have to do with you?

133
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,520
We're ready for the award

134
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:40,760
SANYO

135
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,280
The first ball today is Chase Lee

136
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,400
Got it.

137
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,440
The second one is three.

138
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Let me see.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,880
It's just one number. Is it necessary?

140
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
The third one is nine.

141
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
The fourth is fourteen.

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,360
The fifth is eight.

143
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,720
The sixth is 13.

144
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,800
Seriously?

145
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,720
The last number is nine.

146
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,840
I got it.

147
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Really?

148
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,240
So happy

149
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,240
Ten times.

150
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,160
One billion.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,480
I need to call my daughter.

152
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
What kind of luck is this?

153
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm happy too.

154
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,200
I got a big prize for my shop.

155
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,680
What's my daughter's phone number?

156
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,800
Hurry up.

157
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
No, I want...

158
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,680
I'm going in person.

159
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,600
Why are you here?

160
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
You're still holding Haoming.

161
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,360
You bitch!

162
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
Get up! What are you doing?

163
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,520
Are you crazy?

164
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,240
Can't you see he's sick?

165
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
and won't let me go?

166
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,520
No way. I'll kill you today.

167
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,880
Wait and see.

168
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
Who are you hitting?

169
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,040
You are really unreasonable.

170
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,160
Let go.

171
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,560
You're pressing Haoming.

172
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,200
You bitch!

173
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,320
Get up!

174
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,400
You're the one who's pressing him.

175
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,440
You still want to take the chance to get promoted, don't you?

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,360
Let's go. I'll strangle you.

177
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,600
Let go of me!

178
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,840
Let go of me! Let go!

179
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,200
Let go of me!

180
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,360
Get down. Let go.

181
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,760
It hurts.

182
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,640
Ruan Qingtian, what are you doing?

183
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Let go!

184
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,480
What are you doing, Ruan Qingtian?

185
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
Listen.

186
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,280
If you have bad eyesight, treat it.

187
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,000
If you have a bad brain, go to a mental hospital.

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
Who are you talking about?

189
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
Who are you talking about?

190
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,880
You're the problem.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
You're insane.

192
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,320
