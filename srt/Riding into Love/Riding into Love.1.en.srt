1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief producer.

2
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
As a man,

3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,680
the happiness I imagined

4
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,360
is to ride my love horse

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
and win the first place.

6
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,640
can create more

7
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,800
of China.

8
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,080
Seeing the orphanage they donated

9
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,120
and raised them happily.

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,440
But now,

11
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,320
I need to do something important.

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,680
Find this woman.

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,759
She's my junior.

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,600
She runs a flower shop.

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,960
She's a florist.

16
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,160
Her name is Ruan Qingtian.

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,000
Half a year ago,

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,280
I saw Ruan Qingtian

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,800
with a vase.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,520
I didn't want to get involved in their business.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,680
I didn't expect my cousin

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,000
the next day.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:51,720
So,

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,800
I have to bring Ruan Qingtian

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,240
to my cousin's bed.

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
When I was going to find her,

27
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,440
At the horse farming auction,

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,680
I met her by accident.

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,280
Is this you?

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
He's the guy I had a crush on.

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,600
I kept confessing my love to him during college.

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,760
but he never responded.

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,960
No, I can't let him misunderstand me.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,920
I'm going to the toilet.

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,280
Haoming.

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,840
Haoming, where are you going?

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Younian.

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,880
Seon-woo.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Senpai.

40
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
It's been seven or eight hundred days.

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,320
You really impressed me.

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,560
You've learned how to

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,160
on others' shoulders.

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,240
You didn't talk that much before.

45
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,520
Yes, that was in the past.

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,880
Ruan Qingtian, I didn't expect to see you again.

47
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,560
You are...

48
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,400
You're with that old man?

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,800
You misunderstood me, Senpai.

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,960
Listen to me.

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,959
Actually, I... Listen to me. I...

52
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
Senior.

53
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,000
Let me explain.

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Listen to me.

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,280
Stay here.

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,360
Don't go anywhere.

57
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,400
When I'm done,

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,159
I have plenty of time for you to explain.

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,920
It's not you.

60
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,440
If you keep mumbling,

61
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,159
I'll throw you away in the car.

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,080
I don't have time or patience now.

63
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,440
You have the freedom to choose.

64
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,400
Senpai.

65
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,080
Wait for me here.

66
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
The next horse

67
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
is the most expensive horse in the auction.

68
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,760
This horse is the most popular.

69
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
It's the iron hoof Beauty.

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,520
Its maternal system

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
It's Ruth, who won the 15th champion of Elland.

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,360
My father's family has a long history of winning the championship.

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,560
Thomas family.

74
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,200
The starting price is 3 million.

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,120
The price is 200,000 per time.

76
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,320
You must win this horse.

77
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,120
With our God of Land Wind,

78
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,400
the best horse will grow.

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,360
Wonderful.

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,040
That's why we must win this iron hoof Beauty.

81
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,360
Any bidding?

82
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,840
3.2 million.

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,600
OK, the lady here offers 3.2 million.

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
3.5 million. 3.5 million.

85
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
4 million.

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,360
Four million

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,240
Anyone else?

88
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
4.5 million

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,600
4.5 million.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
It's 4.5 million now.

91
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,080
Any more guests?

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,480
So much

93
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
This is a big sum.

94
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,040
How dare you!

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
Where did you go?

96
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,280
I thought you escaped.

97
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,720
Yes, I wanted to leave, but...

98
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,120
But what?

99
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
But I gave you money.

100
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
4.5 million.

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,880
Now we have 4.5 million.

102
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
Is there any guest bidding?

103
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,840
4.5 million going once.

104
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,600
4.5 million going twice.

105
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,080
I offer 4.8 million.

106
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,880
4.8 million once.

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,520
4.8 million going twice.

108
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,680
5.5 million.

109
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,280
5.5 million.

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
This lady has

111
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,159
5.5 million.

112
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
It's already 5.5 million.

113
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,960
More?

114
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,000
Six million.

115
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,800
Six million.

116
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,760
Ten million.

117
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,720
This gentleman has increased 10 million.

118
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Is there any more bid for 10 million?

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,720
It's already 10 million

120
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,400
Anything else?

121
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,120
10 million once.

122
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,760
Everyone.

123
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,560
Sorry, auctioner, I have something to say.

124
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Today

125
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
is my wife's birthday.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,080
I want to take a photo of this horse

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,720
to my wife.

128
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,480
as her birthday gift.

129
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,200
I hope you'll accept it.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,880
How can I do that?

131
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,200
I can't afford it.

132
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,400
It's your birthday.

133
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,560
Why should we?

134
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,080
No.

135
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,520
Forget it, Miss Xiaoxiao.

136
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,600
Mr. Qian’s wife

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,800
has been dead for many years.

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I finally found a beautiful new wife.

139
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,600
I gave in anyway.

140
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,080
Me too.

141
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,800
Mr. Qian must be newlywed.

142
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,680
to have such a beautiful wife.

143
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,320
Today is Mrs. Qian’s birthday.

144
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,560
You just showed your ID card.

145
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,040
Let's wish them happiness.

146
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,320
Let's give way.

147
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,160
Make way

148
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
What are you thinking?

149
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,640
Miss Ruan.

150
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,080
Think about your mother's gambler.

151
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,640
10,2 million.

152
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,960
This lady offers 10,2 million.

153
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,159
Is there another guest?

154
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,799
102 million going once.

155
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
10,200,000 going twice.

156
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,920
It's a deal.

157
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,080
Ruan Qingtian, you're really something.

158
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,520
This is my flower shop.

159
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,920
Why are you kicking me out?

160
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,840
I invested a lot of money.

161
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,360
Let me tell you.

162
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,560
your mom gave us

163
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,680
to us.

164
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Before your mom pays us back,

165
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
we'll take this shop.

166
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,880
Get lost.

167
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,040
Get lost!

168
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
Hey, Mom! Hey, hey!

169
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
I promised you

170
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,600
to pretend to be his wife

171
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,560
to take a horse for him.

172
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,200
I even did such a ridiculous thing.

173
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,920
Because he can pay your gambling debt?

174
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,320
Did you gamble again?

175
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I just want to make a fortune.

176
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,320
Tian Tian.

177
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Listen.

178
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Don't go home these days.

179
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,520
I'll go out and hide.

180
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,640
Okay, I'll hang up now.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Don't go home.

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
Remember, don't go home.

183
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,400
I spent a lot of money to buy these.

184
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,560
They're all on the street now.

185
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,160
Did I see it right?

186
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,600
I won.

187
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,480
The prize is a farm. Gosh.

188
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,080
It's going to rain.

189
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
My mom won't let me go home either.

190
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,880
Where can I go?

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,000
