1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Director.

2
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,240
I'll put it in the warehouse.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,040
Ren Haoming.

4
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,720
Come on.

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,320
I have something to tell you.

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,720
I heard my future mother-in-law is here.

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,080
What mother-in-law?

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,760
It's not even over yet.

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,200
It's just a matter of time.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,240
It's better to pick another day.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,480
I'll treat her to a meal.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,840
No.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm not feeling well.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,000
She needs some rest.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
What do you mean?

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
My classmate said men cheat on each other.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Can you?

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,240
I can learn if you like.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,680
You can't see my whole family.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,200
Let's get down to business.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,440
Tomorrow.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,520
Tomorrow?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,479
I have to arrange the specific time.

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,080
Don't act on your own.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay.

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,240
What are you thinking?

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
You don't usually work, right?

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,040
Look at the handrail.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,320
Look, it's so tacky.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
Let me tell you.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,560
I can't bear the sand in my eyes.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,000
Let me tell you.

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,160
Since it belongs to my daughter,

34
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,440
it must be clean.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,240
Understand?

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,040
Work hard.

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,920
You all do it well.

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,920
You must be clean.

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Do you hear me?

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,640
What are you doing?

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,760
This old lady

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,520
needs a blogger to promote the racecourse.

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,480
Get ready.

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,320
Over there.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,200
Blogger.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,640
Do we need a blogger?

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,960
Such a big blogger.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,840
Look at this.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,120
Yes, Qiang.

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,000
I asked you to promote the racecourse.

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Then the racecourse will take off.

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,640
Of course.

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,120
Who is she?

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,880
She's Miss Ruan's mother.

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,400
A woman who wants to be the Grand Empress Dowager.

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,440
Qingtian's mother?

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,720
Yes.

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,400
This old lady

59
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,440
thinks of herself as the owner of this place.

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,360
He always asked our boss

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,600
to give him a million betrothal gifts.

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
One million?

63
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,720
Qingtian.

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,200
I don't dare to let our boss

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,160
see her.

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,520
One million.

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
I’m leaving, Qiang.

68
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,120
Bye.

69
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,680
Hello, aunt.

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,760
Who are you?

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,560
I'm one of the two major shareholders

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,760
My name is Keung. There are other small shareholders in the farm.

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,720
Double King.

74
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,440
Add a small card.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,360
You're one of the two kings.

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,079
Are you my precious son-in-law?

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,560
Auntie, I like Qingtian very much.

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,040
But she likes my brother more.

79
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,680
My daughter is so popular.

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,360
Qingtian is as beautiful and capable as you.

81
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,040
It's hard not to be likeable.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,920
The point is

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,760
you've trained him well.

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,480
What a sweet talker.

85
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,600
Where is your brother?

86
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
I've been here for days.

87
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,520
I haven't seen him.

88
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,520
I want to talk to him.

89
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,160
You don't know.

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
My brother

91
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,800
is a very proud person.

92
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
Ordinary people

93
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,520
He won't meet anyone casually.

94
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,880
Ordinary people?

95
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm his future mother-in-law.

96
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,560
Am I an ordinary person?

97
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,920
Auntie, I apologize on behalf of my brother.

98
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,360
I have a jade Buddha here.

99
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
My friend just brought it from Myanmar.

100
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,360
A man wears a Bodhisattva.

101
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,360
This is my gift to you.

102
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Hope you like it.

103
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
For me?

104
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,280
This guy is really nice.

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
So generous.

106
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
This is nothing.

107
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,960
As long as you like me,

108
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
and be your matrilocal husband,

109
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,520
I’m willing to spend a million.

110
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
Which year is this?

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Look at this.

112
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Mom, why do you like wine?

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,840
You don't usually drink.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,480
I didn't drink before.

115
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,720
I can't drink anymore.

116
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,880
Let me tell you.

117
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,960
No matter how excellent you are,

118
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,760
how good you are.

119
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,480
and good at playing cards.

120
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:57,520
can't compare to a good card.

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,880
This is the experience

122
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,400
in her life.

123
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,280
Remember it.

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,560
Got it.

125
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,400
My stomach hurts.

126
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,040
Are you okay?

127
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,200
I need to go to the toilet.

128
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,960
Wait for me.

129
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800
Wait for me here.

130
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,480
Don't move. Wait.

131
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Wait.

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,880
Slow down.

134
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,520
Don't go.

135
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,040
Slow down.

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,600
Don't move. Follow here.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,480
This bottle is over 200 yuan.

138
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,360
This one costs more than 2,000 yuan.

139
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,320
What's the difference?

140
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,200
You scared me.

141
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,120
This bottle costs over 2,000 yuan.

142
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,480
Just like me.

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
He looks ordinary,

144
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
and rich inside.

145
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Why are you here?

146
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,720
Where's my mom?

147
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
She said she had to go.

148
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,880
She asked me to take care of you.

149
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,640
So you two colluded.

150
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,560
But let me tell you,

151
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,760
don't think that bribing my mom is useless.

152
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,040
What are you talking about?

153
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,360
I respect the elderly and love the children, understand?

154
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,680
Qingtian.

155
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,960
Try to accept me.

156
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,640
What are you doing at this hour?

157
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
You scared me.

158
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,760
I heard your mom is not feeling well.

159
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,640
I bought some supplements.

160
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Let's give it to your mom together.

161
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,440
My mom is fine.

162
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm not okay now.

163
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,280
My stomach hurts.

164
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,560
Can you go to the toilet with me?

165
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
I'll go with you.

166
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,680
Why do you dislike me?

167
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,520
No.

168
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,240
Let's go.

169
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,600
I can't take it anymore.

170
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
I can't take it anymore.

171
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,840
Qingtian.

172
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,480
Slow down.

173
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,760
Qingtian!

174
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,840
Where are you, Qingtian?

175
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,360
Honey, have some water.

176
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,159
Thank you, mom.

177
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,480
Time to sleep.

178
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,240
Soon.

179
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
What year is it now?

180
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,600
People write to you with their hands.

181
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,440
Lee Hwan wrote this to me.

182
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,160
She said she wanted to come back to work.

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,000
She realized her mistake.

184
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,120
You're right.

185
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,400
You have to be forgiving.

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
I know, mom.

187
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,800
Actually, I've forgiven her.

188
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay.

189
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,320
Let bygones be bygones.

190
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,520
I welcome you to come back to work anytime.

191
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
Do you remember when I was young?

192
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,679
We rented a house together.

193
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,120
in a very big yard.

194
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
I remember

195
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,400
there were many neighbors around.

196
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,360
We come here every day for dinner.

197
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,720
Sometimes we even bathed together.

198
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,840
Life was really hard then.

199
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,600
But at that time,

200
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,360
we were very happy.

201
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,920
It's because your dad is diligent and skillful.

202
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,760
Not only can he make beautiful clothes for you,

203
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,800
but also for so many people outside.

204
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,080
for so many people outside.

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
So our life

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,680
is getting better.

207
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,320
In my hands,

208
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,920
a big card.

209
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,240
If you don't have a big card,

210
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
All small cards.

211
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,720
How can they all go out?

212
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,680
Okay mom

213
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,000
Why is it brand again?

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,400
I'm talking about life now.

215
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,000
Mom,

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,120
don't worry.

217
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,760
Although my dad is gone,

218
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,960
I'm here.

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,240
I'll take care of you.

220
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,160
I'll take care of you when you're old.

221
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,840
No way.

222
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
The good days have just begun.

223
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
I haven't had enough.

224
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
Are you going to die?

225
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,520
Yes.

226
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,360
Mom, you're right.

227
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
We still have a long way to go.

228
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Of course.

229
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,320
I will make more money.

230
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,080
You don't have to worry about the betrothal gifts anymore.

231
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,520
That one million is nothing.

232
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
When I make money,

233
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,800
we'll buy a big house.

234
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Anyway,

235
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,600
I shouldn't have sold this farm.

236
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,960
Otherwise,

237
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,920
it's more than one million.

238
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,040
Yes.

239
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,400
I think

240
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,680
Qiang is better.

241
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,880
Qiang said

242
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,480
to learn how to drive.

243
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
He asked me to get a driver's license.

244
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,280
and buy me a Porsche.

245
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,560
That's enough.

246
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,200
Don't mention him again.

247
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,200
Then...

248
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
Let's go to bed.

249
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,120
Let's go.

250
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,320
Help!

251
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,000
The door is going down.

252
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,040
What's going on?

253
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,920
You came at the right time.

254
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,800
The door is going down.

255
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,280
Hwan, go get someone

256
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
This door must not fall down.

257
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,680
Once it falls and makes a sound,

258
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,760
the horses will be scared.

259
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,160
Can you do it?

260
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,320
I can. Come back soon.

261
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,400
I'll be back soon.

262
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,920
What's wrong?

263
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,760
In a hurry.

264
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,480
This door...

265
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,720
Qingtian.

266
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,000
Qingtian!

267
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,200
Qingtian.

268
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,000
What happened?

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,920
He was fine just now.

270
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,680
What happened?

271
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
Send her to the hospital.

272
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,280
Leave her alone.

273
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
God is helping me.

274
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,480
This is not good.

275
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,560
She took away your Qiang

276
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,680
and my Haoming.

277
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,080
She's our enemy.

278
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,160
No.

279
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,520
I... I can't do it.

280
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,600
Hwan.

281
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
No one will know

282
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,640
no one will know.

283
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Stop talking.

284
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,080
I promised them to turn over a new leaf.

285
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,240
I'll take her to the hospital.

286
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,720
Qingtian.

287
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
Why are you so silly?

288
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
You risked your life

289
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,360
to save others.

290
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Qingtian.

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,920

292
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,040
