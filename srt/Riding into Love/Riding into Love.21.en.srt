1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief Producer.

2
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,440
What are you doing?

3
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
Beauty, you're awake.

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,760
You drugged me.

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
What should I do?

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,040
You just found out?

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,240
Believe it or not, I'll tell Uncle Wang.

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,520
Bitch!

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,360
Stop struggling.

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,880
You're under my control.

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,000
Uncle Wang, Uncle Li,

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,240
It doesn't matter who comes.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,160
Didn't Uncle Wang introduce you?

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,680
I just realized

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,680
you should be my woman.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,480
Help!

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,960
Help!

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,320
Darn it.

19
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
Qingtian, are you okay?

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,000
Here. I'm here.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,640
Qingtian, don't be afraid.

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,280
Qingtian.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,520
It's okay, Qingtian.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
Okay, come on.

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,280
I called the police.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,240
I finally realized

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,640
how hateful I was.

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,000
It's all in the past.

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,960
I believe your confession now.

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,560
I will always be by your side

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,520
until the day you really like me.

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,880
By the way,

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,200
Why did you show up that day?

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,720
I went to the farm first and met Wealth.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,240
I heard you were on a blind date.

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,160
I wanted to go.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,000
Then I saw you being carried into the car.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Qingtian.

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,120
Qingtian!

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,600
Qingtian!

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,880
Stop the car.

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:01,960
Here.

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
Qingtian.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,720
Qingtian.

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,800
Qingtian, how are you?

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,640
I'm fine, Mum.

47
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,280
Baby.

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,440
Are you still scared?

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,360
No.

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm fine now.

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,800
That's good.

52
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,920
You scared me to death.

53
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,440
Qingtian, I'm sorry.

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,760
It's all my fault.

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,800
Because of you.

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,720
Look who he introduced.

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,440
He's not the person I want to introduce.

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,079
Who is he? Who is he?

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,440
He

60
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
is a habitual offender who owes money.

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
He came to sue our disciples.

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,240
Just in time, he heard me talking to my disciple

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,360
about your family.

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,520
Especially when I know

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,280
your family suddenly got rich.

66
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,680
So I wanted to extort some money from you.

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
I'll kill you.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,079
What did you do?

69
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,840
What happened?

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
Mom, what are you doing?

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
What did you do?

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,120
What did you do?

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,040
Mum, it's all my fault.

74
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,280
You can't blame Uncle Wang for this.

75
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,320
Who knows Uncle Wang's disciple

76
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,040
was a few minutes late.

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,960
Then that pervert took the chance

78
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
to go on a blind date for him.

79
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,880
No matter what, it's Uncle Wang's fault.

80
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Don't worry.

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,480
Uncle Wang asked that pervert

82
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,680
to stay in prison.

83
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
and pay the price.

84
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,680
Yes, of course.

85
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, thank you, Uncle Wang.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,560
It's okay, mom.

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
My dear daughter.

88
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,760
I feel so sorry for you.

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,400
Mom.

90
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,399
Do you remember the last time

91
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,440
like this last time,

92
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,920
I think it was when I was young.

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,400
When my dad was on a business trip,

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,520
When you dare not sleep alone,

95
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,240
you miss your dad.

96
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,920
Mom.

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,880
Tell me.

98
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
what is love?

99
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,920
Silly girl, why do you ask?

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,200
Do you know, mom?

101
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,800
Actually, the one who ruined

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,240
was ruined by Ren Haoming.

103
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Is he crazy?

104
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,760
I think he still loves me.

105
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,080
He left me alone at the wedding.

106
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,800
I tried my best to make up for it.

107
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,720
but he didn't care.

108
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,280
But now I've let it go.

109
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
he's pestering me again.

110
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,280
All right.

111
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
Don't think about that crazy man.

112
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,440
And that Qiang.

113
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:39,200
He always says he likes me,

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,640
but he did something too extreme.

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,760
But today, he saved me.

116
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,240
Mom.

117
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,560
I really don't understand.

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,080
I really don't understand.

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,120
All right.

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
Baby,

121
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,760
Don't think too much.

122
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,120
Go to sleep.

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,280
It's too late.

124
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,560
Go to sleep.

125
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,720
What should I do?

126
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,880
I always feel sorry for my parents.

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,280
Every time I think of her, my heart aches.

128
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,560
I understand how you feel right now.

129
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,920
This body is yours.

130
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,640
You can't drink anymore.

131
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,840
FRT.

132
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,480
Just let me drink.

133
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,280
I feel bad.

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,040
I just want to comfort my parents.

135
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,520
But I can't do anything to Ruan Qingtian.

136
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,680
I still love her.

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,520
But I hate her.

138
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,040
What should I do?

139
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
From a friend's point of view,

140
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,760
the dead can't come back to life.

141
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,640
but the living must live.

142
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
You're right.

143
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,280
You can't drink anymore.

144
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I've decided.

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm going to disappear from Ruan Qingtian's world.

146
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,880
I want her to disappear from my world too.

147
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,960
Xiaoxiao.

148
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,160
I... You...

149
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,440
Why are you here?

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,880
You were drunk last night.

151
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,040
The lawyer asked me and Wealth to bring you back.

152
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,520
I'll always take care of you.

153
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,200
I didn't know you kept calling Ruan Qingtian's name.

154
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,080
Did I do anything?

155
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,760
Nothing.

156
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,480
She just held my hand and didn't let me go.

157
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,800
I didn't know how I fell asleep.

158
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,880
That's good.

159
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,840
Thank you, Xiaoxiao.

160
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,320
Haoming, did you keep your promise last night?

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,039
What did I say?

162
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,280
You said you'd let go of Ruan Qingtian completely.

163
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,160
Yes.

164
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,480
Does that mean I still have a chance?

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
Haoming, listen to me first.

166
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,560
I've liked you since I was a kid.

167
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,040
I've been with you all these years.

168
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,360
You know how I feel, right?

169
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,240
I know. I know.

170
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,600
But Xiaoxiao,

171
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,400
I clearly told you my choice.

172
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,520
But Haoming,

173
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,560
don't you

174
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
in your heart?

175
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,440
Xiaoxiao.

176
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,240
My heart is small.

177
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,960
so small that I can only keep one person.

178
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
So I'm sorry, Xiaoxiao.

179
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,320
You should have your own happiness.

180
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
Coming.

181
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,640
Who are you?

182
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
Are you Little Qingtian?

183
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,280
Yes.

184
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,200
You don't know me.

185
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,320
I know you.

186
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,120
I made

187
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,280
these 20 years.

188
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,880
Isn't this the cake my dad ordered every year?

189
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,080
Right, I'm the owner of this bakery.

190
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,720
I made

191
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,960
these 20 years.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,160
Why didn't your dad pick up the cake this year?

193
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
When did my dad order the cake?

194
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,520
It's an automatic order from your dad's email.

195
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,320
I guess

196
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,600
your dad might have forgotten

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,240
so he set it up in the mailbox.

198
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,760
Over the past 20 years,

199
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
every day on your birthday,

200
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
the email will send an order.

201
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,040
Email?

202
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,160
Okay.

203
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,160
Thank you.

204
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,080

Well,

209
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,440
You, you, you lose his birthday.

210
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,040
Anything else?

211
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
Mom, it's all wrong.

212
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,720
Try losing your birthday.

213
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,920
Right.

214
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,920
It's open, Mom. It's open.

215
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,080
Mom, I miss my dad.

216
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,240
He ordered cakes for me at this time every year.

217
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,560
And over the past 20 years,

218
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,080
for over 20 years.

219
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,240
Why is there another...

220
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,920
Unread email?

221
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,800
Take a look.

222
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,560

223
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
I'm ready.

224
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,680
We can leave now.

225
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Mom...

226
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,920
Look, she seduced your dad.

227
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,440
There's no way your dad cheated on you.

228
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,040
Calm down, mom.

229
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
She definitely seduced her.

230
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,800
Let's take a look first.

231
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,880

237
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
She keeps seducing your dad.

238
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,600
Mom, she keeps asking him to leave. Mom.

239
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,040
He drank again.

240
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
I want to kill him.

241
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,320

it might be hard to see him again.
