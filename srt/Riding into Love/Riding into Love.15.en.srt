1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief producer.

2
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,800
Haoming, why are you here?

3
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,480
Cousin.

4
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,080
We've been together for so many years.

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
I know all your friends.

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,480
Can't you invite me if she invites you?

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,400
Haoming is here.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,560
I was wondering

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,400
why you two didn't come together.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,680
This is great.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,320
May you have a good business.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,560
Thank you. This is...

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:07,920
Xiaoxiao.

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,840
This is the legendary Xiaoxiao.

15
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,039
You're his girlfriend?

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,960
You're so sweet.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,240
Wish you a good business.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
Thank you. What are you waiting for?

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,720
Sit down. I'll share the table with you.

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,400
I'll ask the chef to add more dishes for you.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,840
Let's eat together and have fun.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,840
I don't think my cousin would mind.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,000
Of course not.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,160
Have a seat.

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,840
Here.

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,440
Have a seat.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,560
I'll check the kitchen.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,360
Hurry up.

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
What an ill-fated relationship.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,640
I think it was planned.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm glad you like it.

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,160
Are you okay? Did I hurt you?

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
No.

34
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,280
Xiaoxiao,

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,039
What do you want to eat later?

36
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,720
Anything.

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,520
Whatever you say.

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,920
Your nails are so pretty.

39
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,280
You're so annoying.

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,720
Qingtian.

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,480
Put on your glasses.

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,480
The perfume smells good too.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,680
Qingtian, you look so beautiful today.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,920
Do you want some lipstick?

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,440
Okay.

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm so happy that you can eat with me.

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,440
Look at you.

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,280
He's so cool.

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,640
Why doesn't he mind?

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
Whether it's black or white,

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,440
We should divide them thoroughly.

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,960
I'm feeling my life.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,320
I'm feeling

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,400
why someone is so pitiful.

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
All they think about is being a spare.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,440
Ruan Qingtian.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,960
Why are you so loud?

58
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,160
Ren Haoming is not with you now.

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,480
no one will protect you.

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,840
Please enjoy your food.

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,040
Haoming.

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,480
Qingtian doesn't like you.

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,840
Why are you still pestering her?

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
You'd better stay away from her.

65
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,079
Because I'm sure of one thing.

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,680
No matter how hard you try,

67
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,560
she will never like you.

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,200
Nothing can happen in this world.

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,000
How can you be so sure?

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,920
Just eat.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Why is the bathroom wet?

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,160
Ruan Qingtian!

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,760
Ruan Qingtian, are you crazy?

74
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Qingtian.

75
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,560
I'm tired.

76
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,360
It's no fun.

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,280
Qingtian, let me send you home.

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,680
Qingtian.

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,680
Xiaoxiao.

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
Haoming.

81
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,400
Why don't we apologize to your friend?

82
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,720
Look at this mess.

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,159
The floor is full of water and grass.

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm really sorry.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,360
I don't know why she splashed water on me.

86
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,040
I'll go.

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,159
Be careful.

88
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,080
Don't get cold.

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,760
You bitch!

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,640
I am Mu Zhengyeol.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,159
Male effective and talented.

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,200
I don't understand.

93
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,240
What did I do wrong

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,640
to make you give up on me?

95
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,480
If there is a ridiculous starting point,

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,600
no matter how it goes,

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,200
it's hard to go back to how it was.

98
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,160
You don't want to?

99
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,880
If you don't want to tell me,

100
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,000
I won't ask anymore.

101
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,800
My heart...

102
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,480
must die.

103
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
I just hope

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,040
you can be well in the future.

105
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,320
After all, I loved you.

106
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
I really loved you.

107
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,560
The first time I saw you at school,

108
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,040
I fell in love with you.

109
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,520
It has never changed.

110
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,720
You know, just now,

111
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,400
I scolded myself to the stars in the sky.

112
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,040
Why am I so cheap?

113
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,120
Why should I love you? Why?

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,000
You left me alone at the wedding.

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,800
and made me face so many guests.

116
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,640
Do you know how desperate I was?

117
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Ren Haoming.

118
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Am I your fiancée

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
or your enemy?

120
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
If you give me a reason,

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,840
even if I die tomorrow,

122
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,320
I can still rest in peace.

123
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,760
Ren Haoming.

124
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,680
I don't want to live an unknown life.

125
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,680
or die in a mystery.

126
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,520
In the end,

127
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,200
I lost badly.

128
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,680
I know you hate me.

130
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,240
Then hate me.

131
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

132
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Move. Twist.

133
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,160
Let me tell you.

134
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,040
It's interesting.

135
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,920
You must be tired.

136
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,800
Yes.

137
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, that's it for now.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,520
Come on. Go.

139
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,840
Come again if you can.

140
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,640
Okay.

141
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,440
Hello auntie

142
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,400
My mom wanted to dance here.

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,480
Do you have to pay?

144
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
It's two yuan a month.

145
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,640
Look at the sound.

146
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,880
We need to change the battery.

147
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,840
It's free from now on.

148
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,680
So nice.

149
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,080
Let me add you on WeChat.

150
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
Then you put me in the group chat.

151
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll pay for my mom's expenses.

152
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,200
Scan me then.

153
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I'll scan you.

154
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,680
You've really changed.

155
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,040
Don't play cards and learn to play TikTok?

156
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,960
That's it

157
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,720
I'm in a bad mood.

158
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,760
Alright.

159
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,720
I'll tell you next time.

160
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,680
You should play cards, right?

161
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,920
My daughter is living a good life now.

162
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
and a farm owner.

163
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
As his mother,

164
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't hold her back.

165
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,960
Look at the group chat.

166
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,560
Ji Chunhua's rich son-in-law

167
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,960
is showing affection to another woman.

168
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,040
Really Have a look

169
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,080
This is it

170
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,840
What's going on?

171
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,240
Did your daughter get kicked out?

172
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,640
She's not even at the farm.

173
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,720
She's sweeping the floor out. What else can she do?

174
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,320
Chunhua is going to have a hard time.

175
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,040
You old women!

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,440
Stop talking nonsense.

177
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,680
It must be Xiaoxiao.

178
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,640
She did it on purpose.

179
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
She did it on purpose.

180
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,480
Seduce him.

181
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,400
You still won't admit it?

182
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,880
Take a look.

183
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,640
They're all here.

184
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,360
Don't talk nonsense.

185
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,200
Look.

186
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,760
You see how embarrassed I am?

187
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,120
May Xiaoxiao become the second concubine of Ren Haoming.

188
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,640
Please don't do this.

189
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,320
Who do you think you are?

190
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,800
Who do you think you are?

191
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,400
Captain!

192
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,760
Who do you think you are?

193
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,840
The fire is too strong, captain.

194
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,040
The fire is too strong.

195
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,080
Who's making trouble?

196
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,080
This is for you.

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,160
is Miss Ruan's mother.

198
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,680
It's her.

199
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,400
Are you all dead?

200
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,520
That bitch!

201
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,960
She seduced my son-in-law.

202
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,880
Captain

203
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,040
Help me, captain.

204
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,320
You are all watching.

205
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Today,

206
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,520
I want everyone to see her face.

207
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,200
What shameless bitch?

208
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,120
What are you doing?

209
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,200
You want to cut the banner?

210
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Cut me first.

211
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,880
Not only will I cut the banner today,

212
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,200
but also cut you.

213
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,080
What are you doing?

214
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,000
You're so timid.

215
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,960
It's made of wood.

216
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,880
He's so scared.

217
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,760
How dare you make trouble?

218
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,960
Mom.

219
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,920
Okay.

220
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,480
Mom, how are you?

221
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,000
Sweetie.

222
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
I'm glad you're here.

223
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,360
If you don't come,

224
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,680
I'll be killed by Xiaoxiao.

225
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,680
Mom, what happened?

226
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,680
Well...

227
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,480
Xiaoxiao took a big scissor

228
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,440
and came at me.

229
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,880
Ask them.

230
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,640
Ask the security guards.

231
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Ask them

232
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,920
What's going on?

233
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,960
Say something.

234
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,000
Say it.

235
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
What's going on?

236
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,240
Hurry, let's go.

237
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,320
Listen to me.

238
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,480
It's not what you think.

239
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,880
You don't know what happened.

240
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,680
What happened?

241
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,200
Did you kill my mom?

242
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,600
I respect your mom.

243
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,520
But your mom did it wrong first this time.

244
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,720
Ren Haoming.

245
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,080
Have you gone this far?

246
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,600
What did my mom do wrong?

247
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,360
Did she do anything wrong?

248
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,800
In order to protect me,

249
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,720
to protect me.

250
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
What did she do wrong?

251
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,040
Xiaoxiao.

252
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,160
She took a pair of scissors

253
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,680
with a scissor.

254
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,680
Did she tell you?

255
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,920
Did you know?

256
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,400
That's true.

257
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
The workers also told me

258
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,680
But what?

259
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,200
Ren Haoming.

260
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,480
Listen carefully.

261
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,720
I don't want this farm anymore.

262
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,720
Now I'll take my mom

263
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,960
with my mom.

264
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,360
I don't want to see you again.

265
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,760
I don't want to see you.

266
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,400
Mom, let's go.

267
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
You can't go.

268
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,360
Why?

269
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,680
Your mom took my money for the betrothal gifts.

270
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,240
If you want to leave, return it.

271
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,000
Where's the money?

272
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,320
Pay him.

273
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,600
I...

274
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,960
Mom, did you gamble again?

275
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,800
No. What about the money?

276
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,160
I paid off my debt with three million.

277
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,280
What about the rest?

278
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,880
I bought a lottery ticket.

279
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,280
Mom, I beg you.

280
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,240
