1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Director,

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,240
This house is mine from now on.

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,920
Clean this place up.

4
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,680
I heard three people died.

5
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,480
Isn't it

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,480
unlucky?

7
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,239
Yes.

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,360
The three of them

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,320
fell off the building.

10
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,960
Let me introduce myself.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
My surname is Wang, a lawyer.

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,000
I live across the door.

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,760
I saw the door open,

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,960
I wanted to come in and have a look.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,039
If you buy this house,

17
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,760
we'll be neighbors.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,760
Did three people die?

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,880
Yes.

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,080
Of course I know.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,520
How could I not know?

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,600
One of them is my husband.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
My condolences, Madam.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,000
Why should I?

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,720
People say my husband is a mistress.

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,600
and ruined her family.

27
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,120
I don't believe

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,440
I'll buy this.

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,800
I'll stay with him to suppress the bad couple.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,520
I'll wait for the day when the truth comes out.

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,759
Okay, madam.

32
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,120
I'll clean this up.

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Hurry up.

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,720
You're an amazing woman.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,520
And

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,080
a very elegant

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,520
an amazing woman.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,000
The seller is so careless.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
He even left it behind.

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,320
This must be the three of them.

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,960
They look decent.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,040
I didn't treat you well when I was alive.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,120
and caused you trouble.

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,960
I'll always be with you

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,320
and stay here with you to suppress the bad couple.

46
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,160
I admire women like you.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,520
Take and put them on the road.

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,320
Got it.

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,520
The boss has more takeout.

50
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,640
You need to speed up.

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,480
Okay, I'll be right there.

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
You haven't eaten yet, right?

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
You must be busy.

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Here you are.

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,920
You have to persuade him.

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
We can't go on like this.

57
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,520
Body is the foundation of revolution.

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes.

59
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,480
Thank you.

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,120
Have a box later.

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,040
Thank you, Tian's mother.

62
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,320
By the way,

63
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
the flowers are not watered yet.

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,560
Go water them.

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,160
Okay.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,560
Baby, take a rest.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,640
I'll open it for you.

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,720
Let's have a bird's nest, okay?

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,040
It's too late. Many guests are waiting.

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,160
I opened this shop for you.

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,079
I don't want you to die to open a flower shop.

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,200
You can't let go of that jerk.

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
But last time...

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,680
Last time, I didn't let you go.

75
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,840
but you insisted.

76
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,560
When you come back,

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,360
Are you unhappy now?

78
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,840
All right.

79
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
I'll stop talking, okay?

80
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,040
But you can't just work

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,280
and your life.

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
I know, mom.

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,600
This job is my life.

84
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,280
Okay.

85
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,720
You have to eat something.

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,800
This is bird's nest for you.

87
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,399
Mom, why don't you go home first?

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,519
I can drink this.

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
I'll walk you out.

90
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay.

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,360
Let's go, Mom.

92
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,320
Let's go.

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,560
You

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm worried about you.

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm busy.

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,000
Take care of yourself.

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,520
Hurry up and water it.

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Gosh.

99
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,920
You keep making me angry.

100
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,440
Who made her angry?

101
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,680
Why are you here?

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
This flower is for you.

103
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,960
Tian's mom is perfect for sweet flowers.

104
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,760
You...

105
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,880
You're always shy.

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm not shy in front of you.

107
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Let's go home.

108
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,480
You can't go home.

109
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,200
Well, tell me about Qingtian.

110
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm worried that she'll risk her life when she works.

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,600
What's wrong?

112
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,840
When she works,

113
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,480
she doesn't care about anything.

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,960
She's like a ghost when she's free.

115
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
What should I do?

116
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,440
That's it.

117
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,280
distract her.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,440
That's right.

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
How?

120
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,120
Introduce her more excellent people.

121
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,240
Then she'll have a broad vision.

122
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
Make it simple.

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
Blind date.

124
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,720
Blind date?

125
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Yes.

126
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,200
You're right.

127
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,800
I should arrange a blind date for her.

128
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,840
Blind date?

129
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
Blind date?

130
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,240
This is good.

131
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
No way. I won't let her go on a blind date.

132
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,200
Excuse me.

133
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,240
There's someone here.

134
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,960
Are you Ruan Qingtian's blind date?

135
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,880
Who are you?

136
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,440
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

137
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,320
You don't have to come here since you're her ex-boyfriend.

138
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,880
I just came to see

139
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,720
how elite he is.

140
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,800
will be met by her.

141
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,520
Listen, bro.

142
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,320
I used to have a farm.

143
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
When I met her,

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
she chased me like crazy.

145
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,320
When I was stuck in it,

146
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,760
she dumped me because my family went bankrupt.

147
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,760
Do you think I'll be satisfied?

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,480
She is such a person.

149
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
If it's not true,

150
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,480
who would talk about

151
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
with his tragic experience?

152
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,520
Brother.

153
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,400
Just sit here.

154
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,040
I think I have a meeting to attend.

155
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,480
Thank you.

156
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,240
Boss, how did you know he would believe it?

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,560
Only a half-real story

158
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,080
is the most touching.

159
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,200
Amazing.

160
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,600
Let's go.

161
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
Are you crazy?

162
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,360
Back then...

163
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,600
I was an important character.

164
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,320
That tree is very important.

165
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,720
It's great in the whole story.

166
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,680
Really.

167
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
You have a good personality.

168
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,640
Miss Ruan, you have a good personality too.

169
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,560
I think you're quite humorous.

170
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,360
Which man

171
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
makes you humorous?

172
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,280
Xiaoxiao, why are you here?

173
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,280
Why can’t we come if you can?

174
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,760
By the way,

175
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,760
why didn't you

176
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,080
next to you?

177
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,240
Fiance.

178
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,400
You don't know this funny man, do you?

179
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
The lady in front of you

180
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,640
almost married the one next to me recently.

181
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,440
I don't like him anymore.

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,840
After all, you can find whoever is rich.

183
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,120
Xiaoxiao, are you crazy?

184
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
Tell me then.

185
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
I'll leave you guys alone.

186
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,640
You two are really interesting.

187
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,440
Thank you, Xiaoxiao.

188
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,720
You're welcome.

189
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,560
Boss.

190
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,480
Isn't it inappropriate for us

191
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,160
to keep ruining Miss Ruan's blind date?

192
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,040
