1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief producer.

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let me help you.

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,920
Who is it?

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,080
So grand.

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,360
I don't know.

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,000
Qingtian.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
Mum, why are you here?

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,680
This shabby place.

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,760
We won't stay here anymore.

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,840
What are you doing, mom?

11
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,640
Mr. Wang, show my daughter the message.

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,640
Mom.

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,000
Is this a dream?

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,039
Qingtian, I won't let you suffer anymore.

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,759
We won the lottery.

16
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,640
Here, Qingtian.

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
Here's 10 million.

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,560
Take it.

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,520
Buy whatever you want.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,240
I want to open a flower shop and a flower shop.

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,479
From now on,

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,360
[I don't need to care about anyone anymore.]

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,920
Stay away from a scumbag.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,240
Let's go home.

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,720
Ruan Qingtian, you can't leave.

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,720
Why can't I leave?

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,320
You left my daughter at the wedding.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
We're not allowed to leave.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,840
Who do you think you are?

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,960
No one

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,720
can restrict their personal freedom.

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,480
Did you hear what my assistant said?

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,720
Get lost if you hear me.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,160
You are the elder.

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,000
I won't argue with you, but...

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,920
But what?

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,120
You want to talk about the betrothal gift again?

38
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,720
Ren Haoming, show me your receipt code.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
Mr. Wang.

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,600
Transfer the money to Mr. Ren.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,040
I have nothing but money.

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
Sir.

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
please tell us your account information.

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,040
Mr. Wang.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Follow me.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Please cooperate with me.

47
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,280
Please.

48
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,240
You'll get the money soon.

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,440
Do you have anything else to say?

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,440
Mum, let's go.

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,560
Let's go, Ruan Qingtian.

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,160
Don't you want your farm?

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Is this my farm?

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,800
This is my sad and despair.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
Ren Haoming, don't worry.

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
The cows and sheep in this farm

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,680
and those flowers and plants.

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll hire someone to keep an eye on them.

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,760
Ruan Qingtian.

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,880
My arm is still injured.

61
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,079
Aren't you going to take care of me until I recover?

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
The doctor said

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,880
the gauze on your arm has been removed.

64
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,040
What about you now?

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,880
as strong as a cow.

66
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
You're so irresponsible.

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
You're not responsible for me.

68
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,840
I am an irresponsible person.

69
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
I am the one

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,760
in the world.

71
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,480
Are you satisfied with this title?

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,760
Qingtian.

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,079
Look.

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,720
I bought this for you

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,040
From now on,

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,320
you don't have to care about others anymore.

77
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,040
You want to plant flowers,

78
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,880
You want to raise horses and horses.

79
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,600
No one will ever want you to do anything.

80
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,959
You can raise as many horses as you want.

81
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,880
What do you think?

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,360
Let's go.

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,480
Let's go.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,640
By the way, mom,

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,920
I have something in the dorm.

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,840
Mr. Wang, pull it up.

87
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,200
Don't pack these rubbish.

89
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,159
Let's buy a new one then.

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,400
Mom.

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,440
Don't be like this when you have some money.

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,000
These are all memories of our family.

93
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Why are you here?

94
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,200
Did you lose money or win the lottery?

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,960
Ruan Qingtian.

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
You have a mother like her.

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
You deserve your bad luck.

98
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,640
Enough!

99
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,640
I'll sue you!

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,200
Go ahead.

101
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,560
I'm not scared now.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Go ahead and tell them I hit a bitch.

103
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,360
How much did you get hurt?

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
I'll pay for it.

105
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,760
Let me tell you.

106
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,840
I have plenty of money now.

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,560
You...

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
What's wrong?

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,200
What?

110
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,080
You're right.

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,800
I bought a lottery ticket.

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,520
I won 100 million.

113
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,080
Isn't it irritating?

114
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,320
Are you angry?

115
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,320
Let me tell you.

116
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Don't be mad.

117
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,760
I'm so mad.

118
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,440
Can't you see I'm living a good life?

119
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,800
Impossible.

120
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,720
No way.

121
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,200
Go watch the news.

122
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,159
Don't look at those eyes.

123
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,040
You only see men.

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,840
So what if I win 100 million?

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,080
If you gamble all day,

126
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,520
You'll lose everything sooner or later.

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,560
You'll lose your daughter sooner or later.

128
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,960
Ruan Qingtian.

130
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,760
Watch your mouth.

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,120
Haoming, she left without permission.

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
and hit me.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Again.

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,360
Ren Haoming.

135
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,200
What do you want?

136
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,920
Nothing.

137
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,159
It's useless no matter what you want.

138
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,840
Mom, let's go.

139
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,960
Let's go.

140
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,240
Go.

141
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
Go away!

142
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,200
Qingtian, open the door.

143
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,240
The thing I bought for you is here.

144
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,080
What did you buy this time?

145
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,240
Mom, you always

146
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,920
You can't control yourself with money.

147
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,200
Coming.

148
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,120
Is this Ms. Ruan's house?

149
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,640
Yes.

150
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,160
That's right. Come in.

151
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,640
What's going on?

152
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,680
Mom.

153
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,120
What are you doing?

154
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,760
I bought these for you.

155
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,680
Do you like them?

156
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,680
Look.

157
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,520
Mom, I don't need it.

158
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,760
Why not?

159
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,920
Listen, baby.

160
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
You don't cherish yourself at all.

161
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,120
A girl must love herself first.

162
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,280
Only then can others love you.

163
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,480
Let's start.

164
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,120
Come on.

165
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,040
Come on.

166
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,920
My baby.

167
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
Hurry up. I'll get changed.

168
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,280
Sweetie, mom.

169
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,920
I don't want to change.

170
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,360
What are you doing? It's so pretty.

171
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
That's my daughter.

172
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,760
You look good in anything.

173
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
So nice.

174
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,880
Look.

175
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
Just leave this set.

176
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
No, no.

177
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
Except those black ones,

178
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,480
Leave the rest to me.

179
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,400
Leave them all.

180
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,760
I don't need that much.

181
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,280
It's none of your business.

182
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,080
What else?

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,880
Bring them up.

184
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,680
Okay.

185
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,400
This one

186
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,760
It's moisturizing

187
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
Come on, one set.

188
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,160
OK, this one is for a lady.

189
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,160
And it's whitening anti-aging.

190
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,800
A noble lady?

191
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, two sets.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,720
Enough, mom.

We can't spend it without money.
