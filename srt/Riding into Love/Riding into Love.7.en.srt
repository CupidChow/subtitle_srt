1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief Producer.

2
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,080
Uncle, have some tea.

3
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,240
Haoming,

4
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,360
I came here today

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,440
to talk to you

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,240
about your marriage with Xiaoxiao.

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,640
Uncle.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,360
What about Xiaoxiao?

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,680
I think she is

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,520
an excellent girl.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm afraid I don't deserve her.

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,880
I'll leave her to you.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,800
I can rest assured.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,840
Back then,

15
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,400
when your father was here,

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,560
I promised your father.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,760
Although I only have ten percent

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,760
I only have ten percent,

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,400
I also

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,760
for my daughter Xiaoxiao.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,520
As for the distribution of the shares of the Double Cow Field,

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,600
is 45 percent.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,200
Your cousin has 45 percent.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,960
If Xiaoxiao marries you again,

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,800
if Xiaoxiao marries you again.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,400
Then you are a major shareholder.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,520
When you talk in the company,

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,960
you'll be a man of words.

29
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,640
Uncle, I always follow the rules

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,440
I always follow the rules.

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,640
I won't make a big deal out of it.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,640
Uncle, my girlfriend called me.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,720
I need to answer this.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,960
Honey.

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,800
I'll be right there.

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,600
Wait for me. Okay.

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,200
Girlfriend?

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,600
You already have a girlfriend.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,760
I just had a date.

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
What do you mean?

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
When your parents

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,880
agreed to this marriage when they were alive.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,440
Now my parents are gone.

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,480
Are you breaking the contract?

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,720
Haoming.

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm telling you today.

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,840
If you don’t get engaged

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,560
in a year,

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,320
just wait for your big clients

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,880
to stop renewing the contract with you.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm thirsty.

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,240
Why is this pot hot?

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,640
My mom is prepared.

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
How did she know I was coming back?

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,120
I don't know.

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
I almost fell asleep.

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,600
What took you so long?

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,640
Why do you have the key to my house?

59
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,000
This house is on the Internet.

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,800
I bought it.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,960
What did you do?

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
Your mother entrusted

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
to the third party.

64
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,160
There's a house book.

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,200
It's written clearly.

66
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,200
This is my house now.

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,240
Okay.

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,200
I'll leave then.

69
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,360
Anyway,

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,079
I don't want to stay with you any longer.

71
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,960
There are several horses at the door

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,160
to ask for compensation.

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,520
What?

74
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,160
Didn't you say you don't want to stay with me any longer?

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,280
Leave.

76
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,800
You found the man at the door.

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,240
It's snowing everywhere.

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,960
Dou'e is not as wronged as me.

79
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
Can you stop spinning?

80
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,800
If you want me to help, just tell me.

81
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
I know what you're up to.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,960
But don't even think about it.

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm just giving you a choice.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Just forget what I said.

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,600
You didn't eat, right?

86
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,720
Me neither.

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,920
What are you doing?

88
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,080
I stored these before.

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,240
Don't eat them.

90
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,640
There are only two bitter gourds.

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,560
Two eggs.

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
Hello?

93
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,480
It's mine.

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
My takeout is here.

95
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,760
Delivery?

96
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,880
No, no, no.

97
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,000
You can't open the door.

98
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,400
I won't.

99
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,560
Steamed egg with bitter gourd.

100
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,840
But there seems to be no seasoning.

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,600
Smells good

102
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,920
There are abalone crabs

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,880
It smells so good.

104
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,560
Delicious

105
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,360
It smells good.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,040
I don't care.

107
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,120
Your saliva is all over it.

108
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,760
It's dirty. It touched.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,400
Your saliva is stained on it.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,880
You think my saliva is dirty?

111
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,360
Your saliva is all over your mouth.

112
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,000
You have to throw it away if you can't eat it.

113
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,400
Don't waste it

114
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,840
Gosh.

115
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm full.

116
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,640
I need to go to bed.

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Don't come in.

118
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,200
I'm shy.

119
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,840
There are so many dishes.

120
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
It's a waste if you don't eat.

121
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,720
It smells good.

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Delicious

123
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,760
Smells good, right?

124
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
I thought you went in to sleep.

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Why did you come out?

126
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,960
I couldn't sleep because someone was nagging me.

127
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,360
I forced you to eat this.

128
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,640
Ruan Qingtian is unwilling.

129
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,720
Yes.

130
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
You're unwilling.

131
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,280
You forced me to eat.

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
You forced me to eat.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I treated you so well,

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
but you turned a blind eye, Ruan Qingtian.

135
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,200
How are you nice to me?

136
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,640
Oh my god, how are you nice to me?

137
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,520
What did I do to you?

138
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,320
Touch you.

139
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,680
What are you doing? Where are you touching?

140
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,440
Your hands are oily.

141
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,880
Don't make my hair greasy.

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,679
I want to touch it.

143
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,280
I'll touch your hair

144
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,120
on your hair.

145
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,640
Ruan Qingtian, this is my home.

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,520
If you want to sleep here tonight,

147
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,840
eat it for me.

148
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,800
No, I'll do it myself.

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,000
Let's make a deal.

150
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,760
You really are a businessman.

151
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,000
Of course.

152
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,480
Businessmen value fairness and integrity.

153
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,360
Does your mom have nowhere to sleep?

154
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,000
None of your business.

155
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
Go back to the racecourse now.

156
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,720
I can transfer this house to you.

157
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,760
and write your name.

158
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,520
Nod for me.

159
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,800
Just eat.

160
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
It's a deal.

161
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
Ruan Qingtian, why are you back?

162
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
This place is mine.

163
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,600
Can't I go back to my own place?

164
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
Haoming, you left in a hurry that day

165
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,040
just to find her?

166
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,160
We need her to wake Qiang up.

167
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,800
Do you hear me, Ruan Qingtian?

168
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,920
This is the meaning of your existence.

169
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,840
At least my existence is meaningful.

170
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,640
right?

171
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,960
Haoming, my dad went to see you, right?

172
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,680
Yes.

173
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,280
I'll visit him some other day.

174
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,840
Let's go shopping.

175
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
No, I can't walk.

176
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,840
I'm asking Xiaoxiao.

177
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,600
Okay, Haoming.

178
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,720
Let's go now.

179
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,560
Who is it?

180
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,680
Coming

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
What are you doing?

182
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,560
Someone asked me to give you something.

183
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,040
The farm is having an event.

184
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,760
You know that, right?

185
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,680
Yes.

186
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,800
Haoming is afraid that you have nothing to wear.

187
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,880
to wear clothes.

188
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,600
So

189
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,680
he asked me to prepare

190
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,960
for you.

191
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,600
Xiaoxiao,

192
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
Are you here to make fun of me?

193
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,520
Let me tell you again.

194
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm not a rabbit.

195
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,640
I'm a big wolf, okay?

196
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,080
A dog bites Lü Dongbin.

197
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,920
Gouluo Dongbin is talking about two people.

198
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,640
Got it?

199
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,440
What? Braille?

200
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,600
Who are you calling illiterate?

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,360
Fine. I'll tell you.

202
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,600
Gou Di is a personal name.

203
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,560
Before Lü Dongbin became an immortal,

204
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,400
a friend from his hometown named Gou Dai.

205
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,760
Later, those uneducated people

206
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
by those uneducated people.

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,440
Go back and read Chinese ancient books.

208
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,680
What do you mean?

209
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,960
You think I'm uneducated?

210
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,760
Ruan Qingtian.

211
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Go back to study.

212
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,160
Ridiculous. You are uneducated.

213
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,640
Your whole family is uneducated.

214
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,960
Welcome.

215
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,600
Welcome

216
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,280
Thank you.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Let's get together more often.

218
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,000
No problem.

219
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,160
Xiaoxiao, I picked two dresses for you that day.

220
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
One for you, one for Qingtian.

221
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,360
Didn't you give it to her?

222
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,360
I did.

223
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,200
She said she didn't want it.

224
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,040
Ask her if you don't believe me.

225
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,960
Qingtian.

226
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
I asked Xiaoxiao to get you your clothes.

227
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,920
Why don't you want it?

228
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,400
Why don't you give it to me?

229
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,720
Why can't I?

230
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,200
No.

231
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,280
Qingtian, are you mad at me?

232
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,320
I have something to do. Excuse me.

233
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
Haoming, let's go with the guests.

234
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,040
Come on.

235
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,840
Sit down.

236
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,760
Come on.

237
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,880
I observed the stars at night.

238
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,800
I knew a fairy was crying secretly.

239
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,040
Who's crying?

240
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,200
Isn't it you?

241
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,480
Then why are you drinking alone here?

242
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,640
None of your business.

243
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,280
I have to tell you everything.

244
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,040
I want...

245
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,840
Boss.

246
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,800
Here.

247
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,000
Wealth.

248
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
There are mosquitoes here.

249
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,040
Get me some mosquito repellent.

250
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,600
Never mind.

251
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,880
I have one.

252
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,200
We're drinking and playing games.

253
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,320
Go get a coin.

254
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,760
Go.

255
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
I have one.

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,520
Are you looking for trouble?

257
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,880
No.

258
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,960
You two are so funny.

259
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,160
As long as you're happy.

260
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm too sleepy.

261
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,840
Maybe it's because

262
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,520
I drank too much.

263
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,600
