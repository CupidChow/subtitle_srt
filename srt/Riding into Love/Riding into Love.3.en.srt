1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
He's here. He's here.

2
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,960
Why did he

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,200
fight my parents?

4
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
What does he have

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,920
with my parents?

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,280
Why did they do this to my dad?

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,800
Why was my dad at his house?

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,240
Could it be...

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,800
Are you making clothes for their family?

10
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,880
to make clothes for their family?

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,200
You died miserably.

12
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:15,320
Your parents' phones

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
The data in the phone has been thoroughly read.

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,360
The police have issued a proof

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,920
your parents

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,760
and at the same time,

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,600
who died at the same time.

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,120
called Ruan Bin, 50 years old.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,800
There were signs of a fierce fight at the scene.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,680
They fell while fighting.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,360
About Ruan Bin,

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,960
the police revealed that

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
he is a designer of a small clothing design company.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,560
In family relationship,

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,960
his wife is his wife.

26
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,520
He has a daughter.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,520
He has a harmonious family.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,280
She has no criminal record.

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,160
Miss Ruan found nothing useful

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,479
in your father's phone.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,360
This belongs to your father.

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,080
Take it back and keep it.

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,040
I couldn't reach your mother.

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,759
I can only wait for your mother to call you.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,240
Dad.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,000
Mr. Ren, my condolences.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,760
My condolences, Miss Ruan.

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,280
When can I contact you?

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,120
Dad has been gone for many days.

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
Where are you?

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
Ruan Qingtian.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
Haoming has been gone for over a month.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,320
You've lost weight because of the horses.

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,320
Ruan Qingtian,

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,280
You're so bad at managing.

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,400
I fed the horses according to the rules.

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160
Those horses have lost weight.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,840
They must have become muscle.

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
You're good at talking.

50
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
Fat becomes muscle.

51
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,600
Do you think a horse is human?

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,600
When Xiaoxiao was managing it,

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
I've never done this before.

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,720
The competition is coming soon.

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
Have you contacted Haoming recently?

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,240
No.

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,880
I knew you were irresponsible.

58
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,840
How are my horses?

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,240
Haoming, you're finally back.

60
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,079
Take a look.

61
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,040
Ruan Qingtian has lost weight from starvation.

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
The horse master meeting is coming soon.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
What grass did you feed him?

64
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,079
I fed them according to the rules.

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
The grass in the warehouse.

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,480
Those horses need imported grass.

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,040
You've been managing Xiaoxiao Grass, right?

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,760
Director Ren has a lot to do in the farm.

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,079
and you've been walking for so long.

70
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,079
She can't manage it alone.

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,040
She's been very worried about you lately.

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,040
She's so worried that she's exhausted.

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,800
Right.

74
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,160
Lee Hwan Hwan.

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,600
I’m hungry. Get me some food.

76
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,160
Okay.

77
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,280
I'll make you

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,400
your favorite dumplings.

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,320
Mr Ren, please enjoy.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,280
Eat with me.

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,000
You like vinegar so much?

82
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,040
At this moment,

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,800
I'm finally back to normal.

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,720
What's wrong?

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,640
Did something happen?

86
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
Drink this bowl of vinegar.

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll tell you after I finish it.

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,160
No, no.

89
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,880
I surrender.

90
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,120
Surrender.

91
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,400
You have to raise your white flag if you surrender.

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
Then eat this half of the dumplings

93
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,640
and dance for me.

94
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,560
and help me get rid of all my sorrows.

95
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,920
I can share your sadness with others.

96
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,600
Then don't eat the dumplings.

97
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,560
Dance for me.

98
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
I saw you dancing in school.

99
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,040
I didn't dance because you told me to.

100
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,640
I'll lose face.

101
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,360
Don't eat the dumplings

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Just dance a little bit.

103
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,320
A little.

104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,640
Ruan Qingtian.

105
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,280
Enough.

106
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,320
You're smiling.

107
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,200
I don't care.

108
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,360
From the moment you came in,

109
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
your face is like a piece of metal.

110
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,600
What?

111
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,720
How dare you say I look like a piece of metal?

112
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
My face doesn't look like iron.

113
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Here, here, here.

114
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
Touch it.

115
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,240
Where does it look like iron?

116
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,440
No.

117
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,240
Let me take you somewhere.

118
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
Sure.

119
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,600
Come to our double-edged farm.

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Do you feel

121
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,640
the horses of the double-edged farm

122
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,280
It's better than the horses of your farm.

123
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,280
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,720
Don't stand out.

125
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,559
Everything is fine here.

126
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,160
You didn't say a word in school.

127
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,200
How do you know I'm quiet?

128
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
You see someone else every day.

129
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm not the focus.

130
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
Forget it. Let me introduce.

131
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,440
This is Hayate.

132
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,960
It not only likes to be touched,

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,840
but also likes this.

134
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,800
So stingy.

135
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
Try it. When I first met Hayate,

136
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,400
it took me a long time to gain its trust.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
Hayate!

138
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
You did it all at once.

139
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,400
It must really like you.

140
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,440
I'll leave you to take care of Hayate.

141
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,000
Stand still!

142
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,160
Okay.

143
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
Here's the ingredients.

144
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay.

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Come and help.

146
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,520
Come and help.

147
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,080
Help me.

148
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,880
Hurry up.

149
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,080
Qingtian.

150
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Go and take a look.

151
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,400
Hayate is full of foam.

152
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,040
Let's go.

153
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,120
Look what you've done.

154
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,000
Ruan Qingtian, what did you feed him?

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,360
He was fine before you came.

156
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
How come

157
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,040
when you came?

158
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,120
Do you know how much effort

159
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,520
to train that horse?

160
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Ruan Qingtian,

161
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,560
How can you let Ren Haoming down?

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,800
I...

163
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,680
Let me tell you.

164
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,240
Let me tell you.

165
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,400
Ruan Qingtian sings and dances.

166
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
She's so cute.

167
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,760
If I die first one day,

168
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,640
my biggest wish is

169
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,760
to let Ruan Qingtian come to my grave every day

170
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,280
and sing "Little Reliance".

171
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,800
Go.

172
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,520
Get down!

173
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,680
Where are you taking me?

174
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
I was going to give Hayate to a girl

175
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,120
a girl I had a crush on for a long time.

176
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,880
A girl who has a crush for a long time.

177
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,800
Yes, that's why I asked you to feed her.

178
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,560
A horse and a person

179
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,760
trust is hard.

180
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,160
Once this relationship is established,

181
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,800
the horse will never betray you.

182
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,360
I don't understand what you're talking about.

183
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,720
I only understand

184
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,960
you have a crush on a girl.

185
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,880
Fine. I'll say something you can understand.

186
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,560
Hayate is in danger.

187
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,840
As someone who takes care of it,

188
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,640
you have an inescapable responsibility.

189
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,600
Do you admit it?

190
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,200
I do.

191
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,200
