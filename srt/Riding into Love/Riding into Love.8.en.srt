00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,160
Hello.

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,920
You can't go in

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,960
This is a membership system You can't go in

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,840
This is my daughter's farm.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
My daughter's farm.

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,640
You can't go in there.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,040
Baby, give me a hug.

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,720
My baby.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,320
Did you see that?

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,880
This is my daughter, Ruan Qingtian.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,080
Go back to work.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,560
Mom.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,120
Let's talk outside.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
I have something to tell you.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,320
What are you doing?

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,640
Is this your award-winning farm?

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,360
You won't let me in.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,320
Is it because you're rich now?

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,240
because you're rich now?

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,920
Mom, I want to ask you first.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,920
Why didn't you answer

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,880
Why didn't you answer?

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,240
Also,

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,960
where were you when my dad died?

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,680
I came to tell you about your dad.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,600
The lawyer said

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
we can

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,600
The landlord

30
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,680
the landlord who fell down to claim compensation.

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,080
We can get a lot of money.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,360
Mom, that's enough.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,000
My dad passed away.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,960
They both died.

35
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,479
Why should we ask for compensation?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,960
Now,

37
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,960
I just want to know

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,320
between the three of them.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,360
The lawyer said he'll look for clues.

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
Of course, we have to compensate him.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,720
Your dad jumped off his building.

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,280
Why did you

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,120
why did you go to their house?

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Am I right?

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,440
If they die,

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,600
he still has a child.

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,000
He can sell his house

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
and pay us back.

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Right? In that case,

50
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,920
Otherwise,

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
why did your dad

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,920
jumped off their building?

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,000
Your dad died unjustly.

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,200
Alright, mom.

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,320
I heard you, mom.

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,640
I've taken care of the house.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,560
Here's the key.

58
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,200
Go back and live there.

59
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,640
But remember,

60
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,320
don't gamble anymore.

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
I took the money.

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,840
I gave the house book to him.

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
Mom, I said

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,079
Anyway,

65
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,000
I've taken care of this house.

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
You can go back

67
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,480
and continue to live there.

68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,720
Okay.

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,280
My daughter has grown up.

70
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,400
and capable.

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
You won't let me

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
become the Grand Empress Dowager?

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,840
Mom, listen.

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,040
things in the farm are complicated.

75
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,480
When I'm done,

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,160
and you can come anytime.

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,560
You want to be the Grand Empress Dowager inside.

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,360
Make your choice.

79
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Okay.

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,800
I believe my daughter

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,840
is the most capable person in the world.

82
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,079
Mom.

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,880
I have something to do inside.

84
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,200
I called a taxi for you.

85
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,079
It's just ahead.

86
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,560
You'll be there in two steps.

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
I won't see you off, okay?

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Okay.

89
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,640
Go home now.

90
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,360
Call me when you get home.

91
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
I'll go in first.

92
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
Stop gambling.

93
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,760
Okay.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,320
Tell me when you get home, mom.

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,480
Okay.

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,040
Qiang is awake.

97
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,880
Hello.

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,400
I need to deal with

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,200
I have to deal with it.

100
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
Qiang.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Qiang.

102
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,680
Qiang.

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,520
Qiang.

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,720
Are you alright?

105
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Help!

106
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Let me say something first.

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
The doctor just left.

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,320
He said my cousin hasn't woken up yet.

109
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,960
So, any possibility could exist.

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,480
Also,

111
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,000
I won't blame Qingtian

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
to Qingtian.

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,440
But who else could it be?

114
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,240
After she went in,

115
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
Qiang was on the ground.

116
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,240
Who else could it be?

117
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,360
I've never touched him.

118
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
It's all my fault.

119
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,200
I didn’t watch it.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,120
Lee Hwan, calm down.

121
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
Don’t talk nonsense without evidence.

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Since Qiang died,

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,080
I installed a CCTV.

124
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,200
Let's check it out together.

125
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,160
Ruan Qingtian, look.

126
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,400
Only you passed through this room.

127
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,520
Who else could it be?

128
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
Are you a ghost if not you?

129
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,680
I said it wasn't me.

130
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
Stop pretending.

131
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,280
You keep pretending to be innocent.

132
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,640
How long are you going to pretend?

133
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
It really wasn't me.

134
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,720
Someone must have tampered with this.

135
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,000
Get out.

136
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,120
No, no.

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
You... Let's go.

138
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,840
I haven't finished yet.

139
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,920
Do you have something to tell me in private?

140
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,320
I want to know if it was you.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Are you okay?

142
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,560
Qingtian, are you okay?

143
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
I hate you.

144
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I hate you.

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,440
You hate me.

146
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,800
You threw away the gift

147
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,120
You threw it away without even looking at it.

148
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,800
When did you give me a gift?

149
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,280
When I was in school.

150
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,000
when I was in school.

151
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
to the canteen.

152
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,960
to be with you.

153
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,200
I went to the library

154
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,160
to meet you.

155
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,920
I wrote you a love letter.

156
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
But you disliked me.

157
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,160
like a joke.

158
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,120
I don't want to like you anymore.

159
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,800
I don't want to talk to you.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,920
All right.

161
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
I hate you.

162
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,000
I hate you. I hate you.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,440
I hate you.

164
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
I hate you.

165
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,960
All right.

166
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,080
I hate you.

167
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Okay, stop crying.

168
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,160
Why am I here?

169
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,680
What are you doing?

170
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,720
I don't know

171
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,840
who insisted on sleeping with me.

172
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
No way.

173
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,480
Maybe you had a dream.

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,440
Yes, you were dreaming.

175
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,360
Qingtian.

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,640
I won't make you unhappy again.

178
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,440
I mean,

179
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,040
I won't force you to do things you don't like.

180
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,400
Really?

181
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,080
So you believe

182
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,040
what I told Qiang?

183
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,080
About this...

184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,360
Brother.

185
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,560
Qingtian said

186
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,840
she liked me when she was in school.

187
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,000
But you said she likes you.

188
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,880
What's going on?

189
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,920
Should I trust you or her?

190
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,480
I'm telling the truth.

191
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,080
right?

192
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
No matter what I say now,

193
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,520
no matter what I say.

194
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,400
