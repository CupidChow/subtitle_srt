1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
He said

2
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,400
What did he say just now?

3
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,000
Mom, pack up.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,240
Didn't you trust him yesterday?

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,640
that you would overcome the difficulties with him?

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,400
Mom doesn't need me at all.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,320
From now on, he'll go his way.

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,560
I'll cross my single-plank bridge.

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,640
and become a stranger.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,360
He did something wrong.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,040
Why should we leave?

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,280
Mom, what are you doing?

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,280
He doesn't give me compensation.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,400
If he doesn't give us an explanation,

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,000
we will never leave.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,640
For what?

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,440
I just want to leave here.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
and cut ties with him.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,400
No.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,039
No, daughter.

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,600
My daughter is a virgin.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,920
He cried

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,600
with us.

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,720
He left the scene alone.

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,360
It's so unfair to my daughter.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
Listen, daughter.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,479
Your dad is gone.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,800
If your dad were here,

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
he'll die.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,280
Mom.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,039
How dare he bully my daughter?

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,400
Ruan Qingtian.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,479
You came at the right time.

35
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,160
Ruan Qingtian.

36
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,680
Talk to her.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,479
Where are you going?

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
It's none of your business.

39
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,920
You don't need me anyway.

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,080
I don't need you either.

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,080
Take care of yourself.

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,360
It's your own business.

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,039
You two make it clear.

44
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,560
Good hand. No, play well.

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm leaving.

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,760
Talk nicely.

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,720
Move. Don't go.

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,720
I was at the racecourse before.

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,240
You didn't let me go. I didn't leave.

50
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,600
Because you said

51
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,920
the horses and sheep in the racecourse need to be taken care of.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,120
They'll die. I didn't leave.

53
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,840
But do you really think I'm a fool?

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,760
I don't believe you.

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm just a romantic.

56
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,120
Can you stop being unreasonable?

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
What did you say?

58
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
I'm being unreasonable.

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,120
Okay.

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,760
Then let this unreasonable person go.

61
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,040
You like this box, right?

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,000
This is for you.

63
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,440
I just didn't think it through.

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,800
I didn't ask you to leave.

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,440
Wherever you go,

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,240
wherever you go.

67
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,400
Then why did you run away from the wedding?

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,520
Why didn't you marry me?

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,640
Why? Tell me.

70
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,600
Why why

71
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,920
Why?

72
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,160
Come in.

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,680
Mr. Ren.

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,800
I found the photo of Ruan Bin and your mother.

75
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,200
Mom, you said I'm not leaving.

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,320
You said you would leave again.

77
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,880
You can't ignore your career

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,800
just because you're old.

79
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
You should

80
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,520
take care of yourself.

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,640
You can't abandon your career

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,600
because of Ren Haoming.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,560
right?

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,720
Usually,

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,960
take care of yourself.

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,800
Be good to yourself.

87
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
I

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,760
go out to exercise

89
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,399
with Aunt Wang and Aunt Meng.

90
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,440
Stay away from the table.

91
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,760
Gosh, I won't bother you here.

92
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,040
I'm not saying

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,480
can you stay away from the table?

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,280
Why don't you not go?

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,960
Stay with me.

96
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,200
If mom is here,

97
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,840
it'll be bad for both of you.

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,240
Maybe if mom leaves,

99
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Maybe you two can make up.

100
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,200
You mean this?

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,720
It takes ten years to travel together.

102
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
We can sleep together for a hundred years.

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,280
I've said so many things.

104
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,920
I want you to be happy.

105
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,160
Okay, I'll see you off.

106
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,720
I'm hanging up.

107
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm leaving.

108
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Be careful.

109
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,200
Bye.

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,840
Bye.

111
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,240
Wealth, look.

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,440
My land is crushed.

113
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,720
Why is it all gone?

114
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,240
Don't worry.

115
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,480
Let's wait here.

116
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
He's not our man.

117
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,680
Yes, that's him.

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,760
Stop.

119
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,480
Don't open it.

120
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,840
Move aside.

121
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,120
Look.

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,880
You've crushed my land.

123
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Who told you to come?

124
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,400
The employer said this land belongs to her.

125
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,360
It's about to grow.

126
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,680
employer.

127
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,520
Who called her out?

128
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,360
Yes, let her out.

129
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,320
Who's calling me?

130
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,560
It's you.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,159
The bride who was abandoned at the wedding.

132
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm the employer.

133
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,120
What is it?

134
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,680
Look what you've done to my floor.

135
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,800
In the afternoon,

137
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,880
Let me farm the land of double-armed farm.

138
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,760
I think I should try farming.

139
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,240
So I asked him to farm the land.

140
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,280
You can't just farm.

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,840
Why are you pressing my land?

142
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,280
When did you own the farm?

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,840
Keep farming.

144
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,720
Okay.

145
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,880
Don't.

146
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,040
You're pressing my ground now.

147
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,440
Yours.

148
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,000
Can it say yes if you call it?

149
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,320
If it dares to say yes, it's yours.

150
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,960
Otherwise, you're lying.

151
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,840
Xiaoxiao,

152
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,880
Are you picking a fight?

153
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
I did.

154
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,880
You caught me.

155
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,000
So what?

156
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,880
A woman who has been abandoned by Haoming

157
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,159
yet you're still pestering me.

158
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,360
You bitch!

159
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,000
It's so sunny.

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,360
Stop fighting

161
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,320
Stop!

162
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,400
What's wrong with me pulling you?

163
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,280
You two...

164
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Get out of my way!

165
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,000
Stop pulling my hat!

166
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,120
No, I have to call someone.

167
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,480
Boss.

168
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,400
I'll kill you.

169
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
Go away!

170
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,040
Come on.

171
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,800
Nonsense.

172
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,320
How dare you!

173
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,920
I'll kill you.

174
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,280
Let go!

175
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,320
You bitch!

176
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,840
How dare you press my ground!

177
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
How dare you!

178
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
This photo proves

179
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,120
his father is the culprit

180
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,280
who ruined my parents' marriage.

181
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
For Ruan Qingtian,

182
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
to Ruan Qingtian.

183
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
I want her to know

184
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,920
I don't love her that much.

185
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
It doesn't matter anymore.

186
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,280
Mr Ren.

187
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,520
Mr Ren.

188
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,720
What's wrong?

189
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,800
They're fighting again.

190
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,680
Okay.

191
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,760
Why is it so opium?

192
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,440
Who took this photo?

193
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,440
I've seen this man in the photo.

194
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
I sent something to Mr Ren's mother that day.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
I heard Director Ren's mother crying.

196
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,520
I've had enough of this day.

197
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,840
I really want to run away from home.

198
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,000
Have you thought about it?

199
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,480
if you two have kids,

200
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,880
Once you run away,

201
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,600
it'll affect the child a lot.

202
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
He almost killed me.

203
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,200
I really don't want to live with him.

204
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,520
Please help me.

205
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll help you.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,920
I was wondering who this man was.

207
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
I didn't dare to tell anyone.

208
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,760
Ms. Ren was very nice to me when she was alive.

209
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,280
I can't let her be criticized by me.

210
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,680
No, I can't let Mr. Ren see it.

211
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,120
What on earth

212
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,320
between them?

213
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,000
For this,

214
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,160
I also asked Haoming's lawyer.

215
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,680
But he has a tight mouth.

216
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
He won't say anything.

217
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
Of course he can't tell you.

218
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,680
If he tells you,

219
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,800
how can he be Ren Haoming's lawyer?

220
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,480
However,

221
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,480
what happened

222
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,520
must make Haoming

223
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,920
and can't be solved.

224
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,120
Let's add more fire for him.

225
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,840
You really love Ruan Qingtian.

226
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,400
You too.

227
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,160
Cheers.

228
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,080
What are you doing?

229
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,040
You've been acting like a ghost all day.

230
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,920
What are you doing?

231
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm like a shadow.

232
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,400
This is my office.

233
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,600
I wanted to ask you what you were doing sneakily.

234
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,680
Wait.

235
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,520
What?

236
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,400
Did you take my stuff?

237
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,080
What are you doing?

238
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,720
I didn't take your stuff.

239
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
What is it?

240
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,760
You must have taken my stuff.

241
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,960
What is it?

242
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,320
I didn't take anything from you.

243
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,240
Wait.

244
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,480
What are you doing?

245
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,520
Give it back to me.

246
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,480
I didn't take your stuff.

247
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,160
Give it back to me.

248
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,480
I didn't take anything from you.

249
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
When did you learn to steal?

250
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
Qingtian.

251
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,280
Why are you here?

252
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,160
I've been looking for you.

253
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,000
What's the matter?

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,320
Your senior called you.

255
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,560
Got it.

256
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Please come in.

257
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,520
This is it.

258
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,840
The decoration is elegant.

259
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,720
The location is good too.

260
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,040
Qingtian.

261
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,000
Long time no see.

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,920
Qiang, you're here.

263
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Happy opening.

264
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,200
Long time no see.

265
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,600
Thank you.

266
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,880
Thank you.

267
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
Your restaurant is so beautiful.

268
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,600
Qingtian,

269
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,280
You look more beautiful today.

270
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,120
When Qiang said you were at the racecourse,

271
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,760
I called him.

272
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,680
You must come.

273
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,760
Senior invited you.

274
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm sure Qingtian won't refuse.

275
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,640
Right?

276
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,360
Of course.

277
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,040
You have to come.

278
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,400
OK, go in first.

279
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,240
I'll ask the chef to prepare some

280
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
our special dishes.

281
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,680
It's a deal.

282
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,840
We won't stand on ceremony.

283
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,240
Go.

284
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,200
Okay. See you later.

285
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,640
Nice.

286
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,520
Yes.

287
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,600
Sit here.

288
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,800
By the way,

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,960
You don't eat coriander?

290
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,360
Sit here for a while.

291
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,440
I'll tell her.

292
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,600
Okay.

293
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,880
Haoming.

294
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,680
Your friend must be very rich.

295
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,400
The entire restaurant looks nice.

296
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,960
It looks high.

297
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,920

298
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,520

Why are you here?

302
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,520
Why are you everywhere?

303
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,960
Did you come to meet Haoming by chance?

304
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,040
You scheming bitch.

305
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,560
Your cognition deserves your stupidity.

306
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,120
