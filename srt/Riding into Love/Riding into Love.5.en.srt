1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Chief Producer.

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,280
I deserve to die.

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,040
I deserve to die.

4
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
My husband died two months ago.

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,280
I really don't know.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,520
Do you think I'm a human?

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,239
My daughter.

8
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,400
Why didn't she tell me?

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,320
Your phone hasn't been connected.

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,480
Miss Qingtian can't reach you.

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,320
I'm sorry for your loss.

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,560
At this point,

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,520
It's important for the living to live well.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,720
I'd like to ask for your opinion as a family member.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,160
to ask for reasonable compensation.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Compensate?

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,560
Your husband fell from his house.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As his family, you can make a reasonable claim.

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,080
You're awesome.

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,120
You're right.

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,479
Then my husband...

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,080
is just a designer.

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,080
Apart from work,

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,039
except for work.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,920
Why did he suddenly

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,440
to each other's house?

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
Why did he fall off the building

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,920
fall off the building together?

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,480
There must be something behind this.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,600
At least they didn't fulfill

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,560
to protect them.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Awesome.

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,440
That's my lawyer.

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,880
You're amazing.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
You're right.

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,640
This must be their problem.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,400
If we ask for compensation,

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,120
the other couple

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,240
also jumped off the building.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,320
Who should we ask for compensation?

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,560
The heir of that couple.

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,000
It's a luxurious house.

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,840
They all live in rich people.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,720
They must compensate us.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,600
I believe Mr Ruan

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,520
in heaven

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,600
I hope you two can live a better life.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,600
Yes.

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,120
We have to ask them to compensate.

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,000
Sign on the request.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,280
We'll file a lawsuit first.

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
I'll charge you

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,680
30 percent of the compensation.

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
OK. Let me see.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,280
So many.

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,320
Is it Party A?

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,720
Yes.

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,120
Okay.

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,000
Ruan Qingtian,

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,680
Do you really think you're the owner of the farm?

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,000
You want me to serve you?

62
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,360
If Mr. Ren hadn't insisted,

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,880
I wouldn't have let you stay at the farm for a day.

64
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,560
Let's eat.

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,640
Are you deaf?

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
or dumb?

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,680
Mr Ren said

68
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,440
I can't starve you to death. Let's eat.

69
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,600
I’m not hungry.

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,760
Lee Hwan-hwan, make it for me.

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
Haoming said

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,600
Don't let her starve to death.

73
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,840
You...

74
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,440
Give me some.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,120
Don't you like sour food?

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,120
You like vinegar.

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,440
Give it to me. I'll let you have enough vinegar porridge today.

78
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,400
Give it to me.

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
Drink it.

80
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,360
No.

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,040
Stop bullying me.

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
Let's make a deal.

83
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,079
What deal?

84
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,960
I know you hate me.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,960
I know my presence

86
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,440
took everything from you.

87
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Are you showing off to me?

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,760
I'll give it to you.

89
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,480
I'm leaving the farm. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,400
And...

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,480
I won't take anything that belongs here.

92
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,400
I came back here willingly today.

93
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,680
I had no choice.

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,680
What deal?

95
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,840
The premise of the deal is

96
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,320
the farms

97
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,280
horses, sheep and crops

98
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,400
and crops.

99
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,840
In a few days,

100
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,760
there will be an event in the racecourse.

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,640
Xiaoxiao.

102
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,840
Xiaoxiao, don't worry.

103
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,760
Everything is ready.

104
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,280
The car is outside.

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,480
Me?

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,560
I pushed the vixen to the car.

107
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,880
and the wheelchair.

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm going to Haoming's bedroom tonight.

109
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,760
You lure everyone here.

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,800
Sure.

111
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,560
I promise I'll cook you a proper meal

112
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,560
to prove your relationship with Mr. Ren.

113
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,400
Let's go.

114
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm leaving.

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,280
Haoming, you're drunk.

116
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,800
Let me help you get some rest.

117
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,800
I'm not drunk.

118
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Keep drinking.

119
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,200
You said you're not drunk.

120
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,360
Mr Ren.

121
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,880
You still have more than 20 tables to drink.

122
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,120
Cheers.

123
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,760
Cheers!

124
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,120
Today is a good day.

125
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,680
We must find him and continue drinking.

126
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:12,920
Keep drinking.

127
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,480
Let's go.

128
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,480
Let's get drunk.

129
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,320
Let's go.

130
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,400
The stairs are still shaking.

131
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,480
This...

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,440
There's someone on the bed.

133
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,720
Xiaoxiao.

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Why are you here?

135
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,880
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,360
It's okay.

137
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,960
I'll wake Haoming up now.

138
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
Let him have fun with us.

139
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,760
Haoming.

140
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,240
Haoming, wake up.

141
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,040
Haoming.

142
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,240
Why are you here?

143
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,480
Oh my, it’s you, Wealth.

144
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,040
It’s a misunderstanding.

145
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,920
I didn't see it.

146
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,560
It's a misunderstanding.

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,880
Let's go.

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,520
It's a misunderstanding.

149
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,480
Let's go.

150
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
I’m sorry.

151
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,720
Wealth, it’s you.

152
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,160
Boss asked me to sleep here.

153
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,520
Sir, do you think your wheel is faster

154
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,040
or mine?

155
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
Aren't you drunk?

156
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,360
I only drink mineral water.

157
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,960
You reek of alcohol. Go away.

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,240
You think I smell alcohol?

159
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,840
Yes, my clothes are full of white wine.

160
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
Smell it.

161
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
I don't smell alcohol.

162
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,960
Smell it.

163
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Do I still smell alcohol?

164
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,240
I didn't drink a single drop.

165
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,320
I was wrong.

166
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,760
You didn't drink.

167
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,840
You don't know?

168
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,120
I know you don't know.

169
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,520
I know you don't know.

170
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,280
Brother.

171
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,520
You said you and Xiaoxiao

172
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,760
to fix the racecourse,

173
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,360
How wonderful the world would be

174
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,640
Why do you have to work together to encourage me?

175
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,440
I was just pushing the boat along the way.

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,520
and add to the glory.

177
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,360
and leave you to her.

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
You can leave me to her.

179
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,840
but you have to leave you to those horses.

180
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
The horses at Yonhwa Farm are all worth millions.

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
If anything goes wrong,

182
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,400
you'll never be able to compensate the owners.

183
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,480
What do you want?

184
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,560
Sign this for me.

185
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,640
I'll take care of the owners.

186
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,200
and you wake Qiang up.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
He and I are brothers.

188
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,040
I won't give up on him.

189
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Sign it.

190
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,400
Attorney Ren Haoming, Tang Hao.

191
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,320
