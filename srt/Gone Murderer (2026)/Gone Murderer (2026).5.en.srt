1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,560
Boss.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,280
Is it fixed?

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,440
Yes.

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,280
How do you have these photos?

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,920
Who are you?

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,500
I'm Tang Lingling.

8
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,680
Happy birthday to you

9
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:17,120
Happy birthday to you

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,680
Happy birthday to you

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,920
Happy birthday to you

12
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,240
Happy birthday.

13
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,600
[Happy Birthday]

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,560
What's this?

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
This is called a recorder.

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,840
I just borrowed it from the factory.

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,570
Are you happy today?

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,759
Yes.

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,320
I can't hear you. Louder.

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Happy.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
What did you wish for?

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,920
I want to be an actor.

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,000
Actor.

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,080
OK. OK.

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,759
Sure.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,700
Anything else?

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,320
Do you want to be a hero?

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,440
A hero?

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
What's your wish?

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,920
I hope you can be happy every day.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Have you ever thought of finding me a brother-in-law?

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,520
Let me see

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,570
Do you want a beating, Feng Lei?

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,800
No.

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,720
Why do you ask?

36
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,040
Because after this,

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,700
someone will take care of you.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,520
What?

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,360
Can't you take care of me?

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,440
I'm still young.

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,480
Although our family

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,600
can't be revived,

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
But someone

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,560
to seek justice for them.

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Everything that happened back then

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,640
and my plan.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
and my plan.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,860
As for whether you want to join or not,

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,780
you can think about it.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,920
Hello?

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,160
Su Ran?

52
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,970
The crime scene.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,640
Du Bin.

54
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,960
Mr Su.

55
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,680
Mrs Xu.

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,560
Come in.

57
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,920
Su.

58
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,730
Have some water.

59
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,360
The chairman and Mr Duan

60
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,520
are talking about something.

61
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,360
I'll be down soon.

62
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,159
OK. Thank you.

63
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,820
Have a seat.

64
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,760
I'll wait for them here.

65
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,240
If you're busy,

66
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
go ahead.

67
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm fine.

68
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,010
You're welcome.

69
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,960
Have some water.

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, thank you.

71
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,320
Su,

72
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,920
I think

73
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,440
you should know

74
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
you should know.

75
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,840
Go ahead.

76
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,240
Xu and the three of them

77
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
grew up in Yujiang.

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,280
The three of them are like family.

79
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,640
Although Du Bin did something wrong,

80
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,720
family is family.

81
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,650
are different from outsiders.

82
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,960
Mrs. Xu, what are you talking about?

83
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,490
what you're talking about.

84
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,480
Su,

85
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,920
I might as well

86
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
make it more clear.

87
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,159
This is Yujiang.

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,880
If Xu knows

89
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,760
what you did to Du Bin,

90
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,360
what you did to Du Bin.

91
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,760
So...

92
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,080
I think

93
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,880
for your safety,

94
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,530
you should leave here as soon as possible.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What do you think?

96
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120
Su is here.

97
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,280
Chairman.

98
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,200
Mr Duan.

99
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,560
Based on the current situation,

100
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,840
this fishing village is the last place

101
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,320
where Du Bin might appear.

102
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
Everyone, be careful.

103
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,960
Got it.

104
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,039
Chairman.

105
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,799
Mr Duan.

106
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
This is the feedback

107
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,280
since our factory started.

108
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,340
Please take a look.

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,610
Have some water.

110
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
Mr. Shi, it's the weekend.

111
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,240
Why are we here?

112
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,200
Take this.

113
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
What is this?

114
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,500
I'm taking you to be a warm-hearted citizen.

115
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,360
Here.

116
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,220
Follow me, Qin.

117
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,050
Where are you going?

118
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,960
Hao! Hao!

119
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,760
Master.

120
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,690
Why are you here?

121
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,440
Did you ask everyone here?

122
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
Yes.

123
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,800
This way.

124
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
I'm getting ready.

125
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,200
Okay, I'll go this way.

126
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Let's go, Qin.

127
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,680
Okay.

128
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,840
Now the public knows

129
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,360
our factory is also

130
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,200
of this fake drug incident.

131
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
And, Chairman,

132
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,440
the way you handled it seriously

133
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,520
and apologizing.

134
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,880
are very positive.

135
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
So the public

136
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
turn the tide on us.

137
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,640
After so many days,

138
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,480
I finally heard something happy.

139
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Thanks to Su.

140
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,680
However,

141
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,760
Su told me

142
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,000
she has other work to do.

143
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,040
When are you leaving?

144
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,240
Mrs. Xu.

145
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,890
Actually, behind me...

146
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Mr Su is here too.

147
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,040
Dad.

148
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,680
Did you read the online comments?

149
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,440
Du Bin

150
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,080
has been completely scolded.

151
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,410
The online comments say

152
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,200
our factory

153
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
shouldn't take the blame for Du Bin.

154
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,440
Besides,

155
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
several broken purchasers

156
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
have started to contact our factory.

157
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,280
It's all thanks to Mr Su.

158
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Mr Xu

159
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,880
of Mr. Xu.

160
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,960
Ziyang.

161
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Mr Su

162
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
has his own work to do.

163
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,620
I'm leaving Yujiang soon.

164
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,800
Let's find a time

165
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,960
to have dinner together.

166
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,840
Are you leaving, Mr Su?

167
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,320
Yes.

168
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,080
Mr Xu.

169
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,120
Recently,

170
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
for the past few days.

171
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,560
I'm very happy

172
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,760
working with you.

173
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,120
But

174
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,560
happy times

175
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,000
is always short.

176
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,520
But Mr Xu,

177
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,120
if you need anything,

178
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,400
I'll be there anytime.

179
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,640
I really need Mr Su now.

180
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,880
Excuse me.

181
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,080
Have you seen him before?

182
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
Seok Soo.

183
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,640
How is it?

184
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
No.

185
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,400
Let's go.

186
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,930
Seok Soo.

187
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,960
I've asked around.

188
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,240
Should we

189
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
ask over there?

190
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
I know.

191
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
I'm a little hungry.

192
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,740
It's the same problem.

193
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,180
I have low blood sugar.

194
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,640
Boss.

195
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,320
Coming.

196
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,160
Boss.

197
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,840
Make me a bowl of soup noodles.

198
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,640
Less salt and less oil.

199
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Don't add MSG.

200
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,280
Okay.

201
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm not hungry.

202
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Just one bowl.

203
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,840
Hot water.

204
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
Okay, wait a moment.

205
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
Here's the water.

206
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,800
Brother.

207
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,560
Who is he?

208
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,680
Have you seen him before?

209
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,840
He's crazy.

210
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,800
He didn't come to pick up the noodles.

211
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,600
nor pay.

212
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,400
When did we meet?

213
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,340
Yesterday.

214
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,640
Are you sure it was him?

215
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,560
Yes.

216
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,720
100% sure.

217
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,720
Hao.

218
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,000
[Noodles at Building 14.]

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Come here now.

220
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,280
He's alone.

221
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,480
Just him?

222
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,680
The reputation of our factory

223
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,720
has changed.

224
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,120
All consumers

225
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,880
are waiting for our voice.

226
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,040
If we say something wrong,

227
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,570
our efforts will be in vain.

228
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,840
At this critical moment,

229
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,480
needs Mr Su.

230
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,720
So, Mr Su, you can't leave.

231
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,200
Ziyang.

232
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,640
Even if you need Mr Su,

233
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,960
you can't delay

234
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,440
your own business, right?

235
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,200
You can't tie Mr Su here, can you?

236
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,000
Mum, why can't you understand?

237
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,600
If Mr Su...

238
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,120
Okay.

239
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,960
Zi Ang.

240
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,800
Su,

241
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
What do you think?

242
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,400
I don't mind

243
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,080
is not a big deal.

244
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,560
But...

245
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,800
I don't have much to do here.

246
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,280
In terms of clothing and accommodation,

247
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,010
we have to trouble our factory.

248
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I feel a little sorry.

249
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,040
No.

250
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Su,

251
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,080
If you think like this,

252
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
you're too courteous.

253
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,920
He's right.

254
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,120
Compared to the previous stage,

255
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,160
we need your control.

256
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,320
So,

257
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
if you don't have

258
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,770
any more important arrangements,

259
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,040
you can stay.

260
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,320
Su.

261
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,040
Mr Su.

262
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,120
The president said so.

263
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,880
don't refuse it anymore.

264
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,320
Well...

265
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,360
Fine.

266
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,210
Since the president

267
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,080
and Mr Duan,

268
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,240
I...

269
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,640
stay for a while.

270
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,800
Shi.

271
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,200
I'll buy a bottle of water.

272
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,930
I'm thirsty.

273
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,400
What do you want to drink?

274
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,260
I don't need it.

275
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,850
Go ahead.

276
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,400
I...

277
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,660
I'll go buy some water.

278
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,619
Captain Li.

279
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,760
We did find

280
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,720
Du Bin's fingerprint

281
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,800
and some hair left.

282
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,920
I've sent them to the lab.

283
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,760
The remaining instant noodles.

284
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,880
hasn't molded yet.

285
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
He must have lived here recently.

286
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,680
Did you find out who the owner is?

287
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,000
This is a collective house.

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,680
It's a mess.

289
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,810
Song went to ask.

290
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,280
Boss.

291
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,520
I found it.

292
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,119
Who?

293
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,119
Duan Zhigang.

294
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,000
He registered a boat

295
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,040
at Zhankou Pier.

296
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,540
This ship left the sea yesterday.

297
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,650
Summon Duan Zhi Gang immediately.

298
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,080
Mr Duan.

299
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Ma Qin Yi from Zhankou Fishing Village, number 16.

300
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,640
Is this your house?

301
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
Yes, it's mine.

302
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,820
Why invest in such a remote place?

303
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
I

304
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,240
like fishing.

305
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,000
So I found a house

306
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,560
in Zhankou fishing village

307
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,600
to sail.

308
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,800
Who else knows that house?

309
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,840
Just a few fishing friends I know.

310
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,060
What's wrong, Captain Li?

311
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,980
Is there a problem with the house?

312
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,440
Do you have Du Bin

313
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Do you have Du Bin?

314
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
Yes.

315
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,280
Let me check again.

316
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,680
From the 8th of this month to today,

317
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,480
you and Du Bin

318
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,600
with Du Bin,

319
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,400
Right?

320
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,480
This one.

321
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,480
More precisely,

322
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,920
I couldn't reach him.

323
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,320
You went to Zhankou fishing village yesterday.

324
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,800
right?

325
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,400
Yes.

326
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,680
Why?

327
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,090
Fishing.

328
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,120
Think about it.

329
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,920
Just fishing?

330
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,080
No, Captain Li.

331
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,760
What do you want to ask?

332
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,680
In your room,

333
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
in your room.

334
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,200
When you went to Zhankou fishing village,

335
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,460
Du Bin should be there.

336
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,920
Can I suspect

337
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,800
you went there to find Du Bin?

338
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,400
No.

339
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,240
Du Bin is with me?

340
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,840
Duan Zhigang.

341
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,520
Answer the question.

342
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,600
I went to Zhankou fishing village.

343
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,760
and also went to Du Bin.

344
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,880
But I was just trying my luck.

345
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,650
What do you mean?

346
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,290
What do you mean?

347
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,960
I mean,

348
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,820
if Duan Zhigang really went to Du Bin,

349
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,080
it's likely that

350
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,160
about the fake drug.

351
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,400
Duan Zhigang knew about it too.

352
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,120
Or

353
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,330
it has something to do with him.

354
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,680
Could Yan Bo's death

355
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,480
related to Duan Zhigang?

356
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,640
Mr. Shi.

357
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,240
Heo Seong-liang.

358
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,100
The three of them are quite close.

359
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,730
Could Xu Chengliang

360
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,680
the fake medicine?

361
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,480
What’s wrong with him?

362
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
Making fake medicine against yourself.

363
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,640
He said your head

364
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,280
It's "ha".

365
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,440
It's not true.

366
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,800
Du Bin's house

367
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,480
was arranged by Duan Zhigang.

368
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,040
Du Bin has the key to that house.

369
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,680
When he lost gambling,

370
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,840
he went there to hide from debts.

371
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,520
I think I'm already in the fishing village.

372
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,160
I want to see

373
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,640
see him.

374
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
If I see him,

375
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
I will persuade him to turn himself in.

376
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,600
But...

377
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,600
He's not here.

378
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,400
And you went to the sea, right?

379
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,400
Yes.

380
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,690
Where did you go?

381
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,040
I told you.

382
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,280
Fishing.

383
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,720
It's a big deal

384
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,560
You still have the mood to fish?

385
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,290
It's because I'm not in the mood

386
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,720
so I went fishing.

387
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,250
So many things happened in the factory recently.

388
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,560
I want to find a place

389
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,840
to be quiet.

390
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,920
How did you

391
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,100
What happened?

392
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,660
Captain Li.

393
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
I've been fishing for so many years.

394
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,940
I've never caught such a big fish.

395
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,120
To make it,

396
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,650
The stick is broken.

397
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,160
I used my hand

398
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,080
with my hand.

399
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,920
and pulled it up.

400
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,960
When I pull it up, it crosses the scale.

401
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,120
You scared me.

402
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,800
43 kg.

403
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,000
Such a big fish.

404
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,640
Can you

405
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,680
alone?

406
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,440
Of course.

407
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,600
And a young man in our factory

408
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,530
who went with me.

409
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,440
Who?

410
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,200
A captain of our factory security department.

411
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,080
Qin Kaixuan.

412
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
So,

413
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,210
if we want to find Du Bin,

414
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,360
Duan Zhigang...

415
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,690
is

416
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,560
must be very important.

417
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,400
Master.

418
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,760
Is Qin Kaihui

419
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,040
Is he with you now?

420
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,720
Yes.

421
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,800
What's wrong?

422
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,370
I want to see him.

423
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,780
to know something.

424
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,360
I see.

425
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,140
Captain Li.

426
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,280
You asked me here

427
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,560
What is it?

428
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,160
Captain Qin.

429
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,480
We've been in contact for years.

430
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,160
I won't repeat the rules.

431
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Anyway, I'll tell you everything I know.

432
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,480
To be honest.

433
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,000
Of course.

434
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Where were you

435
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,200
Where are you?

436
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,280
At Zhankou fishing village today.

437
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,640
in Zhankou fishing village today,

438
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,440
why didn't you mention fishing?

439
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
It was so grand.

440
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,440
I didn't dare to say it.

441
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,860
After all, it's between leaders.

442
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,160
What does it involve?

443
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,890
A dead person, a fake medicine.

444
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,480
I'm just an employee.

445
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Don't get involved with me anymore.

446
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,200
As you said,

447
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,600
you're just an employee.

448
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,920
Why did Duan Zhigang

449
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,360
take you fishing?

450
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,480
Mr Duan and I

451
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,640
with Mr Duan three years ago.

452
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,650
Three years ago,

453
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
I saved him once.

454
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,170
Be specific.

455
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
At that time,

456
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,410
I just entered the factory.

457
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,160
Su.

458
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,080
This is Yujiang.

459
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,800
If Xu knows

460
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,680
what you did to Du Bin,

461
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,720
I’m afraid

462
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,420
you won't be able to end it.

463
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,360
Mr Su.

464
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,520
The president said so.

465
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,080
don't refuse it anymore.

466
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,960
Hello, Miss.

467
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,360
What would you like to drink?

468
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,220
Hot Americano.

469
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,700
Okay, I'll be right there.

470
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,960
Keep your phone open when you get back.

471
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,160
I'll call you if anything happens.

472
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Sure.

473
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,320
Seok Soo.

474
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,640
Long time no see.

475
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,130
It's good not to see you.

476
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,160
You're still so humorous.

477
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
It's just awkward.

478
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,760
Well...

479
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,520
If there's nothing else,

480
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,160
I'll...

481
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,960
Song.

482
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,840
Where's Hao?

483
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,200
It's signed.

484
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,760
It's so tiring every day.

485
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,920
Everyone can talk to you.

486
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,480
I'll go back now.

487
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Hao.

488
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,290
Is everything done?

489
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,810
Seok Soo.

490
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,960
It's all done.

491
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,080
Captain Li, if you need anything,

492
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,120
just call me.

493
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,520
I'm always here.

494
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,960
Master.

495
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,480
Here.

496
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,280
Mr. Shi.

497
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,740
I'll wait for you outside.

498
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Okay.

499
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,000
Qin.

500
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,200
Let's go home.

501
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,560
Okay.

502
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,440
Here, take the medicine.

503
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,160
Come on.

504
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,480
Xu.

505
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Duan

506
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,440
hasn't heard from him yet?

507
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,360
Did something happen?

508
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,320
Let's talk later.

509
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,800
By the way,

510
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,840
do you have

511
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,600
with Su?

512
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,120
No.

513
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,760
Why do you ask?

514
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,640
Good.

515
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,730
Zhi Gang is here.

516
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,800
Sister-in-law.

517
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,560
Come in.

518
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,000
Okay.

519
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,720
Duan.

520
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,600
Here.

521
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,420
You guys continue.

522
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,570
I'm going upstairs.

523
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,600
Duan.

524
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,850
Why are the police looking for you?

525
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,400
Boss.

526
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,320
Duan Zhigang and Qin Kaihui

527
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,080
Mr. Gong.

528
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,240
What does it have to do with this?

529
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,920
I'm not sure yet.

530
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,600
But according to the current situation,

531
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,640
Duan Zhi Gang's problem

532
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,320
is definitely bigger than Qin Kaihui.

533
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,840
After all, his relationship with Du Bin

534
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,520
with Du Bin.

535
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,320
What should we

536
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,720
push it?

537
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,760
Duan Zhigang.

538
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,360
I can't treat him

539
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,960
an independent individual.

540
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,140
To figure out the whole thing,

541
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,600
we must get Xu Chengliang

542
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,000
Duan Zhigang and Du Bin

543
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,080
and Du Bin

544
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,880
to decide the direction.

545
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,040
When I first joined the team,

546
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,760
my master investigated them

547
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,840
because of a case.

548
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,440
until he was transferred

549
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,880
to the police station.

550
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,570
but there was no result.

551
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,000
So,

552
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
they asked me

553
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,160
if I saw Du Bin in the fishing village.

554
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,520
I said I didn't.

555
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,880
It's nothing.

556
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,040
Duan.

557
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,640
We'll know

558
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,040
when we look at each other.

559
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,480
No one can fool anyone.

560
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
Of course.

561
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,140
I just want to ask you once.

562
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,720
Think before you talk.

563
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,440
About Bin,

564
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,920
Are you hiding something

565
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
hiding from me?

566
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,600
Chairman.

567
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
All these years,

568
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,120
I've been dedicated to our factory.

569
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,720
Until now,

570
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm still alone.

571
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,720
Although

572
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,320
are not related by blood,

573
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,000
But you

574
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
are my family.

575
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,960
and my brother.

576
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,280
This love

577
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,760
is what I value the most.

578
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,800
I dare to take this relationship

579
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
I promise

580
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,520
I will never

581
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,380
hiding anything from you.

582
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,690
Who is it?

583
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,040
Mr Duan.

584
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm Su Ran.

585
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,320
Reporter Su.

586
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,160
What can I do for you?

587
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,490
I want to do an interview with you soon.

588
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,690
When do you think it's convenient?

589
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,680
I see.

590
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,480
Recently,

591
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,400
in the factory recently.

592
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,160
I’m afraid I don’t have time

593
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,320
Mr. Du said the same thing to you.

594
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,480
but he still came.

595
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,040
I think

596
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,160
you will have time.

597
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,760
Okay.

598
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll call you

599
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,440
I'll call you.

600
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,730
I'll wait for your call.

601
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
Reporter Su.

602
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,360
wants to interview me.

603
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,000
Have some tea.

604
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,360
Seok Soo.

605
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,300
We’re here.

606
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,500
I'll get going.

607
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,800
Take care.

608
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,760
Bye.

609
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,290
Let's go.

610
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,800
Xu Chengliang

611
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,840
Duan Zhigang and Du Bin.

612
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,160
These three

613
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,680
for decades.

614
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,920
But Du Bin

615
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,520
dig the corner of Xu Chengliang.

616
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,000
Duan Zhigang and Du Bin

617
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,820
with Du Bin.

618
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,720
Friends for years.

619
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,650
The three of them

620
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,160
are too complicated.

621
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,520
Yeah.

622
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,400
We can only

623
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,680
we can only see

624
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,840
from the public information.

625
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,240
it's a little secondary.

626
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,360
I want to visit people around them

627
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,490
and get to know them.

628
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,520
The time cost is too high.

629
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,720
Boss.

630
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,200
Tell me.

631
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,560
Why don't we hire someone

632
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,200
to help us?

633
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,060
Sort it out.

634
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,480
Master.

635
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,800
Master!

636
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,560
Are you crazy?

637
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,320
Put down your work.

638
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,080
Get up.

639
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,680
Crack.

640
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,880
Come on, guys.

641
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,080
One, two, three.

642
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,080
Here we go.

643
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,880
the sun shines brightly.

644
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,520
The truth will be revealed

645
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,170
the truth will be revealed.

646
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,760
Hao,

647
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,200
Why am I

648
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,780
a little confused?

649
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,000
Mr. Shi,

650
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,199
considering your 40 years of experience as a police officer,

651
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,130
and familiar with Yujiang Police,

652
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,040
The second Squadron of Yujiang County Police Brigade

653
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,400
has been approved by the superiors.

654
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,080
You are specially appointed as criminal consultant

655
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,639
to help us get familiar with the case

656
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,770
and solve the case as soon as possible.

657
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,800
You mean

658
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,040
I can enter this room again.

659
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,840
I've set up the floor for you.

660
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,520
I can work on the case again.

661
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,719
That's right.

662
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,410
You won't think I'm causing you any more trouble.

663
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,680
Don't say that.

664
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,400
Change a new board for me.

665
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,480
Ziyang.

666
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,620
Uncle Duan.

667
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,770
Why are you here?

668
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,040
I'm reading the manufacturer history.

669
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,640
You want to write a memoir?

670
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,800
No.

671
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,360
It's Mr Su.

672
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Recently, Mr Su

673
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,520
is going to write an article

674
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,760
about our factory.

675
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,320
I just want to

676
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,560
to help her with her research.

677
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,280
Uncle Duan.

678
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
What's up?

679
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Here's the thing.

680
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,000
Su Ran

681
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,200
wants to interview me.

682
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,120
I don't know her well.

683
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,840
What if

684
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,400
in conversation?

685
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,060
You have a lot of contact with her.

686
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Tell me about her.

687
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,610
Let me think.

688
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,560
Mr Su

689
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,520
First of all,

690
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,040
is pretty.

691
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,680
So beautiful

692
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,210
Good figure.

693
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,560
fair and beautiful long legs.

694
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,560
Especially when she smiles.

695
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,460
Uncle Duan.

696
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,080
Do you know

697
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,880
the taste of early spring?

698
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,360
I don't know.

699
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,440
Ziyang.

700
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,220
Say something useful.

701
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:16,840
Yes.

702
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
It's useful.

703
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,720
You're here

704
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,760
Americano

705
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,240
Yes.

706
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,700
Okay, I'll be right there.

707
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,280
You mean

708
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,320
Once she came,

709
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,280
she's interested in

710
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,840
in our old family building.

711
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,720
Yes.

712
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,880
What else?

713
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,760
And...

714
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,080
By the way,

715
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,560
Mr Su is right.

716
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,440
the leopard beach murder case in 1994

717
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,760
in the leopard case in 1994.

718
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,480
She asked me about the past.

719
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,160
The murder case in 1994.

720
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,720
I saw the newspaper in her office.

721
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,520
I told her a lot.

722
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,840
And

723
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,600
Mr Su loves coffee.

724
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,300
Especially that Gucheng Coffee.

725
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,890
I even charged her card.

726
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,760
You mean

727
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,860
the one on the construction road?

728
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,240
What?

729
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,260
You charged your card too?

730
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,000
It's really good.

731
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,640
