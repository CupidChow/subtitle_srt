1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,280
Let's swing the oars

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,560
Boats push away the waves

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,320
The sea reflects beautiful white tower

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:26,000
It's surrounded by green trees and red walls

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,840
The boat floats gently in the water

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,240
The cool wind blows

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,400
Thank you for your wonderful performance!

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,300
What's wrong, Linlin?

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,250
I sprained my ankle yesterday.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,250
Are you okay?

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,370
I'm fine.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,240
I'll get going now. Okay.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,360
Purity and passion

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,800
will never fade.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,840
Just like our Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory,

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,120
as Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory.

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,320
March!

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,160
Linlin!

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,690
Look, it's here. It's here.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,640
Let's go. Let's go.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,100
Come on.

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,920
Don't move.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,920
It's swollen.

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,560
Let me help you.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,760
Don't move.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,760
Seriously.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,520
Don't move

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,770
It won't hurt if you wipe it.

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,930
That girl...

31
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,300
Why are you still here?

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,240
Chief Du.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,160
Stand in line.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,880
Hurry up!

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,800
Linlin!

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,960
I bought you

37
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,720
I bought for you.

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,420
Why aren't you wearing it?

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,760
Linlin!

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,240
Linlin!

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,880
Linlin!

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Mom!

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,520
Linlin!

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,640
Linlin!

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,880
Why are you here?

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,760
Du Bin, what are you doing?

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
Why are you in a panic?

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Linlin sprained her ankle.

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Let me take a look.

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,400
Linlin!

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,640
Let me see.

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,680
No!

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,960
Linlin!

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,480
Linlin!

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,920
Linlin!

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,530
It's quite serious.

57
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,380
I need to apply some ointment.

58
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,240
Dad.

59
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
The crime scene.

60
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,160
Duan Zhigang, Du Bin.

61
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,640
Du Bin.

62
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,240
Tell me!

63
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,080
Say it or not?

64
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,680
Why are you staring at me?

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,040
Say it or not?

66
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,800
Tell me!

67
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Or I'll kill you.

68
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Do you believe me?

69
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Say it!

70
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,880
Zhao Lun.

71
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
What are you doing?

72
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm afraid I won't perform well tomorrow.

73
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,330
Let's rehearse.

74
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
Is it too loud?

75
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
Don't be too nervous.

76
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,159
Who is it?

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Mr. Shi.

78
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,840
Coming.

79
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,440
Mr. Shi.

80
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,160
Zhao.

81
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,960
What brings you here so late?

82
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,520
A few days ago,

83
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,760
Su is still up.

84
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,800
It’s OK, Mr. Shi.

85
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,400
Come in if you need anything.

86
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,160
I'll come in then.

87
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,320
Before my wife went to my daughter's house

88
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,850
I made some pickled kimchi.

89
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,320
The lights are still on

90
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,960
so I brought some for you.

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,840
Zhao has been with me all day.

92
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,700
for a whole day.

93
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
Mr. Shi, you’re too kind.

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,600
Did you fight?

95
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,520
It's not because of me, is it?

96
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
No, that's not it.

97
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,930
That's good.

98
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,060
I have to say something to you.

99
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,920
You have to coax your wife.

100
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,320
A man

101
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,320
Lower your head and apologize.

102
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,650
It’s not embarrassing.

103
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,440
Got it, Mr. Shi.

104
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,080
OK.

105
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
Have a rest. I’m leaving.

106
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,560
Bye, Mr. Shi.

107
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,360
Bye.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,130
Mr. Shi, be careful.

109
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,120
He won’t…

110
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,610
I don't think so.

111
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,360
Be careful in the future.

112
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
Rest early.

113
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,160
Four, eight, five.

114
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
486.

115
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,040
Four, eight, seven.

116
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,960
Four, eight, eight.

117
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,840
489

118
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,680
490.

119
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,600
491.

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,360
492.

121
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,240
493.

122
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
494

123
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,960
495

124
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,640
496

125
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
497

126
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,520
498

127
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,360
499

128
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,240
Five hundred.

129
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,520
I can only dance 500. I have to spare some energy.

130
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:23,920
OK.

131
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,160
Go practice.

132
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't forget.

133
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,520
to call the police.

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Okay.

135
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
Okay, bye.

136
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,720
Bye.

137
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,160
Shi.

138
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
You're not old.

139
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,520
Of course.

140
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,480
Take care.

141
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,040
It seems that

142
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,960
you're doing well recently.

143
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,810
Not only my body is good,

144
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,360
my memory is getting better.

145
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,880
Are you trying to

146
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,520
what happened back then?

147
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
There were a lot of things back then.

148
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,480
Which one are you talking about?

149
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,200
Shi, don't be so mean.

150
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,760
We're old neighbors.

151
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,520
Can't we

152
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,570
talk about something else?

153
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,000
About what?

154
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,570
Let me recite a poem for you.

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
The world is upside down

156
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,200
The earthquake of the five continents

157
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
To wipe out all harmful insects,

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,520
All invincible.

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,360
We've known each other for over 40 years.

160
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,640
At least 15 years.

161
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,800
You have to be careful with what you say.

162
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,440
Okay.

163
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,840
Shi.

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,840
Since you said so today,

165
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,640
I have to ask you

166
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Did the typhoon

167
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,920
by that typhoon?

168
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,360
It's been so many years.

169
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,120
Why do you always hold on to me?

170
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,480
I just think

171
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,960
there was something wrong

172
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,560
that there was something wrong.

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,960
If the case is not closed,

174
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,600
I'll never get over it.

175
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,780
I have to give myself an explanation.

176
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,960
You're right.

177
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,880
We can't put everyone in the coffin.

178
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,920
We haven't figured it out yet.

179
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,800
Mr. Xu, don't worry.

180
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,480
I won't get ahead of you.

181
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,730
What are you looking at?

182
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
Shi.

183
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,280
We're old.

184
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,460
Take your time.

185
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,540
Don't stretch.

186
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,320
Am I stretching?

187
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,080
Boss Du

188
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,560
Open you

189
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,840
You spoiled me.

190
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,440
How dare you fire me?

191
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,600
Light!

192
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,000
Soon-jin.

193
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,960
Did I catch you?

194
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,490
Leopard.

195
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,250
Awesome!

196
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,560
Du.

197
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,840
Don’t you still have the property card?

198
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,880
Go ahead.

199
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,120
It's hard for you to go to bed.

200
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,100
Right, sister?

201
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,680
Why are you laughing?

202
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,120
Are you happy?

203
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
You've never won.

204
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,160
Du, why are you angry?

205
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,440
Du, don’t be angry.

206
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,760
Let's continue.

207
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,600
Don't touch me.

208
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,480
Move.

209
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,170
Every time I take you out, I have a bad luck.

210
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,080
No, Du.

211
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,000
I quit.

212
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,280
Let's play two more rounds.

213
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,610
I'm really not playing.

214
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,720
Sister.

215
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,340
Let's play.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,720
Okay.

217
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,800
I'll play two rounds.

218
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,260
Come on.

219
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,520
Brothers

220
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm playing

221
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,060
Brother

222
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,850
Why didn't you play?

223
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Say it.

224
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,680
Brother.

225
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,160
What should we do

226
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,320
what should we do?

227
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,760
That's your business.

228
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,290
It has nothing to do with me.

229
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,000
Get lost.

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,440
No.

231
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,560
It does.

232
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,440
My business

233
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,560
is also your business.

234
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,520
What about me?

235
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
Did I give you face?

236
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Didn't I tell you to get lost?

237
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,290
You said you would protect me if something happened.

238
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
How many dirty work have I done in these years?

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,480
We are on the same boat.

240
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,080
You can't leave me alone now.

241
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,680
Brother.

242
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
Who is on the same boat with you?

243
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,900
Am I on the same boat as you?

244
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,680
Come here.

245
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,840
Listen.

246
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,400
If you dare to tell anyone

247
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,960
about the fake medicine,

248
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,200
I'll make your whole family miserable.

249
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,120
Understand?

250
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,880
Brother.

251
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,760
I was a little emotional just now.

252
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,120
I said something wrong.

253
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,800
Do you understand?

254
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,760
Yes.

255
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,320
Get lost.

256
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,200
Get lost!

257
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,600
You bastard!

258
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,360
Du, are you really a bastard?

259
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,920
People like you

260
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,680
you won't die at home.

261
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,020
You can't even keep your body intact.

262
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,880
Be careful.

263
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,140
Cross the road with me.

264
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,600
Wait a minute

265
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,240
Okay.

266
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,640
Okay.

267
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,080
Let's go.

268
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,760
Slow down.

269
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,160
Don't move.

270
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,840
Come here.

271
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,960
Qin, come here.

272
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,640
Qin.

273
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,840
Come here.

274
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,160
You have to be with the kids.

275
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
That kid is here.

276
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,560
Why did you stop there?

277
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,080
You can't even learn this.

278
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,680
Seriously.

279
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,720
Security?

280
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,300
It's hard to protect a kid.

281
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,360
Shi, don't be angry.

282
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,000
I see.

283
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,680
When you told me,

284
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,880
I knew it.

285
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,440
If I didn't stop you just now,

286
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,720
would you have hit the hammer?

287
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,240
I'm sorry.

288
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,180
I won't do it again.

289
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,280
But the result is always good.

290
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,680
Right?

291
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,200
Take it.

292
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,940
I didn't sleep well all night.

293
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,040
Put this on.

294
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,400
This medicine doesn't have side effects.

295
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,160
Thank you.

296
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,480
Since Yan Bo has agreed to cooperate,

297
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,940
let’s wait for the result.

298
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,040
This is just the beginning.

299
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,160
No problem.

300
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,120
Of course.

301
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
Don't worry.

302
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,200
I've taught you for 800 years.

303
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,960
If you're not a fool, you should've known.

304
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,800
Okay.

305
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,520
I understand.

306
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,600
Come on, let's go.

307
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,080
Come with me.

308
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,840
Stop the car!

309
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,440
Okay.

310
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Wait a minute.

311
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,240
Hurry.

312
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,570
Come on, kids. Let’s go.

313
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,000
Mr. Shi.

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,930
Isn’t this Zhao?

315
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,640
Mr. Shi.

316
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,319
Su.

317
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
Mr. Shi.

318
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,010
You’ve been busy today.

319
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,680
I'm just playing the remaining heat.

320
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,079
What?

321
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,839
This is...

322
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,099
To the factory?

323
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:17,960
Yes.

324
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,040
Go to the factory with your wife.

325
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,880
Let's go.

326
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,079
The car behind is blocked.

327
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:25,609
Let's go.

328
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,920
Shi.

329
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,210
Was this round okay?

330
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,400
Not bad.

331
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,640
Mr. Du.

332
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Long time no see.

333
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,760
I miss you so much.

334
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,000
I

335
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,360
specially prepared this for you.

336
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
rose tea.

337
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,780
Why are you looking for me?

338
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,320
I really miss you.

339
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Last night,

340
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,280
I dreamed

341
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,400
we were sworn brothers.

342
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,920
Zhi Ling, I'll leave if you don't say anything.

343
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,480
Don't go. Sit down.

344
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,000
I just want to ask

345
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
When will our small workshop

346
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,800
return to production?

347
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,970
There's nothing

348
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,320
in this pocket.

349
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,000
Don't you know what time it is?

350
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,080
How many eyes are staring at the fake medicine?

351
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,440
I want it even if you don’t want to die.

352
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,680
Mr. Du.

353
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,400
My brothers and I

354
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,960
are using our heads

355
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,120
to make money for you.

356
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,760
What happened?

357
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,240
Only his head is left.

358
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,320
What is this?

359
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,600
Judging from what you said,

360
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,160
if I don't give you an explanation today,

361
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
I won’t be able to get out.

362
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,640
Since Mr. Du is here,

363
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,200
stay longer.

364
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm fine.

365
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,280
How is it?

366
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,280
Mr Su.

367
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
Are you satisfied

368
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,700
Are you satisfied?

369
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,240
Very satisfied.

370
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Thank you, Mr Xu.

371
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,000
It's okay.

372
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,000
The historical information of the factory is here.

373
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,440
What do you want to check, Mr Su?

374
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,840
Sure.

375
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,440
No one usually disturbs me.

376
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,100
Okay. Okay.

377
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,290
Okay.

378
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,320
I'll listen to Mr Xu.

379
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,730
Three bodies were found at the leopard beach.

380
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,360
Are you still interested in this?

381
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,480
I know.

382
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,440
How old were you?

383
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,320
So tall.

384
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,840
It doesn't matter.

385
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,800
Let me tell you.

386
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,920
It was a big deal.

387
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,640
My mom didn't let me go out.

388
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,400
The murderer

389
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,680
deserves to die.

390
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,640
Indeed.

391
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,400
Zhi Ling.

392
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,960
Think about it.

393
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,240
Did I ask you to make less money?

394
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,500
How much money have you earned

395
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,680
you should know

396
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,520
how much you earned.

397
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,520
The storm is too strong now.

398
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,760
Let's continue to make money when the wind settles down.

399
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,080
With the air dryer,

400
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
we'll all fall over.

401
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,920
Are you a second?

402
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,120
I understand.

403
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,640
But at least I have time.

404
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,200
I happen to have some big clients.

405
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,160
Let me tell you.

406
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
If you dare to work secretly,

407
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,680
don't blame me for turning my back on you.

408
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
If you can't wait,

409
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,480
you can leave anytime.

410
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,640
Understand?

411
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,800
Mr. Du.

412
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,640
Harmony brings wealth.

413
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,970
Harmony brings wealth.

414
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,760
Do you understand?

415
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,200
Yes.

416
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,840
Yes.

417
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,080
You heard it too.

418
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,920
He doesn't dare to work.

419
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,080
I have no choice.

420
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,680
Zhi Ling.

421
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,280
If my clients still can't get the goods,

422
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,560
they will all run away.

423
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,720
Fine.

424
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,570
I'll figure something out.

425
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,440
Let's go.

426
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,400
This is...

427
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,160
Open it.

428
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,360
I didn't want to cut it open.

429
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,520
Today, my dad

430
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,440
asked me to learn more from you.

431
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,320
I thought

432
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,560
I should have

433
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,960
a proper thank-you gift.

434
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,610
Everything opened yesterday.

435
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,490
I didn't expect the water to be so good.

436
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,320
It seems

437
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,080
it's really meant to be with Mr Su.

438
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,440
This is too precious.

439
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,200
No.

440
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,560
Mr Su.

441
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,760
Fate

442
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,760
is priceless.

443
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,160
Take it.

444
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,760
Mr Su.

445
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,720
You haven't eaten

446
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Yujiang cuisine.

447
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,400
Can you give me a chance tonight?

448
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,920
Sorry.

449
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,920
My wife is waiting for me at home.

450
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,420
Maybe another day.

451
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,920
I'll leave you to it.

452
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,250
Let's do it another day.

453
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,280
I'll get going then.

454
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,140
Take your time.

455
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,930
We'll meet another day.

456
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,840
It's a deal.

457
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,520
Bye.

458
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
It's cool.

459
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,640
Brother.

460
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,600
I haven't used my strength yet.

461
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,660
It's comfortable.

462
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,240
Sister, hold this for me.

463
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,000
Go on.

464
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,680
Hello.

465
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,360
Hello, Mr. Du.

466
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,680
It’s me.

467
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,600
Su Ran.

468
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,560
Mr Su.

469
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
What's up?

470
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Here's the thing.

471
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,760
I want to interview you.

472
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,240
Can you make it

473
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
in 20 minutes?

474
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,120
What an interview!

475
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,960
It will take 20 minutes.

476
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,440
Mr. Du.

477
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,040
My brothers and I

478
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,720
are using our heads

479
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,920
to make money for you.

480
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
In the end, I only have my head.

481
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,120
What is this?

482
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,920
Don't you know what time it is?

483
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,040
How many eyes are staring at the fake medicine?

484
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,130
You go out first.

485
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,920
What do you want?

486
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,120
Mr. Du.

487
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
See you in 20 minutes.

488
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,280
Hello?

489
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,960
Mr. Du.

490
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,560
Two minutes late.

491
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,480
Cut the crap.

492
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,540
Where's the recording? Give it to me.

493
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,160
Don't you know what time it is?

494
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,160
How many eyes are watching the fake medicine?

495
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,920
What do you mean?

496
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,560
Nothing.

497
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,400
Don't you want it?

498
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,700
I'll give it to you.

499
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,600
I have plenty anyway.

500
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,800
Su, what do you want?

501
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,600
Mr. Du.

502
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,960
It’s not as complicated as you think.

503
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,490
I have nothing against you.

504
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,610
Just think of me as a paparazzi.

505
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,800
I saw your scandal.

506
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,840
You need to make money to get rid of the bad luck.

507
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,680
That's all.

508
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,930
One million.

509
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
[The recording will be gone.] Okay.

510
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,320
It's not hard

511
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,240
to you, right?

512
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,520
Are you blackmailing me?

513
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,320
Yes.

514
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Su,

515
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,920
Don't forget

516
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,480
you are in Yujiang now.

517
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,720
Aren't you afraid that you'll never come back?

518
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,580
Here we are.

519
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,840
Play a song

520
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,320
for Mr. Du.

521
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,760
Mr. Du,

522
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,880
You have time to decide on a song.

523
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,520
Because the next song

524
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,940
is your recording.

525
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,480
Wait.

526
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,600
Wait a minute.

527
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,280
Su,

528
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,360
Do you think it's fun?

529
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,800
Of course.

530
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,760
Fifty.

531
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,340
Almost one minute.

532
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,320
I don't have that much money now.

533
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,520
What a pity.

534
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,880
How about

535
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,160
Let's figure something out.

536
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,720
Mr Su.

537
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,960
Maybe

538
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,640
I didn't respect you before.

539
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,570
Just do me a favor this time.

540
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,680
Eighty.

541
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,560
80. OK.

542
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,640
Mr. Du.

543
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,200
It’s weird.

544
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,400
When I first met you,

545
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,440
when I first met you.

546
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,880
and even disgusted.

547
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,000
But looking at you now,

548
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,760
makes me feel refreshed.

549
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,480
Su,

550
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,960
Don't...

551
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,600
I don't like the way you talk to me.

552
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,640
Kneel.

553
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,480
You...

554
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,720
Kneel.

555
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,400
I...

556
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,240
80 this time.

557
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,320
Happy?

558
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,840
No.

559
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,160
It's almost time.

560
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay.

561
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,160
100.

562
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,040
Just 100.

563
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,840
Well,

564
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,530
Thank you for your generosity.

565
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,610
Give me ten days.

566
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,440
One week.

567
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,120
It's still here after a week.

568
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Hand in the money.

569
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Hand in the goods.

570
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,200
Okay.

571
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,200
One week.

572
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Just one week.

573
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,720
Mr. Du.

574
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,960
I don't want anyone else to know.

575
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,840
Linlin!

576
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,540
Did you sprain your ankle?

577
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,290
It won't hurt if you wipe it off.

578
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,040
Linlin!

579
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,640
as

580
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,120
Zhou Cheno as Zhao Lun.

581
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,760
Wang Daqi as Qin Kaixuan
