1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
He's here. He's here. He's here.

2
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,720
Duan Zhigang. Du Bin.

3
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,520
Hello. Hello.

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Your dad? Yes.

5
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,759
He went out that night.

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,320
he never came back.

7
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,680
He died at the leopard beach

8
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,360
he died at the leopard beach.

9
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,280
Mom

10
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,760
Is there something you want to tell me? What is it?

11
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,360
I don't understand. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

12
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,079
How did he know

13
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,880
how did my dad know

14
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,360
the three of them were at the leopard beach?

15
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,520
Yeah.

16
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
How did Tang Haojun know

17
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,060
you were at the leopard beach?

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
I was also confused.

19
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,440
But I thought about it.

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,680
Except the three of us and Director Yang,

21
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,400
only one

22
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,320
knows we're going to the leopard beach.

23
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,040
Not me

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
I don't know.

25
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
I really don't know.

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,820
Can you fool yourself?

27
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,560
I guess that night,

28
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,610
you not only told them where they were.

29
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,440
Yuzhen.

30
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,040
I'm going out.

31
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,079
Tang,

32
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,640
I heard Xu Chengliang

33
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,280
in the financial office today.

34
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Du Bin and others

35
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,580
at the leopard beach tonight.

36
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,000
Go to bed early.

37
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
You went there with my dad's camera.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
and took pictures of my dad's murder.

39
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,680
Linlin!

40
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,280
No.

41
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,440
No.

42
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,120
You hurt my daughter.

43
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,680
is my life.

44
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Tang!

45
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,360
Tang!

46
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,320
Xu Chengliang.

47
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,380
What are you doing?

48
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,440
Do it!

49
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,060
Let go of me!

50
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,120
Not long after my dad left,

51
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,000
I found that photo at home.

52
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,200
The three of them were on it.

53
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,360
and my dad.

54
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
I can't remember.

55
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,600
That photo was...

56
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,860
Then I called the police with that photo.

57
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,720
It was pouring that day.

58
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,800
I couldn't see the road ahead.

59
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,840
I can't remember.

60
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,520
Let me think about it.

61
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,760
Mom.

62
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,720
I saw you that night.

63
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,840
You know Heo Chengliang so well.

64
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,600
Have you ever thought that my dad and the others

65
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
they won't come back?

66
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,320
Or is it because

67
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,360
because you were afraid

68
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,880
So you want to use Heo Chengliang to silence him.

69
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,960
Then you use the evidence of Heo Chengyeong’s murder

70
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,290
to force him to divorce.

71
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,400
you can be the wife

72
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,040
the wife of the chairman.

73
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,240
That photo

74
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,410
is more important than your daughter's life.

75
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,600
right?

76
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,080
No!

77
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,120
Linlin, no!

78
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
That's not what I thought.

79
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
No.

80
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,810
I guess you didn’t use it to force Heo Chengliang.

81
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,210
Otherwise, he wouldn’t let you live till now.

82
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,130
That day when I woke up at the beach,

83
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,919
I cried for the last time.

84
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,760
Since then,

85
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,960
there was only one thing left in my life.

86
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,039
is to avenge my dad.

87
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,960
It's been 15 years.

88
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,520
Every year on my dad's death anniversary,

89
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,680
on my dad's death anniversary.

90
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,560
It says "Return to Lost".

91
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,760
Turn yourself in and you'll be lenient.

92
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,410
I've been waiting for you for 15 years.

93
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,160
You never did that.

94
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,040
After I came back to Yujiang,

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
you know I live in danger every day.

96
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,520
You can stand up and end everything.

97
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,760
You didn’t do that.

98
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
After Du Bin died,

99
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
I was going to tell you the truth.

100
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,450
Are you pretending to be crazy?

101
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,960
That's when I knew

102
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,600
I would never

103
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,280
your path.

104
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Linlin!

105
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,560
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,120
I really had no choice last night.

107
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,880
so I called you.

108
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,360
Please give me the photo.

109
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,520
I’ll use it to force him

110
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,960
to save Uncle Wang’s son.

111
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,080
I think a daughter

112
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,480
wants to see her for the last time.

113
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,440
It's not too much, is it?

114
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,040
It seems

115
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,400
to you.

116
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,120
Mom.

117
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,600
I do have one more ticket,

118
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,650
but it's not for you.

119
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,940
Because you have to stay here.

120
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,240
and pay back what you owe my dad.

121
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,490
Before Heo Chengliang finishes his confession,

122
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,820
before Heo Chengliang finished.

123
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,930
I've been wrong all my life.

124
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,450
Don't make mistakes again.

125
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,600
Mom!

126
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,600
Linlin!

127
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
We thought about

128
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
how to choose ourselves.

129
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
There was a typhoon that night.

130
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,480
We thought

131
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,340
there might be no evidence left at the scene.

132
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,560
So I rushed back immediately

133
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,360
to collaborate with Director Yang.

134
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
and destroyed all the accounts.

135
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,840
and blamed everything on that typhoon.

136
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,920
And then,

137
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,280
you knew everything.

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,080
Is there any letter from Qin Kaihui?

139
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,920
Almost.

140
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,520
Don't move.

141
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,140
Don't move.

142
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,760
Don't move.

143
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,420
Stay still.

144
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,480
What are you doing?

145
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm telling you, there's someone up there.

146
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,120
I'll arrest you if there's no one.

147
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,920
Handcuff him.

148
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,090
Get him! Get him!

149
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,660
Don't move.

150
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,660
One more question.

151
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,480
You buried three bodies.

152
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,080
Why are they in the ground?

153
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,880
Why is Tang Haojun's body in the sea?

154
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,760
I really don't know.

155
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,480
I did bury all three of them.

156
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,000
Maybe it was washed away by the flood.

157
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,240
Or he didn't die.

158
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,640
crawling out of the pit,

159
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,040
and was pushed into the sea as a ghost.

160
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Maybe.

161
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Maybe.

162
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,520
What happened in the end?

163
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,890
What did you do with her?

164
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,600
I gave her some money

165
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
to get her off work.

166
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,200
Anyway,

167
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,480
we're on the same boat.

168
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,560
It's not easy to push him too hard.

169
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,080
You keep a close eye on her.

170
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,500
she won't call the police and get herself into trouble.

171
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Forget it.

172
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,540
Master.

173
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,180
I need to answer a call.

174
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,280
What’s wrong, Liu?

175
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,940
Captain Li.

176
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
Qin Kaixuan is imprisoned by Xu Chengliang.

177
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
We found the place.

178
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,660
But he's not here anymore.

179
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,360
The man in charge told me

180
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,160
Xu Chengliang ordered Qin Kaihui to go this morning.

181
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,800
Okay.

182
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,960
I got it.

183
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,530
Shi, let's go. Let's go.

184
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,760
If I knew this would happen, I would've listened to you. I should've listened to you.

185
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,000
I should have listened to you.

186
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,600
At least my son can...

187
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,570
What did you do earlier?

188
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,680
Now you regret it.

189
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,120
Alright.

190
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,720
Tell me about Su Ran.

191
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,200
Su Ran.

192
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,240
She is the daughter of Tang Haojun.

193
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,780
Xu Chengliang.

194
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
Where is Qin Kaixuan?

195
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,760
You kidnapped him

196
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,800
and let him go.

197
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,700
What are you doing?

198
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,400
Ask two people to continue the trial.

199
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,200
Let's go.

200
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,120
What's wrong, master?

201
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,650
Hurry up.

202
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,880
Hey!

203
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,280
Linlin!

204
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,960
Where are you?

205
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,200
We're leaving soon.

206
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
I'll wait for you at the dock.

207
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,800
Do you know

208
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Got it?

209
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,560
Linlin.

210
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Tell me.

211
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,040
not to kill innocent people.

212
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,100
But none of the people I killed

213
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,760
are innocent.

214
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
You can't do it.

215
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
I'll play for you.

216
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,520
I told her to turn herself in.

217
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,120
Come to the dock now.

218
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,960
and get on the boat.

219
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,440
and leave.

220
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,840
everything will be over.

221
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,090
If she turns herself in,

222
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,450
would she have waited until today?

223
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,780
I understand that you didn't tell me about this.

224
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,480
But I have no right

225
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,720
to forgive any murderer for my dad.

226
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,640
I've done so much for you.

227
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,320
This time,

228
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,360
for my dad.

229
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Don't blame me.

230
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,720
Return in triumph.

231
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,320
It's been 15 years.

232
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
Every year on my dad's death anniversary,

233
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,080
on my dad's death anniversary.

234
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
It says "Return to Lost".

235
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Turn yourself in and you'll be lenient.

236
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,170
I've been waiting for you for 15 years.

237
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,240
You never did that.

238
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,080
I do have one more ticket,

239
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,650
but it's not for you.

240
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,820
Because you have to stay here.

241
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,240
and pay my dad back.

242
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,410
I've been wrong for a lifetime.

243
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,650
Don't make mistakes again.

244
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,120
Mom.

245
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,640
When did she disappear?

246
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,800
The hospital said

247
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
in the park across the street every afternoon.

248
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,680
Change the dressing before dinner.

249
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,800
She's not here today.

250
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,130
I've asked Liu to look for her at her house.

251
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,460
Captain Li.

252
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,400
Is he home?

253
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,080
No.

254
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,560
But Yuzhen Song has a burning object.

255
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,760
She didn't go far from the temperature.

256
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,880
One kilometre.

257
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,800
Split the film and find someone.

258
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Hurry.

259
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,160
Hurry up.

260
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,600
Aunt Song.

261
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,440
Who is it?

262
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
Do you still know me?

263
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,040
You are...

264
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,200
I am Max.

265
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,640
Wang Wenqiang's son.

266
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,840
How much?

267
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,080
You've grown up.

268
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,400
I can't recognize you.

269
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,720
But I know you.

270
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Back then,

271
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,480
killed my father and the others.

272
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,980
I have to pay

273
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,040
this debt.

274
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,040
Max.

275
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Listen to me.

276
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,040
It's not what you think.

277
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,900
At that time...

278
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,780
It doesn't matter.

279
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,570
Auntie Song.

280
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,320
Ling Ling said you're going to turn yourself in.

281
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,160
This way...

282
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,000
No.

283
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,100
The direction.

284
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,240
Yes.

285
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,560
This way.

286
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,840
Don't move.

287
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,040
Qin Kaixuan.

288
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,580
Put down the knife.

289
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,600
Don't come over.

290
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,330
Qin Kaixuan.

291
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,560
What can we discuss?

292
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,440
Don't move.

293
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,000
Come closer.

294
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,680
Boss.

295
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
On the east side of 13 Alley,

296
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,370
We found the murderer Qin Kaixuan.

297
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,320
Hello.

298
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,650
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

299
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
Sir, can you hurry up?

300
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,480
Okay.

301
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,480
Qin Kaixuan, put down the knife.

302
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,360
Don't move.

303
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,500
Put the knife down.

304
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,440
Don't move.

305
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,040
Qin Kaixuan, put down the knife.

306
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
Put the knife down!

307
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,880
Mr. Shi.

308
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,160
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,530
I can't listen to you this time.

310
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,920
Stop talking nonsense.

311
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,760
Put it down.

312
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,970
Do you think your dad can rest in peace?

313
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,300
He can't live in peace.

314
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,640
Qin.

315
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,300
Don't move.

316
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,160
Calm down.

317
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,760
Qin.

318
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,120
When your dad was in the Security Department,

319
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,440
he was a security slogan in the factory for years.

320
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,600
All workers in the factory

321
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
to live next to your house.

322
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,240
Why?

323
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,000
Because it's closer to your dad.

324
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,530
everyone will feel at ease.

325
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
Look at you now.

326
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,370
Do you deserve to be his son?

327
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,240
I know all these years,

328
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,720
You...

329
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,720
You are

330
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,560
Zhang Yixing: Tang Linlin. Zhang Yixing: Yes.

331
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,720
and Zhao Lun.

332
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,440
must have suffered a lot.

333
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,000
But this is not the reason for you to punish her.

334
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,490
What does Su Ran have to do with Linlin?

335
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,160
She's already missing.

336
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,920
If you really wanted to help her,

337
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,840
you should have persuaded her to trust the police.

338
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,160
to come this far.

339
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,960
It's meaningless for you to do this.

340
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,290
Qin Kaixuan.

341
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,540
Why are you still here?

342
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,760
Why did you come back?

343
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,280
Why did we

344
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,680
become like this?

345
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,400
Max.

346
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,120
Put the knife down.

347
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,880
I...

348
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,320
I can't watch my mom die.

349
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,880
I can't watch you die either.

350
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,840
Put the knife down.

351
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,640
Qin Kaixuan.

352
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,180
Think about it.

353
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,890
Why did Heo Seong-liang let you go?

354
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,920
This is what he wants to see.

355
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,640
Are you still breathing?

356
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,200
If you want to kill me,

357
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,840
kill me.

358
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Don't worry.

359
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,720
I won't kill you,

360
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,400
I have one more thing to tell you.

361
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,720
Actually, there was another murderer.

362
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,280
If he didn't die,

363
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
You'll pay for it. You'll pay for it.

364
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,680
Who?

365
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,440
Yuzhen Song.

366
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,820
Put down the knife.

367
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,980
Put the knife down.

368
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,640
Seok Soo.

369
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,960
You're a good cop.

370
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,650
All these years,

371
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,960
you haven't given up on the investigation.

372
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,040
I can see

373
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,400
for this case.

374
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,090
All these years,

375
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,440
Thank you.

376
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,100
Captain Li.

377
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,720
You're indeed Shi's disciple.

378
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,660
We've known each other for so many years.

379
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
for so many years.

380
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,600
This time,

381
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,180
Sorry for the trouble.

382
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,120
Sorry.

383
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,120
Don't cry.

384
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,140
What are you doing?

385
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,040
Get lost.

386
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,920
I thought my life

387
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,440
was a joke from God.

388
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,520
Now I know

389
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,400
why I'm alive.

390
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,840
When I recover,

391
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,890
I'll go to Yujiang to set things up for you.

392
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,900
I'll wait for you to come back.

393
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,000
Because I want to try.

394
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,560
Is life

395
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,560
Is it possible?

396
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,480
Yes.

397
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
I'm crazy.

398
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,400
But I know why I'm back.

399
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,450
It doesn't matter if he betrays me.

400
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,560
What if he betrays you one day?

401
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,040
Just like Zhao Lun,

402
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,240
I have a thorn in my heart.

403
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,360
You want me to leave too.

404
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,440
But...

405
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,160
But I can't wash it clean.

406
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,140
Take my ticket and leave here.

407
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,370
Live a clean life for me.

408
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,410
I committed a crime.

409
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,200
How will you sentence me?

410
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,880
I have nothing to say.

411
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
I thought

412
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,960
even without us,

413
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,520
Heo Chengliang and the three of them

414
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,800
will explode one by one.

415
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,739
Their ending will be the same.

416
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
I just don't want to wait any longer.

417
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
to light the fire for them.

418
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,060
But I didn't expect

419
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,040
this fire

420
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,080
will ignite us

421
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,719
until the end.

422
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,040
We can't even recognize ourselves.

423
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,980
Captain Li.

424
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,320
Please apologize

425
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,440
for me.

426
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,639
He's right.

427
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,450
We should trust the police.

428
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,730
You shouldn't apologize to us.

429
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,740
You should apologize to your dad.

430
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,800
He wanted to see you live well.

431
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,040
and finish his unfinished life

432
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,240
his unfinished life.

433
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,700
Captain Li.

434
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,880
I have another question.

435
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,810
Go ahead.

436
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,560
You have done a DNA test

437
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,880
for me and my mom.

438
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,240
Why didn't you arrest me?

439
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,360
I just finished my job.

440
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,640
It's not like I'm not coming back.

441
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,170
Alright.

442
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,120
Go back.

443
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,100
Go back to work.

444
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,120
Master.

445
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,920
Come visit us often.

446
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,960
You said that.

447
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,800
What?

448
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,730
Am I still reckless?

449
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,880
No.

450
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,480
Do I still act on my own?

451
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,640
Absolutely not.

452
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Am I still on the edge of the law?

453
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,540
Just don't attack the police.

454
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,600
I almost...

455
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,920
You punk.

456
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,320
I have to pick up my wife.

457
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,680
She brought my fat grandson home today.

458
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,850
Let's go.

459
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,700
Master, wait a minute.

460
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,680
Ready, go.

461
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,520
Golden Shield.

462
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,520
With passion

463
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,560
Show yourself when you're in danger.

464
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,760
Enough.

465
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,800
Don't be so emotional if you don't know how.

466
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,360
When you're on a mission,

467
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,040
when you're on a mission.

468
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,920
For family,

469
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,250
For the sake of society,

470
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,680
you must take care of yourself.

471
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,120
This is important.

472
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,240
Good work, everyone.

473
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,000
Let's go.

474
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,360
Everyone.

475
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,920
Salute.

476
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,960
Thank you.

477
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,920
Bye.

478
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,920
In fact,

479
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,640
is quite cute.

480
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,320
Leader Li.

481
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,200
What do you mean?

482
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,000
We found this at her house.

483
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,440
She also told us

484
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,820
your father, Tang Haojun,

485
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,440
has no ability to give birth.

486
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,200
Brother.

487
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,680
I want to go to the toilet ahead.

488
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,920
Can you give me a hug?

489
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
I'll be back soon.

490
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,560
Okay, go ahead.

491
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,320
Thank you.

492
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,160
Thank you.

493
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,240
Be careful.

494
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,200
Slow down.

495
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,200
Listen to me.

496
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,730
Sister, I'll wait for you here.

497
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,520
Thank you.

498
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,440
It's okay.

499
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,620
Your dad waited until the sun set,

500
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,100
no one came to find this child.

501
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,160
Later, in that fur,

502
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,040
he found this note.

503
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,480
What's wrong?

504
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,800
Nothing.

505
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,320
Kid,

506
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,120
We are destined to meet.

507
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,480
How about

508
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,560
we can

509

once in a lifetime.

510
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,440
Don't worry.

511
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,040
I'll protect you.

512
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,040
Linlin!

513
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,400
Yes.

514
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,320
It's Linlin.

515
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,280
Let's go.

516
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,090
Let's go home. Okay.
