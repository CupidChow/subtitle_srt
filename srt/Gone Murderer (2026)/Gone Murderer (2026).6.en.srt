1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,440
Mr. Song, calm down.

3
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,520
I don't want to live anymore.

4
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:40,920
Mr. Song.

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,960
I can't go on.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,360
I want to die.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,170
I can't take it anymore.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,280
What's going on, Mr. Song?

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,340
What are you doing?

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,960
Take this.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,000
Mr. Song, Mr. Song.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,680
Let's talk about it calmly.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,160
What happened?

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,640
Tell me.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,920
Lingling is missing.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,680
My daughter is gone.

17
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,000
Du Bin.

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,160
That girl has disappeared.

19
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,760
Yes.

20
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,490
When I was investigating this case back then,

21
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,360
I always felt that Tang Haojun's daughter

22
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,600
had something to say.

23
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,170
But she suddenly disappeared,

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,620
and this lead was lost.

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,720
So this disappearance case

26
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,980
is definitely connected to the Leopard Beach murder case.

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Chief Shi,

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,960
why did you say

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,760
we need to fully understand this case first?

30
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,040
to figure out the relationship

31
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,200
between Xu Chengliang, Duan Zhigang and Du Bin?

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,720
Master,

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,560
just tell me

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,960
what makes these three people suspicious.

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,440
After the incident that year,

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,560
we questioned the pharmaceutical factory employees

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,840
one by one.

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,720
Since a typhoon passed through that night,

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,120
almost everyone stayed at home.

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,160
But Xu Chengliang,

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,800
Duan Zhigang and Du Bin,

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,560
braved the heavy rain

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
and went to Factory Director Yang Dequan's place to drink.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,360
No one saw them.

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,200
Right.

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,579
They provided alibis for each other,

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,090
and their statements were highly consistent in detail.

48
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,920
Colluded on testimony.

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,560
Yes.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,570
So we began a thorough investigation.

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,380
Finally, we discovered that Yang Dequan

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,900
had suspicious personal assets.

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,240
Embezzlement.

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,450
Shouldn't there be traces in the financial records?

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,680
After the typhoon,

56
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,920
the finance office was severely damaged,

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,000
a complete mess.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,240
The factory's accounts were lost and couldn't be verified.

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,560
We could only rely on interrogation.

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,680
Five whole rounds.

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,840
Xu Chengliang and the other two kept their mouths shut tight.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,600
Just when we were about to

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,760
break through Yang Dequan,

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,240
he had a sudden stroke

65
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,120
and died.

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,140
This case has been suspended until today

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,250
due to insufficient evidence.

68
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,380
Master.

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
I also heard that Xu Chengliang's wife,

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,399
Yang Jing.

71
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,440
They...

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,280
Right.

73
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,240
Yang Jing.

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,880
This Yang Jing is Yang Dequan's niece.

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,400
Yang Dequan.

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,880
Xu Chengliang was able to become

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
the chairman after the state-owned enterprise reform.

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
His wife's family put in a lot of effort.

79
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,560
Later, those veterans in the factory

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,120
were gradually dismissed.

81
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,820
In the leadership,

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
only Duan Zhigang and Du Bin remained.

83
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
According to what you said,

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,700
the relationship between these three is really complicated.

85
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,240
Master.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Do you think

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,960
that when Du Bin was investigated for making fake drugs,

88
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,820
Duan Zhigang might help hide him?

89
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
If it's just because of friendship,

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,080
not likely.

91
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,360
Duan Zhigang probably wouldn't

92
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,560
offend Xu Chengliang for Du Bin.

93
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,040
But there's one scenario

94
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,140
where he would help Du Bin.

95
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,660
The fake drug case.

96
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,050
He was involved too.

97
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,680
Right.

98
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,560
Song.

99
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Are you keeping up?

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,920
Yes.

101
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,720
Boss.

102
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,940
Why don't you just tell us what to investigate next?

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,960
Bring in two experts.

104
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,040
Thoroughly investigate Du Bin himself

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
and all the accounts of that fake drug workshop.

106
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,600
See if there's any connection to Duan Zhigang.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,240
Got it now.

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,160
Hello.

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,170
We're closed. Please come back tomorrow.

110
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Accountant Song.

111
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,120
I ordered for tomorrow.

112
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,880
Please prepare a table for me

113
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,560
with home-style stir-fries.

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,890
As for the combination,

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880
you decide.

116
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,100
Tomorrow at 9 a.m.,

117
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,720
deliver it to the Workers' Hall.

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,810
I don't have any stir-fry dishes here.

119
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Accountant Song,

120
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,280
this guest of mine

121
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,020
is very important.

122
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,740
I think she would definitely like

123
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,840
to eat your cooking.

124
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,240
She likes my cooking?

125
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,560
Just make whatever

126
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,500
your daughter used to like

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,050
when she was little.

128
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,570
Thank you for your trouble.

129
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
See you tomorrow.

130
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,960
Um,

131
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,360
I noticed your stomach was bothering you,

132
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,620
so I made you some soup.

133
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,780
Come out and have some.

134
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
Is it okay?

135
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,170
It's delicious.

136
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,640
Su Ran.

137
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,570
For all these years,

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,060
no one has cared whether I live or die.

139
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,360
Until you came along,

140
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,480
I was willing to trust someone for the first time.

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,159
So...

142
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,260
If I've done something wrong,

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,260
you can just tell me directly.

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,490
Don't overthink it.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,130
It's not your fault.

146
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,940
So for tomorrow's interview with Duan Zhigang,

147
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,770
should I still follow our plan?

148
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,130
I'll go alone tomorrow.

149
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
If anything happens,

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
I'll contact you.

151
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,770
Thanks for the soup.

152
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
Get some rest.

153
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,160
Mr. Duan.

154
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,640
Good morning.

155
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,640
You're very punctual, Mr. Duan.

156
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,440
I learned from Du Bin

157
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,170
about your work style, Miss Su.

158
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,610
I wouldn't dare take this lightly.

159
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,290
You're too kind.

160
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,490
Let's get started then.

161
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,040
Sure.

162
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,840
Let's begin with

163
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,100
the history of Yujiang Pharmaceutical.

164
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,360
Yujiang Pharmaceutical

165
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,370
evolved from an old state-owned factory.

166
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,000
Innovation and tradition

167
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,040
are our two guiding principles for development.

168
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Innovation

169
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,880
refers to our technology.

170
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,600
Tradition

171
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,080
refers to our human touch.

172
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,290
Speaking of human connection,

173
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,200
I know you and Director Xu,

174
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,500
including Mr. Du who's now wanted by the police,

175
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,840
go way back.

176
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Could you elaborate

177
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,820
on your relationship?

178
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,960
The issue with Du Bin.

179
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,730
Isn't that a bit sensitive?

180
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
What do you mean by sensitive, Mr. Duan?

181
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,960
Hello.

182
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,880
Mr. Duan's ordered meal.

183
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Accountant Song.

184
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Bring it here.

185
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,090
When you get old,

186
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
you can't skip breakfast.

187
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,640
Let's talk while we eat.

188
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,660
Director Duan.

189
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,360
Open it.

190
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Accountant Song,

191
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,280
this is the guest I told you about,

192
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,280
Ms. Su Ran.

193
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Accountant Song.

194
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,920
Hello.

195
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,640
Mrs. Song.

196
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,680
Ms. Su is from the north,

197
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,890
why did you prepare all these Yujiang dishes?

198
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Didn't you say...

199
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,440
What did I say?

200
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,400
You said...

201
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,840
You said...

202
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,600
Right, right.

203
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,560
I said

204
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,280
whatever her daughter likes to eat,

205
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,880
that's what she should make.

206
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,360
So Ms. Su,

207
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,170
these dishes...

208
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Do you like them?

209
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,400
Take it back.

210
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,320
Redo it

211
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,560
until Mr. Su is satisfied.

212
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,640
I said

213
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,400
take it back.

214
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
No need to redo it.

215
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,980
I can get used to it.

216
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,880
Leave it then.

217
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,480
Thank you, Accountant Song.

218
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,560
You can go now.

219
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,280
Ms. Su.

220
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,360
Since you came to Yujiang,

221
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,920
Du Bin has suffered a lot because of you.

222
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,960
And Yan Bo?

223
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
He died mysteriously too.

224
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,060
I've been thinking all night.

225
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,680
All these things

226
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,440
must be connected to you.

227
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,680
You changed your name

228
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,780
and came back to Yujiang with ulterior motives.

229
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,040
What exactly do you want?

230
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,540
Since that's the case,

231
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,040
let's get straight to the point.

232
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,400
You,

233
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,860
Xu Chengliang,

234
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,320
and Du Bin.

235
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Why did you kill my father back then?

236
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,370
It's been so many years.

237
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,520
Why can't you let it go?

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,920
We explained everything to the police back then.

239
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
We had nothing to do with it.

240
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,460
Please enjoy the show.

241
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,840
Su,

242
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,600
you've gone too far.

243
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
I have to tell you.

244
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,160
Young Mr. Xu said he'd come by to deliver coffee.

245
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,520
But he didn't say when.

246
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,080
So I think we need to hurry.

247
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,099
Why did you kill my father?

248
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
Turn this off.

249
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,599
Turn it off.

250
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
Answer the question.

251
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,960
Turn it off for me.

252
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,560
Answer

253
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,760
my question.

254
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
Xiao Jiang,

255
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,080
any news from Du Bin?

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,920
My men

257
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,400
have almost turned Yujiang upside down,

258
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
but still no news.

259
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,160
Dad, have a cup.

260
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,320
My heart can't take this.

261
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,300
Why did you buy so much?

262
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,880
Teacher Su is doing an interview with Uncle Duan today.

263
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,480
As for me,

264
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,660
I'm just going to show my support.

265
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,530
Do you think wearing this to meet Ms. Su

266
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,840
looks too casual?

267
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,300
When have you ever dressed formally?

268
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,760
Jiang, Workers' Cultural Hall.

269
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,200
By the way,

270
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,250
there's something I need to remind you about.

271
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,600
You have rhinitis, right?

272
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
What are you trying to do?

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's hereditary.

274
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,860
Young Mr. Xu has it too.

275
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
When did you and

276
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,770
the chairman's wife get together?

277
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Have you checked?

278
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,680
What are you trying to do?

279
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,440
What do you want?

280
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,400
I thought you'd be more composed than Du Bin,

281
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,120
but it seems you're not much different.

282
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,680
Tomorrow at 10 AM,

283
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,520
these videos and photos.

284
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,640
This email will be on Xu Chengliang's desk.

285
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,320
So before that,

286
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,400
tell me everything about what happened back then.

287
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,640
You know Xu Chengliang better than I do.

288
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,840
You're more familiar with his methods.

289
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,440
Of course,

290
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,440
you could also strike first,

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,320
since you have the chairman's wife to help you.

292
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,680
Or you can turn yourself in.

293
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
It's your choice.

294
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,760
What I said.

295
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Did you get that?

296
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,980
I'm asking you.

297
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,360
Did you hear me clearly?

298
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,400
My Uncle Duan looks so handsome in this shot!

299
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,050
Mr. Duan,

300
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,240
that's all for today.

301
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,500
About the next interview,

302
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
you understand everything, right?

303
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,000
Um, yes, I do.

304
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,930
I'll leave you a copy of today's recording

305
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,840
so you can enjoy it later.

306
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,960
Thank you for your hard work, Ms. Su.

307
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,520
This cup is for Mr. Duan.

308
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,600
He worked the hardest today.

309
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,600
Mr. Duan.

310
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:54,960
Okay.

311
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,480
So,

312
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,140
looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.

313
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,380
Looking forward to it.

314
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,400
I'm leaving.

315
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,600
Where are you heading, Ms. Su?

316
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,800
No need, thanks.

317
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,880
All right.

318
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,450
Bye-bye.

319
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
Rejected again.

320
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,760
Mr. Duan.

321
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,920
Mr. Duan.

322
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Ms. Su has some skills, doesn't she?

323
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,740
She's more than just skilled.

324
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,000
Get in.

325
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,400
Just say what you want to say.

326
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,440
Su Ran.

327
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,320
This wasn't our plan.

328
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,080
How could you confront him directly?

329
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,680
And force him to kill Xu Chengliang?

330
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,600
Are you insane?

331
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,010
How did you know?

332
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,650
If I didn't know,

333
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,520
If I didn't know,

334
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,560
I'd be dead by now.

335
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,330
Zhao Lun.

336
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,360
You've been spying on me.

337
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,240
Didn't I tell you?

338
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,320
I would tell you everything you need to know.

339
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,280
Then tell me!

340
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,560
Su Ran.

341
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,880
Why is it that ever since Yan Bo died,

342
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,280
you've started hiding everything from me?

343
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,080
Is Du Bin dead or alive right now?

344
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,160
If Duan Zhigang doesn't do what you say,

345
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,420
what are we going to do?

346
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,360
And another thing.

347
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,800
How exactly did Yan Bo die?

348
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,520
Does it really have something to do with you?

349
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,400
I've tied my life to yours now.

350
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,880
Can you tell me everything you know?

351
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,440
Can you just be quiet for a moment?

352
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,360
I can't.

353
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,960
Master, you look quite sharp in this outfit today.

354
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,080
So,

355
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,810
how do you like these pastries?

356
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
They're okay.

357
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,200
Actually,

358
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,720
I've discovered something.

359
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,200
You've already made progress just after starting.

360
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,060
Well, that's why I'm your master.

361
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,160
I've reviewed your investigation materials

362
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,280
and found that the origin of these incidents

363
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,010
doesn't lie with Duan Zhigang.

364
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
At Su Ran's place.

365
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,920
Su Ran.

366
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,800
Su Ran.

367
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,960
Look here.

368
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,160
According to your investigation,

369
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,800
Su Ran started investigating

370
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,080
the counterfeit drugs three days before Du Bin disappeared.

371
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,600
Du Bin.

372
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,520
This is our chairman's honored guest

373
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,800
who came to help handle some matters at the factory.

374
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,160
The counterfeit drug issue, of course.

375
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,890
After that, Du Bin took all his savings to gamble.

376
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,720
Coincidentally, that gambling den was anonymously reported.

377
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,840
That's why he took the risk to force the counterfeit drug workshop to operate.

378
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,080
But it happened to coincide with Su Ran's undercover investigation,

379
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,760
which helped us shut down the counterfeit drug workshop.

380
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,820
Are you suggesting

381
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
that Su Ran might be deliberately targeting Du Bin?

382
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,560
That's right.

383
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,560
But she has no grudge against Du Bin,

384
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,620
what's her motive?

385
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,330
That's what we're looking for.

386
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,960
How are you guys doing?

387
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,720
Any discoveries this afternoon?

388
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,780
We actually have some real findings.

389
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,160
This Zhonghan Hotel,

390
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,440
Duan Zhigang keeps a suite year-round.

391
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,380
How is that a real finding?

392
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Every time I go, it's with Yang Jing.

393
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,160
This is indeed a legitimate discovery.

394
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,740
Can you give it to me next time?

395
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,090
Mr. Duan,

396
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
what happened? Why the rush?

397
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,200
My left eyelid

398
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,160
has been twitching since last night.

399
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,560
Is it about Du Bin's matter?

400
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,960
What's this about?

401
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
It has nothing to do with his matter.

402
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,930
Two strands of hair.

403
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,960
Take them.

404
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,560
Find a testing agency

405
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,570
and do a paternity test.

406
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,440
Then find a scalper

407
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,500
to make two ID cards

408
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,360
using other people's names.

409
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,170
Mr. Duan,

410
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,320
did something happen again?

411
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,920
It's none of your business.

412
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,250
Stop asking questions.

413
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,800
Go on, get going.

414
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Get out of the car.

415
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Get out of the car.

416
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,920
What are you trying to do?

417
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,680
I'm asking you what you want to do.

418
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,000
I want him dead.

419
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,180
Just take this.

420
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,600
Weren't we working together well before?

421
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,520
How come when you got to Duan Zhigang's place,

422
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
you acted like you'd lost your mind?

423
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,480
If it were really that simple,

424
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,800
would we have needed to plan for so long?

425
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,400
Plan?

426
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,520
Is there even a plan now?

427
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,800
Then tell me.

428
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,160
What's your next move?

429
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,000
I'll tell you when the time comes.

430
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,160
You have no idea.

431
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,480
Su Ran.

432
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,080
Admit it.

433
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,360
You're losing it too.

434
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,600
Let me tell you what's going to happen next.

435
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,600
Duan Zhigang won't kill Xu Chengliang.

436
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,640
He'll kill us

437
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,040
just like he killed our families back then.

438
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,440
We won't get our revenge.

439
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,480
We'll die here.

440
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
We've already...

441
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,120
Zhao Lun.

442
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,360
Stop talking nonsense.

443
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,400
I would never joke about my life.

444
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,040
There's no time left now.

445
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,600
I can't stop now.

446
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm asking you right now.

447
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,680
Do you want revenge

448
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,810
or do you want to die?

449
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,680
Do you want revenge or death?

450
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,020
Let me tell you.

451
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,800
If you still want revenge,

452
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,880
then do as I say.

453
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,280
Do exactly what I tell you to do.

454
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,520
Don't question me.

455
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,600
If you dare to act recklessly like today again,

456
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,340
no one will save you when you're dead.

457
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,420
Do you understand?

458
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,480
Answer me.

459
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,900
Say something.

460
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,820
These people really know how to have fun.

461
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,080
Master.

462
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Do you think Du Bin

463
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,800
might know about this?

464
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,760
We've been searching for so long

465
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,360
but found no trace of Du Bin.

466
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,840
Even on Duan Zhigang's boat,

467
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,400
we searched every inch

468
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,440
and didn't find even a footprint.

469
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,900
It's suspiciously clean.

470
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,800
I suspect now

471
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,640
that Du Bin may already be dead.

472
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,840
And the place of death

473
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,160
is Zhankou Fishing Village, where he was last seen.

474
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,760
You think Duan Zhigang

475
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,280
silenced Du Bin because of this?

476
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,160
Duan Zhigang has been living off the Xu family his whole life.

477
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,420
That's enough motive.

478
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,620
The motive analysis makes sense,

479
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,800
but the timing doesn't add up.

480
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,440
Why didn't he act earlier?

481
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,400
Why wait until we're investigating the counterfeit drugs

482
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,880
and watching them closely to commit the crime?

483
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Isn't that just asking for trouble?

484
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,160
If he killed Du Bin,

485
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,780
it must be related to the counterfeit drugs.

486
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,600
True.

487
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,500
You're more thorough.

488
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,360
Song'er.

489
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,680
How's the account investigation going?

490
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,480
I gave strict orders.

491
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,840
Results in 48 hours.

492
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,240
You just said

493
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,720
the boat was cleaned.

494
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Where's the boat?

495
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
We're holding it.

496
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,760
Take it apart.

497
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,500
Check between the panels.

498
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,290
There must be something there.

499
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,320
As you say.

500
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,130
Hello, Mr. Duan.

501
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,440
Ms. Su.

502
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,720
I think

503
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
we should have another proper talk.

504
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,080
I found a place

505
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
where we can meet.

506
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,610
We have nothing to discuss.

507
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,080
If you want to tell me the truth,

508
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,920
say it now.

509
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,640
Mrs. Su.

510
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,040
About this matter, I think

511
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,760
she just refuses to see me now.

512
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,560
Duan.

513
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,280
Back then, you three

514
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,440
really did kill someone.

515
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,160
Yang Jing.

516
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,040
Can you stop obsessing over this?

517
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,440
If Su Ran

518
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,800
tells Xu everything tomorrow,

519
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,040
we're both done for.

520
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,160
The only way now

521
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,040
is to get out of here quickly.

522
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,440
If you want to leave, you leave.

523
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,920
I won't leave Zi'ang.

524
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,450
What do you mean?

525
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,120
You said you're not afraid of Xu Chengliang.

526
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,720
Then do as Su Ran said.

527
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,280
No, Yang Jing.

528
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,600
Can you think before you speak?

529
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,680
If I kill Xu,

530
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,800
Su Ran will report me right away.

531
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Then I'll be a dead man.

532
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,080
Do you understand?

533
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
Then deal with Su Ran.

534
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,320
You don't know anything.

535
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,080
Shi Guangming lives across from Su Ran.

536
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,280
Otherwise I...

537
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,580
Could you please stop pacing around?

538
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,320
Sit down here and let me tell you something.

539
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,280
I just remembered.

540
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
Old Xu

541
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,400
is going abroad for medical treatment at the end of the month.

542
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,929
When that happens, tell him

543
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,360
the police are reopening the Baoziwan case

544
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
and to stay abroad and not come back.

545
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,600
Meanwhile,

546
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,179
I'll persuade Zi'ang.

547
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,719
As long as Zi'ang agrees to join us,

548
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,960
we can take control of the pharmaceutical factory

549
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
and sideline Xu Chengliang.

550
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,170
Even if Su Ran produces those photos then,

551
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,900
he won't dare to come back.

552
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
What do you think?

553
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,160
You mean

554
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,090
as long as we hold off that Su woman,

555
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,040
we might have a chance to turn things around?

556
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,640
What other choice do we have?

557
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Zhou Cheng'ao as Zhao Lun

558
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:19,920
Tan Yang as Duan Zhigang

559
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,240
Xiao Cong as Li Hao

560
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,500
Yuan Dasen as Xu Zi'ang

561
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,120
Yang Dachuan as Jiang Wanli

562
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,400
Liu Shuohao as Liu Feng

563
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:23,720
Zhang Jinan as Du Bin

564
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,400
Tian Lu as Fourth Brother

565
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,720
Na Xin as Feng Lan

566
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,000
Zhao Zhenyu as Detective A

567
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,400
Zhang Rui as Waiter

568
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,960
Ren Chunliang as Henchman
