1
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,200
Look, Duan.

2
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,320
Ever since Bin's incident,

3
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
I've noticed that you

4
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,450
haven't been yourself.

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,120
I asked you about it,

6
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,380
but you wouldn't talk.

7
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,000
I thought maybe I was overthinking things.

8
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,040
But this morning,

9
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,840
when I received that package from Zhonghan Hotel,

10
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,960
when I opened it,

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,000
I clearly saw something inside.

12
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,500
But when I came back from outside and checked again,

13
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,840
the envelope was empty.

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,960
The item was gone.

15
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,040
Chairman.

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,360
Let me finish

17
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,290
what I'm saying.

18
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm getting old,

19
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,420
afraid of forgetting things.

20
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,040
Of course.

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
I asked

22
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,920
Xiao Jiang to investigate,

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,840
and he actually found something.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
I don't quite understand what's in here.

25
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,880
Can you take a look for me?

26
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,660
I've said my piece.

27
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,500
Now it's your turn.

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
No?

29
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,760
Alright then.

30
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,640
Since we're here today to inspect the goods,

31
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,160
then let's

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
take a look at them first.

33
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,640
You know,

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
in my entire life,

35
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,120
what I hate most

36
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
is betrayal.

37
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,840
But none of you have ever seen

38
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,000
what happens to those who betray me

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,400
in front of me.

40
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Their fate.

41
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,400
Today,

42
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,700
you'll have the privilege to witness it.

43
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,040
Where?

44
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
Nanjiao Hardware Factory.

45
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,240
Good.

46
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,680
Xu Chengliang's car is heading to Nanjiao Hardware Factory.

47
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,210
Hurry up.

48
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,970
Understood.

49
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,200
Mr. Duan.

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,280
For a woman,

51
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,480
I wouldn't take your life.

52
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,720
If you liked her, you could have told me.

53
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,080
I might have agreed.

54
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,000
But stealing,

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
that's where you went wrong.

56
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,040
You know so much,

57
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,080
yet you're still fine today

58
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,000
because you've been obedient

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,680
and never stepped out of line.

60
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,880
But I never expected

61
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,720
you were playing the biggest game of all.

62
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,640
You even played me!

63
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,920
Since that's the case,

64
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,560
I can't let you live anymore.

65
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,360
Mr. Duan,

66
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,920
don't blame me.

67
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,480
Chairman.

68
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,480
Don't move!

69
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,280
If you dare come closer,

70
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,520
I'll kill him.

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,480
Well, well, Mr. Duan,

72
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,800
keeping your head down all these years,

73
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
must have been frustrating.

74
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,120
Shut up!

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
You old bastard!

76
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
Let me tell you,

77
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,840
apart from back then,

78
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,770
when you were better than me

79
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,650
at sucking up to Director Yang,

80
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,560
you're nothing.

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,440
You're just a pile of shit,

82
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
you're garbage!

83
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,060
Don't move!

84
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,700
If you move, I'll kill him.

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
I'll kill him!

86
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,960
Let me go

87
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,730
and don't come after me.

88
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,420
Otherwise,

89
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,210
I'll expose what happened at Baoziwan back then.

90
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
None of us will survive.

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,600
Don't move!

92
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,409
To hell with you!

93
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,080
Chairman!

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,260
Find him immediately.

95
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,280
If he survives tonight,

96
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,280
don't come back to see me.

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,200
Yes.

98
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,400
Chief Shi,

99
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,460
Qin Kaixuan has been taken upstairs.

100
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,720
Song.

101
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,720
Get a police dog to sniff around this car.

102
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,840
Make sure whether Su Ran was in this car or not,

103
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,240
so he can't deny it later.

104
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,970
Understood.

105
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,520
Your life,

106
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,600
I'm saving it for Zi'ang.

107
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
Watch your mouth.

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
Understand?

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,720
Captain Li.

110
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,580
Where's Duan Zhigang?

111
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,010
What about Duan?

112
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,140
Cut the crap. He got into your car.

113
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,900
Where is he?

114
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,240
I don't know.

115
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
Okay, got it.

116
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,560
Captain Li, message from command center.

117
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,320
Speak up.

118
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,680
Message from command center.

119
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,960
Xu Chengliang's car

120
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,640
just left this hardware factory.

121
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,720
Headed south.

122
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,460
Two of you stay here

123
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
and search this factory.

124
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,680
The rest of you,

125
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,280
go after that car immediately.

126
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,480
You two, come with me.

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,980
What's with that cage?

128
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,680
I bought a dog but couldn't keep it in.

129
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,400
It ran away.

130
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,900
Xu Chengliang.

131
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,680
I'm asking you one last time.

132
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,060
Where is Duan Zhigang?

133
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
I told you, Captain Li,

134
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,520
I really don't know.

135
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Take him back to the station.

136
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Yes.

137
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,920
I was just with Duan Zhigang.

138
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,860
Why didn't you say so earlier?

139
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,300
Officer Li,

140
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,120
if your wife cheated on you,

141
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,620
would you tell everyone about it?

142
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Cut the crap.

143
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,580
Where is Duan Zhigang?

144
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
I really don't know.

145
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,320
Today I asked him and Yang Jing

146
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,280
to meet at that place

147
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,800
just to talk about this

148
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,620
embarrassing situation.

149
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,600
But that bastard

150
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
suddenly pulled out a knife on me

151
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,490
and stole my car.

152
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
Is that all?

153
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,440
Yes.

154
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,080
What if he hadn't run?

155
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,180
What are you doing?

156
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,720
But he did run.

157
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,200
You've known Duan Zhigang for so many years.

158
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,040
Why would he suddenly decide to run now?

159
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,680
I don't know.

160
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,760
Before Duan Zhigang left,

161
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,820
didn't he tell you where he was going?

162
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,680
I really don't know.

163
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,960
I don't know anything.

164
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,400
Go ask him yourselves.

165
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,100
Get out of the car. Don't move.

166
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,140
Squat down.

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Is this your car?

168
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,060
Where's Duan Zhigang?

169
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,400
I don't know.

170
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,640
I found this car.

171
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,840
Where did you find it?

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,480
Under the bridge.

173
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,160
Take him away.

174
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,600
Master.

175
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,730
What did others say?

176
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,440
Chief.

177
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,890
Officer Shi.

178
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Did you catch him?

179
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,800
Don't even ask.

180
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,200
Our men chased them all the way

181
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,040
and caught up with the car on Nanguang Road.

182
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,760
But there were just two punks inside.

183
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,600
They said they found the car

184
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,440
under the Binhai Overpass.

185
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
It wasn't locked.

186
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,760
Duan Zhigang must have

187
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,560
abandoned the car there and fled.

188
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,960
Set up strict checkpoints at all city exits.

189
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,320
Don't let him leave Yujiang.

190
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,800
Focus the search around where he abandoned the car

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,760
to capture Duan Zhigang.

192
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,240
Hurry!

193
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,970
Understood.

194
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,160
Master,

195
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,640
what about Xu Chengliang and Yang Jing?

196
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,800
It's not time yet.

197
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,560
Continue the interrogation.

198
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,160
By the way,

199
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
where is Qin Kaixuan?

200
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,680
He's waiting in the interrogation room.

201
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,280
We'll question him together with Duan Zhigang once we catch him.

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,560
Master,

203
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,820
what are you thinking?

204
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm worried

205
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,740
something happened to Su Ran.

206
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,920
If

207
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,840
Su Ran pushed Duan Zhigang to this point,

208
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
is it possible that Duan Zhigang

209
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,410
Su Ran...

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
wanted to kill Su Ran?

211
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm not waiting anymore.

212
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,280
I'm going to interrogate Qin Kaixuan now.

213
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,340
I'll make him talk.

214
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,200
Good.

215
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,080
Kaixuan.

216
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,680
Kaixuan.

217
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,120
Is that you?

218
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,120
Yes, it's me.

219
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,440
This is my car.

220
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Of course it's me.

221
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,770
Who is it?

222
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,530
Who's there?

223
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,040
Who is it?

224
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,260
Was there anyone else in your car?

225
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,960
There was a female journalist

226
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,720
surnamed Su.

227
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,170
You know each other?

228
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,560
I don't know her.

229
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,100
But Manager Duan does.

230
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,160
Manager Duan asked her

231
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,740
to get some materials from me.

232
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,600
Then she said she needed to go to

233
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,160
Factory West Street for printing.

234
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
So I gave her a ride.

235
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,170
Mr. Duan has purchased cement before.

236
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
That I don't know.

237
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,880
But that day on the boat,

238
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,540
there definitely wasn't any.

239
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,260
What are you thinking?

240
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Officer Li, now that you mention it,

241
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,920
I feel Mr. Duan that day

242
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,610
was acting strange,

243
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,680
he seemed

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,599
quite restless.

245
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,360
So you're saying

246
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,920
that Duan Zhigang might have gone out to sea

247
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,650
by himself before you arrived?

248
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,760
Not necessarily.

249
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,280
But whenever Mr. Duan goes sailing,

250
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,810
he always fills up the tank.

251
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,920
But that day,

252
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
it was only half full.

253
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
And he seemed distracted that day,

254
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,660
barely talking at all.

255
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,260
Lieutenant Li.

256
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,320
I'm just guessing.

257
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,000
Maybe I'm overthinking this.

258
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,660
Let's not cause any trouble for the leadership.

259
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,680
Hu.

260
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,800
What are you brewing in your cup?

261
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
Coffee. Would you like some?

262
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,880
You can have it yourself.

263
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,640
[Cement Inspection Report]

264
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,040
Master.

265
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,320
How's it going?

266
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,360
He admitted that Su Ran got into his car.

267
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,720
Said he dropped her off at Factory West Street.

268
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,180
We're verifying that now.

269
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
What about the cement?

270
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,220
Did you ask?

271
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,320
He said that day Duan Zhigang

272
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
might have gone overseas himself.

273
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,370
Now we can only wait until we catch him.

274
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,160
I've known Qin Kaixuan for so long.

275
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
But I had no idea about his personal relationship

276
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,840
with Duan Zhigang.

277
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,490
His words can't be trusted.

278
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,840
Alright, I'll continue the interrogation.

279
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
It's too late today.

280
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,280
Sir,

281
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,440
why don't you go home and rest?

282
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,700
Considering your age.

283
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,360
What about my age?

284
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,570
Where have I fallen behind?

285
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,680
Neither Duan Zhigang nor Su Ran has been found.

286
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,080
You...

287
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
What home should I go back to?

288
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,520
That's not what I meant.

289
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,880
The boss means that

290
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,680
we're stuck at Duan Zhigang now.

291
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,400
Without catching him,

292
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,800
we can't move forward.

293
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,000
Leave the groundwork to us.

294
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,960
You need to conserve your energy.

295
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,560
We still need you to guide us.

296
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,480
Boss.

297
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,440
You'll go far in the future,

298
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,610
better than him.

299
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,680
So the boss wants you to...

300
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,120
I'm not going back either.

301
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,720
Don't worry about me, just hurry and find them.

302
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,880
Staring at me won't help.

303
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,780
I won't go back even if you kill me.

304
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,800
Xu.

305
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,900
I'll go back right now.

306
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,720
Xiao Xu.

307
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,640
Chief Shi.

308
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,440
Where did you go, Xiao Su?

309
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:10,920
I...

310
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,640
Uncle Shi,

311
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,570
you're here.

312
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,340
Please sit.

313
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,780
Please sit.

314
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,660
Don't even mention it.

315
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,800
My wife's phone died.

316
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,090
What a coincidence.

317
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,200
Ms. Su suddenly had low blood sugar.

318
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,320
We found a small clinic for a glucose IV.

319
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,400
He fell asleep on the phone.

320
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,800
Isn't that frustrating?

321
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,120
Have some tea.

322
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Slept until now.

323
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,840
Yes.

324
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,760
I didn't know.

325
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,090
I've troubled you here.

326
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm really sorry.

327
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,760
It is quite troublesome.

328
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,640
By the way,

329
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,280
Xiao Qin took you to Changxi Street, right?

330
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,600
Xiao Qin?

331
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,160
Manager Duan's subordinate?

332
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,640
Yes.

333
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,680
Yes.

334
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,080
He took me there.

335
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,000
I see.

336
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,560
Xiao Su.

337
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,300
I heard you interviewed Duan Zhigang a few days ago.

338
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,680
Yes.

339
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,820
What did you ask him about?

340
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,320
Just some questions about business development.

341
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,940
Didn't you ask him about those things from his early years?

342
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,680
What are you referring to?

343
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Leopard Beach.

344
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
You must have heard about it.

345
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,280
Leopard Beach?

346
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
The murder case.

347
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,280
Ms. Su,

348
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,700
I told you about it before.

349
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
But you shouldn't write about this.

350
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,500
It would create a bad impression.

351
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,200
Chief Shi was in charge of this case back then,

352
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,080
and it remains unsolved.

353
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,680
Isn't that right, Chief Shi?

354
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,240
Slow down.

355
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,640
Ms. Su,

356
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,880
I actually think

357
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,680
you should interview Chief Shi.

358
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,040
He had a huge impact on our factory back then.

359
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,320
Especially-

360
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,560
Interview me for what?

361
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,920
What's the point?

362
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,610
What's so great about that?

363
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,960
Can this kid stop interrupting?

364
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,290
If you don't know how to talk, just shut up.

365
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,760
Yes, Chief Shi.

366
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,080
Good that you're fine.

367
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,440
Okay.

368
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,840
I'll head back first.

369
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,560
After all this fuss tonight,

370
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
it's almost dawn.

371
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,840
You should get some rest.

372
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,760
I'll be going too, Ms. Su.

373
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,120
Thanks for all your help.

374
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,680
No problem.

375
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,480
Contact me if you need anything.

376
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,100
Take care of yourself.

377
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,240
Shi Suo.

378
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
I'll be going now.

379
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,720
Take care on your way.

380
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,080
Hao.

381
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,240
Yes.

382
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,080
Su Ran is back.

383
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,000
Alright then.

384
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,360
I'm feeling

385
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,260
a bit uncomfortable with my heart right now.

386
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,480
You continue with the interrogation.

387
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,880
No matter what happens,

388
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,520
inform me immediately.

389
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,930
Where have you been?

390
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,050
Let's get some sleep first.

391
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,400
We should hear from Duan Zhigang

392
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,600
soon.

393
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,940
These three people

394
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,660
are more tight-lipped than the next.

395
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:03,920
Boss.

396
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,760
According to Qin Kaixuan's statement,

397
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,220
do you think it's possible

398
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,530
that Duan Zhigang first killed

399
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,760
Du Bin at sea,

400
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,290
and then had Qin Kaixuan

401
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,520
accompany him to sea again,

402
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,800
using Qin Kaixuan's presence

403
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,200
to cover up his crime?

404
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,780
Captain Li.

405
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,840
Song

406
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,340
has been found.

407
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,080
Mr. Xu,

408
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,250
go get some rest. You've been busy too.

409
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,660
Xu Chengliang,

410
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,240
who do you think you are?

411
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,480
Let me tell you.

412
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,480
Everything you have today

413
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,760
was earned by begging on your knees at our Yang family.

414
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,880
I know everything you've done.

415
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,140
Just try to touch me again, I dare you.

416
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,520
Yang Jing.

417
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,160
If it weren't for Zi'ang,

418
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
you'd be dog food by now.

419
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,720
Don't push your luck.

420
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,090
If I hear one more disrespectful word,

421
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,120
your son will be visiting your grave next year.

422
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,800
Dad, Mom.

423
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,290
What are you two arguing about now?

424
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,050
Who's kneeling to whom?

425
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,800
Nothing.

426
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,040
Go back to sleep.

427
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,260
What's wrong with you?

428
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,040
Nothing.

429
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,640
My throat doesn't feel well.

430
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,360
Zi'ang.

431
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,560
There's an entrepreneurs' forum in France early next month.

432
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,220
Go apply for your visa in the next couple of days.

433
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,700
It'll be a good learning experience.

434
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,120
Dad, why so sudden?

435
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,080
What about Mom's birthday in a few days?

436
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080
I said go apply for your visa in the next couple of days.

437
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,000
Do you understand?

438
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,560
Mom,

439
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,120
what's wrong with Dad?

440
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,720
Zi'ang.

441
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,520
Zi'ang.

442
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,760
I'll get you some breakfast.

443
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,580
Captain Li.

444
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,800
Captain Li.

445
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,740
Captain Li.

446
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,500
Captain Li.

447
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,520
Qin.

448
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,200
Chief Shi.

449
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,880
Why are you here so early?

450
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,840
Captain Li came to get some information from me.

451
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,560
I've been here all night.

452
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,920
About Duan Zhigang.

453
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,400
Right.

454
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,050
You two are so close.

455
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,760
You must know a lot.

456
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,640
Chief Shi, you said he's a leader.

457
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,300
If there really was a problem,

458
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,120
he wouldn't tell me.

459
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,520
Yeah.

460
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,170
With our relationship,

461
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,960
if he had something going on,

462
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,560
you wouldn't keep it from me.

463
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,580
That's definitely not possible.

464
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,010
Alright, let's go back.

465
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,400
I'll be heading back then.

466
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,120
Okay, Officer Shi.

467
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,050
Go get some rest.

468
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,570
Officer Shi.

469
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,420
Where are Xiao Hao and the others?

470
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,880
They're at the scene.

471
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
I'm waiting for the autopsy report.

472
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,840
Autopsy report?

473
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,920
What scene?
