1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,920
Tell me.

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,640
If I had proposed to your family earlier back then,

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,100
made a marriage proposal,

5
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,290
would there have been no Mr. Xu in the picture?

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,440
Zi'ang is almost finishing elementary school.

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,160
Why are you still talking about this?

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,040
Are you crazy?

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,560
Back in the day,

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,880
I told you to confront Mr. Xu.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,860
But when you met him, you couldn't say a word.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,620
And in the end, didn't you say,

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,820
'Congratulations, brother.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,100
I'm happy for you'?

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,680
Who said that?

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,920
At that time,

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,560
my situation was really bad.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,720
And I was working under Xu Chengliang.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,480
So...

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,140
Slow down when you run.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,740
Watch where you're going.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,480
Dad, I'm not a child anymore.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,600
Yes, yes, yes.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
Not a little kid.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,260
A big kid, okay?

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,760
Lie down quickly.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,820
Someone's coming.

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,250
Stand still.

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,320
I'll take a photo of you here.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
This background doesn't look good.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,440
You've been taking photos all afternoon.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,720
Haven't you had enough?

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,120
Can you take enough photos?

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Dad can never take enough in a lifetime.

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,580
Don't move.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,400
I'll bring you here to play again next week.

37
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,820
This background looks great.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,680
It looks great.

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,340
Don't move.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
Give me a smile.

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,800
Ready.

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,220
Beautiful.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,380
What's wrong, Dad?

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,210
That looks like a car from our factory.

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,200
It's coming.

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,050
It's a car from our factory.

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,079
They stopped. Hurry!

48
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,760
Mr. Duan.

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,320
What are you taking pictures of?

50
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,079
I'm asking what you're photographing.

51
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,610
Mr. Duan.

52
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,690
I brought my daughter to take some photos.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,760
Sir.

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,600
I...

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,520
Sir.

56
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,560
I wasn't photographing you two.

57
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Nonsense.

58
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,560
Sir.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,520
Let me tell you,

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,440
watch your mouth.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,300
If you dare spread rumors in the factory,

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
think about the consequences.

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,290
Who was that person?

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,170
Why did he take our film?

65
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,560
Lingling.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,370
Remember what Dad says.

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,380
We didn't see anything today.

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
Got it.

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,440
Duan Zhigang, Du Bin.

70
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,840
Du Bin.

71
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Sorry, sorry.

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
I can't see.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,960
Excuse me, excuse me.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,260
I have water in my shop.

75
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,580
Do you want to come in and clean up?

76
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,490
Go all the way to the end.

77
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,409
Bei'an Road.

78
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,240
Lingling?

79
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,480
Lingling,

80
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,600
is that you?

81
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
It's me, your mother.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,060
You've mistaken me for someone else.

83
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,100
I wouldn't make a mistake.

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
You are Lingling.

85
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,480
You're back, Shisuo.

86
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,450
You're back.

87
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,480
It's been 15 years.

88
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,440
Where have you been?

89
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,320
Lingling.

90
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,520
Let's talk at home.

91
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,080
Come.

92
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,740
You really have the wrong person.

93
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,340
You came back because of your father, right?

94
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,520
Lingling.

95
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,720
We can't fight against them.

96
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,080
So what?

97
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,120
We just do nothing?

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
You're right.

99
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,560
I've come back to Yujiang

100
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,000
to fight against them.

101
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
They owe a blood debt

102
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,300
someone has to collect it.

103
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,970
Don't you think?

104
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,640
Mom.

105
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,440
Xiao Zhang, going out?

106
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,370
Shi Station.

107
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,520
Ma'am, I just moved in here.

108
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,840
I don't know the place you're asking about.

109
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,170
Maybe ask someone else.

110
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,520
Okay.

111
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,560
Xiao Su.

112
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,680
Mr. Shi.

113
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
Just got back?

114
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,120
You just got back too?

115
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,480
Yes.

116
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,300
I'll head home now.

117
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,120
Xiao Su.

118
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,680
Have you been crying?

119
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,520
No, I haven't.

120
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,380
The wind just blew in my eyes a moment ago.

121
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,320
Alright, I'll go home now.

122
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,280
Thank you.

123
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,040
No problem.

124
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,010
I've left your things here.

125
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,500
Here's 100 yuan for your meals this week.

126
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,800
No one will be at my place tonight.

127
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,060
Come see me after work.

128
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,920
Juan.

129
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,560
I'm talking to you.

130
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,420
Did you hear me?

131
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,080
Chao, I have plans tonight.

132
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,120
Tell me

133
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,210
what's happening tonight.

134
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
Speak up.

135
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm talking to you.

136
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
Why are you bullying her?

137
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Who are you?

138
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,360
Never mind who I am.

139
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,680
I just want to know why you're bullying her.

140
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Are you crazy?

141
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,810
I'll kill you if you don't back off.

142
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,200
I'm already tired of living.

143
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,320
Come on. Do it.

144
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,680
Come on, hit me here.

145
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,960
Come on!

146
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,600
Hit me!

147
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,400
Chao.

148
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,900
I'm coming to your place tonight.

149
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,570
This is my customer.

150
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,640
Handle it yourself.

151
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,240
Okay.

152
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,200
Lunatic.

153
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
Is your head okay?

154
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,680
It's fine.

155
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Don't worry about me.

156
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,960
Comrade.

157
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Accountant Song.

158
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,130
Accountant Song

159
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,920
seems to have been in a car accident.

160
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,960
Let's go see.

161
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Accountant Song.

162
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Accountant Song.

163
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Accountant Song.

164
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Accountant Song.

165
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,520
Su Ran.

166
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,810
Your mother's had an accident.

167
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,840
Song,

168
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,040
are you sure they're still at the factory?

169
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,440
Yes.

170
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,490
Xiaohao.

171
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,260
Master.

172
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,370
Why are you back?

173
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,520
There's something

174
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,050
you need to help me find out.

175
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,010
Is it urgent?

176
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,700
There's a mission.

177
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,880
Chief Shi.

178
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Here's the thing.

179
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,200
You asked us to dismantle Duan Zhigang's boat.

180
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,320
You were right.

181
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,240
We found some cement residue

182
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,980
in the gaps under the deck.

183
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,520
Cement on a boat.

184
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,120
Those two don't go together, do they?

185
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,380
We also think it's odd.

186
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,760
So we're about to hear

187
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,560
what Duan Zhigang and Qin Kaixuan have to say.

188
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,120
Master.

189
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,730
What did you need me for?

190
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Song Yuzhen had a car accident.

191
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Tang Haojun's wife?

192
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,000
Yes.

193
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,680
I think

194
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,420
this can't be a simple traffic accident.

195
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,360
Quickly help me find out

196
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,160
about that hit-and-run driver.

197
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,800
Okay, Song'er.

198
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,000
You stay here and call the traffic police.

199
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Report to Chief Shi.

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,730
Understood.

201
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,960
Liu.

202
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,490
Come with me.

203
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,340
Master.

204
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,800
Let's go to Duan Zhigang's place first.

205
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,320
Hao.

206
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,960
While you're there, ask Duan Zhigang

207
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,600
about his relationship with Song Yuzhen.

208
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
See how he reacts.

209
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,320
You think he's connected to this accident?

210
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,120
You ask first.

211
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,560
Okay, got it.

212
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,930
Let's go.

213
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,960
Ms. Su,

214
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,120
still up so late?

215
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,290
Was it you who did it?

216
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,120
What are you referring to?

217
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,280
I'm asking if you did it.

218
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,800
I had no choice.

219
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,760
The task you gave me,

220
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
I just couldn't complete it.

221
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,240
I know.

222
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,000
Even if I asked for those photos,

223
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,120
you'd keep backups anyway,

224
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
so I didn't bother.

225
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,680
How about this?

226
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Tomorrow,

227
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,080
you leave Yujiang,

228
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,200
and we'll pretend

229
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,530
nothing ever happened.

230
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,520
Don't worry.

231
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,720
The hospital where your mother was taken for emergency care

232
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,240
is officially called

233
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,680
Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory Hospital.

234
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,810
As long as you leave,

235
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,280
our hospital's medical expertise

236
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,599
is still trustworthy.

237
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,800
If I see you in Yujiang

238
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,359
again,

239
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
you'll have only yourself to blame.

240
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,460
Duan Zhigang, let me tell you,

241
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
if anything happens to her, I'll...

242
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,760
Come in.

243
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,320
Mr. Duan.

244
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,840
If you had called me five minutes later,

245
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,080
I would have been home already.

246
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,010
What's going on?

247
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,860
I need you tomorrow

248
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,210
to keep an eye on someone at the affiliated hospital.

249
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,880
Who am I watching?

250
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,520
Mr. Duan.

251
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Okay, got it.

252
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,880
Thank you.

253
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,920
What's the situation?

254
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,960
The driver who caused the accident is unemployed.

255
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,360
According to the traffic police,

256
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,280
he has astigmatism

257
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,840
and couldn't see clearly before hitting the person.

258
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,570
Having astigmatism and still driving that fast?

259
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,920
Right now the driver

260
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,160
is showing sincere remorse and admitting guilt.

261
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,440
We're just waiting for Song Yuzhen to wake up

262
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,370
to see how to proceed with the case.

263
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,690
Good.

264
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Officer Shi, about our next steps...

265
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,920
When Xiao Hao returns,

266
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,320
tell him to contact me immediately.

267
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,050
Understood.

268
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,880
Pulling someone's respirator

269
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,160
is really unethical.

270
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,450
Sit down.

271
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,560
Sit down.

272
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,120
Give me your card number.

273
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,410
Mr. Duan,

274
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,400
this isn't about money.

275
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,720
Kaixuan,

276
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,360
why don't you understand?

277
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,160
You're a murderer.

278
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,440
Even if you want to wash yourself clean

279
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,080
for the rest of your life, you can't.

280
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
There's only one way for you now.

281
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,280
You.

282
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,320
You need to change

283
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,380
your way of thinking quickly.

284
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,450
What I'm asking you to do now

285
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,880
is to cut off the police's leads.

286
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm helping you.

287
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,820
Do you understand?

288
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,660
I just want to scare them a bit.

289
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
It doesn't mean

290
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,300
I actually want you to do anything tomorrow.

291
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,280
But

292
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,940
as long as my people are there,

293
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,600
others will be afraid.

294
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,820
Do you understand?

295
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,460
You can't go in.

296
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,640
I'm sorry.

297
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,560
I forgot to knock.

298
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
You're both here.

299
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,000
Officer Li.

300
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,160
Please step outside.

301
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,740
I was just looking for both of you.

302
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,040
Coming.

303
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,040
Zhao.

304
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,760
Well, um.

305
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,800
I have something tonight and might not come back.

306
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,530
My car is charging downstairs.

307
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
If it rains, please cover it for me.

308
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,020
Sure thing.

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,480
Su.

310
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,440
Mr. Shi.

311
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,680
By the way, Su.

312
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,920
That person who asked you for directions...

313
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,720
What place was she asking about?

314
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,720
I really don't remember.

315
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,840
What's wrong?

316
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,450
That person had a car accident.

317
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,520
Is it serious?

318
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,010
It's quite serious.

319
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,040
They're trying to save her at the hospital now.

320
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,160
People drive so recklessly these days.

321
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,520
We should be more careful when we go out.

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,800
That's right.

323
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,120
She's had a hard life.

324
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Her husband died,

325
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,880
her daughter went missing,

326
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,810
and she's been all alone for years,

327
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,640
with no one to rely on.

328
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,800
And now this happens.

329
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,880
It's not even certain if she'll make it.

330
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,920
Poor woman.

331
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,480
All right.

332
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,560
I won't disturb you anymore.

333
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,290
I'm leaving.

334
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,720
Take care, Mr. Shi.

335
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,620
Xiao Zhao, don't forget to cover it for me when it rains.

336
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,860
I told you playing mahjong would cause trouble.

337
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,810
Maybe I should go to the hospital to check.

338
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,720
Cement.

339
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,760
What cement?

340
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,400
You don't need to ask back.

341
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Just say whether you know or not.

342
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Then I don't know.

343
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,460
It's your boat and you don't know?

344
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,320
Well, this boat,

345
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,240
it is my boat.

346
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,880
But my friends

347
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
often borrow my boat to go out to sea.

348
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,040
Why don't you

349
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,480
go ask them?

350
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,520
Mr. Duan.

351
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,690
Do you know Song Yuzhen?

352
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,760
Who?

353
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,880
Do you know her?

354
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,760
When you mention it...

355
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,240
I can't recall right away.

356
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,080
Isn't she the accountant from our old factory?

357
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,850
Have you seen her recently?

358
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,660
Just tell me straight.

359
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Yes, I have.

360
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,560
I saw her this morning.

361
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,490
Why did you meet?

362
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,560
Well...

363
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,960
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
I have allergies.

365
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
This morning, you know, our

366
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,800
company had

367
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,800
a journalist visit.

368
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,360
And then,

369
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,320
well,

370
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,840
this morning

371
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,040
they interviewed me.

372
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,600
Then Song Yuzhen,

373
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,840
she makes authentic Yujiang cuisine,

374
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,760
so I ordered some food from her.

375
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
You two are close?

376
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,440
Not really.

377
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
We haven't been in touch for years.

378
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,220
Then how do you know she's a good cook?

379
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,370
I heard about it.

380
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,280
You heard?

381
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,560
From whom?

382
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,960
Well, that...

383
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,740
That... um... you know...

384
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,570
No, now that you ask,

385
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,200
I've forgotten, you see.

386
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,900
Ask Qin Kaixuan to come in.

387
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,040
Have some water.

388
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,640
Su Ran.

389
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,800
I think now...

390
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,080
Come in.

391
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,450
I need to talk to you.

392
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,200
Zhao Lun.

393
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,730
This isn't the time for us to argue.

394
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,900
I'm not in the mood to explain much to you.

395
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Don't you want to know the next step?

396
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,440
Take this letter

397
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,680
to the mailroom.

398
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,960
Your mother is still in Duan Zhigang's hands.

399
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,020
We still need to...

400
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Hao is here.

401
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,810
I came back too late last night.

402
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,960
I was afraid you were asleep.

403
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,290
So I didn't disturb you.

404
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
Why did you sleep here all night?

405
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,760
Don't catch a cold.

406
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,360
No, no, no.

407
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,080
I'm not cold.

408
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,440
Song Yuzhen might be our breakthrough.

409
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,520
I feel more at ease keeping watch here.

410
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,960
Here.

411
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,220
Breakthrough?

412
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,120
Let's talk about your situation first.

413
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,980
How's it going?

414
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,520
Any news from Duan Zhigang?

415
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,080
Chairman.

416
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,200
Mr. Duan.

417
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,000
Chairman.

418
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,810
Why are you here so early today?

419
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,680
I have a meeting at the Drug Administration.

420
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Just came to pick up some documents.

421
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,480
The police came to see you again last night.

422
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
What was it about?

423
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,330
Still about that Du Bin matter.

424
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
Have some water, sir.

425
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,160
Chairman.

426
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Your mail.

427
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,250
Just leave it there.

428
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,920
Jiang.

429
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,160
Cancel my flight for the end of the month.

430
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,890
I won't be going to that resort.

431
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,720
Chairman.

432
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,440
Western Europe is beautiful this time of year.

433
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,170
You really should take a break.

434
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,720
I'd like to.

435
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,090
But with so many issues at the factory,

436
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,690
how could I possibly go?

437
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,920
Tomorrow at 10 AM,

438
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,760
all these videos and photos

439
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,840
will be delivered to Xu Chengliang's desk on time.

440
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,860
Here's your water, Chairman.

441
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,960
Oh no!

442
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,760
Quick, get some tissues!

443
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,760
It's okay.

444
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,040
You should rinse it with cold water

445
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,170
or it might blister.

446
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,320
Come on.

447
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,240
Okay.

448
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,720
Let me go with you.

449
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,850
I can manage myself.

450
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,800
You need to wash it

451
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,680
for a while.

452
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,360
Alright.

453
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,160
This cement,

454
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,280
he claims he's never seen it before.

455
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,680
Right.

456
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,120
I've sent Song to Zhanjiang fishing village

457
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,160
and the nearby building material markets and construction sites

458
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,400
to investigate one by one.

459
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,880
Once we find out they purchased cement,

460
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,610
we'll interrogate them again.

461
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,220
Master,

462
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,820
I also did as you suggested

463
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,980
and mentioned Song Yuzhen to him.

464
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,930
Judging from his reaction,

465
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,900
something definitely seems off.

466
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,280
The chairman isn't here.

467
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,500
I'll wait for him here.

468
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,920
Don't think I won't touch your mother.

469
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,440
Just try it.

470
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,880
Duan Zhigang.

471
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,480
I have ten thousand ways

472
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,540
to show Xu Chengliang those videos and photos of yours.

473
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,280
You can't stop them all, can you?

474
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,600
Fine.

475
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,960
You're ruthless.

476
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,580
I wouldn't have come back if I wasn't.

477
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,460
Let me off the hook.

478
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
Whatever you say from now on,

479
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
I'll do it.

480
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,560
I can give you one more day,

481
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,200
but I hope

482
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,490
you won't challenge my bottom line again.

483
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,760
Duan,

484
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,520
ask Xiao Jiang to bring some burn cream.

485
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,720
Sure.

486
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,280
Chairman,

487
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,200
what happened?

488
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,570
Ah, Su, you're here.

489
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,440
It's nothing.

490
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,100
I just burned myself a little.

491
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,320
Su.

492
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,080
I've noticed recently

493
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,240
that our online reputation is changing.

494
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,680
It must be those competing pharmaceutical companies behind it.

495
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,320
We need to come up with a strategy quickly.

496
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,880
Chairman.

497
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,240
We're thinking exactly the same thing.

498
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,280
Yesterday,

499
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,920
I specifically drafted a PR strategy proposal.

500
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,980
Please take a look.

501
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,280
Chairman.

502
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,560
I've already briefed Jiang.

503
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
If there's nothing else, I'll head to the meeting.

504
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,480
Go ahead.

505
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,120
Wash or cut?

506
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,800
I knocked on the glass but you didn't respond.

507
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,730
So I just came in.

508
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,800
I'm sorry.

509
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
I didn't hear you.

510
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,200
What brings you here?

511
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,130
Just passing by.

512
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,140
Just in the neighborhood.

513
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,400
So I came in.

514
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,570
That guy yesterday.

515
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,570
You two seem to know each other.

516
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,000
Did I cause you trouble?

517
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,200
Who is he?

518
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,860
Why was he getting physical with you?

519
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,400
Am I asking too many questions?

520
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,040
Let me wash your hair.

521
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,290
Can't let you take that punch for nothing.

522
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,520
Come on. Don't be shy.

523
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,560
I was just drunk.

524
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,000
Mr. Duan.

525
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,240
Didn't I tell you

526
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,560
to wait for my news at the hospital?

527
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,600
Why did you come back?

528
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,080
I went there early this morning.

529
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
There were guards at Shi's ward.

530
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,320
I couldn't get close.

531
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,179
Shi Guangming.

532
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,920
Watching Song Yuzhen.

533
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,360
Right.

534
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,239
Mr. Duan.

535
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,840
Does this mean the police are starting to suspect us?

536
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,159
How many years would we get?

537
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,159
They can't execute us, right?

538
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,280
Shut up! Shut up!

539
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,520
Oh, right.

540
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,920
This... this...

541
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
I brought it back.

542
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:34,800
Zhu

543
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,560
I remember you have rhinitis.

544
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,000
It's hereditary.

545
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,820
Young Mr. Xu has it too.

546
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,800
When did you and the chairman's wife

547
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,560
get together?

548
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
