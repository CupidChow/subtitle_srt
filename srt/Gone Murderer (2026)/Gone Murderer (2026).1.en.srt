1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
The National Radio Station

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,880
[Due to the typhoon Mogura,]

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,120
the coastal towns

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,720
and ports.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,360
were attacked by disasters.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,240
[A flood occurred in the south.]

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,000
Many people have gone missing.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
and many families are trapped.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,840
relevant departments have started immediately

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,800
emergency rescue immediately.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,280
Up to today,

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,160
the rescue team has successfully rescued

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,240
235 trapped people.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,760
Boss.

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,119
How many buckets?

16
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,280
A few buckets

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,920
The typhoon is so strong.

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,560
All the fish are on shore.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,960
Get more buckets

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,160
The living will eat it.

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,240
The dead feed the pig

22
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,200
God gave it to me.

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,160
Don't waste it.

24
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,240
Take care.

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,460
I'll pick it up.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,920
Someone's dead.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,560
Help!

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,560
Brother, someone is dead.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,729
Captain Shi.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Two bodies.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,800
A man and a woman.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,320
was found by the villagers nearby.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,600
They were buried in the soil.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,840
When we took the police,

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,640
the body

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,880
There are obvious

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,080
blunt weapon wounds and sharp weapons.

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,680
We speculate

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
was buried here after the murder.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,720
Excuse me.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
Stop looking.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,720
Here.

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
This is the victim's family.

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,360
This way.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,360
Forensics are in.

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,020
for the preliminary autopsy.

47
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,740
At present,

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,960
the time of death

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,820
It should be two or three days ago.

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Where is the report?

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,680
Over there.

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,280
Who is he?

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,480
His identity is confirmed.

54
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,360
His name is Wang Wenqiang.

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,160
The woman is Feng Lan.

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,920
They are all workers of Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory.

57
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,520
Three people went missing on the night of the typhoon.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,720
These are two of them.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,840
I found these two. It's one of them.

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,640
For now.

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Go on.

62
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,079
On the night of the typhoon,

63
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,240
the sea water flooded this area.

64
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,900
There is no clue at the moment.

65
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,050
Captain Shi.

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,040
Captain Shi.

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,480
Say it.

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,780
Another body is found.

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,680
Let's go.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,260
Captain Shi, look.

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,320
The body was hit by waves

72
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,120
the head repeatedly hit the reef.

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,650
The face was badly damaged.

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,160
The body was soaked in the sea.

75
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,560
We can't identify it yet.

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,160
We found this ID card

77
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,320
on the body.

78
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,480
Initial inference,

79
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,040
he is the third missing person.

80
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,770
Tang Haojun.

81
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,960
Tang.

82
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,520
Tang!

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
Tang!

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,760
Tang!

85
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,440
Tang!

86
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,440
Zhang Jingxiang.

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,600
Pan Zhengxiang

88
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,000
Zheng Jingwen Zhang Lingfeng Li Zhuang

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,120
Aria Liu.

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,960
Yang Da Chuan, Liu Shuhao.

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,480
The crime scene.

92
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,960
Mr Su.

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
We're in Yujiang.

94
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,280
Okay.

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,930
Yuji.

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,880
Sir, what are you doing?

97
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm catching a thief.

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,520
Thief?

99
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,960
Who are you?

100
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,320
This is Shi Guangming.

101
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,120
Shi.

102
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,880
Isn't this Dachang's driver?

103
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Who are they?

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,640
Who are they?

105
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,200
of our president.

106
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,960
to help with something.

107
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,880
About the fake medicine.

108
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,120
Mr Jiang.

109
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,200
The chairman is waiting.

110
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,730
Let's go.

111
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,440
Seok Soo.

112
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
We'll get going then.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,840
Wait a minute.

114
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,680
Young man.

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,480
You?

116
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,840
I...

117
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,800
I'm old.

118
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,010
I'm afraid when he wakes up,

119
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,760
when he wakes up.

120
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,410
Wait for the police with me.

121
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,320
You...

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,280
You're just a cop.

123
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Return it.

124
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,580
Yujiang Pharmaceutical.

125
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
We want justice!

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,520
Without getting rid of the fake medicine,

127
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,920
it's unforgivable.

128
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,240
An evil pharmaceutical factory.

129
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,640
You have no conscience.

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
Punish him severely.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,059
and get rid of the evil for the people.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,730
Manager Yan.

133
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,940
Uncle Duan has checked the entire production department.

134
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,080
eight quality inspection lines.

135
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,559
The tracks are fine.

136
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,800
But just now,

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you told me

138
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
your sales department

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
did self-inspection one by one.

140
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,040
No problem.

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm wondering

142
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Where did you get the fake medicine?

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,200
Mr. Xu.

144
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
We really don't know.

145
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
You're so stubborn.

146
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,240
Ziyang.

147
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,920
That's enough.

148
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Luckily, Yan Bo

149
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
has worked with me for so many years.

150
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,800
It depends on the owner.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,680
Uncle Du.

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,000
I’m in a hurry.

153
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,720
Uncle Du.

154
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Hello. Hello.

155
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,610
the vice president in charge of sales?

156
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,960
You really don't know

157
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,740
You really don't know?

158
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,380
or are you pretending not to know?

159
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,560
What do you mean?

160
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,930
I don't mean anything else.

161
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,600
I just want to ask you.

162
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
Three quarter of the sales have dropped.

163
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,280
You still have the mood to play cards all night?

164
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,200
Why are you so generous?

165
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,920
Kid,

166
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,800
you can stand here

167
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
to talk to me like this

168
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,000
because you have a good father.

169
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,560
Otherwise,

170
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,120
Who do you think you are?

171
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,760
Say it again.

172
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,720
Ziyang.

173
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,800
Okay.

174
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,480
Okay.

175
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,480
I'm already in the meeting room.

176
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
You can come up directly.

177
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Okay.

178
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,400
Tell me.

179
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,680
What's wrong with you two?

180
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,440
If we don't get rid of the fake medicine,

181
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,840
it's unforgivable.

182
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,320
An evil pharmaceutical factory.

183
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,720
You have no conscience.

184
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,920
Punish him severely!

185
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,980
Heo Chengliang’s car!

186
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,680
Stop him!

187
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,080
Listen, Xu Ziyang.

188
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,320
Uncle Du watched you grow up.

189
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,120
No matter what he did,

190
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,080
he is your elder.

191
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,360
Brother.

192
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
It's okay.

193
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,520
It's my fault.

194
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,960
I shouldn't have said that.

195
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,480
Your Uncle Du didn’t argue with you.

196
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,080
because he cares about you.

197
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,820
You have to appreciate it.

198
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Do you hear me?

199
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,160
Yes.

200
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,720
Chairman.

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,920
Mr Su is here.

202
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,640
Mr Su.

203
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,680
You're finally here.

204
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,140
Come on.

205
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
This way, please.

206
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,960
Let me introduce

207
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,480
my idol.

208
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,640
Miss Su Ran.

209
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,640
The top-class main writer of Xinwei Network.

210
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,040
The top expert

211
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,440
of the medical industry.

212
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,080
I invited

213
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,280
to invite Reporter Su

214
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,320
to the front line.

215
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,360
to solve the problem

216
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,160
the fake medicine in our factory.

217
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,920
Mr Su.

218
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,920
This is...

219
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,760
Chairman Xu.

220
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,130
Nice to meet you.

221
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,960
I've heard a lot about you.

222
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,840
In order to recommend you,

223
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,080
he talks about you every day.

224
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,760
in front of me every day.

225
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,920
At first, I thought

226
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,160
an expert in the industry.

227
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,980
I didn't expect you to be so young and promising.

228
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,740
I'm flattered, President Xu.

229
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,680
It's my honor

230
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
to learn from you.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,720
Su,

232
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,080
Come, sit down.

233
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,600
Okay.

234
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,740
I have low blood sugar.

235
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,080
Chocolate.

236
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,410
Do you want some?

237
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,160
I'm not low.

238
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,440
Mr. Shi, you're here.

239
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,000
Song.

240
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,000
The baby will be full soon, right?

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,880
Soon.

242
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,120
Don't forget to call me.

243
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,040
I'll give you a gift.

244
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
Okay, thank you.

245
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,770
Are you busy?

246
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,840
Hi, Shi.

247
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Liu, are you busy?

248
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,250
Are you done?

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,560
Yes.

250
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,720
Just do it.

251
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I'll go back then.

252
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,440
Wait a minute.

253
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,680
Can you stop?

254
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,800
Since we moved here,

255
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,200
we've been working together.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,920
Are you here

257
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,980
to take a walk here.

258
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
What you said

259
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,400
You're right.

260
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,920
When you didn't move in,

261
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,040
I came here every day.

262
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,400
This is my old company.

263
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,640
I'm here to see if it's illegal.

264
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,120
Are you here to take a look?

265
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
The greeting room

266
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,400
There are eight of them.

267
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,560
You sent them here?

268
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Six of eight are civil disputes.

269
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,240
An apology can solve the problem.

270
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,700
Do you have to put him here?

271
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,240
Okay.

272
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
At your age,

273
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,760
Just enjoy your life after retirement.

274
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,880
Let me finish.

275
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,640
Luckily this guy is here today.

276
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,400
If the cable thief wakes up,

277
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,480
what if

278
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
what should we do?

279
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,640
No.

280
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,920
I didn’t help much.

281
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,480
Mr. Shi is quite strong.

282
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,120
He fainted with one punch.

283
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm not talking about this time.

284
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,840
Master.

285
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,720
Be careful

286
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,600
Enjoy life.

287
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,840
Mind your own business.

288
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,200
Ungrateful.

289
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,960
This is typical ungrateful.

290
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,320
Young man.

291
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,120
What’s your name?

292
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,700
My name is Zhao Lun.

293
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,960
Reporter.

294
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,880
Are you here for the fake medicine?

295
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,400
Yes.

296
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,890
Let's go.

297
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,920
I'll take you to Yujiang.

298
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,080
About the fake medicine,

299
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,800
about the fake medicine.

300
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,360
Okay.

301
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,920
Great.

302
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,760
This is professional.

303
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,680
Mr Su's strategic book

304
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,000
is well-prepared.

305
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,800
I don't think so.

306
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,960
How so?

307
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Space.

308
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,920
It's unrealistic.

309
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,520
Please tell us in detail.

310
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,320
I'm not a professional.

311
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,640
You are.

312
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,200
Interesting.

313
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,440
An amateur.

314
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,800
They say they are professional.

315
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,600
Chairman,

316
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
What do you think?

317
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,280
I think the public relations strategy

318
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,520
is very solid.

319
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,120
Very comprehensive.

320
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,800
But I can see that

321
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,240
Su doesn't know

322
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,380
about our factory.

323
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,760
But it's okay.

324
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,480
Ziyang.

325
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,760
Arrange a hotel for Su first.

326
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,280
Dad, here's the thing.

327
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,740
I've already arranged it.

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,040
Mr Su told me

329
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,600
she wants to find a house

330
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,840
in our factory.

331
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,340
Closer to the factory.

332
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,880
It's convenient for our daily interviews.

333
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,680
Yes, that's what I mean.

334
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,560
Really?

335
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,360
If that's the case,

336
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,520
Whatever.

337
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,980
I won't stand on ceremony.

338
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,570
In the next few days,

339
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,560
I'll

340
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,280
to visit Mr Su in the factory.

341
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,970
As for me,

342
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,480
can learn more

343
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
from Mr Su.

344
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,560
You little...

345
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,400
You're quite active today.

346
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
When I went in,

347
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,380
the atmosphere was weird.

348
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,440
He was covered with wounds.

349
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,560
Last year at the business summit,

350
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,880
when we first met,

351
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,640
Mr. Xu.

352
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,920
It's my courtesy.

353
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,079
Talk about it

354
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,839
I didn't expect you to be so hot-tempered.

355
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,200
I was so angry that I had no choice.

356
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,720
Actually,

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,130
gentle and elegant.

358
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,680
is my true color.

359
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,160
But to be honest,

360
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,360
at the industry summit...

361
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,240
Enough.

362
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,360
You'd better tell me

363
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,760
about the fake medicine.

364
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,760
Mr Su.

365
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,720
Let me put it this way.

366
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,240
Fake medicine? Yes.

367
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,640
It must have something to do with

368
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,080
with Du Bin.

369
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,420
And the man surnamed Yan under him

370
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,760
must be dirty.

371
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,440
Not clean.

372
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,720
Yes.

373
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,920
Your department is the problem.

374
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,880
Of course you should be responsible.

375
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes.

376
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,860
How about this?

377
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,480
Give me some time.

378
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,360
How long will it take?

379
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,280
A week.

380
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,880
One week.

381
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,840
What's wrong with a week?

382
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,800
Isn't one week enough?

383
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,480
If you can't handle it in a week, get lost.

384
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,540
Do you understand?

385
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,320
Just watch.

386
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,680
My dad is so angry this time.

387
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,560
Du Bin won't protect him.

388
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
Yan Bo.

389
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,400
Oh, no.

390
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,240
Mr Su.

391
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,050
This area

392
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
is our old family hospital.

393
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,780
It was built in the 80s.

394
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,000
Now

395
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,410
Young people have mostly moved out

396
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,440
Only some left.

397
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,280
The old man is still here.

398
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,490
How is it?

399
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
Do you feel like time traveling?

400
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,760
There used to be

401
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,290
who sells candied haws.

402
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,920
My mom didn't allow me to eat them when I was young.

403
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,960
She was afraid that I would have cavities.

404
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
She only gave me one.

405
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,760
And there.

406
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,880
There's a big pit.

407
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,160
There's fruit inside.

408
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,240
Not bad.

409
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Linlin's back!

410
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,920
Come on up!

411
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,720
Look at me.

412
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,080
what I made for you.

413
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Let me tell you.

414
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,730
I made all your favorite dishes today.

415
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,560
Don't just stand there.

416
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,360
Go inside.

417
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Mr Su.

418
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,000
Mr Su.

419
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,620
I'm listening.

420
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,720
Anyway,

421
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,880
I used to play here when I was a kid.

422
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,610
Look at that.

423
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,600
That wire pole.

424
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,600
I climbed to the top.

425
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,080
Guess how I got down.

426
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:47,880
Mr. Xu.

427
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,120
Let's go somewhere else.

428
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,760
Okay.

429
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Here.

430
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,320
I fell off.

431
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,760
Mr. Shi.

432
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,120
Are you alone?

433
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,240
My daughter

434
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,520
She's married out of town.

435
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
I just gave birth to a fat boy.

436
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,440
My wife

437
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,520
went to take care of her child.

438
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,000
Have some tea.

439
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,560
Zhao.

440
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,720
Tell me.

441
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,360
We've been walking around the whole afternoon.

442
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Do you remember

443
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,600
of Yujiang?

444
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,280
Actually, Yujiang...

445
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm sorry.

446
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,920
Hello, honey.

447
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
I’m at Mr. Shi’s.

448
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,040
Where are we staying?

449
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,240
Mr. Shi.

450
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
Where is Building 16?

451
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,140
It's just opposite me.

452
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,480
Mr Su, slow down.

453
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,400
Mr Su.

454
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,250
This is the room.

455
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,040
Okay.

456
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,120
Thank you.

457
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,720
Thank you.

458
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,560
It's okay.

459
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,880
Mr Su.

460
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,200
When I heard you on the phone,

461
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,860
you brought someone with you.

462
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,800
Right.

463
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,040
As a reporter,

464
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,480
You must have an assistant.

465
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,210
I'll get him a room in the hotel.

466
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,360
No, he...

467
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,080
Honey.

468
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:32,920
You...

469
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,220
This is Mr. Shi’s home.

470
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
You must be tired.

471
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,640
I'm fine.

472
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,240
Let me introduce.

473
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,600
This is my wife, Zhao Lun.

474
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,480
This is Xu Ziyang.

475
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,120
Mr. Xu.

476
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,460
The Mr. Xu you always mentioned to me.

477
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,810
Nice to meet you.

478
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,880
Hello.

479
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,040
What does Mr. Zhao usually do?

480
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,100
You're so free.

481
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,520
You can accompany Mr Su on a business trip?

482
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,920
I'm on leave recently.

483
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
My wife has a bad stomach.

484
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,720
If I stay here,

485
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,600
she can eat comfortably.

486
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,080
Okay.

487
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,800
Have a rest.

488
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,240
I'll leave you alone.

489
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:11,840
Mr Su.

490
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,400
I'll keep the car for you.

491
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,400
This is the car key.

492
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,660
And the key to the door.

493
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,200
Okay.

494
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,040
Thank you.

495
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,040
It's okay.

496
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,640
Thank you.

497
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,200
Mr Xu.

498
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,040
You're leaving?

499
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,000
Shi Su.

500
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,050
I didn't see you.

501
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,880
It doesn't matter.

502
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,080
How can you like me?

503
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,280
I heard that your dad is in poor health.

504
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,120
He retired.

505
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,320
I'm old.

506
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
It's time to rest.

507
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,730
What he has done all these years

508
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is really tiring.

509
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,610
Don't imitate your dad.

510
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,080
Fine.

511
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,740
Okay. Okay.

512
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,520
If there's nothing else,

513
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,380
I'll get going.

514
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,420
Okay, let's go.

515
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,440
Mr Su, I'm leaving.

516
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,920
Bye.

517
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,240
Bye.

518
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,800
Mr. Shi.

519
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,960
We’ll go back now.

520
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,920
Look.

521
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,240
We haven't left the house after a day's work.

522
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,320
Let's settle down.

523
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,840
We're close this time.

524
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,640
Let me know if you need anything.

525
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,520
OK.

526
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,880
Bye, Mr. Shi.

527
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,240
OK.

528
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,760
Honey.

529
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,780
There's only one bedroom.

530
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,680
Like this.

531
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,400
You sleep in the room.

532
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,900
I'll sleep in the living room.

533
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,480
Okay.

534
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,290
You stayed with Captain Shi all day today.

535
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,890
Did you say anything to him?

536
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,800
Nothing.

537
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,920
Mr. Bai has retired.

538
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,250
You had a lot of dealings back then.

539
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,600
Did he recognize you?

540
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,050
I don't think so.

541
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,800
But we have to

542
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,520
in front of him.

543
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,490
Don't worry.

544
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,620
Take less sleeping pills.

545
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,280
It's bad for your health.

546
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,720
It's okay.

547
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
When will our plan

548
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,040
