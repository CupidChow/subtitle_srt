[National Radio Station]

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,240
I quit.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,340
Tang Lingling.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,680
You're just in time.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,160
Is your dad dead in the sea?

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,640
He must be on the shore.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,400
Right?

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,300
Tell me now.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,120
We're betting on billiards.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,760
Are you dumb?

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,420
What are you doing?

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,080
Are you looking for trouble?

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,760
Get lost!

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,720
Why are you back?

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,120
My mom

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,600
my mom kept it from me.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,760
I got the news yesterday

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,080
so I rushed over.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,860
By the way, Linlin,

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,730
About the murderer,

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,010
about the murderer?

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,360
No.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,520
By the way,

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,660
I'm getting expelled.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,770
I finally got into the city middle school.

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
You're not going?

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,560
You know my family.

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,360
My mom's illness is all because of my dad's salary.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,700
My dad passed away.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,039
I have to earn money to treat her.

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,200
Will you go back to Yujiang?

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,039
If one day

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,340
I know who the murderer is,

34
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,039
I'll be back.

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,759
I'm home.

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,920
Okay, I'll go now. Okay.

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,520
Wait.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,250
The address is on it.

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,960
If you need help in the future,

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,290
remember to write to me.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,320
By the way,

42
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm not old enough.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,860
I can't get this badge.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,570
They secretly changed my age and name.

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,020
Don't get it wrong.

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,520
What's your name?

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,640
Qin Kaixuan.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,440
Du Bin.

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,880
Du Bin.

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,250
Are you sure?

51
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,320
Then hurry up and find out the source of the news.

52
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,440
I'll be right there.

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,700
What's wrong, Ziyang?

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,220
I need to go to the factory.

55
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,010
Rumor has it that

56
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,320
Uncle Duan is dead.

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,760
Go now.

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,800
Tell me if anything happens.

59
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,360
Jiang.

60
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,640
Chairman.

61
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,360
The police asked me just now.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,080
Pack your things.

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
I'll ask someone to send you out.

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,960
Chairman.

65
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,240
Tell me! He's dead! He's dead!

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
I didn't kill him.

67
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,120
Boss.

68
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,960
The one with the most motive

69
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,159
is Xu Chengliang.

70
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,120
He was in the team with Yang Jing last night.

71
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,400
The driver Jiang Wanli

72
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,120
just finished the trial.

73
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,280
Jiang Wanli did chase Duan Zhigang last night.

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
But from the CCTV,

75
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,280
the direction he was chasing

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,360
and left the crime scene.

77
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,040
We can basically rule out the suspicion.

78
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,700
Captain Li.

79
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,680
We found a piece of fiber.

80
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Take it to the hospital.

81
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,120
See if there are any tissues left.

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,850
Understood.

83
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,280
Boss.

84
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,040
Master.

85
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,800
You...

86
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,860
Don't, Captain Li.

87
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,850
I'm just a regular consultant.

88
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,280
Don't tell me

89
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,200
don't tell me.

90
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,600
I have no right to know.

91
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,530
I'll stand here.

92
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,960
Ask me if you have any questions.

93
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,120
If you don't have anything to ask, I don't exist.

94
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,600
Master, I'm not trying to hide it from you.

95
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Cut the crap.

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,680
Let me ask you.

97
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,960
Can I look into the case now?

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,560
Here.

99
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,970
They were found in the morning.

100
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,520
There are traces of fighting in this area.

101
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,760
But the ground has been washed away by water.

102
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,280
It's hard to extract footprints and fingerprints.

103
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,000
We found a paternity certificate

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,760
in Duan Zhigang's personal belongings.

105
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,320
But the names of both samples

106
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,520
are not Duan Zhigang.

107
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,450
I've sent someone to check.

108
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,520
Liu.

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,040
What did the autopsy say?

110
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,730
Seok Soo.

111
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
The time of death was

112
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,120
to 0.20 yesterday.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,920
When Qin came back,

114
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Xu Chengliang and Yang Jing

115
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,780
are in the team.

116
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,600
There are seven wounds on the body.

117
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
The fatal wound is in the chest.

118
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
What weapon?

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,800
Axe.

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Axe again?

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,920
And it's the same size

122
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
on Yan Bo's body.

123
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,920
The prosecutors suspect it's the same weapon.

124
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,800
Is it possible

125
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,280
the same person?

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,760
This doesn't look like the same person.

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,800
The depth and angle of this wound are different.

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,600
The power of two killers and habits are different.

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
Could it be...

130
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,560
change it on purpose?

131
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
To confuse us.

132
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,200
If he really wants to confuse us,

133
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
he won't use the same weapon.

134
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,880
Besides,

135
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,840
there is a psychological difference between the two murderers.

136
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,159
The one who killed Yan Bo

137
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,680
is inexperienced, but he has strong mental quality.

138
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,200
The eight axes were chopped to death.

139
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,720
The purpose is clear and decisive.

140
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,760
And this time,

141
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,720
he cut his 70s.

142
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,400
But the deep angle of the wound

143
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,440
It's a mess.

144
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Obviously, he's venting his anger.

145
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,480
The second crime

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,540
should be calmer than the first time.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,920
Do you think you're a rookie this time?

148
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,600
I think so.

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,440
He's not as good as the last one.

150
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
How did he get the report?

151
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,040
This warehouse is under Duan Zhigang's name.

152
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
He hired someone.

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,660
On the 15th of every month,

154
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
on the 15th of every month.

155
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,120
Today is the 15th.

156
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,919
That's the area.

157
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,919
Probably someone close to Duan Zhigang.

158
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,440
First, he must know Duan Zhigang has such a warehouse.

159
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,960
Second,

160
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,640
he must know that Duan Zhigang

161
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,919
he would come here.

162
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,520
You mean

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
Duan Zhigang

164
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,080
to let the murderer come here to meet him.

165
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,940
and killed him.

166
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,040
Probably.

167
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,400
He must be trusted by him.

168
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,440
The one with this condition

169
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
is Qin.

170
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,080
But he has no motive or time to commit the crime.

171
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,240
Boss.

172
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,290
The murderer is probably a man.

173
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,920
Xu Chengliang has the most motive.

174
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,360
Qin Kaixuan has the best condition.

175
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,090
But neither of them were there.

176
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
There is no other suspect

177
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,880
in our eyes.

178
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,280
If we can confirm

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,920
Su Ran is Tang Lingling,

180
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,480
there is another man who can ask.

181
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,240
Song, let's go.

182
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
He's here. He's here.

183
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,400
Who is it?

184
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,220
Don't come out.

185
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,850
Come out when I count to ten.

186
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,120
I'll give you a surprise.

187
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,520
What is it?

188
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,280
You'll know later.

189
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,360
Six.

190
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,000
Five.

191
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,600
Four.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Two.

193
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,160
Sister.

194
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,480
I'm coming out.

195
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,760
Sister.

196
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,920
Sister.

197
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,680
Sister.

198
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,640
Sister.

199
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,720
Sister.

200
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,000
Kid.

201
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,640
I found you.

202
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,000
What's wrong?

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Nothing.

204
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm fine.

205
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
You drank all night.

206
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,520
Duan Zhigang is dead.

207
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
You knew?

208
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,690
How did you know?

209
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,560
I shouldn't have known.

210
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,080
How far is the plan going?

211
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,200
How did people die?

212
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
How many of us were there?

213
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,770
I shouldn't know anything.

214
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,320
Right?

215
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,400
Hello? Hello?

216
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,400
Hello?

217
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,160
Zhao Lun?

218
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,480
Who is it?

219
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,880
Don’t care who I am.

220
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,010
Su Ran is in trouble.

221
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
and rushed to the east of the dock.

222
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
at the east of the pier.

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,760
If he goes,

224
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,600
it means he has failed.

225
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Su Ran's plan failed.

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,040
Don't you want Duan Zhi Gang to die?

227
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,480
I've prepared an axe

228
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,920
and a black raincoat.

229
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,520
Think about it or not

230
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,360
If you don't,

231
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,160
he'll leave the country tonight.

232
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,020
You'll never get another chance.

233
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,760
Who are you?

234
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,840
Hey!

235
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,000
Didn't I tell you?

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,520
I'll be out of touch for a few hours.

237
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,040
and ask you to wait for my news?

238
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,600
Su Ran.

239
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,120
I'm a human.

240
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,400
not a tool.

241
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,720
I have my own judgment.

242
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,880
You hide everything from me.

243
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,880
Of course I can only do what I want.

244
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,800
I just want to know

245
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,480
who that person is.

246
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,560
Is he the man

247
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
called victory?

248
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,200
Who is it?

249
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,480
Me.

250
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,760
Mr. Shi.

251
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,560
Coming.

252
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,240
Su is busy.

253
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,480
Zhao is also at home.

254
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,600
Mr. Shi.

255
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,040
Mr. Shi, what are you doing?

256
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,080
Hello, Miss Su.

257
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,160
We have a case

258
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,640
for a DNA sample.

259
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,770
Please ask your wife to come with us

260
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,050
to cooperate with the investigation.

261
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,920
Anything else, Miss Su?

262
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,920
Move.

263
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,440
Go back.

264
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,360
Mrs. Xu.

265
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,320
Get out of the way!

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,930
Heo Chengliang.

267
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,240
What do you want?

268
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,800
I think I've figured it out.

269
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,920
You two have been sneaking around for so long.

270
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,080
Why did Duan suddenly

271
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,760
suddenly want to run away?

272
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,040
Someone is pushing you.

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
The person who sent me this email

274
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,339
and the person who killed Duan

275
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,319
who killed Duan.

276
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,839
Tell me.

277
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,079
Who is he?

278
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,160
Give me some money.

279
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,690
and let Ziyang and me go.

280
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,319
I'll tell you.

281
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,200
From the moment I met you,

282
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,480
the only thing I like about you

283
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,880
is this foolishness.

284
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,810
It's like I'm living in a dream.

285
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,080
Okay.

286
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,940
If you don't want to say it,

287
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,480
then never.

288
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,920
But it's not your life

289
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,360
That's not your life.

290
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,520
Let me plan your life.

291
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,720
Your future life should be like this.

292
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,400
From now on,

293
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,480
don't want to go out.

294
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,000
or contact others.

295
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,960
On your birthday,

296
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,840
on your birthday.

297
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,460
I'll spend it with you.

298
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,800
Then you'll get a serious illness.

299
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,440
and die on the operating table.

300
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
When he comes back from France,

301
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,120
I'll cry at your funeral.

302
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,160
Your life will be written

303
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
you're a good mother.

304
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,600
and a good wife.

305
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,920
I've let you down.

306
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,290
Heo Chengliang.

307
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,840
What are you doing?

308
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,320
You're tired.

309
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,840
Go upstairs and rest.

310
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,840
Here.

311
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,500
Five times.

312
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
You were looking for your wife

313
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,260
looking for your wife in the west of the city?

314
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,040
Yes.

315
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,160
Mr. Xu,

316
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,420
have divided the film.

317
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,180
He went to the east.

318
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,340
I'm in the west.

319
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,690
Where have you been?

320
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,160
Here.

321
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
It's upside down.

322
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,560
These two places.

323
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,880
I didn't go to the warehouse on Hailin Road.

324
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,120
Hailin Road.

325
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,610
I'm not familiar with Yujiang yet.

326
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,700
I don't know exactly where I've been.

327
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,940
Just these two places.

328
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,480
How did you get there?

329
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,770
I'll take a taxi.

330
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,090
Have some water.

331
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Think again.

332
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,360
How did you get there?

333
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,810
I'll take a taxi.

334
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,000
When you get to a familiar place, come down and look for it.

335
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and take a taxi.

336
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,480
That's troublesome.

337
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,450
Don't you have a car?

338
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,250
I drank a little yesterday.

339
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
so I didn't drive.

340
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,400
What are you wearing?

341
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,440
This one.

342
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Leave a sample according to the law.

343
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,000
Duan Zhigang.

344
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,420
Do you know him?

345
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,960
I heard it from my wife.

346
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,240
But we don't know each other.

347
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Besides,

348
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
didn't you two

349
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
both of you went to the freight port.

350
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,080
You drove there?

351
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,640
Really?

352
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,800
Maybe it's a coincidence.

353
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,800
I've never seen the sea since I was a kid.

354
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,200
I wandered around the sea.

355
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
He went there too.

356
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,480
He's been drinking water for six times now.

357
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,720
Song.

358
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Add more for Zhao.

359
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,480
He's thirsty.

360
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,810
No need, Captain Li.

361
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,840
I'm done.

362
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,680
Enough.

363
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,040
Captain Li.

364
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,680
How long

365
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,320
for my wife?

366
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,380
Captain Li.

367
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,490
Su Ran's sample is done.

368
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,400
Got it.

369
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,960
Sign your name on the statement.

370
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,720
Drive.

371
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,090
The police asked where you went last night, didn't they?

372
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,360
I said,

373
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,960
I've been looking for you in the west of the city.

374
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,490
I didn't drive when I went to see Duan Zhigang.

375
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,760
I changed my clothes.

376
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,480
and a hat.

377
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
The ax that killed him.

378
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,500
I threw it into the river with my clothes.

379
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,600
They won't find me.

380
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,440
Right?

381
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,160
Let's run.

382
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,400
Run!

383
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,960
We're not done yet.

384
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,240
We can't hide it

385
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,680
we won't be able to hide it.

386
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,120
The police have informed me

387
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,000
to restrict us from leaving Yujiang.

388
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,960
It's not too late to leave now.

389
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,340
Why are you panicking?

390
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,000
The police don't have solid evidence yet.

391
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,800
If we run away now,

392
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,080
it's like giving up.

393
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,420
I'll leave now.

394
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,810
You have an accomplice anyway.

395
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,040
It's too dangerous for me to stay here.

396
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,840
Are you crazy?

397
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,240
You sold us all if you ran away.

398
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,080
From now on,

399
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,160
that old man will be watching us.

400
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,440
Mind your own business.

401
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,970
Don't let him find anything unusual from you.

402
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,560
Also,

403
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,240
if he asks you to do anything again,

404
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,840
you must tell me immediately.

405
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,360
Then tell me

406
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,240
Who is he?

407
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,120
Why is he in this plan too?

408
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,120
He already knows that I killed someone.

409
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
I need to know if I can trust him.

410
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,320
He's crazy.

411
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,680
If you know who he is,

412
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
you won't be able to live.

413
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,760
That's why I kept it from you.

414
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,240
I’ll get Heo Sung-liang

415
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,490
before the police find out the DNA.

416
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,360
We can travel from the sea together.

417
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,000
Zhao Lun.

418
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,360
Zhao Lun.

419
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,970
We can leave this place successfully.

420
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,800
Trust me.

421
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,720
Let's go.

422
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,340
Send me to the factory.

423
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,600
Captain Li.

424
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,000
What did Su Ran say?

425
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,290
Master, don't call Captain Li.

426
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,120
I apologize to you, okay?

427
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,560
Report.

428
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,440
Su Ran said she grew up in a welfare home.

429
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,570
Basically similar to what we know.

430
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Her earliest information

431
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,080
from a public welfare home in Qingyan City.

432
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,320
The file is incomplete.

433
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,360
but this orphanage is closed down.

434
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,240
The person in charge passed away two years ago.

435
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,520
We can't get in touch with anyone else.

436
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,320
It sounds suspicious.

437
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,600
Find out

438
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,040
how old she is.

439
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,320
I've tried my best.

440
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,800
When she was 18,

441
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,400
at 18.

442
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,640
She went to Xinwei Network after graduation.

443
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,160
She registered with Zhao Lun

444
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,560
in Songryeong a year ago.

445
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,400
What about Zhao Lun?

446
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,360
He is simple.

447
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,960
He was born and raised in Songryeong.

448
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,280
My parents passed away

449
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,820
They don't have any close relatives.

450
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,120
And his clothes

451
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,840
and the fiber found at the scene

452
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,600
at the scene.

453
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,080
We can't connect Duan Zhigang's death

454
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,610
with Duan Zhigang's death.

455
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,600
Zhao Lun was flustered just now.

456
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,080
with Zhao Lun.

457
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,600
Song.

458
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
Call the Songryeong Police.

459
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,840
Find out who he is.

460
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,880
I'll go now.

461
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,560
Master.

462
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Su Ran's identity is still unclear.

463
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,570
If we remove this identity,

464
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,060
Zhao Lun has no motive.

465
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,330
Let’s check around the crime scene

466
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,040
and see if there is any breakthrough.

467
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,840
Don’t be killed by Su Ran circle.

468
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,520
When the DNA results are out,

469
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,400
as long as we confirm she is Tang Lingling,

470
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,040
we will

471
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,280
right away.

472
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,080
I don't think we need to wait.

473
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,520
Push it this way.

474
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,780
It should be right.

475
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,200
Now walk with two legs.

476
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,920
First,

477
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,640
Find out where Zhao Lun was

478
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,040
on the night of his death.

479
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,480
Especially to whether

480
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,640
he's pretending to avoid the surveillance.

481
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,120
Second,

482
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,320
If Su Ran is suspicious,

483
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,080
her next target

484
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,320
is probably Xu Chenglong.

485
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,080
Be careful of Su Ran and Zhao Lun.

486
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,640
with Xu Chenglong alone.

487
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,060
to prevent crimes.

488
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,120
Okay.

489
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
I'll do as you say.

490
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,760
Qin.

491
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Are you cooking for everyone again?

492
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,960
They are busy.

493
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
What are you busy with?

494
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,200
I'm bullying you.

495
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,820
Okay, I'm leaving.

496
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,730
Qin Kaixuan.

497
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
You made me lose contact for several hours yesterday.

498
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,720
Have you thought about

499
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,580
to let Zhao Lun kill Duan Zhigang?

500
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,280
I’m not as dark as you think.

501
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,680
I asked you to lose touch

502
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,880
because I was afraid Duan Zhigang would find out

503
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,800
and suspect me.

504
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,840
and affect our plan.

505
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,080
I contacted Zhao Lun.

506
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,640
I was forced to leave.

507
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,120
Do I need to contact him?

508
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,080
I told you.

509
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,560
Let them kill each other.

510
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,160
We can't kill them.

511
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,800
Have you forgotten?

512
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,600
Linlin!

513
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,340
Do we have a choice?

514
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,640
What do you mean?

515
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,320
You deserve it.

516
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,050
That's just your imagination.

517
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,440
From the day we decided to come back,

518
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,840
we can't leave without a trace.

519
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,200
That's because you've been sabotaging the plan.

520
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,320
we can't leave.

521
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,480
I can follow your plan.

522
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Will they?

523
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,920
In your plan,

524
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,080
will Duan Zhigang run away from Xu Chengliang?

525
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,920
It’s me.

526
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,320
I contacted Zhao Lun.

527
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,250
Otherwise, he would have run away.

528
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,760
And Yan Bo.

529
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,320
He escaped from the fake medicine workshop.

530
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,560
in your plan?

531
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,680
If he told Heo Chengliang

532
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,840
to Heo Chengliang,

533
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
what other plans do you have?

534
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,360
Since Yan Bo ran away,

535
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,280
your plan has failed.

536
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,400
Follow me.

537
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,320
I could have killed all of them.

538
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,160
There's no need to be so complicated.

539
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,960
So?

540
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,820
Are you going to die with them?

541
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,020
It doesn't matter.

542
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,960
My life

543
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,080
has only one result

544
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,040
since 1994.

545
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,560
Because of you,

546
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,800
You told me

547
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,960
not to punish ourselves

548
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,280
with their sins.

549
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,480
You told me

550
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,120
After this,

551
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,720
we can have our own lives.

552
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,880
So I came back three years early

553
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,400
to make Duan Zhigang's car accident and get close to him.

554
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,840
to collect their information.

555
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,880
From Du Bin to fake medicine,

556
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,760
and Xu Chengliang wanted to escape and retire.

557
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,800
and Duan Zhigang and Yang Jing.

558
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I'll help you step by step.

559
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,660
I'll wait for you to come back.

560
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,400
Because I want to try.

561
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,080
Is life

562
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Is it possible?

563
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,100
But what happened?

564
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,450
It's still the same.

565
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,160
This is my life.

566
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,520
I can't escape.

567
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,840
Drag your husband into this.

568
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,580
I didn't expect you to be so angry.

569
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,040
Are you two pretending?

570
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,210
Are you crazy, Qin Kaixuan?

571
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,160
The DNA test results

572
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,480
