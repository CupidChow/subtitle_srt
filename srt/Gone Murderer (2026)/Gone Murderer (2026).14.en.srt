00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,000
Linlin!

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,760
Linlin!

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,640
I bought you a skirt.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,100
Why aren't you wearing it?

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,960
Linlin!

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,600
Open the door!

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,880
Linlin!

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,040
Tell me!

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,480
What happened?

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,040
Did someone bully you?

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,360
Linlin!

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,050
Don't be afraid.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,840
I'm here.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,120
I'm fine.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,160
Leave me alone.

17
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,290
The crime scene.

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,880
Du Bin.

19
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,520
Mr Su.

20
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,480
Mr Xu.

21
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,280
You haven't rested yet, have you?

22
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,840
No.

23
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,079
Can I help you?

24
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,120
Can we talk inside?

25
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,960
Go in.

26
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
Thank you, Mr Su.

27
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,420
Why are you leaving suddenly?

28
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,520
I don't know why my dad

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,060
He insisted that I attend that forum.

30
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,890
My mom's birthday is tomorrow.

31
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,840
I just want to stay one more day, but he won't let me.

32
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
I was so worried.

33
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,480
so I came to see you before I left.

34
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,400
Maybe your dad

35
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,399
has his own plan.

36
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,079
Ran.

37
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,480
Do you mind

38
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,360
Do you mind?

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,880
Recently,

40
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
my mom is in a bad mood recently.

41
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,000
and her face is always injured.

42
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,960
She didn't tell me when I asked her.

43
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,840
My dad

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
doesn't want me to be alone with her.

45
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,720
Anyway,

46
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,650
my family has been very depressed lately.

47
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
I received another

48
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,560
a strange text

49
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
saying you were in danger.

50
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,600
but you were with my dad.

51
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
So I want to ask you.

52
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,540
Is there something going on between you two?

53
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,640
No.

54
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,080
Okay.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,240
Raise your head.

56
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,360
Tell me.

57
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,520
Where is

58
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,040
Where is it?

59
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,840
It's...

60
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,800
It's in your father's grave.

61
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,080
Mr Xu.

62
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,840
Maybe you're overthinking.

63
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,120
But

64
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
your relationship with your mom

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,560
with your mom.

66
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,960
In front of my mom,

67
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,560
in front of my mom.

68
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
To my dad,

69
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,980
I'll always be a subordinate.

70
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,560
a loser.

71
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,680
By the way,

72
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,560
Mr Su.

73
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,900
Who are you close to your parents?

74
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm an orphan.

75
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:51,960
Ran.

76
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,720
I...

77
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I didn't mean it.

78
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,640
It's okay.

79
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,080
By the way,

80
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,720
Mr Su.

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,930
Your husband...

82
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,940
If you can't, divorce him.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,660
He's really not a good person.

84
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,800
It's almost time.

85
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,700
I should go to the airport.

86
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,930
I'll get going then.

87
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,640
Okay.

88
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,880
Mr Xu.

89
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,240
What's wrong?

90
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,720
Ran.

91
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,400
You'd better

92
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,480
take your mother with you.

93
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,520
Why?

94
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,960
Why are you risking your life for Su Ran?

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,440
Who is she to you?

96
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,120
Forget it.

97
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,120
Let's make it quick.

98
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,200
Let's talk to Su Ran.

99
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,000
See if she

100
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,440
she can handle it.

101
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,560
Hey.

102
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,200
Mr Xu.

103
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
I...

104
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,600
come back three years early

105
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,440
to collect your dirty work

106
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,400
to help Su Ran

107
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,160
for Su Ran.

108
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,330
Why did you help her?

109
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,800
I...

110
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
love her.

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,400
I...

112
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,600
really love her.

113
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,440
I hid all the shameful things

114
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,600
in Su Ran's office.

115
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
including that tape.

116
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Don't touch her.

117
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,000
Come at me.

118
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
I can do anything.

119
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,360
Liang.

120
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,480
These are two amulets

121
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,800
before I came to Yujiang.

122
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,770
I never got a chance to give them to you.

123
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,600
Honey.

124
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,010
There's only one bedroom here.

125
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
You sleep in the room.

126
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,820
I'll sleep in the living room.

127
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,460
Captain Li.

128
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:30,880
Liu.

129
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,900
What happened?

130
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,200
The car

131
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,480
was that car.

132
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,600
I've sent someone to keep an eye on it.

133
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,520
Where is the owner?

134
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,840
I can't find the plate.

135
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,680
Have you checked this area?

136
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,120
Yes.

137
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
We haven't found anything yet.

138
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,320
According to the footprints and wheels on the ground,

139
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,180
they must have changed a car here.

140
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,440
Liu.

141
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,540
Keep checking around.

142
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,160
That car can be a bait.

143
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,440
Keep an eye on it.

144
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
See if anyone comes to pick up the car.

145
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,240
Got it.

146
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,760
Song.

147
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,740
Let’s split up.

148
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,280
Go to Qin Kaihui’s house.

149
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,480
and try to find some clues.

150
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
I'll ask Su Ran.

151
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,300
Okay. Okay.

152
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,240
Yes.

153
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,960
Bed 36.

154
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,760
Come here.

155
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,520
Su.

156
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,220
Mr. Shi, you’re awake.

157
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,720
You sent me here?

158
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,600
Yes.

159
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,760
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

160
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,160
Your blood sugar is too low.

161
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,080
You need to be observed for a few days.

162
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,610
Are you feeling better now?

163
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,680
Check the box again.

164
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,290
and see if there's anything else I don't know.

165
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
If not,

166
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,320
take care of it.

167
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,880
And then,

168
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,400
kill Qin Kaixuan.

169
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,140
We have to hurry up with Su Ran.

170
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,600
I won't keep him.

171
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,240
Yes.

172
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,080
Hurry up.

173
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,960
The doctor said you should eat regularly.

174
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,280
Master.

175
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,240
Are you okay?

176
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,410
I'm fine.

177
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,880
Thanks to Su's delivery in time.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,660
Your blood sugar is low again.

179
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,000
Call me if you're sick.

180
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,040
Are you feeling better?

181
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm fine.

182
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,320
Anything else?

183
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,200
If there's nothing else,

184
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,160
I'll go back now.

185
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,920
Miss Su.

186
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,930
You can't leave yet.

187
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,000
We need you

188
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
need your cooperation.

189
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,850
Go ahead.

190
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,400
Mom.

191
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,000
Shouldn't you be at the airport now?

192
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,760
Dad.

193
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,520
Miss Su.

194
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,800
You are husband and wife.

195
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
Something is wrong with Zhao Lun's identity.

196
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,720
You said you didn’t know.

197
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,720
Captain Li.

198
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,580
I really don’t know

199
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,370
what’s wrong with Zhao Lun.

200
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,120
Go!

201
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,160
Don't hit him.

202
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,240
Go!

203
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,720
Heo Seong-liang.

204
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,440
You devil!

205
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,400
Kill me if you dare.

206
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,680
Don't hit him.

207
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,120
Who told you to come back?

208
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,600
Dad.

209
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,330
If I don't come back,

210
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,000
if I don't come back?

211
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,360
Xu Ziyang, listen carefully.

212
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,880
She doesn't deserve to be your mother.

213
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
Buy the flight ticket and leave now.

214
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,240
Don't ask anything.

215
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,920
You'll be the new chairman

216
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,440
of the factory.

217
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,080
You'll know in the future

218
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,680
the choice I made for you is right.

219
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,520
Dad.

220
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,520
I don't want anything you say.

221
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
I want you to live.

222
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,800
You loser.

223
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,120
No!

224
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,720
Dad.

225
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
It's indeed her fault

226
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,080
is indeed her fault.

227
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,320
But for my sake,

228
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,000
for my sake?

229
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
Who told you that?

230
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,280
It doesn't matter who told me.

231
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,320
Since I was young,

232
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,160
the most proud thing

233
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,860
is never that I have an excellent background

234
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200
or a bright future.

235
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,480
but because I have a happy family.

236
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,440
and a pair of parents who love me.

237
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
Dad, please.

238
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,860
Please don't take it away from me.

239
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,480
Dad!

240
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,800
Dad!

241
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,880
Dad.

242
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,040
Duan Zhigang is dead now.

243
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,880
My mom knows she was wrong.

244
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,240
Can you give her a chance?

245
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,360
Didn't you always say

246
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,620
you always said I didn't want to improve.

247
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,720
I'll listen to you in the future.

248
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,600
I can participate in

249
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,800
that I don't like.

250
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,800
I'm going to a company forum.

251
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,640
Dad, I'll go.

252
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,840
Or

253
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,040
I can form a team for R&D.

254
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,960
I promise.

255
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,240
I promise in three years,

256
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
in three years.

257
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,800
Okay, Dad?

258
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,120
Ziyang,

259
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,770
Is the road I made for you

260
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,040
made you so painful?

261
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,800
No, Dad.

262
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,520
Not at all.

263
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,640
Dad.

264
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,240
I can make you satisfied.

265
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,960
I can do it.

266
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,600
As long as you let my mom go,

267
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,520
I will be

268
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,450
the son you want.

269
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,920
I beg you.

270
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,080
Ziyang.

271
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,840
One day, you will understand

272
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,720
I did everything for you.

273
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
for you.

274
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,000
But this woman

275
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
betrayed us,

276
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,560
but also killed me with an outsider.

277
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,600
When she did this,

278
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,920
she never thought about your feelings.

279
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,680
She's the selfish woman.

280
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,360
But she's my mom.

281
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
But she's my mom.

282
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,560
Dad.

283
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,920
She's my mom.

284
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,920
I beg you.

285
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,040
I beg you.

286
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,640
Okay.

287
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,120
For you,

288
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,960
I can spare her life.

289
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,360
But from now on,

290
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
you are not allowed to see her again.

291
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,760
If you agree,

292
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
I'll let her go.

293
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,680
Okay.

294
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,360
Dad.

295
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,400
I promise you.

296
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,050
I promise you anything.

297
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,240
Mom, it's okay.

298
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,490
[I'm sorry.]

300
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,440
Captain Li.

301
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,400
Let me explain.

302
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,960
I just met

303
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,800
just met him.

304
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,010
We didn’t have any connection.

305
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,640
About Zhao Lun.

306
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,520
Ling Ling,

307
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
If the police ask you about Zhao Lun,

308
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,160
you can make it up.

309
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,920
To be honest,

310
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,920
since I married him,

311
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,760
I found

312
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,820
something was wrong with him.

313
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,840
He always asked me about Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory.

314
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,000
He also insisted

315
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,080
he insisted on coming with me.

316
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,280
After he came,

317
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
he asked me to introduce him to Chairman Xu.

318
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,380
Does Zhao Lun know Qin Kaihui?

319
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,800
I don’t know.

320
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,880
No.

321
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,360
No.

322
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,360
Search carefully.

323
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,890
Don't miss a single thread.

324
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,680
Chairman.

325
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,500
Forget about that.

326
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,920
How is it?

327
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,260
There's nothing else in this box, right?

328
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,640
You little...

329
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,440
He's quite active today.

330
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,440
Of his peers,

331
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,720
among his peers.

332
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,760
You spoiled him.

333
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,640
Ziyang.

334
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,600
It's okay.

335
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Mom.

336
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,800
Get out of here.

337
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
I'll find a chance to work for my dad.

338
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,170
Our family will never be apart.

339
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,440
You don't know him.

340
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,640
He won't let me live.

341
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,960
He's just pretending to be nice in front of you.

342
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,400
Mom.

343
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,520
As long as you leave here,

344
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,400
You're safe.

345
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,040
Ziyang.

346
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,680
I don't want to leave you.

347
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,960
I'm worried about you.

348
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,680
Mom, let's not talk about this.

349
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
I'll walk you out.

350
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,600
Be good. Let's go.

351
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,880
Are you suspecting

352
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,880
what happened in the pharmaceutical factory

353
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,000
has something to do with us coming to Yujiang.

354
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,130
You just need to answer the questions.

355
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,240
You just started

356
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,840
you started to pay attention to Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory.

357
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,900
of Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory?

358
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,000
When I first joined the industry,

359
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,520
I saw Chairman Xu developing independently

360
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,160
to break the overseas technology monopoly.

361
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,080
I'm touched.

362
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,560
I wrote my first report

363
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
I wrote my first report literature.

364
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,680
So from then on,

365
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
I respected President Xu.

366
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,800
Ziyang.

367
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,640
Hold your mother.

368
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
Come and sit down.

369
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,720
Ziyang.

370
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,920
Dad, please.

371
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,240
I want to ask you.

372
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,200
since you were born,

373
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,640
I treat you well, right?

374
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,280
Is it okay?

375
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,240
Yes.

376
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,160
That's good.

377
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,960
That's good.

378
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,280
Mom.

379
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,760
Mom!

380
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,320
Dad, let go of my mom.

381
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,000
Tell me.

382
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,120
When did you and Duan Zhigang get together?

383
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,600
Whose son is he?

384
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,360
Xu Chengliang.

385
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,360
I spent the night with Duan Zhigang.

386
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,200
than being with you

387
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,720
than being with you.

388
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,040
Ziyang, run!

389
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,800

Run!

391
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,760

Wake up, Mom!

396

Don't come near me!

397
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,620
Don't touch my mom!

398
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,240
Xu Ziyang.

399
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,560
You still want to kill me?

400
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,280
Dad!

401
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,400
Dad.

402
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Dad, listen to me.

403
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,520
Dad.

404
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,480
I didn't. Listen to me.

405
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,040
Kill me!

406
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,170
Dad, let me explain.

407
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,600
Don't call me dad.

408
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,480
Dad, I beg you.

409
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,720
I told you not to call me dad.

410
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,880
Dad.

411
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,960
Don't call me dad.

412
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,360
After I came here,

413
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,840
Chairman Xu

414
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,610
took good care of me.

416
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,720
with his family.

417
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,880
This is all the relationship

418
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,080
with Heo Chengliang.

419
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,480
There's nothing else.

420
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,080
Su.

421
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,640
You saved me once.

422
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,240
I'll show you the way.

423
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,200
Tell the police

424
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,000
everything you know.

425
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,160

426

427
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,770
What are you talking about?

428
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,210
I don't understand.

429
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,690
If you still don't understand,

430
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,480
there's no turning back.

431
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,220
Captain Li.

432
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,040
It's my duty to cooperate with the investigation.

433
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,120
But if you don't have

434
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm involved in these cases,

435
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,560
I'm involved in these cases?

436
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,100
If you have nothing to ask,

437
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,680
when can I leave?

438
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,000
Don't touch him.

439
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,600
Chairman.

440
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,360
We have to deal with it quickly.

441
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
I told you not to touch him.

442
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,240
I...

443
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,160
came back three years early

444
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,400
to help Su Ran

445
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,000
for Su Ran.

446
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,880
I hid all the shameful things

447
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,760
in Su Ran's office.

448
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,200
Xu Chengliang.

449
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,960
You will die a horrible death.

450
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,120
Duan, Bin.

451
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,060
Listen carefully.

452
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,300
What we do at the leopard beach

453
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,280
is to eat guns.

454
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,640
No matter how many years pass,

455
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,800
you have to remember

456
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,720
every confession you make today.

457
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,800
Let those three lives

458
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,120
in that typhoon forever.

459
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,860
Master.

460
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,449
Su Ran definitely didn't kill her.

461
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,239
It’s too difficult

462
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
It's too difficult to get evidence.

463
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,320
She won't stop.

464
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,050
She will take another step.

465
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,199

470
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,040
Yes.
