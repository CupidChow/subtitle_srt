1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,040
This counts as a work-related injury.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,440
They can't just lay us off like that.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,240
Let them wait.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,330
We must sue them.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,640
All of us

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,600
can't just take this lying down.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,660
We must stand firm.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,540
You hear me?

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,160
Hey!

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,440
Hey!

12
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,490
Bunch of losers.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,170
Didn't you say you were doing well?

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,520
Didn't you say you became a boss?

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,840
Didn't you say that when I graduated

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
I could work for you if I couldn't find a job?

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,160
I am doing quite well.

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,600
Quite well?

19
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,100
Look at your hands.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,840
All these injuries.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Is this what you call doing well?

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,640
How did you find me?

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,280
So

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,440
the murderers are Xu Chengliang,

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,770
Duan Zhigang and Du Bin.

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,040
Yes.

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,520
[Fresh]

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,480
After all these years,

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,040
[Fresh]

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,120
why are you only telling me now?

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,880
[Fresh]

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,120
Because in this world, you're the only person

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,800
I still care about.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
All these years,

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
you worked to earn money for my education.

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,460
I can't let you do something foolish.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,840
I needed to come up with a foolproof plan

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,450
before I could tell you.

39
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,210
How did you find out?

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,320
I once saw a photo

41
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,370
that contained evidence of their crimes.

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,010
But when I was about to report it to the police,

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,100
someone snatched the photo away.

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,640
So I had no evidence to prove

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,610
their crimes to the police.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,480
Of course, I have no proof

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,920
to convince you this photo ever existed.

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
But Kaixuan, I can assure you...

49
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,440
Lingling.

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,690
You don't need to assure me.

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,400
I believe you.

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
I thought my life

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,040
was just heaven playing a cruel joke on me.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,720
Now I know

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,720
why I'm still alive.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,400
Once I recover,

57
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
I'll go to Yujiang

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,640
and set things up for you.

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
But for this plan, just the two of us isn't enough.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,760
I need another helper.

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
For something like this,

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,380
who else would believe us?

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,120
Feng Lan.

64
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,480
She has a brother.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
I don't know this person.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,040
And I don't want to know them.

67
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
If you insist on having him join,

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,600
don't let him know I exist.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,340
Except for you,

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,960
I trust no one.

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,920
Duan Zhigang and Du Bin.

72
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,360
Du Bin.

73
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,640
Juan.

74
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,400
Your brother's medicine for next week

75
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,460
might take a while.

76
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,440
There's nobody here right now.

77
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Go lock the door.

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Chao.

79
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,409
Please give me back the agreement.

80
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,760
I want to leave.

81
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,520
What did you just say? I didn't catch it.

82
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,960
I said

83
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I want to leave.

84
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,560
Juan.

85
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,160
Our agreement is for five years.

86
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,200
It's still early.

87
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,800
Besides,

88
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,440
if your brother stops taking his medicine now, he'll die.

89
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,300
Don't you care about him anymore?

90
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,760
Go lock the door.

91
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,100
I'll be waiting for you in the inner room.

92
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,040
Our agreement was for you to get me medicine.

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm only working for you.

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,080
Everyone's talking about it today.

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,240
That relative of yours, Mr. Duan, is dead.

96
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
You won't be able to get the medicine anymore.

97
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,280
Why won't you let me go?

98
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,760
Am I being too nice to you?

99
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,880
Have I been too lenient with you?

100
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,540
Don't you think so?

101
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,380
Who is this?

102
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,100
Are you busy right now?

103
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,740
I'd like to come see you later.

104
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,679
Sure.

105
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,220
I'll send you my location.

106
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,960
I've been feeling uneasy lately.

107
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,440
First Du Bin.

108
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,520
Then my Uncle Duan.

109
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,320
You need to tell Brother Jiang to be careful.

110
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm worried

111
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,180
that those gangsters might seek revenge

112
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,360
against you three brothers for the fake medicine incident.

113
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,000
Zi'ang.

114
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,160
How did you

115
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
meet that Su girl?

116
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,840
At that industry summit.

117
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,560
She came over to toast me,

118
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,760
then we chatted a bit,

119
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,720
and surprisingly, we really hit it off.

120
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,960
So that means

121
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,440
you don't know her very well.

122
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,040
That's not true, Dad.

123
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,320
I know Ms. Su very well.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,840
From her character to her abilities,

125
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,570
from her speech to her manners,

126
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
she's simply perfect.

127
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,850
You can't find a single flaw in her.

128
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
If you really had to pick something,

129
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,360
you could only say her taste in men

130
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,930
is terrible.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,800
Ms. Su.

132
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,400
Mr. Xu.

133
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,600
We were just talking about you. What brings you here?

134
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,280
Didn't you mention your mother's birthday is coming up?

135
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,010
I thought I'd come by to see her.

136
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,010
What happened to your face?

137
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,540
Did he bully you again?

138
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
Your friend was wrong.

139
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,800
That person slapped me.

140
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,730
I couldn't even fight back.

141
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,800
Just wait.

142
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,240
Forget it.

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,640
I just want to have a drink for once.

144
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,570
And then go home and get some sleep.

145
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,450
Stay with me for a while.

146
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,200
Mom, look.

147
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,480
I picked this based on my own taste.

148
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,720
I don't know if Mrs. Xu will like it.

149
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,690
With your taste, Ms. Su,

150
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,120
I'm sure I'll love it.

151
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,880
Su,

152
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
why are you being so formal?

153
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,650
It's nothing. It's Mrs. Xu's birthday after all.

154
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,160
Would you like to try it on?

155
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,880
If it doesn't fit,

156
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
I can exchange it for you.

157
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,880
Yes, Mom,

158
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,160
go try it on.

159
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,160
Okay.

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,760
Here.

161
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Thank you, Ms. Su.

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,760
Xiao Su.

163
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,240
I heard from Zi'ang that

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,640
you had a hypoglycemic episode the other day.

165
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,440
How are you feeling? Any better?

166
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,600
Much better.

167
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,360
That day because of this,

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,640
I really put young Mr. Xu through a lot of trouble.

169
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,400
Even the police got involved in the end.

170
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
It made me feel really embarrassed.

171
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,320
It was on that same day.

172
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,500
Mr. Duan had his accident.

173
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,620
You've heard about it, right?

174
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
Yes, I have.

175
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,560
So what's happening now?

176
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,540
Is there any news from the police?

177
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,400
Su Ran.

178
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,480
Could you come up and help me

179
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,600
with the zipper on the back of my dress?

180
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,530
I can't reach it.

181
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,620
Sure thing.

182
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,360
Chairman.

183
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,330
Then I'll...

184
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,810
Go ahead.

185
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,240
Go on.

186
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,700
Why can't I reach you on the phone?

187
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,120
Su Ran.

188
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,680
You know

189
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,080
I'm in this situation today

190
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,980
because you forced me into it.

191
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,840
But

192
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,880
now Xu Chengliang wants to kill me.

193
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,480
So

194
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,130
if you're willing to get me out of here now,

195
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,200
I can help you take him down.

196
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,240
Let's work together now.

197
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,680
Okay?

198
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,560
Mom,

199
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
are you ready?

200
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
We want to see.

201
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,240
Coming.

202
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,920
Don't even think about using it to call the police.

203
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,400
Otherwise, we'll both go down.

204
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,930
Neither of us will survive.

205
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,520
I know.

206
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,760
Don't worry.

207
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,720
Tonight,

208
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,930
I'll wait for your call.

209
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,800
With Ms. Su's taste

210
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,240
and your elegance,

211
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,600
it's perfect.

212
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,500
You two are such a great match.

213
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,860
Right, Dad?

214
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,960
Yes, yes.

215
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,160
I think so too.

216
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,380
We really are compatible.

217
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,290
How should I put this...

218
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,000
My wife and I

219
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
We just don't have feelings for each other anymore.

220
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,060
It's unavoidable.

221
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,720
Let's not talk about me anymore.

222
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,050
Tell me about yourself.

223
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,650
You and your brother

224
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,360
are really close, right?

225
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,840
My family was quite poor.

226
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,210
My mom ran off with someone else when I was very young.

227
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,440
And my dad has been

228
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,810
in prison all this time.

229
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,050
So there are only two of us in my family,

230
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,740
my brother and I depending on each other.

231
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,700
As long as my brother stays alive,

232
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,770
I know why I have to endure this suffering.

233
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,820
Now I can't get the medicine anymore.

234
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,930
I really don't know why I should

235
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
stay here anymore.

236
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,210
Then just leave.

237
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,560
Get out of here.

238
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,060
Go back and be with him.

239
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

240
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,040
That's exactly what I told Chao.

241
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,560
I said,

242
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,120
'Your relative Duan is already dead.

243
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,720
You won't be able to get medicine anymore.

244
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Please let me go.'

245
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,160
And then?

246
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,320
You mean

247
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,960
he was getting medicine from someone named Duan

248
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,120
for your brother?

249
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,240
So now

250
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,930
your brother has no medicine left.

251
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,119
After that, he...

252
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,480
The doctor said at most

253
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,099
six months, probably.

254
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,569
Nothing can be done.

255
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,079
That's just fate.

256
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,560
I heard that Duan was murdered.

257
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,400
In a way,

258
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm actually quite grateful to the killer.

259
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,040
Why?

260
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,520
Because my brother hasn't

261
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,320
contacted me for a long time.

262
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
The last time he called me was

263
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,220
New Year's Eve.

264
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,420
He was in so much pain he could barely open his mouth,

265
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,100
but he still gritted his teeth to tell me he hated me.

266
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,440
He hates me for letting this disease

267
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
torture him for several more years.

268
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,560
He hates me

269
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,410
for sacrificing my life

270
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,160
for his sake.

271
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,500
That's just how my brother is.

272
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,560
He has never asked

273
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,440
me to do anything for him.

274
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,080
Not even once.

275
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,600
So that killer

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,060
has essentially cut off my last hope.

277
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,960
What I want most right now is

278
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,050
to see my brother one last time.

279
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,600
Then do as he said

280
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
and leave this place.

281
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Find a clean place

282
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,040
and then live well for myself.

283
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,660
I really don't know

284
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,420
who else I can talk to about these things.

285
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
I really don't know

286
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,200
who else I can talk to

287
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,970
about these things.

288
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,360
That's great.

289
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,400
Mrs. Xu,

290
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,460
remember this.

291
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,100
Liberation Road, Section 6, Number 178.

292
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,890
That's Duan Zhigang's winery.

293
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,240
There's a safe in the cabinet in the living room.

294
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,600
The password is 3160.

295
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,300
What's inside?

296
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,680
In 1994,

297
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,810
a tape recording of Xu Chengliang and the other two coordinating their testimonies.

298
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,960
Okay.

299
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,640
I got it.

300
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,480
Hey, Lingling.

301
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,930
Alright.

302
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,120
I understand.

303
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,360
Come tell me

304
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,410
what's happening tonight.

305
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,680
Say something.

306
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,720
I'm talking to you.

307
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,680
As long as my brother is alive,

308
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,010
I know why I have to endure this suffering.

309
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
He hates me.

310
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,680
He insists on letting this disease

311
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,480
torture him for a few more years.

312
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,040
He hates me.

313
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,440
For him,

314
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,520
I gave up my own life.

315
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,740
That's just how my brother is.

316
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,880
He has never asked

317
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,640
me to do anything for him.

318
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,280
Not even once.

319
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,440
Boss.

320
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,360
We've searched everywhere around the warehouse.

321
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
Still nothing.

322
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,080
Should we expand the search area?

323
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,060
Captain Li.

324
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,400
In the Qinglong River, 1.5 kilometers away,

325
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,560
we found a black jacket.

326
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,880
There was an axe wrapped inside.

327
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
I measured it briefly.

328
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,520
It matches the murder weapon's size.

329
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,360
Get it to forensics immediately.

330
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,920
Got it.

331
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,000
Hao,

332
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,760
something's off about Zhao Lun.

333
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Where are you now?

334
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Guangming Alley.

335
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,600
Master,

336
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
if Zhao Lun is really the killer,

337
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,200
you must be careful.

338
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,240
Listen to me.

339
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,520
Don't be reckless.

340
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,520
Don't follow too closely.

341
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,050
I'm heading back right now.

342
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,760
Okay.

343
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,400
I'll follow him to the exact location

344
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,060
and let you know immediately.

345
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,000
Xiaojuan.

346
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,200
Why are you looking for me

347
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,530
so late? What happened?

348
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,960
Hey, Xiaohao.

349
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,120
Liuhua Lane, No. 629, Unit 2, Room 202.

350
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,280
Yes.

351
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,200
He's in Yujiang County.

352
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,160
He doesn't know anyone there.

353
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,040
Coming here in the middle of the night...

354
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,120
There must be something wrong.

355
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,080
Hurry up.

356
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,960
No.

357
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,320
Xiaojuan.

358
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,120
Do you like me?

359
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,960
I...

360
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,640
Hello.

361
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,360
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

362
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,320
Your call will be notified to them by text message.

363
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,600
Who are you?

364
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,679
Will you bring it over

365
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,540
or should I come pick it up?

366
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,200
Zhao Lun.

367
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,520
The axe that killed Duan Zhigang

368
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,240
and the one I used to kill Yan Bo

369
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,170
are the same one.

370
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,960
If the police determine

371
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,480
that all these crimes were committed by the same person,

372
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,840
I'll pin everything on him.

373
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,920
Zhao Lun.

374
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,480
Hello.

375
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,440
Lingling,

376
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,140
Yang Jing sold you out.

377
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,660
Xu Chengliang already knows who you are.

378
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,560
Did you get it?

379
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,320
I got one tape.
