1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello. Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,720
Long.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,040
What's wrong?

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,200
It's not that I don't buy from you.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,040
but the price is too high.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,880
I can't sell it.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,480
Then don't sell it.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,480
You're the only one in the communication street.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,520
You're smart.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,160
You're secretly purchasing goods behind my back.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,290
and sold fake goods,

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,570
Who will take the responsibility?

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
My goods

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,080
must be safe.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,840
You have to pass through me first.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,720
The test fee is 8,000 yuan.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,800
How about paying?

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,760
Or I'll destroy it for you.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Don't you think you're bullying me?

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,760
Kid.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,080
This is the rule.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,440
Bullying the market

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,500
Buying and selling

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,040
What kind of rule is this?

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,040
Who are you?

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,060
It doesn't matter who I am.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,039
Put it down.

28
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,300
Take your men with you.

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,960
Otherwise, the news

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,320
is about you.

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,320
Boss.

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,480
The Market Supervision Bureau is secretly investigating.

33
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,400
She might...

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,360
Put them down.

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,480
Let's go.

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,320
Well,

37
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,020
thank you for earlier.

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,160
They bullied you.

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
you just endured it.

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,880
No.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,960
They are nice to me sometimes.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,200
Do you need some electronic products?

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
Can you restore data here?

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Just give it to me.

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
I'll contact you when it's done.

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay.

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,560
I'm leaving.

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,400
Let me see you off.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,200
No need.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,810
Go ahead.

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,440
I'll pick it up tomorrow.

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,600
I'll be quick.

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,120
Du Bin.

54
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,560
Du Bin.

55
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,780
Captain Li.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,680
Captain Li.

57
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,159
Say it.

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,280
According to the evidence,

59
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,760
Yan Bo has been in the room

60
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,040
in the back door.

61
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,690
The murderer was later.

62
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,920
He only stayed for two or three minutes.

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,520
There were no signs of fighting at the scene.

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,640
or lost anything.

65
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,800
The purpose is clear.

66
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,600
It's murder.

67
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,240
What did the report say?

68
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,440
He said he came back to get something.

69
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
I heard someone shouting,

70
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
so I came to check.

71
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,360
I saw the killer leave the scene.

72
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,720
He looks like a man.

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,680
About 18cm.

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
wearing a black raincoat.

75
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,610
He's normal.

76
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,200
but I didn't see his face.

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,960
The murderer

78
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,240
from the south.

79
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,600
I've sent someone to check.

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,080
Jia.

81
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,320
Did you find anything else?

82
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,280
What about the weapon?

83
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,440
It should be an ax.

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,800
There are wounds on the back of the chest and abdomen.

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,440
Although the murderer was decisive,

86
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,760
but he didn't aim at the vital part.

87
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,560
It was random.

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
The ax on the head is the fatal wound.

89
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,740
Like a raw hand.

90
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,280
Boss.

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,960
According to the current situation,

92
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,480
the murderer didn't handle the scene.

93
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,040
It looks like he was in a hurry.

94
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,500
I don't think he's a professional criminal.

95
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,960
Investigate.

96
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,680
Find it out no matter what.

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,440
Yes.

98
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,720
Su Ran.

99
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,570
Did you see the news?

100
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,040
Yan Bo is dead.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,640
I know.

102
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,080
How could he die?

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,090
Could it be Heo Chengliang?

104
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,640
If Heo Chengliang finds him,

105
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,400
we would have...

106
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,960
Zhao Lun.

107
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,920
Listen.

108
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,960
From now on,

109
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,080
all your questions

110
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,200
all your questions.

111
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,840
Do your job.

112
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,280
Understand?

113
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
Do you understand?

114
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,360
Yes.

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,400
I brought you breakfast.

116
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,159
Why is Du

117
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,280
Why didn't he die?

118
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,080
Watch your attitude.

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Ziyang.

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,640
Sit down.

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,040
Look at him.

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,080
Sit down.

124
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,500
In other words,

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,620
the last time you met Du Bin

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,810
when Su Ran arrived at Yujiang.

127
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,480
The last time I talked to him,

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,160
was his den for gambling.

129
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,200
He borrowed money from you, right?

130
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes, Captain Li.

131
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
What about Yan Bo?

132
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,200
When was the last time we met?

133
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,800
It was the day Reporter Su came.

134
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,800
I haven't seen him since.

135
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,039
He has been following Du Bin.

136
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,299
He has no personal relationship with us.

137
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,280
Please take a look.

138
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,919
If there's no problem,

139
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,760
sign here.

140
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,559
Let me remind you.

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,400
Yan Bo's death

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,160
is very related to Du Bin

143
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,490
with Du Bin’s fake drug.

144
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,360
Du Bin will be caught sooner or later.

145
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,620
If you don’t report it,

146
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,360
or help Du Bin hide,

147
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,280
if you help Du Bin hide.

148
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,720
So sign it after you see it.

149
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,940
Captain Li.

150
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,080
About the fake drug case and Yan Bo's death,

151
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
are you sure

152
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,800
Du Bin did it?

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
I didn’t say I’m sure.

154
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,010
I said it's related.

155
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,720
Yes.

156
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,880
You mean related.

157
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,970
I shouldn't have said that.

158
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,160
Shi Su.

159
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,200
Mr. Shi.

160
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,120
Boss.

161
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,760
What do you think is the problem?

162
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm not sure.

163
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,970
It doesn't smell right.

164
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
The bureau has ordered

165
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,640
to solve the case within 15 days.

166
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,440
Let's hurry back

167
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,920
and sort out Yan Bo's social relationship.

168
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,440
OK.

169
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,930
Shi, Hao.

170
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,440
Master.

171
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
Why are you here?

172
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,280
Yan Bo's death

173
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,960
may be done by an acquaintance.

174
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,820
and killed him.

175
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,980
Let's talk inside.

176
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,580
Master,

177
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,300
Why do you think Yan Bo was killed?

178
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,050
Answer me a question first.

179
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,920
Something was lost at the scene.

180
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,880
Or

181
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,800
for a long time?

182
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,920
Master, why am I...

183
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,560
discipline.

184
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,960
I'll tell you then.

185
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,420
Listen.

186
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,180
If there's any lost property,

187
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,520
there will be signs of a long fight.

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

189
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,960
If not,

190
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,200
I'll just say my opinion.

191
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,000
First,

192
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,520
we just served a fake medicine workshop during the day.

193
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
Yan Bo was killed at night.

194
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,320
Judging from the time,

195
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,380
it can't be a coincidence.

196
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,320
Second,

197
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,440
There wasn't much fight.

198
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,680
It means the purpose of the murder is clear.

199
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,640
The murderer

200
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
involved in the fake medicine case.

201
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,530
An acquaintance has a big face.

202
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,720
Of course,

203
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,560
may not

204
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,960
with Yan Bo.

205
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,360
or indirect.

206
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,400
Now we just interact with Yan Bo.

207
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,000
There are a lot of work.

208
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,660
it might be hard to find clues.

209
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
So you mean

210
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,340
when did Du Bin disappear?

211
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
When you gave us Su Ran's recording,

212
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,920
I sent someone to keep an eye on her.

213
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,240
I couldn't find him then.

214
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,720
I guess

215
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,240
he could smell it in advance.

216
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,880
If the police force is limited,

217
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,140
we need to find Du Bin as soon as possible.

218
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,560
He knows everything about the fake drug case.

219
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
Let him open his mouth

220
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,240
and expand our scope of information

221
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,570
to find a breakthrough.

222
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,720
Got it.

223
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,120
I'll report to the police.

224
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,920
and ask the police to cooperate.

225
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,480
Go.

226
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,240
Wait, Master.

227
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,000
You did this to me.

228
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Reflection.

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,520
Yes.

230
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
I also reflected.

231
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,140
Okay, I'm leaving.

232
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,600
Go.

233
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,280
Chairman.

234
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,680
Do you want to go back and rest?

235
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
Why should I?

236
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,800
Du Bin, you bastard!

237
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,080
Where can he hide?

238
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,600
Duan, just say it.

239
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,040
I don't like guessing.

240
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,540
President.

241
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,800
I'm afraid that once he's arrested,

242
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,800
he won't tell anyone

243
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,480
what happened back then?

244
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,530
He will be shot to death.

245
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,960
How dare you!

246
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,160
Chairman.

247
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,160
You have a letter in the mail room.

248
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,960
Sign Du Bin.

249
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Chairman.

250
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,480
I was wrong about the fake medicine.

251
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,040
But I have no choice now.

252
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,000
For our sake,

253
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,760
please give me two million yuan on this card.

254
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,200
If I can get out,

255
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,980
I'll live with this money.

256
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,980
I can't get out.

257
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
I won't say a word

258
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,080
what happened in 1994.

259
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,480
Jiang.

260
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
Those people in Taihe Street

261
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,880
are idle these days.

262
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,680
I've raised him for so many years.

263
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,080
It's time to exercise.

264
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,400
Tell them

265
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,920
to find Du Bin

266
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,400
before the police.

267
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,320
Got it.

268
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,520
Section Chief Yuan has stressed that

269
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,720
many police officers

270
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,770
to our factory for investigation.

271
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
The Security Department and the police

272
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,680
with the police.

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So it must be good.

274
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,760
Cooperate with others.

275
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Like fruits.

276
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,960
tea

277
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,330
must ensure supply.

278
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,520
The most important thing is your attitude.

279
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,480
Understand?

280
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Yes.

281
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,890
Section Chief Yuan, what else do you need?

282
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,560
This investigation

283
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,760
a lot of visitors.

284
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,080
There are a lot of people

285
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,340
in the investigation.

286
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,160
You must stand in your positions

287
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
and maintain our image.

288
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,760
Hello?

289
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:30,840
Mr Duan.

290
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,570
Please do your best to cooperate with the police.

291
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,360
Okay.

292
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,400
Okay.

293
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,480
Mr Su.

294
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,120
You're too polite.

295
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,560
You brought so many things.

296
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,360
No.

297
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,680
I should have come to visit you earlier.

298
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,920
I just came here a while ago.

299
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,080
I did have a lot to do.

300
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,960
I'm going to show the chairman some documents today.

301
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,360
So I came to visit you.

302
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,200
Thank you.

303
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,610
I heard a lot about you from Ziyang.

304
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,570
He said you care a lot about him.

305
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,760
He's young.

306
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120
Please forgive him

307
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,520
please forgive me.

308
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,800
No, no.

309
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,760
Mom.

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,280
Look at you.

311
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
like a child.

312
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,160
Dad is back.

313
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,080
Chairman.

314
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,960
Su, you're here.

315
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,360
Hello, sir.

316
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,560
Boss.

317
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,280
One bowl of seafood noodles.

318
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,160
and a fish.

319
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,080
Take it away. Hurry up.

320
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,520
Okay.

321
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,880
Su.

322
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,359
Do you like it?

323
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,599
Yes.

324
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,890
Fried tea from Yujiang.

325
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,400
It's hot and bitter.

326
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,290
You're not local. You can't get used to it.

327
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,760
You know what?

328
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,240
you really

329
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,960
with this place.

330
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,080
The president and Mr. Xu are here.

331
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,600
I must be fated to be here.

332
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,880
Yang Jing.

333
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,360
Go to my study

334
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,440
in my study.

335
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,320
Ask Su to take it back and try it.

336
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,800
Okay.

337
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,200
You're too kind.

338
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,240
Have you heard

339
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,620
Have you heard?

340
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,520
Yes.

341
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,800
I think

342
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,520
this is a good thing.

343
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
It's a good thing.

344
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,240
It's confirmed that

345
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,200
he did the fake drug.

346
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,720
Then we can

347
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,520
to the public

348
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
and explain to the public

349
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,040
Then you come out and speak.

350
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
to regain everyone's trust in the pharmaceutical factory.

351
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,380
Then the fake medicine

352
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,800
will be settled.

353
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,160
I think Mr Su is right.

354
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,360
Listen to Mr Su.

355
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,240
is really like a spring breeze.

356
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,080
Du Bin

357
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,040
a few days ago.

358
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,400
All clear.

359
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,120
Okay.

360
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,720
Let's write as you wish.

361
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,840
If you remember anything,

362
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,100
we can talk at any time.

363
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:56,960
Okay.

364
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Qin.

365
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,280
Duan.

366
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,280
What are you doing?

367
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,720
Didn't I tell you?

368
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,120
not to run around.

369
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm hungry. I'm going to buy some noodles.

370
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,240
Untie him.

371
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,210
The person who picked you up

372
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,160
Yes.

373
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,320
I'll send you now.

374
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,320
Set sail.

375
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,600
Yan Bo.

376
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,050
Who is it?

377
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,360
Me, Master.

378
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,440
Coming.

379
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,890
Why are you here?

380
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,800
We have a clue.

381
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,220
Let's talk inside.

382
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,620
Write a letter.

383
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,840
What letter?

384
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,860
You wrote to the president

385
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,000
in 1994

386
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
and extort money.

387
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,920
I wrote to blackmail the president.

388
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,280
Do I have a death wish?

389
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,520
It must be Su Ran.

390
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,560
No.

391
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,320
Su Ran wouldn't know what happened in 1994.

392
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,280
She only knows about the fake medicine.

393
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,920
Besides,

394
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,440
only you and I know about the fake medicine.

395
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
Anyway, this person is not simple.

396
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,520
Be careful.

397
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,080
Once I leave,

398
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,200
I can't help much.

399
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,880
You help me

400
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,560
Help me.

401
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,040
We've been investigating for a long time,

402
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,570
but found no trace of Du Bin.

403
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,840
Master.

404
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,200
To be honest,

405
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
I'm just a little worried about him.

406
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,760
If Yan Bo was to silence him,

407
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
would Du Bin be in danger now?

408
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,640
Also,

409
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
the couple who reported to you

410
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,200
with these things?

411
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,400
There's nothing wrong with your direction.

412
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,260
But on the night Yan Bo was killed,

413
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,560
I saw the couple

414
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,360
come out to collect the clothes.

415
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
So far

416
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,320
they have no motive.

417
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,680
Yes.

418
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,930
Besides, they call the police first before killing.

419
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,260
It doesn't make sense.

420
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,360
You saw it.

421
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,720
Me too.

422
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
I have no choice.

423
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,930
You can call the police.

424
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,160
But think about it.

425
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,800
You tied him up.

426
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,600
You drove the boat.

427
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,880
The satellite phone is in the cabin.

428
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,260
I've prepared some money for you.

429
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,920
for the rest of your life.

430
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,840
If it's possible,

431
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
then today,

432
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,480
nothing happened.

433
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,440
We went to sea

434
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,680
to fish.

435
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,640
Nothing.

436
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Bucket and cement

437
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
are ready.

438
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,530
Put him in the bucket

439
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,500
Throw him into the sea.

440
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,240
Good job.

441
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,000
From now on,

442
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
we are friends.

443
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,720
Can you see it?

444
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,000
We found bruises

445
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,280
on Yan Bo's face.

446
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,720
It looks like a punch.

447
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,280
It'll take three to five days

448
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
We're going to the factory.

449
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,200
To the factory?

450
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,360
Yes.

451
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Go to the factory with your wife.

452
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,680
Zhao,

453
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
do you know

454
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,800
on Yan Bo's face?

455
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,760
I think she was hit by Mr. Xu.

456
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
My wife told me

457
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,600
on the day we came,

458
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,730
they seemed to have a conflict.

459
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,320
What conflict?

460
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,840
I don’t know.

461
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,540
Mr. Shi, it’s done.

462
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,480
Look at Mr. Shi.

463
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,800
That’s it.

464
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,240
Okay.

465
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,560
From now on,

466
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,840
I can see

467
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,080
from here, right?

468
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,640
Yes.

469
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,600
Great!

470
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,920
Mr. Shi.

471
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,760
If you can’t figure it out,

472
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,220
you can come to me anytime.

473
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,620
You're really something.

474
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,920
I'll go back if there's nothing else.

475
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,400
Okay.

476
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,920
Let me see you off.

477
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,360
No need.

478
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,820
Mr. Shi.

479
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,440
Go ahead.

480
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,720
Thank you, Zhao.

481
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,650
You're welcome.

482
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,690
You're back.

483
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,380
Did the old man ask you something?

484
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,200
Or Yan Bo?

485
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,080
He has been trying to trick me.

486
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,610
I didn't tell him anything.

487
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,480
Sleep.

488
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,640
Su Ran.

489
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,520
What's wrong?

490
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
After Yan Bo died,

491
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,680
everyone in Yujiang

492
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,210
are watching these things.

493
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,680
Should we

494
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,140
change our original plan?

495
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,570
Isn't it too dangerous?

496
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,360
What we did

497
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,960
are dangerous.

498
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,980
Don't you think so?

499
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,400
I understand.

500
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,360
But I...

501
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,170
I don't understand.

502
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,520
Why do you suddenly

503
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,360
Like what?

504
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,900
There's nothing similar.

505
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,440
I'll tell you

506
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,180
I'll tell you everything.

507
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,480
Duan.

508
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,400
You have good taste.

509
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,120
How is it? Is it pretty?

510
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,480
What's wrong?

511
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,080
Why do you look unhappy?

512
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,680
I think

513
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,320
the woman surnamed Su

514
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,480
is a trouble.

515
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,820
What's wrong with her?

516
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,680
She caught Bin.

517
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,400
that Bin made fake drugs.

518
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,080
That's why Bin became like this.

519
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,360
No wonder I don't like her.

520
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,200
Gosh.

521
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,560
What if Xu

522
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,600
knows that you made fake drugs,

523
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,600
you'll be done for.

524
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,640
I'm doomed.

525
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,410
You look quite excited.

526
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,480
Are you crazy?

527
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,600
I am.

528
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,520
Do you have medicine?

529
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,120
Yes.

530
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,450
Where is your medicine?

531
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,400
Duan Zhigang.

532
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,320
Are you crazy?

533
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,250
Aren't you afraid Xu will find you?

534
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,040
Sometimes,

535
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,480
I really want Xu to see it.

536
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,840
Do you have the guts?

537
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,320
Pervert!

538
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,800
See if I have the guts.

539
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,640
Go.

540
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,880
Mr Duan.

541
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,440
Mr Duan.

542
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,120
Who are you?

543
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm from the Security Department of our factory.

544
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,500
My name is Qin Kaixuan.

545
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,320
Just call me Qin.

546
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,960
It's you.

547
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,160
who saved me.

548
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,920
Mr Duan.

549
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,920
You mean

550
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,880
Du Bin hid it at your place?

551
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,360
Why did you tell me?

552
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,360
You know

553
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,860
our relationship.

554
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,840
I want to persuade him to turn himself in.

555
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,400
It might be easier.

556
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,720
A triumphant return.

557
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,730
Go to Zhankou fishing village.

558
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,850
No matter what it takes,

559
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,020
Find him. Yes, sir.

560
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,160
Take him

561
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,920
to my fishing boat.

562
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
I'll talk to him.

563
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,200
I can't trust anyone else.

564
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,720
After all,

565
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,080
our relationship is different.

566
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,320
I see.

567
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,120
Mr Duan.

568
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,380
Zhankou fishing village.

569
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,090
I'll be right there.

570
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,000
Hello?
