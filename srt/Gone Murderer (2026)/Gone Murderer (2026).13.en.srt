1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Come.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,840
Jiang.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,000
Boss Xu really knows how to spend.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,840
Tell us, Jiang.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Who's the target?

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,480
Sit.

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,360
Remember.

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,700
We need them alive.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,200
The chairman said

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,730
he wants the goods tonight.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,720
Otherwise, you'll be sent to serve Chief Duan.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,320
Tell Boss Xu not to worry.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,500
Chief Duan won't have that pleasure.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,570
I don't like hearing nonsense.

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,940
Get moving.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,120
Take care, Jiang.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,200
Careful, Jiang.

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,160
Du Bin.

20
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,680
Du Bin.

21
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,400
That tape.

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,130
When will the police get it?

23
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,440
Lingling.

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,450
About that tape.

25
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,700
I don't want to give it to the police anymore.

26
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,690
What do you mean?

27
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm just like Zhao Lun.

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,540
I also have a thorn in my heart.

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,079
Xu Chengliang is already so old.

30
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,720
Even if he's executed, what difference would it make?

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,450
He's already enjoyed all the good things in life.

32
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,280
Letting him die like that...

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,079
This thorn in my heart

34
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:29,940
won't come out.

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,900
I'll ask you one last time.

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,700
That plan I told you about,

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,079
you still won't consider it?

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,650
I'll also answer you one last time.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,079
Absolutely not.

40
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,560
Now Mingming has given the tape to the police.

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
Everything could be over.

42
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,720
Why complicate things?

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,800
Fine.

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,760
From now on,

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,680
you're out of the plan.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,260
I'll handle it myself.

47
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,920
Qin Kaixuan.

48
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,170
Do you realize you've completely lost your mind?

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,519
Lingling.

50
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
I understand.

51
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,640
You want me

52
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,220
to leave with clean hands too.

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
But...

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,610
But I can't wash myself clean anymore.

55
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
Take these two boat tickets.

56
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,290
Go to the dock tomorrow.

57
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,050
Call the number on them,

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,200
someone will help you board.

59
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,840
If heaven allows it,

60
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,680
tomorrow,

61
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,290
I'll also go to the dock.

62
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,850
If that's not my fate...

63
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Take my ticket and leave this place.

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
Live a clean life for me.

65
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,200
Qin...

66
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,200
Qin Kaixuan, don't do anything stupid.

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,160
Give me the tape.

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,760
By the way.

69
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,890
What are you going to do about Zhao Lun?

70
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,650
What do you mean?

71
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,960
Nothing. I'm leaving.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,370
Qin Kaixuan, you...

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,530
Don't do anything reckless, okay?

74
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
What happened to your face?

75
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,760
It's nothing.

76
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,600
The police just came looking for me.

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,880
You're

78
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,810
here, Xiaojuan.

79
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,320
Do you trust me?

80
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
If you trust me,

81
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,720
don't ask any questions.

82
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,420
Pack your things quickly now.

83
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,760
I'll come pick you up soon

84
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
and take you away from here.

85
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,760
Later,

86
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,960
I'll explain everything to you.

87
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,640
I trust you.

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,860
Wait for me.

89
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,159
Boss.

90
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,970
Captain Shi.

91
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,280
I did another round of investigation.

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,880
Feng Lan did have a younger brother back then.

93
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,280
But due to quota restrictions,

94
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,040
his household registration was secretly put under someone else's name.

95
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,320
However, Zhao Lun's household registration shows both parents deceased.

96
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,000
We still need some time to investigate the details.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
Also, when Feng Lan died,

98
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
the DNA database hadn't been established yet.

99
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,920
To verify the sibling relationship between her and Zhao Lun,

100
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
we need to find Feng Lan's living relatives

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
and compare them with Zhao Lun.

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,640
Liu.

103
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,320
Check

104
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,580
if there are any around Yujiang area.

105
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,290
Captain Shi.

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
There's another question.

107
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,040
According to your reasoning,

108
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,320
if the murderers in the two cases are different,

109
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,180
and Zhao Lun killed Duan Zhigang,

110
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,180
then who killed Yan Bo?

111
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,960
If Su Ran and Zhao Lun

112
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,540
are both relatives of the Baozitan victims,

113
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,080
then what about Wang Wenqiang's descendants?

114
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
Could they have been involved too?

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,520
You mean

116
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
Su Ran's gang

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,060
might be three people?

118
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
It's quite possible.

119
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,980
Besides Su Ran,

120
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,840
the other two should both be male

121
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,600
and both capable of acting alone.

122
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,200
Then why would they use the same murder weapon?

123
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
What do you think?

124
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,260
Frame someone.

125
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,520
The person who killed Yan Bo

126
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,120
wanted to use the same murder weapon

127
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,080
to frame Zhao Lun for both murders.

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,140
So internally,

129
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,340
there must be disagreements.

130
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Most likely that's what happened.

131
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,200
Then who

132
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,640
could this person be?

133
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,680
Let's just talk about Duan Zhigang's case.

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,200
Su Ran and Zhao Lun have motive

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,330
but no opportunity.

136
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,640
There's someone who has opportunity

137
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,240
but no motive or timeframe.

138
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Qin Kaixuan.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,980
All three of them may be involved in identity fraud.

140
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Three victims,

141
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,450
three descendants,

142
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
three enemies.

143
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,960
This should be the full picture of the case.

144
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,880
Mr. Shi.

145
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,720
Did you see those three children back then?

146
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,799
I've seen Tang Lingling.

147
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,360
But Su Ran's face

148
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,409
looks like she's had work done.

149
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,210
Wang Wenqiang's eldest son

150
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,760
was attending a boarding school in the city at that time

151
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,960
and rarely came back.

152
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
Feng Lan doesn't have a brother on her household registration.

153
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
When I visited the factory workers,

154
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,610
nobody ever mentioned him.

155
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,040
Boss.

156
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
The search area is too wide now.

157
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,400
We have limited manpower.

158
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
Evidence collection takes time.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,960
Everything now is based on

160
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,850
Su Ran being Tang Lingling.

161
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,650
If this foundation collapses,

162
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,810
we'll be completely off track.

163
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,600
Yeah.

164
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,960
The bureau gave us 15 days to solve the case.

165
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,440
If we make a mistake...

166
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,900
Never mind.

167
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,080
I'll go to the municipal forensics center first

168
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,840
and push them to get me the report.

169
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,920
Once we get a match,

170
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll immediately

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,330
arrest all three of them

172
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,080
for suspected identity forgery.

173
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,560
Okay.

174
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
I'll go home and keep a close eye on Su Ran.

175
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,410
Song.

176
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,960
You go with Chief Shi.

177
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,820
Work together.

178
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
Don't let him be rash.

179
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,280
If you use that word again,

180
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,740
I'll knock your teeth out.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,440
Liu.

182
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,410
I'm leaving things here to you.

183
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,200
Trace the suspect's clothing and the murder weapon.

184
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,160
Zhao Lun's movements on the night of the incident.

185
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,680
Also,

186
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,520
the police at these three people's registered residences

187
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,680
need to cooperate with us to verify their identities as soon as possible.

188
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,280
Have nearby prisons investigate

189
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,080
inmates who've forged identities for others.

190
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,160
See if there's a breakthrough.

191
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,760
Got it.

192
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,690
Move out.

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
Where exactly is the agreement?

194
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,080
Juan.

195
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,560
What are you looking for?

196
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Nothing.

197
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
Just tidying up the cabinet.

198
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:47,960
Go ahead.

199
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,940
Wash my hair when you're done.

200
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,200
Shi.

201
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,840
I need to use the bathroom.

202
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,200
Okay.

203
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
Call me if you need anything.

204
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,320
Go ahead.

205
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,080
Where are you planning to go?

206
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,040
Anywhere is fine.

207
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,500
As long as I can leave here.

208
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,170
How are you planning to get out?

209
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,160
I have my plan.

210
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,320
Switch to a backpack.

211
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,320
The suitcase is too obvious.

212
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,160
Suran.

213
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,160
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
Don't say anything more.

215
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,210
Since you've decided to leave,

216
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,620
take care of yourself.

217
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,940
These are two safety amulets I got

218
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,540
before coming to Yujiang.

219
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,860
I never had the chance to give them to you.

220
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,520
Thank you.

221
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
During this time,

222
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,200
I've learned a lot from Xiaojuan.

223
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,820
I've figured out many things.

224
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,340
Actually, our family members

225
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
never asked us

226
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,440
to do anything for them.

227
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
What they hope for

228
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,680
is that we live well.

229
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,440
Since we

230
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,480
promised to stay together till the end,

231
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,810
we should keep our word.

232
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
But now I really can't go on anymore.

233
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,560
I don't want to continue.

234
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,560
Thank you.

235
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,170
Don't worry.

236
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
I promise in the future I'll-

237
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,200
Wait a minute.

238
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,520
It's over. It's over. It's over.

239
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,120
It's over.

240
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,450
What's wrong, Song?

241
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,840
What?

242
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,480
Boss.

243
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,640
Master.

244
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,720
Let's not talk about your recklessness last time.

245
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Why are you peeping again this time?

246
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,760
Me? Peeping?

247
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,780
I have a clear conscience.

248
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,680
Peeping.

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,400
Let's forget about that.

250
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,280
Why were you peeking through someone's window?

251
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,880
Don't you know why I was peeping through her window?

252
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,119
Didn't I tell you

253
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,599
not to be reckless?

254
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,359
When nothing has been confirmed yet,

255
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,280
isn't this acting on your own?

256
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,920
And you call yourself a veteran detective.

257
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,079
Have you forgotten the most basic discipline?

258
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,280
Do you realize

259
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,640
you're already walking on the edge of the law?

260
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm reckless?

261
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm acting on my own?

262
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,580
I'm already walking a fine line with the law.

263
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,760
Fine.

264
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
Then I'll assault an officer today too.

265
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,280
Chief Shi! Chief Shi! Chief Shi!

266
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,240
Let him hit me.

267
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,240
If beating me to death solves the case, I'll take it.

268
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,640
Boss.

269
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,170
Alright.

270
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,760
You've got guts, kid.

271
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,360
Chief Shi! Chief Shi!

272
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,000
Sit down.

273
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,160
Don't be angry.

274
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,040
Everything now

275
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,020
is stuck on that identification report.

276
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,160
We can't make progress on anything else.

277
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,320
You want me to just sit here waiting?

278
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,800
I can't wait anymore.

279
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,400
I just want to find more clues.

280
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,160
Am I wrong?

281
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,240
Am I wrong?

282
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,560
And you.

283
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,760
Didn't you go to get the results?

284
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,960
Are they ready?

285
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,560
What about making an arrest?

286
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,800
According to the identification report,

287
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,260
our assumption was wrong.

288
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,320
She has no blood relation to Song Yuzhen.

289
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,960
No.

290
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,410
Impossible.

291
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Her sample must have been switched,

292
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,120
or the city's testing equipment is faulty.

293
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,680
Something must have gone wrong somewhere.

294
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,080
Right?

295
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,760
Three different institutions got the same results,

296
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,400
including one that's the city's top authority.

297
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Then let's take it to the provincial level.

298
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,020
They're all wrong.

299
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,680
All wrong.

300
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,320
Sir.

301
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,160
It's okay.

302
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,480
We'll start over.

303
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,080
Listen to me.

304
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,060
Since they've filed a report,

305
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,880
we should first get their understanding.

306
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,760
Then we'll go back to the station

307
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,020
and carefully review everything again.

308
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,250
With you on the case,

309
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,490
we'll definitely solve it.

310
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,280
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,040
It's okay, Mr. Shi.

312
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,970
I've been thinking.

313
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,760
You probably didn't mean to do it.

314
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,840
Don't say that.

315
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,200
I did it on purpose.

316
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,600
I was peeping.

317
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,020
You should apologize.

318
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,690
What do you mean by that?

319
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,200
Nothing.

320
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,160
It's just an apology.

321
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,530
I did apologize.

322
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,320
But I'm apologizing to all those unsolved cases

323
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,280
over the years.

324
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,080
I'm apologizing to the deceased

325
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,000
who never got to know the truth.

326
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm also apologizing to the families

327
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,320
who still believe in the law,

328
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,200
in justice and fairness,

329
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,800
the families of the victims.

330
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,920
I also need to apologize to this uniform

331
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,080
I've worn for forty years.

332
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,060
Take your pick.

333
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,480
See which apology

334
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,600
you can accept.

335
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,320
Please leave.

336
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,330
Song'er.

337
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,930
Zhao Lun isn't home.

338
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
He left after giving his statement.

339
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,500
Master.

340
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,160
Let's go.

341
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,880
We'll discuss this more back at the station.

342
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,410
Xiao Hao.

343
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,640
I

344
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,800
want to resign.

345
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,120
Master.

346
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,320
Stop joking around.

347
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm not joking this time.

348
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,560
If you have any questions,

349
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,820
you can still come to me for information.

350
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,360
I just won't

351
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,130
cause you any more trouble.

352
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,330
Look, you asked me to come back,

353
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,320
and it's been nothing but chaos.

354
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
During this time,

355
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,320
I've led everyone astray.

356
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,520
Chief Shi.

358
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,440
Chief Shi.

359
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
Sorry to bother you.

360
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,880
Do you have a moment, Chief Shi?

361
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,680
What's wrong, Xiao Fan?

362
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,340
My mom's cat is missing again.

363
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,600
She insisted I come find you.

364
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,520
She doesn't trust anyone else.

365
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,040
So, you see.

366
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,160
She forgot to close the door again, didn't she?

367
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes.

368
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,680
Let's go find it quickly.

369
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,520
I know where that cat goes.

370
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,200
Liu'er.

371
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,040
Okay.

372
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,100
I'll be right back.

373
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,680
I added another clause to our agreement.

374
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,160
Take it out of my bag later

375
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,880
and sign it.

376
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,160
You got the medicine at employee price before.

377
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,680
But if you break the contract, you have to pay me back at full price.

378
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,810
Fair enough, right?

379
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,680
How much do I need to pay?

380
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,480
Not much.

381
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,240
Who is it? Knocking after we're closed.

382
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,840
It's my customer.

383
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,970
Tell him to get lost.

384
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,330
Chao is here too.

385
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,720
These are the messages just sent from Songling.

386
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,280
They've all been verified.

387
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,240
Liu.

388
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,680
What's going on?

389
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,740
We hit the jackpot.

390
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,400
We used that recovered piece of clothing

391
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,440
as our search target.

392
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,720
We checked surveillance footage all day

393
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,200
and half an hour before Duan Zhigang's death,

394
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
at the Hailin intersection one kilometer from the warehouse,

395
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,800
we found a suspicious person.

396
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,730
He was wearing that same clothing.

397
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,440
Based on height, build, and gait analysis,

398
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,400
along with this only side-view photo,

399
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,120
it's highly consistent with Zhao Lun.

400
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,080
And Songling police just sent me a message.

401
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,320
They've been verifying Zhao Lun's identity these past few days.

402
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,600
Now they've confirmed there are definitely issues.

403
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
We also contacted

404
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
an inmate at Hongtai Prison who was jailed

405
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
for employing child labor.

406
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,200
In '94, he helped a minor

407
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,360
forge an identity.

408
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,520
After changing his name,

409
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,780
he became Qin Kaixuan.

410
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,580
We've also traced the murder weapon.

411
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
It was purchased by Qin Kaixuan.

412
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,240
Chief.

413
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,240
It looks like

414
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,320
Officer Shi was right all along.

415
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,840
What about Su Ran's DNA?

416
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,840
Tell me.

417
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,800
Got it.

418
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,280
Chief.

419
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,920
Ma Chao from Taihe Street just called the police.

420
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,280
He says someone beat him up

421
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,480
and stole his motorcycle,

422
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,200
taking one of his female employees.

423
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,920
Zhao Lun.

424
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,250
Su Ran is already under travel restrictions.

425
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,160
Now quickly

426
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,000
locate Zhao Lun and Qin Kaixuan.

427
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Split up and go after them. Move out.

428
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,560
Got it.

429
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,560
I understand.

430
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,920
What's the update?

431
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,640
The command center has locked their location.

432
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,480
Lu Xiaojuan and Zhao Lun are heading east

433
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,840
toward Wanghai Town.

434
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,640
Step on it.

435
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Xiaojuan.

436
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,610
Are you sure?

437
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,200
Okay, got it.

438
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,480
What is it?

439
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,080
Qin Kaixuan's car is heading in that direction too.

440
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,640
Hurry up.

441
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Hurry, Juan.

442
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,120
Who is that?

443
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,800
Don't ask.

444
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,960
Run! Quick!

445
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,520
Xiaojuan!

446
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,480
Zhao Lun!

447
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Useless.

448
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,120
Just like 15 years ago.

449
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,560
Zhao Lun!

450
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,160
Notify the team.

451
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,090
Request backup.

452
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,080
Follow me.

453
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,530
This way. Quick!

454
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,840
Lingling doesn't want me to kill innocent people.

455
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,880
Tell me,

456
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,120
are you innocent?

457
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
But she

458
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,560
is innocent.

459
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,640
No one is innocent.

460
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,100
Don't move!

461
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,720
Song, stay here and check.

462
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,380
The rest of you, go after them.

463
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,160
Stop!

464
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,280
Zhao Lun!

465
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,480
Stop!

466
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,280
Don't run!

467
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,570
Hands on your head and get down!

468
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,480
Get down!

469
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,120
Down!

470
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,700
Where is he?

471
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,280
He took my bike and ran.

472
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,140
Do you know him?

473
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:52,960
No.

474
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,020
Which way did he go?

475
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,610
That way.

476
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,480
Be more specific.

477
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,140
Over there.

478
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,760
Shunyi Road intersection.

479
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,290
Bring the car over quickly.

480
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,280
Lingling.

481
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,680
If the police ask about Zhao Lun,

482
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,960
you can make up whatever story you want.

483
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,890
What do you mean?

484
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,600
The police and Xu Chengliang

485
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,760
are searching for me everywhere.

486
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,960
I have nowhere to run.

487
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
But this revenge,

488
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,220
I will definitely take it.

489
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,480
Hurry up.

490
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,440
Qin!

491
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,170
Qin Kaixuan!

492
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,120
Hello?

493
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,720
Hello?

494
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,880
Qin Kaixuan!

495
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,320
Qin!

496
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,760
Yes.

497
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,890
A black motorcycle,

498
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,280
license plate 05316,

499
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,220
heading west on Wanghai Road.

500
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,540
Captain Li.

501
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,400
Pull over.

502
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,000
It's this one.

503
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,719
Hao.

504
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,800
Master.

505
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,920
Both Zhao Lun and Qin Kaixuan's identities are suspicious.

506
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,560
Just now,

507
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,570
Qin Kaixuan murdered Zhao Lun.

508
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,179
We're searching the area.

509
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,239
What about Su Ran?

510
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,560
Nothing yet.

511
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:49,800
Got it.

512
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,560
Go catch them.

513
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,360
I'll keep an eye on Su Ran.

514
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,840
Chairman Xu Chengliang.

515
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,360
Hello?

516
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,240
Who's this?

517
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,760
Mom.

518
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,320
It's me.

519
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,600
Who are you?

520
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,480
Can you come out of the hospital?

521
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,760
Let's meet.

522
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,760
I was in a car accident recently.

523
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,960
I can't remember people.

524
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,880
Who are you exactly?

525
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,720
My father is Tang Haojun.

526
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,480

527
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,960

528
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,680

and Uncle Wang's son

530
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,330
could die at Xu Chengliang's hands at any moment.

531
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,240
So now

532
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,520
I want to see you one last time.

533
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,080
Is that okay?

534
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,200
I don't know you.

535
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,760
