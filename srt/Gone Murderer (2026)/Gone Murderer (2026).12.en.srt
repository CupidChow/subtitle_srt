00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,880
Sir.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,880
I did get married.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,580
But the two of us

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,320
are not what you think.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
I did take the initiative.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,040
But I don't think we did anything wrong.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Sir.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,040
Check if there's anything wrong. I'll check it out. Okay.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,280
I have a clear conscience.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,610
But if you don't find out I'm a prostitute,

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,850
I have to ask that man

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,080
apologize to us.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,940
Okay. Okay.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,000
No money.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,760
What's wrong? What's wrong?

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,000
It's me. It's me. It's me.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,280
It’s not my fault.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,760
I didn’t know Zhao Lun would…

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,480
I told you not to act recklessly.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
But you just kicked the door.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,320
I know you want to prevent crimes,

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,800
but you can't do that.

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,280
Yes.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,920
Technically speaking,

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,080
Zhao Lun is suspicious,

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,480
but he didn’t commit a crime.

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,840
Look at you.

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,970
How is it not a crime?

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,240
20 years ago, he was a gangster.

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,980
What's the point, master?

32
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,560
I invited you to be my consultant.

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,960
You made such a big mistake for me.

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,520
What should I say to my leader?

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,000
You should report and report.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll carry the punishment.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,960
How can you carry it?

38
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,840
You're retired. How can you carry it?

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,370
Deduct medical insurance.

40
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,680
Go in and

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,880
and apologize to him.

42
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,360
and try to reconcile.

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,280
No.

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
If you don't go, I'll remove it for you.

45
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,759
It's not that I found you.

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,890
Are you going or not?

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,000
No.

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,560
I'll never go.

49
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,440
I was wrong.

51
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,360
I...

52
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
too reckless.

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,479
If there's nothing wrong,

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,140
this letter of apology...

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Juan'er.

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
How about...

57
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,640
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,200
Drive.

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,760
The crime scene.

60
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,280
Duan Zhigang. Du Bin.

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,680
Du Bin.

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,040
Listen.

63
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,920
Bin got the beer

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,640
from home.

65
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,600
Two boxes of 24 bottles.

66
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,520
6:40.

67
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,240
I drove to pick Duan up.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,040
to Mr. Yang's house.

69
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,000
Got it?

70
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,880
Yes, brother.

71
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
6:40.

72
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,840
Yes.

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, I...

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,530
I brought two boxes of beer.

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,080
I went out at 6:40.

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,120
You left at 6:30.

77
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,050
You'll be shot to death.

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,730
Can you be more careful?

79
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,920
Yes.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,400
How about

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,520
do it again?

82
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,280
Again.

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,920
This old man

84
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,960
He's usually a wimp.

85
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,159
You're hiding so well.

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,840
Chairman.

87
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
One more thing.

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,080
Go ahead.

89
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
That man

90
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,120
took a tape.

91
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,730
I couldn't catch up.

92
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,010
I've been holding it all night.

93
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,770
Say what you want to say.

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,560
Zhao Lun.

95
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,000
After this,

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,760
I won't care what you want to do.

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,840
But now,

98
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,920
it took us so long to come back to Yujiang.

99
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,640
Do you remember what we were doing?

100
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,280
Su Ran.

101
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,260
You have no right to criticize me.

102
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,880
You said

103
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,280
we came back to use legal means

104
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,600
to kill each other

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
and give our family an explanation.

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,840
We won't kill anyone.

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,200
We can get away safely in the end.

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,480
Is this the promise you gave me?

109
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,600
I...

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,400
I trust you so much.

111
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
I treated you as my family.

112
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,840
And you?

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
What do you take me for?

114
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,940
But it doesn't matter.

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,060
Since I'm an outsider,

116
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,500
You guys continue.

117
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm taking Juan away from here.

118
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,890
What do you mean?

119
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,240
We've been planning for so long.

120
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,650
What about your sister?

121
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,200
You can't take revenge on your sister.

122
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,840
Duan Zhigang is dead.

123
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,840
Even if

124
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,320
is over.

125
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
What do you mean by "sister"?

126
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,800
Hello?

127
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,159
Linlin!

128
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,760
I have something to tell you.

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,740
I'll wait for you in Building 15, District 3.

130
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,120
Mr Su.

131
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,400
Mr Jiang.

132
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
Is your wife home?

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes.

134
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,200
Honey.

135
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,980
If it's convenient for you and your wife,

136
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,159
the chairman would like to invite you to dinner.

137
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,800
It's not convenient for us today.

138
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,880
Mr Su.

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,600
There's always time for a meal.

140
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,720
What else do you need?

141
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,040
I...

142
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,840
I'm not going.

143
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm not feeling well.

144
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,120
Are you sure?

145
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,250
I'm much better.

146
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,680
Mr Su.

147
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll go get changed.

148
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,160
Remember all the details.

149
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,600
As long as you bite them to death,

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,320
No one can find us.

151
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,960
Hello?

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,330
What are you doing here?

153
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,800
Here.

154
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,600
Miss.

155
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,280
About yesterday,

156
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,040
I was wrong.

157
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,160
Sorry.

158
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
I'll put some fruits here.

159
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,680
No need.

160
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,960
I'll feel even more guilty if you don't accept it.

161
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,400
I said no.

162
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,720
Take it back.

163
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,520
Actually,

164
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,970
I'm here to wash my hair.

165
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,240
Have a seat.

166
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,880
Miss.

167
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,880
I'm not being nice.

168
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Zhao and you...

169
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
What happened between you two

170
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,320
between you two.

171
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,560
Sir.

172
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,880
Don't worry about us.

173
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,480
about us.

174
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,240
That's not your business.

175
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,290
Where do you think your wife is?

176
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,960
Her marriage is protected by the law.

177
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,760
Just say it.

178
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,400
Zhao is cheating.

179
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,040
You're a third party.

180
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,700
and ruin someone's marriage.

181
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,560
Look at you two.

182
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,160
Isn't it immoral?

183
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,520
Who are you calling immoral?

184
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
They have no feelings for each other.

185
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,660
They had no choice but to be together.

186
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,920
He told you that?

187
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,700
Are you here to wash your hair?

188
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,800
Master.

189
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,450
Why are you here?

190
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,170
I'm washing my hair.

191
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,160
Please.

192
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,120
Chairman.

193
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,040
He's here.

194
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
Su.

195
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,320
Have a seat.

196
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,280
What’s your wife’s name?

197
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,240
Zhao Lun.

198
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Zhao.

199
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,960
Okay.

200
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,800
Okay.

201
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,060
Do you know each other?

202
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,560
Because Ma Chao bullied you,

203
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,760
Zhao Lun helped you.

204
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,480
You don’t know Zhao Lun’s personal situation.

205
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,360
You were together.

206
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,360
Boss.

207
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,320
It's done.

208
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,680
In the next two days,

209
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,240
ask the police station to talk to Ma Chao.

210
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Give him a lesson.

211
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,680
He needs to be punished again.

212
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,280
Got it.

213
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,320
Sir.

214
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,040
I'll take back

215
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,680
the surveillance video of your shop.

216
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,340
If you think of anything else,

217
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,770
feel free to contact us.

218
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,600
Miss.

219
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
I have something to tell you.

220
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,640
I haven't finished washing my hair.

221
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,080
Keep an eye on yourself.

222
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,880
Don't get yourself involved.

223
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Chairman Xu.

224
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,920
Why did you

225
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,640
What brings you here?

226
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,760
I heard

227
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
you want to kill me.

228
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,920
But I don't understand.

229
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,760
You and I have no grudges.

230
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,240
Why did you do that?

231
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,200
Tell me.

232
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,400
Here.

233
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,520
Read it.

234
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,880
Read it.

235
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,200
Or you?

236
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,240
Wait.

237
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,500
Take off your sunglasses.

238
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,920
Stand up

239
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
That's how you respect your customers.

240
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,400
In 1994,

241
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:42,160
three bodies were found at the leopard beach of Yujiang Police.

242
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,900
After investigation,

243
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,860
It's from Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory.

244
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,600
of Yujiang Pharmaceutical Factory.

245
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,160
Tang...

246
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,560
Tang Haojun.

247
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,160
Who is she?

248
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
Tang Haojun's daughter.

249
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,680
Tang Lingling.

250
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,440
No wonder I always say we're old friends at first sight.

251
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,320
In a blink of an eye,

252
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,360
you've grown

253
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,680
so pretty.

254
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,120
Sexy.

255
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,520
and scheming woman.

256
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,720
I've been afraid of neglecting you these days.

257
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,280
I didn't expect

258
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,080
You've done me wrong.

259
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,680
See?

260
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,280
Cut the crap.

261
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,400
I know you have an accomplice.

262
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,200
stole a tape last night.

263
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,320
Who is he?

264
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,480
I don't know.

265
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,940
What about you?

266
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,760
I...

267
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,760
I don't know.

268
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,760
It's none of your business.

269
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,040
Take her away.

270
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,960
Yes.

271
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,120
Do you know the new reporter in our factory?

272
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Her husband broke his shoes yesterday

273
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,760
and was arrested by the police.

274
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
In our building.

275
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,120
That man looks gentle.

276
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,440
is not a good person.

277
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,600
That woman is not simple.

278
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,240
She's flirting every day.

279
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,010
What are you talking about?

280
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,880
Mr. Xu.

281
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,760
Don't talk nonsense.

282
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,600
Good job.

283
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,060
Get lost if you can't do it.

284
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,120
Yes.

285
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,080
Guys.

286
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,600
There are two bullets in this gun.

287
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,880
But today,

288
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,400
four people will die today.

289
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,320
Except you two,

290
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,480
I still remember

291
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,880
your lover

292
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,000
named Lu Xiaojuan.

293
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,040
The other one

294
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,040
is my old friend.

295
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,480
Her name is Song Yuzhen.

296
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,260
Xu Chengliang.

297
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,820
You will die a horrible death.

298
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,080
Wait.

299
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
Don't be rude to women.

300
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,560
Who is he?

301
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,320
Tell me.

302
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,880
victory.

303
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,730
What about the tape?

304
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
Do you have it

305
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
or his?

306
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,040
He has it.

307
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,080
He has it.

308
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,920
Today,

309
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,680
see anyone else today.

310
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,240
He must have it.

311
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
Chairman.

312
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,200
Please let us go.

313
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,960
Please!

314
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,640
Please let us go.

315
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,320
Let this triumphant bring the tape here.

316
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Heo Chengliang, in your dreams!

317
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,940
Do it properly.

318
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,720
Mr Su.

319
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,360
Mr Xu.

320
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,480
Mr Su.

321
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,480
Why are you...

322
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,640
Mr Su.

323
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,000
Mr Su.

324
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,160
Did he hit you?

325
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,680
Zhao.

326
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,120
How dare you hit Mr Su?

327
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
Do you want to die?

328
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,500
I’ll take you to the hospital.

329
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,040
Zhao Lun.

330
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,880
Aren’t you leaving?

331
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,770
Let's go.

332
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,050
Leave him alone.

333
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,760
Chairman.

334
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,600
Do you need some people

335
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,220
They can't get out of Yujiang.

336
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,880
The tape is more important.

337
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,920
We must find the triumphant.

338
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,500
If anything goes wrong this time,

339
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,800
go and serve Duan.

340
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,200
Yes.

341
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,560
Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu.

342
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,560
Lend me your car.

343
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,920
I can ask Zhao Lun to go to the hospital with me.

344
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,800
No, Mr Su.

345
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,080
He's fighting you.

346
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
After all,

347
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,360
it's between us.

348
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,520
And the chairman solved it just now.

349
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,880
We're already embarrassing enough.

350
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,680
Don't worry.

351
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,780
I can handle it myself.

352
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,320
Zhao Lun.

353
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,560
Drive.

354
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
Drive.

355
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,800
Okay, Mr Su.

356
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,610
If anything happens again,

357
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,960
call me.

358
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,600
Okay.

359
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Okay, got it.

360
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,130
Let's eat first.

361
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,890
How is it?

362
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,840
Su Ran and Zhao Lun came out from Gosan Club.

363
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,040
Heo Chengliang is fine too.

364
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,600
I asked my men to eat first.

365
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,880
Go back and check all the conversations

366
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,200
of Zhao Lun and Lu Xiaojuan

367
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,280
Take it out and listen to it.

368
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,320
See if there are any goods.

369
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,880
Got it.

370
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,850
Officer Li, Shi.

371
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,000
Liu.

372
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,840
Is the DNA result out?

373
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,920
It's been rushing.

374
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,120
It's probably today.

375
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,250
What about the axe and clothes?

376
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,120
The size of the weapon matches.

377
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,480
The fiber found at the scene

378
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,800
is the same as that one.

379
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,800
I'm sure now.

380
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,240
the clothes and the axe

381
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,560
were abandoned by the murderer who killed Duan Zhigang.

382
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,400
But we didn't get any DNA and fingerprints.

383
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
It was soaked in the river for a long time.

384
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
I've sent someone to check

385
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
the purchase channel of the weapon.

386
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,380
Master.

387
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,800
Did you find anything

388
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
from Lu Xiaojuan?

389
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,160
There must be something wrong with their relationship.

390
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I suspect

391
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,280
they're trying to get in touch during their revenge.

392
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,740
and pretend to be a couple.

393
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,680
I thought about this direction.

394
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,800
But I have a question.

395
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,000
I didn't push it down.

396
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,840
Tell me.

397
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,320
why

398
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,040
Zhao Lun?

399
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,120
Look.

400
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,520
He doesn't have strong skills

401
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
and he has no guts.

402
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,450
He's just so-so.

403
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,480
He has no connections in Yujiang.

404
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,840
You said he was loyal.

405
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,770
He cheated on me.

406
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,600
Such an important partner.

407
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,520
Why did Su Ran choose such a person?

408
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,580
He needs some necessary conditions.

409
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,240
Need? Yes.

410
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,760
Hello?

411
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,600
Heo Sung-liang knows you.

412
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,040
Did you give the tape to the police?

413
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,840
What’s wrong?

414
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,440
Zhao Lun sold me.

415
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,920
We don’t have time.

416
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,120
Give it to the police.

417
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,240
Su Ran.

418
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,880
I just...

419
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,800
Do you know why I'm here?

420
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
15 years ago,

421
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,880
My dad...

422
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,320
Your sister?

423
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,640
They...

424
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,440
They fell here.

425
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,040
They won’t rest in peace until today.

426
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,120
Zhao Lun.

427
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,480
You can betray us.

428
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,520
It doesn't matter.

429
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,600
But have you thought about them?

430
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,640
Have you thought about your sister?

431
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
I know you're scared.

432
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,000
You can lie to him.

433
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,160
Just make up a name.

434
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,200
Why did you say it out loud?

435
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,160
I really didn't think that much.

436
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,120
He...

437
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,960
He will shoot.

438
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,840
I don't want to die.

439
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,720
Shi.

440
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,280
Captain Li.

441
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
Something happened.

442
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,520
Sister.

443
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,480
Sister

444
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,400
Louder!

445
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm back.

446
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,850
Check it out.

447
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,040
Victory!

448
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,680
Victory!

449
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,280
Qin Kaihui!

450
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,120
Qin Kaihui!

451
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,720
Qin Kaihui, stop it.

452
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,280
Qin Kaihui.

453
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,160
Boss.

454
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,600
I checked again.

455
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,650
Zhao Lun doesn’t have a sister.

456
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,540
Then why did he have a sister in his dream?

457
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,960
Keep investigating.

458
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,080
I told you

459
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,400
we can do it together.

460
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
But you didn't listen.

461
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,400
I should have come back alone.

462
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,160
I didn't have to commit a crime.

463
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,720
But now,

464
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,440
A crazy man.

465
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,520
A piece of trash.

466
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,320
Yes.

467
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,680
I'm crazy.

468
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,600
But I know why I'm back.

469
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,450
It doesn't matter if he betrays me.

470
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,560
What if he betrays you one day?

471
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,880
I'll kill you.

472
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,240
Qin Kaihui!

473
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,600
Qin Kaihui!

474
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,080
Are you crazy?

475
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,960
You're right.

476
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,920
I'm a loser.

477
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,480
I'm sorry.

478
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,800
and my sister.

479
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,800
Su Ran.

480
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,840
I knew it.

481
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,560
15 years ago. I knew it.

482
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,880
Do you know

483
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,240
why I have to let Duan Zhigang die?

484
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,080
Because I saw it.

485
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,680
What do you mean?

486
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,120
That day,

487
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,200
A typhoon is coming.

488
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
My sister and I took a shortcut home.

489
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,160
and ran into Heo Chengliang.

490
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,080
They just killed someone.

491
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,880
They're transporting the body.

492
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,640
I was so scared that I shouted.

493
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,520
They found me.

494
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,260
Keep quiet.

495
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,130
Don't make a sound no matter what happens.

496
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,610
Wait for me to come back.

497
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,920
Do you hear me?

498
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,560
Yes.

499
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,640
Mr Duan.

500
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,290
Where are you going?

501
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,080
No, Director.

502
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,400
Isn't it going to rain?

503
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,480
Why are you running?

504
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,570
Why didn't you call the police?

505
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm scared.

506
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,500
What are you afraid of?

507
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,920
I'm afraid they'll take revenge on you.

508
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,050
I was afraid the police would ask me

509
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,719
what I was doing when my sister was killed.

510
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,000
I didn't do anything.

511
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,760
I hid in the woods

512
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,960
and saw my sister

513
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,880
One.

514
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,280
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

515
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,160
Three.

516
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,560
I was hit to death.

517
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,080
I didn't dare to say a word.

518
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,810
All these years,

519
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,040
I tried my best to forget that night.

520
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,080
I told myself

521
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,960
I was too young.

522
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,320
If I had grown a little longer,

523
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,650
I would have stood up to protect my sister.

524
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,560
This thorn has been in my heart for 15 years.

525
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,320
15 years.

526
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,160
I thought Duan Zhigang was dead.

527
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,480
I could pull out the thorn.

528
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,200
I'll be able to kill

529
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,680
[15 years ago.]

530
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,640
Duan Zhigang was killed by me.

531
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,960
But that coward

532
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,690
is still alive and well.

533
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,840
He's always in my dream

534
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,120
in my dream every day.

535
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,090
I can't kill him.

536
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
I can never kill him.

537
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,000
15 years.

538
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,400
If you were brave for 15 years,

539
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,280
if you were brave,

540
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,010
we wouldn't be like this today.

541
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,760
You hurt all of us.

542
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,780
I can atone for my sins.

543
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,720
Call the police.

544
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,120
I'll call the police now.

545
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,960
You killed him.

546
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,020
What's the use of calling the police?

547
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,650
If you want to atone,

548
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,120
Then die!

549
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,800
If you jump from here,

550
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,980
you'll atone for your sin.

551
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,960
Die!

552
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,240
I want to live.

553
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,400
I don't want to die.

554
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,820
I don't want to die.

555
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,080
Let me help you.

556
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,080
Su Ran.

557
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,640
I beg you.

558
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,280
I beg you.

559
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,800
Su Ran.

560
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Get lost!

561
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,160
Duan Zhigang.

562
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,080
Zhao Lun.

563
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,680
They don’t love each other.

564
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,740
They had no choice but to be together.

565
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,400
She also thinks that the death of Tang Haojun

566
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,280
was related to the three of them.

567
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,040
So she changed her name

568
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,720
and came back to investigate.

569
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,360
She married Zhao Lun in Songryeong a year ago.

570
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,640
Lun.

571
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,770
What about Zhao Lun?

572
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,920
He is simple.

573
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,680
He doesn't have any close relatives.

574
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,440
Zhao.

575
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Come and sit here.

576
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,600
Feng Lan.

577
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,600
Sister.
