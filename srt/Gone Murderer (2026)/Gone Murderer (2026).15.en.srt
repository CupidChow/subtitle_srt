[National Radio Station]

2
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
The crime scene.

3
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,720
Duan Zhigang, Du Bin.

4
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,120
Du Bin.

5
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,240
Run slowly.

6
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,580
Watch where you're going.

7
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not a kid anymore.

8
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,880
That's right, kid.

9
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,800
Hey, kid.

10
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,919
Don't move.

11
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,370
Take a photo.

12
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,840
Look at me.

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
Ready.

14
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,690
The background is not good.

15
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,720
Next week,

16
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,300
I'll bring you here again.

17
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
It's pretty here.

18
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
Look at me.

19
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,720
So pretty.

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,560
So pretty.

21
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,220
You're here. I'm here.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Mr Xu.

23
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,680
Have you left?

24
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,800
Where did you get the paternity test?

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,920
Where is Mr. Xu?

26
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,760
Where did you get it?

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,260
About Heo Sung-liang.

28
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,560
I have a plan.

29
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,360
I want to make one with the paternity test.

30
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,880
No.

31
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,600
Why? We'll kill the innocent too.

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,160
If we kill innocent people,

33
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,320
what's the difference between us and them?

34
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,090
Let me ask you one last time.

35
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,020
Are you still not considering

36
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
the plan I mentioned?

37
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,420
I'll answer you one last time.

38
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,120
Never.

39
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,440
Su Ran.

40
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,839
You just want to see me suffer.

41
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,079
You win.

42
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
You win.

43
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm begging you.

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
I just want to know

45
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,440
whether the paternity test

46
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,520
Is it real?

47
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,250
Of course it's fake.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But he's innocent.

49
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
What about my dad?

50
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,320
Weren’t they innocent back then?

51
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,610
Heo Chengliang.

52
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,600
You deserve everything now.

53
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,520
Although it's a little late,

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,330
this day will come sooner or later.

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,560
For the past 15 years,

56
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,160
our pain every day

57
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,120
Please feel it.

58
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
Chairman Xu.

59
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
My work is done.

60
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,200
I wish you

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,720
live a long life.

62
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,240
Ziyang.

63
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,080
Leo.

64
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,840
Ziyang.

65
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,520
Let me introduce.

66
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,040
my idol, Miss Su Ran.

67
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,640
Okay.

68
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
Great.

69
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,800
This is professional.

70
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,120
Mr Su.

71
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,680
Fate

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
is priceless.

73
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,160
Mr Su.

74
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,480
Did he hit you?

75
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,320
Zhao.

76
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,840
How dare you hit Mr Su?

77
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,760
Do you want to die?

78
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
If you need anything in the future,

79
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,940
I'll be there anytime.

80
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,360
I really need Mr Su now.

81
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,600
Ran.

82
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,300
Do you mind if I call you like this?

83
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,400
Let me tell you.

84
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,530
I made all your favorite dishes today.

85
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,880
Actually, our family

86
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,560
asked us

87
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,200
to do for them.

88
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,360
They hope

89
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,720
to live well.

90
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,760
Master.

91
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Since Qin Kaihui chose to expose himself,

92
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,650
and die with Xu Chengliang,

93
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,800
When we arrested him,

94
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,960
when we arrested him.

95
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,880
He was arrested.

96
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,340
Just give us the evidence.

97
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,360
Oh no.

98
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
He’s buying time for Heo Chenglong.

99
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,610
What do you mean?

100
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,440
Do you remember the paternity test

101
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,770
on Duan Zhigang’s body?

102
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,680
I remember.

103
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,640
Didn't we look into it?

104
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,520
It was forged.

105
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,600
Maybe Chengliang doesn’t know.

106
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,880
If Su Ran tells him

107
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,280
this is the document of Duan Zhi Gang and Xu Zi Ang,

108
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,740
Tell me.

109
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,160
What will Heo Chengliang do?

110
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,800
We’ve been preventing

111
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,730
they would murder Heo Chengliang.

112
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,290
Maybe their revenge on Heo Chengliang

113
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,200
to kill him.

114
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,920
Don't move. Get down.

115
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,680
Get down!

116
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,800
Call the ambulance! Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

117
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,360
Yes.

118
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,840
Ambulance.

119
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,800
Hello? Hello?

120
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,280
You...

121
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,680
Shi.

122
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,840
Are you happy

123
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
with my ending?

124
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,720
Grandma, do you want to buy newspapers?

125
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Big news!

126
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,410
Chairman of the pharmaceutical factory, Xu Chengliang was arrested.

127
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,640
Xu Chengliang.

128
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,760
Three lives at the leopard beach in 1994.

129
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
And you killed people on purpose today.

130
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
all the evidence is clear.

131
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
There's no room for excuses.

132
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
What are you waiting for?

133
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,520
Where's Shi?

134
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,960
I want to talk to him.

135
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,080
What do you think this place is?

136
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,280
Are you negotiating?

137
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,000
As long as Lao Shi comes,

138
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,620
I'll tell him everything.

139
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,560
If he doesn't come,

140
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,960
I won't say a word.

141
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,360
Shi Su.

142
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,850
Where are you going?

143
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,320
Li said

144
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,340
Su Ran disappeared from the CCTV.

145
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,160
Everyone is looking for Qin.

146
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,360
We can’t find anyone.

147
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,880
I’ll go find him.

148
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
Go and interrogate Heo Chengliang.

149
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,290
I’ll arrange someone else.

150
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
You have to go out now.

151
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,440
Go out?

152
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,540
What mountain?

153
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,000
I have a lot of things to do.

154
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,460
He's such a troublemaker.

155
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,160
Su Ran has restricted her departure.

156
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
She can’t leave Yujiang.

157
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,890
Don’t worry.

158
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,520
If Su Ran wanted to leave,

159
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,600
he wouldn’t have chosen a regular transportation route.

160
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,520
We have to check the freight dealers at the wharf.

161
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,720
Captain Li has told us

162
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,520
Hurry up.

163
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,820
Master.

164
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,180
Xu Chengliang.

165
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,040
He’s here.

166
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,920
Tell me.

167
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,240
Shi.

168
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
It's been 15 years.

169
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,560
I think we should

170
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,680
to finish what we started.

171
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,120
Do you need some?

172
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,650
Let's talk while drinking.

173
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,440
You're flirting with me.

174
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,720
I don't have time.

175
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,840
Hurry up.

176
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,300
Start from the beginning.

177
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,840
From the beginning,

178
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,120
I have to

179
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,200
the first one.

180
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,540
Don't do it.

181
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,090
Who's that? Who's that?

182
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,200
Mom.

183
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,260
How long are you going to pretend?

184
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,120
If you don't know anything,

185
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,360
Why did you buy this newspaper?

186
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,090
Give it to me.

187
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,420
Give me the ticket.

188
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,600
Heo Chengliang has been arrested.

189
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,840
Once he gives you up,

190
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,640
the police will immediately restrict you from leaving Yujiang.

191
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,900
You can't go anywhere.

192
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,280
Besides,

193
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,960
at your age,

194
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
your body...

195
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
Where do you think you can go?

196
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,170
I have an extra boat ticket.

197
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,850
I can smuggle out in the afternoon.

198
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,240
Tell me everything you know.

199
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,000
Tell me.

200
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,520
I can take you away.

201
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,200
Linlin!

202
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,480
I'm sorry.

203
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,920
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,280
Mom.

206
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
There are so many people here.

207
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,970
Let's talk somewhere else.

208
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,480
What does Song Yuzhen have to do

209
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,210
What does it have to do with her?

210
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,600
The old factory manager Yang De Quan

211
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,680
talked to me once.

212
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,200
That conversation

213
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,480
made me

214
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,360
that I can't turn back.

215
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,440
Chengliang.

216
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,839
We don't have to talk about it.

217
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,599
Yes, of course.

218
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,480
At home.

219
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,119
I always tell Yang Jing

220
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,040
without my arrangement,

221
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,240
I wouldn’t be here today.

222
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,680
Just tell me what you want.

223
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,810
Next year, the factory will be restructured.

224
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I have to think about my future.

225
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,960
I know some Hong Kong merchants.

226
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,800
They are very interested in our factory.

227
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,120
I want to gather the money.

228
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,880
Later,

229
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,160
I'll bring you

230
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,360
the chairman's position.

231
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
Old factory manager.

232
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,480
Thank you so much.

233
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,840
My life will be yours from now on.

234
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Call me if you need anything.

235
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,280
Actually,

236
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,800
I have

237
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,120
my own selfishness.

238
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,200
I understand.

239
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,680
We had enough funds back then.

240
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,560
Mr. Yang.

241
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,640
wants to

242
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,920
to put the money

243
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,760
into your pocket.

244
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
What can I do?

245
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,520
If you were me,

246
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,560
can you not do it?

247
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,970
You can't change me.

248
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
Talk about yourself.

249
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,680
If you want to get the money out,

250
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,480
I have to pass.

251
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,300
Duan Zhigang, the director of the workshop,

252
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,440
and the sales manager Du Bin.

253
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,050
They are my childhood friends.

254
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,180
It's not difficult to get them in.

255
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,400
But I have to drag someone into the Finance Department.

256
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,280
This person

257
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,000
is Song Yuzhen.

258
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,330
Deputy Director Xu.

259
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,400
Song,

260
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,810
When checking the accounts today,

261
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,720
I felt uncomfortable.

262
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,880
I asked someone to make some ginger water with brown sugar

263
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,000
to bring it to you.

264
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,860
Director, this...

265
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,360
Drink it while it's hot.

266
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,520
Take it.

267
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,200
Thank you, Director.

268
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,280
You're welcome.

269
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
There are so many accounts.

270
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,080
The whole department is giving it to you.

271
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
It's obviously bullying.

272
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,240
Tomorrow,

273
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,840
I'll ask the kids in the factory to help you.

274
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,640
Drink it.

275
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
What do you think?

276
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,680
She was pretty when she was young.

277
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,840
But her parents were sick.

278
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,730
Her family is a bottomless pit.

279
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,880
Tang Haojun is an honest man.

280
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,240
took this mess,

281
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,490
But they don't have much feelings for each other.

282
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,000
I took her down

283
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,640
to get her.

284
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,960
Then you asked her

285
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,220
to embezzle public funds for you.

286
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,560
Yes.

287
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,920
Ask her about her condition.

288
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,000
and see if she can be questioned.

289
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,520
So

290
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,080
you betrayed my dad.

291
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,200
Xu Chengliang said

292
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
he would break up with Yang Jing.

293
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,280
and be with me.

294
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,280
Mom was really obsessed

295
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,850
I helped him with counterfeit accounts again and again.

296
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,260
and got deeper and deeper.

297
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,420
But every time I asked him when he would divorce,

298
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,800
he told me

299
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,080
Just wait.

300
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,680
Just wait.

301
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,410
There will be no result.

302
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,370
Heo Chengliang.

303
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,240
What are you going to do about us?

304
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,720
Yuzhen.

305
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,480
Wait for me.

306
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
When I become the president,

307
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
no one can stop us.

308
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,960
I can give you

309
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
the life you want.

310
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,480
Still the same.

311
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
I'll go out first.

312
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,240
Leave in half an hour.

313
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,720
Don't let anyone see you.

314
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,760
Okay.

315
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,240
And then?

316
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
The last time.

317
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,080
that we embezzled public funds

318
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,800
We missed it.

319
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,320
Bin, hurry up.

320
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,760
Who is it?

321
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,100
What are you doing?

322
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
Isn't this Deputy Director Xu?

323
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Wang, you...

324
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,140
Are you on duty?

325
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:25,880
Yes.

326
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm on duty today.

327
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,240
This...

328
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
This is...

329
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,600
from the factory.

330
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,240
Mr. Yang approved it.

331
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,320
I was worried about Wang Wenqiang for a while.

332
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,040
Luckily, he didn’t make a fuss.

333
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,800
But his mouth

334
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,160
is not that strict.

335
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,720
embezzlement of public funds.

336
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,200
Yes.

337
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,820
It's going to be changed soon.

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,120
There are no new orders in the factory.

339
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,380
Where did you get so much purchase money?

340
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,770
I think these people

341
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,840
they're trying to

342
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,860
to dig up the walls in the factory.

343
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,280
Wang.

344
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,020
Here, have some water.

345
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,250
Sister-in-law.

346
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,440
Aren't you at the Finance Department?

347
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,040
Didn't you notice anything?

348
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,160
No.

349
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,720
That's strange.

350
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,840
If it doesn't work,

351
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,100
we can call the police.

352
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,720
Leave them to the police.

353
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,120
Wang,

354
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,320
We don't have solid evidence.

355
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,360
If we call the police, we won't be able to find out.

356
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,760
Isn't that offending?

357
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,760
Yes.

358
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,560
Wang.

359
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,360
Right now,

360
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,600
the factory is arranging a list.

361
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,040
It's not appropriate

362
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,640
at this time.

363
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,240
Look at you.

364
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,690
What's wrong with that?

365
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,000
No matter how big his leader is,

366
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,730
no matter how big his leader is.

367
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,880
I don't believe

368
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
these days,

369
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,480
they must have a new move.

370
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm going to follow them for a few days.

371
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
I'll catch them red-handed.

372
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,400
Tang.

373
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,810
Are you going or not?

374
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,040
I...

375
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,480
Your dad

376
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,010
doesn't like to cause trouble.

377
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,240
He wouldn't go.

378
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,560
Then he went too.

379
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,800
Why?

380
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,640
For you.

381
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,160
Dad.

382
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,970
No matter what happens,

383
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,970
you will protect me, right?

384
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,360
Yes.

385
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,080
I'll keep my promise.

386
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,720
Tell me.

387
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,800
What happened?

388
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,040
Du Bin...

389
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,850
What did Du Bin do to you?

390
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,440
Tell me.

391
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,210
What did he do to you?

392
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,800
You mean

393
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,880
because of me?

394
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,280
Wang.

395
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,940
Are you asleep?

396
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,660
Come pick me up.

397
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,480
That night, the three of us

398
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,960
from the factory

399
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,290
to Director Yang

400
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,280
to Director Yang.

401
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,100
This time, it's 300,000 yuan.

402
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,760
You can count it.

403
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,640
I trust the three of you.

404
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,400
Du.

405
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,560
Duan.

406
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,360
Here.

407
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,170
One for each.

408
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,680
Here.

409
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,280
No.

410
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,480
Thank you, Director.

411
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,380
What are you doing?

412
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,320
Director,

413
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,040
We work for you.

414
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,460
We never want this.

415
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
We just want

416
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,600
to work with you.

417
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,440
Yes.

418
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,480
We just want to work with you.

419
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,600
Yes.

420
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,600
Yes.

421
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,570
It's the leopard beach every time.

422
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,440
That place is hidden.

423
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,800
It's the border of three provinces again.

424
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,060
If something happens,

425
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,970
it's easy to run.

426
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,720
And then?

427
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,800
Then...

428
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,240
something really happened.

429
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,400
Du Bin.

430
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,080
You bastard!

431

432

Lingling is so young.

433
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,080
Are you a human?

434
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,720
What are you talking about?

435
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,920
What's wrong with me?

436
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,800
Calm down, Tang. Calm down.

437
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,720
Tang! Tang! Tang!

438
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,320
Let's get to the point.

439
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,880
Put the knife down first, okay?

440
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,240
Put down the knife.

441
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,720
Mr. Yang.

442
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,320
My daughter is so young.

443
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,960
Du Bin.

444
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,200
Tang,

445
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,970
If you have any problem,

446
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,080
I can help you.

447
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,730
Stop pretending to be nice.

448
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,080
Mr. Yang,

449
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,200
I advise you to return the money to the factory.

450
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
and ask Du Bin to apologize to Tang.

451
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,420
Otherwise,

452
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,080
we'll meet at the police station.

453
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,920
Wang Wenqiang.

454
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,880
Who are you talking to?

455
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,200
I'm talking to you.

456
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,880
What?

457
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,480
You bastards!

458
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,840
A rat in a nest

459
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,360
will die a horrible death.

460
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,680
Get out of the way!

461
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,520
Tang.

462
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,810
Chengliang.

463
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,800
You caused the trouble.

464
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,080
Take care of it yourselves.

465
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,840
If you can't,

466
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,560
don't come back to see me.

467
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,200
If you touch my daughter,

468
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,720
is my life.

469
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,770
Does it have anything to do with me?

470
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,760
Tang,

471
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,880
I'll kill you today!

472
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Tang, Tang, don't kill anyone.

473
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,800
Get out of the way!

474
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:36,920
Tang,

475
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,720
I'll kill you today.

476
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,000
Move!

477
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,200
Let me tell you.

478
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,680
You're really sick.

479
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,000
You know it clearly.

480
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,240
Tang, don't kill him.

481
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,160
Calm down. Get out of the way.

482
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,080
Don't kill him.

483
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Get out of the way!

484
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,120
Tang! Tang! Tang!

485
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,180

486
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,800
What are you doing?

487

What are you looking at?

488
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,640
We'll all die if we dig it out.

489
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
What do you want?

490
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,680
What are you waiting for?

491
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,740
Let go of me!

492
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Murder!

493
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,560
Help!

494
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,320
Brother!

495
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,680
Help!

496
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,520
Help!

497
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,160
Bin!

498
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,320
Help!

499
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,560
Bin, I can't hold you.

500
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,520
We had no choice.

501
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,320
These two

502
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
hit us.

503
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,640
We have to

504
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,120
to the end.

505
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,380
So you killed Tang Haojun and Wang Wenqiang.

506
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,250
What about Feng Lan?

507
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,480
Who is she?

508
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,000
Feng Lan.

509
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
She must have heard

510
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,440
Wang Wenqiang.

511
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,640
Besides, she has to go through the forest.

512
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
What should we do?

513
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,400
We can't keep him here.

514
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,280
Duan.

515
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,480
Mr Duan.

516
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,130
Why are you running?

517
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,480
And then?

518
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,120
Then

519
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,920
we dug a hole

520
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,480

521
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,480
