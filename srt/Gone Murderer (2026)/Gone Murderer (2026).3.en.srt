1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello. Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,480
Hey, hey. Hey.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,680
That's to say,

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,300
the night your wife went missing,

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,120
you don't know

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,400
why he went out.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,600
You looked for him in the family hospital and the factory.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,640
Then...

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,900
She went home after 9 a.m., right?

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,320
Kid.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,170
You were home, weren't you?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,840
Why are you holding this?

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,600
It's this.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,800
My dad gave it to me.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,640
Child,

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,480
We must catch

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
as soon as possible.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,920
Help me recall it.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,880
That night,

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,040
did your dad tell you

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,760
why he went out?

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,960
Linlin, what happened?

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,840
Shi is here.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's go. Okay. Okay.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Here's the thing.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,240
Mr. Yang

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,080
He asked us to take a look.

28
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,100
It's okay, Linlin.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,039
If you remember anything,

30
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,400
just tell Uncle Shi

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,039
this is the eldest brother

32
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,759
we grew up together.

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,250
As long as he's here,

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,250
This case...

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Did I ask you?

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
No, no.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,560
Why didn't you wear

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,020
Why aren't you wearing it?

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,720
No.

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,120
Why are you looking at me?

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,280
What's wrong?

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,580
You can't look.

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,560
I can.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
But Linlin,

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm quite nice to you.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,880
You can't hide it now.

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,240
You saw

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,600
your dad met me.

49
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,240
Did your dad tell you

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,280
he went to see me.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,060
Look, Captain Shi.

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,720
He looked at you

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,760
and made you so weak.

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,680
How can I not be weak?

55
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760
It's a big deal.

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,840
It's so scary.

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,360
Kid.

58
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Do you have something to say?

59
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,640
Nothing.

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Uncle is here.

61
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,780
Say whatever you want.

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Captain Shi.

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,240
Her father just passed away.

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
Let's give her some time.

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,920
Okay.

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,640
Okay.

67
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,720
Let's go. Okay.

68
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,360
Okay.

69
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,280
I'll come back tomorrow.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Yes, you're a child.

72
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,560
Don't move.

73
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,120
Let me take a photo for him.

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
Come on.

75
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,200
Nice.

76
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,800
Zhang Jingxiang.

77
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,960
Pan Zhengxiang

78
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,320
Zheng Jingwen Zhang Lingfeng Li Zhuang

79
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,480
Aria Liu.

80
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,720
Yang Da Chuan, Liu Shuo, Xu Chenliang, Duan Zhigang.

81
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Yang Da Chuan, Liu Shuhao.

82
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Du, Bin.

83
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,360
Did you grow up drinking dog milk?

84
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,360
If I hadn't found a doctor for your dad,

85
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,120
your dad would have been reincarnated.

86
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,250
He should be three years old this year.

87
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,840
I'll borrow 100,000 yuan from you.

88
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,360
Hello?

89
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,320
Hello?

90
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,640
Hello?

91
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,520
Honey.

92
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,360
He really came.

93
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Yan Bo said

94
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,240
Du Bin has no savings.

95
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,890
He lost everything.

96
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,210
I also owe a bunch of foreign debts.

97
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,600
I need to raise three to five hundred thousand yuan.

98
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,240
we might be able to borrow money.

99
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,120
One million.

100
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
He can only rely on gambling.

101
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
Let's proceed as we planned.

102
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
Don't let the police catch him.

103
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,200
That way, we can force him to work.

104
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay.

105
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,760
Hello.

106
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,970
I have a tip-off.

107
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
K+KTV.

108
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,560
Someone is gambling.

109
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,660
It's a huge amount.

110
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,360
Got you.

111
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,000
I told you to leave, but you didn't?

112
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,520
I don’t believe it.

113
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,680
How many, Du?

114
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,840
Are you cheating?

115
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,560
Watch your mouth.

116
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,000
I won today.

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,680
Don't let me

118
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
in happy times.

119
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,560
Niu.

120
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,400
Come on

121
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
Deal.

122
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,400
YuJ 38303.

123
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,200
Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

124
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,840
What?

125
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,900
Your car was paint.

126
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,520
What?

127
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,720
Your car was paint.

128
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,160
I...

129
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,720
YuJ 38303.

130
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,960
Who did this?

131
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,160
Song.

132
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,240
Go and block the back door.

133
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,440
Xiao Jie and others block the back door.

134
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,280
Police.

135
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't move.

136
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,360
Don't move. Squat down.

137
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
Get down. Get down.

138
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,320
Get up.

139
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,400
Hurry up.

140
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,700
Captain Li.

141
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,040
Duan.

142
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,450
You'll set up a meeting these days.

143
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,320
Let Ziyang

144
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,120
make a toast to Uncle Du.

145
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,560
and talk it out.

146
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,760
It's always awkward.

147
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,040
President,

148
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,000
I think

149
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,640
Bin is to blame.

150
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,920
You spoiled him.

151
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Of his peers,

152
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,880
among his peers.

153
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,440
Duan,

154
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,880
Let's close the door and talk.

155
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,440
That typhoon

156
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,320
I can't even sleep well.

157
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,520
So I have to make him grow up.

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,600
As long as he

159
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
to make a big shot,

160
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,200
I can rest assured.

161
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
But as the old saying goes,

162
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,400
you can't take care of your own child.

163
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,680
So please

164
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,760
for me.

165
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,760
I know.

166
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,320
Who is it?

167
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,760
Bin.

168
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,160
Answer.

169
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,360
Bin.

170
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,640
Duan.

171
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,960
Is the chairman beside you?

172
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,600
Tell me what it is.

173
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,600
The venue I used to go was destroyed.

174
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,640
It's closed down.

175
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,800
Yes.

176
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,240
I earn over 600,000 yuan in total.

177
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,120
The boss took

178
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,560
over 600,000 yuan.

179
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,280
I can't change the cash.

180
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Are you okay?

181
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm fine.

182
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,920
I escaped.

183
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,000
Duan.

184
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
Is there any way

185
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,880
help me

186
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,440
the casino owner?

187
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,520
Bin.

188
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,600
Are you crazy?

189
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,760
It's not Duan.

190
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,000
Please help me.

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,760
I really need to find it.

192
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,360
Bin.

193
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,420
Listen carefully.

194
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,040
I can help you with anything.

195
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
I can't help you

196
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,080
I can't help you.

197
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
Duan, I...

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,880
Where is he?

199
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,260
He's crippled.

200
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,240
Mr. Du.

201
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,040
Zhi Ling.

202
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,400
Last time you said

203
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,840
some big clients

204
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,240
to buy our goods.

205
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,240
how much can they eat?

206
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,400
Mr. Du.

207
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,680
Have you figured it out, Mr. Du?

208
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,000
Two million.

209
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,480
Talk to them.

210
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
Let them pay half first.

211
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,480
Mr. Du, just kill me.

212
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,340
How can you do business like this?

213
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,600
If we succeed,

214
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,060
we'll start immediately.

215
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,480
Let me try.

216
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,760
Zhi Ling.

217
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,240
Wait.

218
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,160
Have you

219
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,960
have you been in contact with strangers recently?

220
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,400
A stranger?

221
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,240
No.

222
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,520
Mr. Du.

223
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,120
I don’t want anyone else to know.

224
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,600
It's okay.

225
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,720
Go talk.

226
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,080
Bye.

227
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,400
That means

228
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,200
Du Bin contacted Fourth Brother.

229
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,280
Get ready to work.

230
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,520
Yes.

231
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
The next step is

232
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,340
Yan Bo will continue to get it out.

233
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,360
where Du Bin's fake medicine workshop

234
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,320
is hiding?

235
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,880
But now,

236
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,840
a very tricky problem.

237
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
What's wrong?

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,880
Tell me.

239
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,120
Say it.

240
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,160
Fourth Brother said

241
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,690
to meet the buyer in person.

242
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,160
As long as there's no problem,

243
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,360
he'll start working.

244
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
What should we do?

245
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,640
You...

246
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,040
Why are you staring at me?

247
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,760
Swing. Swing. Swing.

248
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,200
Yes, it looks good.

249
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,880
Come on. Twist.

250
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,320
Right

251
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,160
Not bad.

252
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,720
Swing. Swing. Swing.

253
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,160
Right

254
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,160
It's pretty That's it

255
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,200
Not bad

256
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,080
Yes.

257
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,839
This is...

258
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,839
Zhi Ling.

259
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,040
Let me introduce.

260
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,520
This is

261
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,720
is Mr. Zhao

262
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,560
Mr Zhao.

263
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

264
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,040
Mr. Zhao.

265
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,480
Hello.

266
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,840
Mr. Shi.

267
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,880
Su.

268
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,160
You're here.

269
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,280
I...

270
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,080
I have something to do.

271
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,400
Can you do me a favor?

272
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,800
What is it?

273
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,200
Mr. Zhao.

274
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,960
Here's to you.

275
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,340
This...

276
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,840
Here.

277
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,570
Let me add it for you.

278
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
I didn't expect

279
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,040
Mr. Zhao is really young and promising.

280
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,480
In this business,

281
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,160
for long.

282
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,440
Why does it sound like

283
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,640
doubt me?

284
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,320
No.

285
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,640
No.

286
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,280
Forget it.

287
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,000
No.

288
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,760
Don't.

289
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
No, Mr. Zhao.

290
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
Have a seat.

291
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,610
I don't mean anything else.

292
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,400
Well...

293
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm curious.

294
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,240
Zhi Ling.

295
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,760
Mr. Zhao's father.

296
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,440
In the local medical entrance,

297
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I told you before.

298
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,240
Why did you mention this?

299
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,480
Yes.

300
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,280
It was a long time ago

301
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,960
a long time ago.

302
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,740
What about now?

303
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,330
The old man retired.

304
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,320
but the relationship is all there.

305
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,400
So Mr. Zhao...

306
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,040
Right?

307
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,560
Mr Zhao.

308
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,160
Come on.

309
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,320
Come.

310
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,760
I...

311
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,200
A toast to you.

312
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,760
Come on.

313
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,320
Stop the music.

314
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,520
Get out! Get out!

315
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,760
Mr. Zhao.

316
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,920
Mr. Yan guarantees it.

317
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Don’t worry.

318
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,760
Yes.

319
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,240
I have no problem with it.

320
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,120
However,

321
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,320
I have to tell you

322
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
maybe we need you

323
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,520
we need you to

324
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,040
half of the goods first.

325
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,440
Yes.

326
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Does Yujiang

327
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,180
do business like this?

328
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,320
No, no, Mr. Zhao.

329
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,920
There's room for discussion.

330
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,400
Weiquan

331
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,840
Is there a discussion?

332
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,840
Yes.

333
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,720
We can discuss.

334
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,880
Come on

335
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,160
Here you go.

336
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,000
Are you sure

337
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,280
Are you sure?

338
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,320
I can't say 100 percent,

339
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,080
but it should be fine.

340
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,880
Okay.

341
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,120
Okay.

342
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,640
Okay.

343
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Slow down.

344
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,520
Your smile is sweet

345
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,640
Have a drink.

346
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,850
Have a drink.

347
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,840
Slow down.

348
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,320
Mr. Zhao.

349
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,160
About today,

350
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,680
let's

351
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,800
It's decided.

352
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,600
Zhi Ling.

353
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,820
How about this?

354
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,700
Take me to your factory

355
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,280
take me to your factory.

356
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,760
As long as the goods are fine,

357
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,200
I'll pay you half of the goods right away.

358
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
What do you think?

359
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,160
You're sincere, aren't you?

360
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,290
Mr. Zhao, why did you go to the factory?

361
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,080
That place is dirty and messy.

362
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,000
How about this?

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,130
I'll bring you some samples tomorrow.

364
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,760
Okay?

365
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,720
Slow down.

366
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,160
Are you still questioning me?

367
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,520
Forget it.

368
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,360
No no

369
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,320
Zhi Ling.

370
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,280
No.

371
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,680
Mr. Zhao.

372
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,200
Mr. Zhao.

373
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,060
How about this?

374
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,960
Tomorrow,

375
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,260
Wait for my call, okay?

376
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,680
Okay.

377
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,160
Okay.

378
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,480
Take Mr. Zhao home safely.

379
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:37,880
Don't worry.

380
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,240
Okay.

381
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,000
Open the Bentley

382
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,320
Okay.

383
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm leaving.

384
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,400
Okay.

385
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,240
Mr. Zhao is so temperamental.

386
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,770
This guy.

387
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,010
You drive first.

388
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,000
Are you okay?

389
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
Seafood market.

390
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,000
Gao.

391
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,480
Mr. Zhao.

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This is called dark under the light.

393
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,880
Mr. Zhao.

394
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,120
Please.

395
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,760
Manager Yan.

396
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Watch carefully.

397
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,560
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

398
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,920
Come on, Mr. Zhao.

399
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,800
Mr. Zhao.

400
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
This way, please.

401
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,440
Come on.

402
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,320
Come on.

403
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,720
This is a sterile workshop.

404
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,040
international standard.

405
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,880
Please understand, Mr. Zhao.

406
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,520
Come on.

407
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,040
Please.

408
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,960
Mr. Zhao.

409
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,640
Come on.

410
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,810
Mr. Zhao.

411
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,260
Please have a seat.

412
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,040
Mr. Zhao.

413
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,440
You saw it too.

414
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,800
our goods

415
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,360
can be taken seriously.

416
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,880
This place

417
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,040
even Manager Yan has never been here.

418
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
My fourth brother

419
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,320
treat you as one of us.

420
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,120
I know.

421
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,490
Zhi Ling.

422
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,000
How do you

423
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,280
usually sell?

424
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,200
Okay.

425
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,040
Not bad.

426
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,680
Mr. Zhao, don't worry.

427
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,920
It's absolutely safe.

428
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,880
If there's no problem,

429
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,320
let's talk about the rest.

430
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,960
No hurry.

431
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,440
I have to...

432
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,330
Let me see the goods.

433
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,440
Is the scene ready?

434
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,320
Don't worry, boss.

435
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,980
Everything is under control.

436
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,520
Mr. Zhao.

437
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,600
Mr. Zhao.

438
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,320
Mr. Zhao.

439
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Take your time.

440
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,320
Take your time

441
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,640
Hello, Boss Du

442
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
How is the negotiation going?

443
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,480
He's so slow.

444
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,080
I didn't want to talk about the transaction time.

445
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,680
Who brought this client?

446
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,920
Mr. Yan.

447
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Yan Bo.

448
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,480
I think something is wrong.

449
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,480
You mean

450
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,660
There's a trap inside.

451
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,840
Don't spoil him.

452
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,760
I'll test him directly.

453
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,640
I won’t play with him if you continue.

454
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,440
Got it, Mr. Du.

455
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,640
Mr. Zhao.

456
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,080
One million.

457
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,240
I'll deliver the goods in three days.

458
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Just tell me whether it works or not.

459
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,640
For all these years,

460
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,080
this is the first time

461
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,210
talk to me like that.

462
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,520
Zhi Ling.

463
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,480
Zhi Ling.

464
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,930
You have to give Mr. Zhao some time.

465
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,640
Time? What time?

466
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,040
Let me tell you.

467
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,080
We're here to see the factory.

468
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,560
Look

469
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,640
I want to see the goods.

470
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,120
I've shown you the goods.

471
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,400
I didn't see a penny.

472
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,240
You two are still

473
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
with me?

474
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
Listen, Mr. Zhao.

475
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,320
I've given you enough sincerity.

476
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,520
Mr. Zhao,

477
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,720
Open your bag.

478
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,200
I want to see your sincerity.

479
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,570
What do you mean?

480
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,720
What do you mean?

481
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,640
Open the box.

482
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,160
Manager Yan.

483
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,060
I can’t do this business anymore.

484
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,170
I'm leaving.

485
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,400
Zhao.

486
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,520
If you play like this,

487
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,640
don't blame me for being rude.

488
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,440
Move!

489
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Zhao.

490
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,280
drew me a million, right?

491
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,760
Manager Yan.

492
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,450
What do you mean?

493
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,280
Zhi Ling.

494
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,440
This has nothing to do with me.

495
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,200
Really?

496
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,850
Pick out his tendon.

497
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,600
Pick out his tendon.

498
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,120
It's a misunderstanding.

499
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,760
Zhi Ling.

500
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,760
Zhi Ling.

501
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,440
Zhi Ling, it really has nothing to do with me.

502
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,000
Trust me, Zhi Ling.

503
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,160
Run!

504
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,200
Stop! Don't move!

505
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,720
Stop! Don't move!

506
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,920
Don't let him escape.

507
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,360
Hurry!

508
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,680
Behave!

509
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,880
Old man.

510
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,840
Little thing.

511
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,000
Take him away.

512
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,960
Check carefully.

513
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,680
See if there's anything missing.

514
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,200
Zhao.

515
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,640
Are you okay?

516
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,800
Are you hurt?

517
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm not hurt.

518
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,690
But his blood sugar is a little low.

519
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm done.

520
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,570
Sichuan Tongzhu Red Wine Co., Ltd.

521
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
Something happened.

522
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,640
Honey.

523
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,220
How are you?

524
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,280
Are you hurt?

525
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,060
Don’t worry. I’m fine.

526
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,160
Mr. Shi.

527
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,720
Thanks for what happened today.

528
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,610
Don't say that about Su.

529
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,640
About this,

530
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,960
you two

531
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,680
investigate the secret.

532
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,840
Follow the clues

533
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,440
and get into the tiger's den.

534
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,100
You two are really something.

535
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,600
My pleasure, Mr. Shi.

536
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,360
Duan, what took you so long?

537
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,400
What are you doing?

538
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,480
Duan.

539
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,840
Do you want to die?

540
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Do you want to die?

541
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,920
I have no choice.

542
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,320
I don't know where Su found

543
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,120
a recording of me and Zhi Ling.

544
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,520
She extorted me one million yuan.

545
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,200
I had no choice but to work.

546
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,920
You mean

547
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,360
Su?

548
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,480
That reporter.

549
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,120
That woman.

550
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,050
This is so exciting.

551
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,920
I didn't expect my first acting

552
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,880
I did it.

553
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,960
I told you from the beginning.

554
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,000
you would be fine.

555
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,400
Now we have

556
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
the fake medicine workshop.

557
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,060
Xu Chengliang will find out soon.

558
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,120
Du Bin did it.

559
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,200
I copied Du Bin's notebook and wrote a letter.

560
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,360
Send it to the mailbox in the mailbox.

561
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,480
Du Bin will die soon.

562
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,000
This letter

563
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,800
Can it really kill Du Bin?

564
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
Why didn't you tell me

565
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,730
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

566
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,199
I wanted to solve it myself.

567
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,620
Have you solved it?

568
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,219
Have you solved it?

569
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Is it solved?

570
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,960
Enough, Duan.

571
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,360
You can't escape even if you find out about the fake medicine.

572
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,850
Are you threatening me?

573
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,020
Let me give you an example.

574
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,280
There's a plank drifting on the sea.

575
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,360
There are three people standing up there.

576
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,960
When no one moves

577
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,440
Everyone can live

578
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,370
But when one person starts to move,

579
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,040
and the plank is about to flip,

580
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,940
what will the other two do?

581
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,239
Push him into the sea.

582
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,560
This plank

583
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
is the leopard case.

584
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,760
The one who moved first

585
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,320
