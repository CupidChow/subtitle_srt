1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,720
Master,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,520
why do you think Song Yuzhen

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,050
is our breakthrough point?

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,720
Xiao Hao,

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,560
I have a theory.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,360
I now suspect

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
that Su Ran might actually be Tang Haojun's daughter,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,900
Tang Lingling.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,520
She's Tang Lingling?

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,040
Before the accident last night,

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,520
I ran into Su Ran with Song Yuzhen.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,660
Su Ran had obviously been crying.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,570
I asked her a few questions,

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,890
and her reaction was very unusual.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,320
And why did Duan Zhigang

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,840
specifically ask Song Yuzhen to deliver food during Su Ran's interview?

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,970
I don't believe this is a coincidence.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,340
If Tang Lingling hadn't disappeared back then,

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,400
by now,

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
she would be about the same age as Su Ran.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,840
You mean

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,490
she also believes Tang Haojun's death

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,280
is connected to Xu Chengliang and the other two?

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,640
So she changed her name

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,130
and came back to investigate herself?

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,480
If she's only investigating, that's fine.

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,580
I'm afraid she wants to take justice into her own hands.

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,400
She had just started investigating counterfeit drugs

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,800
when Du Bin disappeared.

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,340
According to Duan Zhigang's statement,

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,160
Su Ran also interviewed him.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,039
If Su Ran used his affair with Yang Jing

34
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,560
as leverage

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,320
to force him to do something,

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,539
Duan Zhigang would be in a tough spot.

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,620
If he wanted to maintain control,

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
he'd need to find Su Ran's weakness.

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,200
So that's why Song Yuzhen had the accident.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,680
Xiao Hao.

41
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,960
Can we now conduct a DNA test

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,800
between Su Ran and Song Yuzhen?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,460
Su Ran isn't a suspect yet,

44
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,740
so it might not follow proper procedure.

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,840
I see.

46
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,920
I'll file a request and see.

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,480
Good.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,000
Have Song check Su Ran's background thoroughly,

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,660
the more detailed the better.

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,410
Understood.

51
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,040
Patient Song Yuzhen in bed 21 has regained consciousness.

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,240
Call Dr. Fan over.

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,450
Crime scene.

54
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,079
Du Bin.

55
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,280
Duan Zhigang, Du Bin.

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,840
Good.

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,040
As for our direction,

58
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,720
we should focus on technological leadership

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,850
and proven treatment effectiveness.

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,800
As for the specific details,

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,640
you decide.

62
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,920
I trust you.

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,360
I'll go back and organize it

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,720
and send it out in the next couple of days.

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,080
Okay.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,440
Chairman.

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
The trauma ointment.

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,920
Chairman, it's not convenient for you.

69
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,580
Let me do it.

70
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,040
Okay.

71
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,360
Thank you, Su.

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,460
No problem.

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,760
Su,

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,700
when you interviewed Director Duan yesterday,

75
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,280
did he act unusual in any way?

76
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,120
No.

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,840
Why?

78
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,920
Nothing.

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,440
But

80
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,520
Director Duan

81
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,480
is quite deep.

82
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,650
What do you mean?

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,860
I can't figure him out,

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,440
unlike you who's so approachable.

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,090
You're the first person who's ever called me approachable.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
But Su,

87
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,440
to be honest with you,

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
I've always felt that we

89
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,730
have met somewhere before.

90
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,320
Maybe it's just that we clicked right away.

91
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,080
Alright,

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,320
if there's nothing else,

93
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,800
I'll go back to finish my article.

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Sure.

95
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,080
Thanks for your hard work.

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,760
It's no trouble. Just doing my job.

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,020
The chairman has left.

98
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,320
Xiao Jiang.

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,080
Chairman.

100
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,560
Check this place.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,100
Brother Jiang.

102
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,080
I was just using the hair dryer for a customer.

104
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,520
You weren't even awake.

105
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,980
I thought this wouldn't be a problem either.

106
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Did I disturb you?

107
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,720
I just fell asleep.

108
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,360
You were sleeping so soundly.

109
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,620
You were even snoring.

110
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,560
Hello.

111
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,640
Xu Chengliang is already investigating Yang Jing

112
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,040
and Duan Zhigang's case.

113
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
I'm afraid Duan Zhigang might run.

114
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,240
Go keep a close eye on him.

115
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't let him leave Yujiang.

116
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,400
Okay.

117
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
I understand.

118
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,360
Thank you.

119
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,159
I have to go now.

120
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,820
using Microread technology.

121
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,160
According to the People's Republic of China Public Security Industry Standard,

122
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,880
I'm confused.

123
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,160
I'm really confused.

124
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,960
How could Zi'ang be the two of us?

125
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,010
Now Mr. Xu definitely won't go abroad.

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Su Ran's mother is now being watched by the police.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,280
And now this issue with Zi'ang has come up.

128
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
What should we do?

129
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,520
Yang Jing.

130
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,760
I just want to ask you one thing.

131
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,960
Between Mr. Xu and me,

132
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,520
if one of us has to die,

133
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,039
who would you choose?

134
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
Don't be ridiculous.

135
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,400
I choose my son.

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,730
Who else would I choose?

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
After the murder,

138
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,400
when we were coordinating our stories,

139
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I secretly recorded several tapes

140
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,760
and hid them in the safe at my winery.

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,100
I was preparing for the day

142
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,460
when Xu Chengliang might silence me.

143
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,580
I'd use those tapes

144
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,640
to bring him down with me.

145
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
Tonight,

146
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,360
I'll be on a cargo ship,

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,960
sneaking out of the country.

148
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,720
You can give those tapes to the police.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
Xu Chengliang will certainly be finished.

150
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,720
You and Zi'ang

151
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,300
will naturally take over the pharmaceutical factory.

152
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,970
I definitely won't be coming back.

153
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,240
But you must ensure that I'll be

154
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,700
well provided for abroad.

155
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,360
What are you thinking about?

156
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,360
Nothing.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,460
Let me tell you, Yang Jing.

158
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,720
If I'm out there

159
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,440
and you don't take care of me...

160
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
Are you crazy?

161
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
I have a Swiss bank card.

162
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,960
I'll go get it for you now.

163
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,760
That card can be used worldwide.

164
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
Understand?

165
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Mr. Song,

166
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
you're awake.

167
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,970
I bought you some fruit.

168
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,160
You really scared me yesterday.

169
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
How are you feeling now?

170
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,930
Don't worry.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm from the Criminal Investigation Department.

172
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,560
No need to be nervous.

173
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
Who are you?

174
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm...

175
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm Shi Guangming.

176
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,800
I handled the case of your husband Tang and your daughter.

177
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,920
Remember?

178
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,560
I have a daughter?

179
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,520
Uncle Duan,

180
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,040
what brings you here?

181
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm

182
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,240
picking up some things for your father.

183
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,600
Where have you been?

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
Didn't I tell you before

185
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,320
that Ms. Su is writing a factory history?

186
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,920
I went to the county archives specially today.

187
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,720
I found out

188
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,770
our factory has so many stories worth writing about.

189
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
I've organized everything for her.

190
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,080
All categorized

191
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,340
and clearly arranged.

192
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,840
Zi'ang.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,600
Mom.

194
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,740
Get something for Uncle Duan.

195
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I'll be going now.

196
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
Okay. Take care, Uncle Duan.

197
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,000
Zi'ang.

198
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,440
Listen to your mother.

199
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,420
I'm leaving, sister-in-law.

200
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,490
Why is Uncle Duan acting so strange today?

201
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,540
Let's go upstairs.

202
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,480
Song Yuzhen now

203
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,940
can't remember anything.

204
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,540
I don't think this approach is going to work.

205
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,040
I'll go question Su Ran

206
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,130
and feel her out.

207
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,360
The rice isn't even cooked yet.

208
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,090
Why are you cooking the dishes?

209
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
You don't have any solid evidence.

210
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,250
What are you going to feel her out with?

211
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,810
Hey, Liu'er.

212
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,130
Captain Li, we've found a new lead.

213
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,000
What is it?

214
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,680
We've traced the money flow from Du Bin's counterfeit drug operation.

215
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,880
It's been fully tracked now.

216
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,400
The money was routed overseas

217
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,480
and eventually ended up in Yujiang,

218
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,600
at a company called Yuanyang Trading.

219
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
We found several boxes there

220
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
of shredded financial records.

221
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,680
We're bringing them back to reconstruct them.

222
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,320
I got it.

223
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,140
We'll head back right now.

224
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,170
Understood.

225
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,680
These are the last two spots.

226
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,960
If you want to leave after this, you'll have to wait until next week.

227
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,760
Tonight when boarding, they'll check tickets, not faces.

228
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,690
Keep these safe.

229
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,400
Hey.

230
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,620
Duan Zhigang seems to be really planning to escape.

231
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,960
It's not that I'm afraid.

232
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,560
It's just that there are two of them.

233
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,520
Can I

234
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,650
handle it by myself?

235
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,400
What if

236
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,690
you just give the photos

237
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
to Xu Chengliang?

238
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
If I do that, my intentions would be too obvious.

239
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,290
Xu Chengliang isn't a fool.

240
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,260
Now as long as we can stall him,

241
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,260
he won't be far from death.

242
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,800
Alright.

243
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,640
I understand.

244
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,740
Mr. Duan, if you're leaving tonight,

245
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,890
I'd like to go back and pack my luggage.

246
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,640
Don't go back.

247
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,140
You might be followed.

248
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,560
I have a warehouse near the dock.

249
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,000
We can stay there for a while.

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,930
Change clothes.

251
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,400
We'll board the ship together tonight.

252
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,000
Go get some food now.

253
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,220
Give me the bag.

254
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
Hey, brother.

255
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,120
Got a light?

256
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,040
Stop!

257
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,320
Stop!

258
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,400
Stop!

259
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,680
Kaixuan!

260
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
Kaixuan!

261
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,120
Mr. Duan!

262
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,680
The bag!

263
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,160
Over there!

264
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,380
Where is he?

265
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,800
He...

266
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,760
He got away.

267
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,760
What about the bag?

268
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,960
Mr. Duan, what should we do?

269
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,369
Former Factory Directors.

270
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,480
Hey, Mr. Xu.

271
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Hey, Ms. Su.

272
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,520
I've prepared all the materials you asked for.

273
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,580
You'll definitely be satisfied.

274
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,280
Then I'll trouble you

275
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,140
to deliver them to me personally.

276
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,880
Oh no,

277
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,090
that lacks a sense of occasion.

278
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,180
How about this?

279
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,920
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

280
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,080
By the way, it's my mother's birthday soon.

281
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,180
I'm really terrible at picking gifts for women.

282
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,650
You have good taste,

283
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,520
so could you help me choose a gift while we're at it?

284
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,120
Sure,

285
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,120
no problem.

286
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,440
Great, it's settled then.

287
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,480
I'll book a table and send you the details tonight.

288
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,920
Okay.

289
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
This damn charm.

290
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,480
ID card,

291
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,280
bank card,

292
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,880
passport,

293
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,640
and the boarding pass.

294
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,770
They're all inside.

295
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,660
He can't leave even if he wants to.

296
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,360
Good job.

297
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,800
Are you hurt?

298
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,280
Su Ran.

299
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,400
Duan Zhigang.

300
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
We'll have results tonight, right?

301
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,490
Go home and wait for my news.

302
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,080
Hello, Mr. Duan.

303
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,400
Do you have my stuff?

304
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,250
Mr. Duan.

305
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,360
I gave you an extra day, not for you to run.

306
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,920
Since you won't talk,

307
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,080
then kill Xu Chengliang.

308
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,900
Once he's dead,

309
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,180
I'll return your stuff immediately.

310
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,520
Look behind you.

311
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,600
Do you see a van?

312
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,840
Under the passenger seat of the van,

313
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
there are some tapes.

314
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,400
Those are the recordings from back then at Baozi Beach after the murder.

315
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Our rehearsed alibis.

316
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,160
Just hand the recordings to the police,

317
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,050
and Xu Chengliang is finished.

318
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,400
But tonight,

319
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,530
I must board the ship and leave.

320
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,320
I hope you keep your word,

321
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,090
don't double-cross me.

322
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,610
As long as what you said is true,

323
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I'll keep my word.

324
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,320
Duan Zhigang.

325
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,920
Are you sure it's in the passenger seat?

326
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm not sure.

327
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,170
Xiaojie.

328
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,760
Chief Shi, is Captain Li back yet?

329
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,360
He's back.

330
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,860
Captain Li,

331
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,040
we've now confirmed

332
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,560
that the main beneficiary of the counterfeit drug money

333
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
is Duan Zhigang.

334
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,680
Boss,

335
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
at the construction site near Zhankou Fishing Village,

336
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,120
we found that on the day Du Bin disappeared,

337
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,400
Duan bought two bags of cement.

338
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,730
He lied to us yesterday.

339
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,660
Send out the order.

340
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,240
Make the arrest.

341
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,800
Yes, sir.

342
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,450
Mr. Duan,

343
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,250
everything's here.

344
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,010
Bury the body

345
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,360
behind the factory.

346
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,640
Then go to the dock.

347
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,200
Hailin warehouse.

348
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Wait for me there.

349
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,330
We'll board the ship together.

350
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,560
Jiang.

351
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,120
Chairman.

352
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,840
Where is

353
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,360
Duan Zhigang?

354
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,160
Xiao Hao.

355
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,600
Try to interrogate Duan Zhigang and Qin Kaixuan simultaneously.

356
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,240
If Duan Zhigang refuses to talk,

357
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,440
Qin Kaixuan might be our breakthrough.

358
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,160
I'll check on Su Ran,

359
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,840
let me know immediately if anything happens on your end.

360
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,720
Understood, sir.

361
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,360
Just keep an eye on Su Ran,

362
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,040
it's still just speculation after all.

363
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,160
Please don't do anything rash.

364
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Once Duan Zhigang confesses,

365
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,280
we'll discuss our next move.

366
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,640
How am I being rash?

367
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,280
I'm just reminding you.

368
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't need your reminders.

369
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,320
Chief,

370
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,800
is it possible

371
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,360
that Duan Zhigang, because of the fake medicine incident,

372
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,200
cemented Du Bin and dumped him in the sea to silence him?

373
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,460
That's very possible.

374
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,280
Did you send someone over?

375
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,600
I contacted the police station.

376
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
They're heading to the factory now.

377
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,200
What about Qin Kaixuan?

378
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
We're confirming his location.

379
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,770
We'll report back to the team once we find him.

380
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,730
Hurry up.

381
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,600
Hello.

382
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,960
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

383
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,680
Hello.

384
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

385
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,760
Mr. Duan.

386
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,040
Where are you heading?

387
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,640
Well,

388
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,760
Chairman,

389
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,000
I

390
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,280
was just heading back.

391
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Not busy?

392
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
No, not busy.

393
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Get in.

394
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,410
Come with me to inspect some goods.

395
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,520
Please, Mr. Duan.

396
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,320
Hello.

397
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,120
What would you like to drink?

398
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,380
Watermelon juice.

399
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,160
How many glasses?

400
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,130
Two glasses.

401
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,170
What are you doing here?

402
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,490
Just passing by.

403
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,380
Have a seat.

404
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,160
Mr. Su,

405
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,120
Mr. Su,

406
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,720
Mr. Su,

407
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,760
are you there?

408
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,600
Xu.

409
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,320
What's wrong?

410
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,640
Why are you in such a hurry?

411
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,360
Director Shi.

412
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
I had plans to go out with Mr. Su today,

413
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,280
but suddenly I couldn't reach him.

414
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,680
So I rushed over to check.

415
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
We can't reach Xiao Su?

416
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,210
Song'er.

417
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,300
Where is he?

418
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Wasn't he at the factory?

419
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,960
How did he go missing?

420
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,440
Captain Li,

421
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,200
he was already gone when we arrived.

422
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,840
His car hasn't been moved.

423
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,480
He's not answering his phone.

424
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,440
He's not in any of the departments he usually visits.

425
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
Have you checked the factory surveillance?

426
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
I've already sent someone to check.

427
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,000
Where's the surveillance room?

428
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,660
Over there.

429
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,920
Hao.

430
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,440
Where is he?

431
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Did you catch him?

432
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
Not yet, Master.

433
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,900
He got away.

434
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,200
He escaped?

435
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,920
How did he get away?

436
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,250
He probably caught wind of it beforehand.

437
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,360
Master.

438
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,760
What brings you here?

439
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,960
Su Ran is missing.

440
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,740
Officer Li.

441
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,620
How's it going?

442
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,810
We just found out

443
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,120
that Duan Zhigang left the factory in Xu Chengliang's car.

444
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,480
Quick, have the command center track them.

445
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,040
Send me the vehicle's movement trajectory.

446
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,770
Understood.

447
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,570
Song'er.

448
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,800
You stay here and assist Officer Shi.

449
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,080
Check Su Ran's whereabouts.

450
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,560
Got it.

451
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,240
The rest of you come with me.

452
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,120
Let's go.

453
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,940
You and your sister

454
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,980
are close, aren't you?

455
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,200
How did you know?

456
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,120
When you fell asleep in my shop that day,

457
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,020
you kept calling for your sister.

458
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
I guess you were dreaming about her.

459
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,520
Yes.

460
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,640
Yes.

461
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,300
That was the best sleep I've had in years.

462
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,360
By the way.

463
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,680
After that person from the other day,

464
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,140
has he bothered you again?

465
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,720
Who is he?

466
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,930
I also have a brother

467
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,040
who's a year younger than me.

468
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,890
Stage 3 stomach cancer.

469
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,520
The only effective treatment

470
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,720
is a restricted medication produced by Yujiang Pharmaceutical.

471
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,580
It's not available on the market.

472
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,880
That day when you drove that person away...

473
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,810
His name is Chao.

474
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,050
He's the owner of my hair salon.

475
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,720
He knows people at the pharmaceutical factory

476
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,720
and can get this medicine through internal channels.

477
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,320
So I came to Yujiang.

478
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,060
I work for him for free,

479
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,330
and he regularly gets me the medicine.

480
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,480
So,

481
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,050
how long has this been going on?

482
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,360
Two years,

483
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,880
three months and 18 days.

484
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,520
Zoom in.

485
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,850
Isn't that Qin Kaixuan?

486
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,300
This is the last footage of Su Ran.

487
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,840
None of the security cameras at any entrance

488
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,600
captured her leaving the factory area.

489
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,480
Are you suggesting

490
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,210
Su Ran was in Qin Kaixuan's car?

491
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,040
Quickly find out where Qin Kaixuan is.

492
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,770
Understood.

493
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,160
Hello?

494
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,250
Help me check a car quickly.

495
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,780
I never had a chance to tell you

496
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,780
about that day.

497
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,720
Thank you.

498
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,720
In all my life,

499
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,920
it's the first time someone stood up for me.

500
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,240
All this time,

501
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,770
I've been drifting out here alone.

502
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,120
I've been bullied plenty of times too.

503
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,840
I just kept putting up with it.

504
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,160
After enduring it for so long, I stopped feeling anything.

505
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,400
Later, a friend

506
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
from my hometown told me something.

507
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,240
When fate slaps you in the face,

508
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,370
you can actually slap back.

509
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,760
Because there's nothing to lose anyway,

510
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,320
right?

511
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,240
If

512
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,000
I mean, if

513
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,930
that person bullies you again,

514
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,000
call me.

515
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,640
So you're just

516
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,200
single, huh?

517
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,040
I

518
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,360
I actually...

519
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,100
What are you doing?

520
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,480
Mr. Xu.

521
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,560
Your wife is missing.

522
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,520
Don't you know?

523
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,770
And you still have time to hit on girls?

524
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,720
Missing?

525
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,760
Listen to me.

526
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,840
I'm going to the east side of the city now.

527
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
You go to the west side.

528
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,080
Search every place she could possibly go.

529
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,000
Search them all.

530
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,640
Tell me immediately if you find her.

531
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,320
Do you understand?

532
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

533
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,970
How did she ever fall for someone like you?

534
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
Are you okay?

535
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm fine.

536
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,180
I'll go outside to make a call.

537
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,160
Scumbag.

538
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,800
Hello.

539
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,450
The number you have dialed is powered off.

540
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,320
I'm done eating, so I'll head back now.

541
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,020
Let me walk you out.

542
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,280
Go find your wife.

543
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,290
I'm leaving.

544
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,639
Hello?

545
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,420
Who's calling?

546
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,000
Hello, officer.

547
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,370
Is this Qin Kaixuan?

548
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
Yes, it's me.

549
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,120
Get out of the car and show me your ID.

550
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,480
Okay.

551
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,560
Check the trunk.

552
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,800
Comrade Qin Kaixuan.

553
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,680
Come with us.

554
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,600
Officer.

555
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,240
What do you need me for?

556
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,180
We need to ask you some questions.

557
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,520
I understand. Okay.

558
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,240
Chairman.

559
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,920
We came here to

560
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,040
Didn't I tell you?

561
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,240
To help me inspect the goods.

562
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,210
Let's go.

563
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,460
We'll talk after getting out.

564
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,680
Mr. Duan.

565
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,600
Please.

566
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,400
[Cast]

567
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:43,720
Xuan Lu as Su Ran

568
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:43,920
as

569
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,440
