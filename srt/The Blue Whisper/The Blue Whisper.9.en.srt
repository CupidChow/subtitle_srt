00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,000
Unless I'm willing to do so,

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,500
or even if I die, you can't cut off my tail.

15
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,700
Things have become like this, you still want to resist?

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
Li Shu has died.

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,700
Blue Feather Phoenix has escaped with Xue Sanyue.

18
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,200
No one can help you now.

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
Li Shu died?

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,200
The hero died by saving the beauty.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, let me tell you another thing.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Ji Yunhe's Frost mark seal was triggered.

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,600
If there is no antidote, she can't survive for three days.

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,800
If you don't want her to be frozen and sleep forever,

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,800
you need to cut your tail to save her.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,200
What's this Frost mark he mentioned?

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,500
If you don't believe me, someone will prove it for you.

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,700
But don't let me wait for too long.

29
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,000
Go to see Yunhe!

30
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,700
Young Master.

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
What is a Frost mark?

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,500
Why would Yunhe have that? Did you put that mark on her?

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,000
You said you need me to help you save Yunhe.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Why are you hurting her now?

35
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,800
If you really want to save Ji Yunhe, there is something you can't attend or ask...

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
because it's beyond your control.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Say it clearly.

38
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,200
Qu Xiaoxing, there isn't much time left for you.

39
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,500
Do you still want to talk with me, or do you want to see her yourself?

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,200
Make your choice.

41
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,700
<i>Here is the antidote.</i>

42
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,800
<i>But how and when to use this antidote,</i>

43
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,400
<i>Haoqing, you need to think about it.</i>

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
<i>You need to sacrifice something to gain the thing you want.</i>

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
<i>If you want to gain something,</i>

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,600
<i>you need to pay the same price.</i>

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,000
<i>I hope you can live up to the expectation of me and Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
Chang Yi...

49
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,800
Luo Luo.

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,300
I feel the merman pearl inside me telling me...

51
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
Chang Yi is feeling hurt.

52
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,200
It must be Lin Haoqing.

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,800
Lin Haoqing must be torturing him.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Stop, Yunhe.

55
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,800
The barrier is so strong. You can't open it.

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,700
But Chang Yi...

57
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,800
Yunhe! Yunhe!

58
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
Yunhe, what happened?

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,500
Master said you're here to heal your wound.

60
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Why did he lock you here?

61
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
It's not strange.

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,200
I've always been the tool of his son.

63
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,400
So the Frost mark that Young Master mentioned is true?

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Did Master plant the Frost mark on you?

65
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Is that Frost mark related to the antidote you stole that day?

66
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
Stop asking questions. Think of a solution.

67
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Yunhe is freezing now.

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,600
Qu Xiaoxing, can you do me a favor?

69
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Of course. I'm standing right here.

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
<i>Just say it. What can I do?</i>

71
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,200
Tell me. Did Lin Haoqing use me as an excuse to ask Chang Yi to cut off his tail?

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,800
How did you know that?

73
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,200
Tell Chang Yi not to believe anyone.

74
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll be fine.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
- But you are...
- The merman must be willing to cut off his tail.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Since Lin Canglan chose to torture me with the Frost mark,

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,700
it means I'm the only excuse

78
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
that he can use to make Chang Yi cut off his tail.

79
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,600
<i>He has no other solution now.</i>

80
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,700
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

81
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,800
He won't really kill me.

82
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
He is just bluffing.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,600
- But...
- Luo Luo.

84
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,400
The pain means nothing to me.

85
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,700
But as for Chang Yi,

86
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,800
he comes from the deep sea.

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,600
He is proud of that tail.

88
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,200
If the tail is destroyed, he won't be happy anymore.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,200
Yunhe, are you sure you want to take the risk?

90
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,500
- If...
<i>- There is no such assumption.</i>

91
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,600
We are friends.

92
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,200
Do you believe me or Lin Haoqing?

93
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,610
I believe you.

94
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,100
<i>I will go now.</i>

95
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Young Master, Qu Xiaoxing has visited Guardian Ji.

96
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,300
What should we do next?

97
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,800
How's Guardian Ji?

98
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,500
She is weak and has spat blood sometimes.

99
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Prepare all the things that she needs,

100
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,400
in case someone may say we maltreated Guardian Ji.

101
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,300
Okay.

102
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,500
What about the merman?

103
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,200
Just let him be more worried about her.

104
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
Okay.

105
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,600
How's Yunhe?

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Yunhe does have a Frost mark,

107
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,600
but she asked me to tell you not to believe anyone else.

108
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,100
If you give in easily, she will be punished as well.

109
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,500
As long as you don't let them cut off your tail, she will be fine.

110
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,400
Do you understand?

111
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Does she hurt?

112
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,300
Take me to see her.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,400
If I can't see her, I'll worry about her.

114
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't make it hard for me.

115
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Okay. I won't make it hard for you.

116
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,500
<i>Yunhe is willing to suffer torture for this merman.</i>

117
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,900
<i>If he is injured, she will surely be sad.</i>

118
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Enough!

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can take you to see her.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,300
But let's make a deal.

121
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,000
You can only see her, don't try to save her

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
or you'll both be in trouble.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Okay.

124
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,300
Lin Haoqing, what are you doing?

125
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
Let me go! Let me go!

126
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Because of your recklessness, do you know how much pain Ji Yunhe is suffering?

127
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,600
I know you can't go back to the sea if you cut off your tail.

128
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
But which one is more painful?

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,300
Losing your tail or losing Ji Yunhe?

130
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,400
Yunhe told me not to believe you.

131
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,000
The second day is coming.

132
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,100
Yunhe, how are you?

133
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,500
Any news from the outside?

134
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
There has been no movement.

135
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
I guess Qu Xiaoxing has told Chang Yi about it.

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
That's good.

137
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,500
- That's good.
- You look like you are freezing to death.

138
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,000
Are you sure you will risk your life for Chang Yi?

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,600
Luo Luo, you don't know.

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Before we were caught,

141
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,000
I went to a beautiful place with him.

142
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,200
It felt like I left Thousand Flower Valley

143
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,800
and was living the life I wanted.

144
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,000
When I recall those memories now,

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,200
I still feel warm,

146
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,300
so I won't be that cold.

147
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,500
I think I can survive this.

148
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,600
Then, is there no hope

149
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
for you and me to live on Immortal Island?

150
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Luo Luo...

151
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm just kidding.

152
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,400
Here is a cup of hot water.

153
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Just drink it.

154
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,260
Luo Luo, you're still so careless.

155
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,060
There is no water in this cup.

156
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,600
Yunhe, what's wrong with your eyes?

157
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,760
<i>Ji Yunhe, you are such a cruel person,</i>

158
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,300
<i>to me and to yourself.</i>

159
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,700
<i>Where is my tail?</i>

160
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,940
<i>Why can't my legs change to the tail?</i>

161
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,080
Chang Yi.

162
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,400
Father.

163
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,180
Chang Yi, you betrayed the mermen and the sea.
<i>[King of Mermen]</i>

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,620
No, I didn't. You told me that when I meet the one I love,

165
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,280
I need to protect her and be loyal to her my whole life.

166
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,760
My son, there is no gain without losing anything.

167
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,340
You've given her the merman pearl and lost your tail.

168
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,780
You can never go back to the sea.

169
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,100
It's not like that, Father! It's not like that!

170
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,160
Father! Father!

171
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,700
Father!

172
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,040
Yunhe?

173
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,700
Have you thought about it?

174
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,060
<i>Don't believe anyone.</i>

175
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,720
<i>If you give in easily, she will be punished as well.</i>

176
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,140
<i>As long as you don't let them cut off your tail, she will be fine.</i>

177
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,960
<i>Do you understand?</i>

178
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,600
So you will believe anything she says?

179
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,720
Okay. I'll take you to see Ji Yunhe.

180
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,640
Yunhe!

181
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Don't struggle. It's useless.

182
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,540
Even if I let you in, you can't save her.

183
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,580
What's happened to her?

184
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,980
The cold aura rose up and caused her to go blind.

185
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,820
Eventually, her meridians will freeze and her blood will stop flowing.

186
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,900
At last, she will freeze and sleep forever.

187
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
Yunhe!

188
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,400
Yunhe.

189
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,840
You're the only one that can save her now.

190
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,580
You told me that they were just scaring you.

191
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,280
Why are you frozen now?

192
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,720
Don't cry.

193
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,960
If this is my destiny,

194
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,740
don't tell Chang Yi about it.

195
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,540
If he trusts me for one more day,

196
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,460
he'll survive one more day.

197
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,960
No... I don't want anything to happen to you.

198
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,500
Help! Help!

199
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,840
- Help!
- Save her!

200
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,820
- Cut off your tail, then I'll save her!
<i>- Help!</i>

201
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,160
<i>Help!</i>

202
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,840
Which one is more important? Her words or her life?

232
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,600
The tail of a merman has become this pearl.

233
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,700
Take care of it, then give it to Fairy Shunde.

234
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,720
Give me the antidote.

235
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,300
Step aside.

236
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,660
It seems God shows some sympathy for me,

237
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,720
so that I can dream of you before I die.

238
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,760
You're not dreaming.

239
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,720
Chang Yi, how did you get in here?

240
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,860
I told you not to believe anyone else.

241
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,900
Why didn't you listen to me?

242
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,400
If a merman cuts off his tail, it means he has betrayed the Merman Clan.

243
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,120
He can never go back to the sea. Don't you want to go home?

244
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,780
I want to go home,

245
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,340
but I don't want you to die.

246
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,400
Chang Yi. Chang Yi!

247
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,480
Luo Luo, come here.

248
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,060
Take care of Chang Yi for me.

249
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,000
Yunhe!

250
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,640
Lin Haoqing!

251
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,740
Step back!

252
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,820
You're so crooked.

253
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,180
Are you feeling better now?

254
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,620
Stop pretending to care about me.

255
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,520
This is just between us.

256
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,920
If you hate me, you can take revenge on me.

257
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,240
How can you use such a crooked method to harm an innocent person?

258
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,380
Ji Yunhe, think about it!

259
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,060
It's our duty to do such things as Spiritual Masters!

260
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,960
How could you almost die for a merman?

261
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,800
I don't care what you say.

262
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,200
All I want is to win.

263
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,920
Now we are even.

264
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,380
You weren't like this before.

265
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,520
This is the young master that everyone wants.

266
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,160
Guardian Ji, you've just recovered so get some good rest.

267
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,860
Take the merman to Reflect Cave.

268
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,000
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

269
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,520
Stop!

270
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,600
No one shall go in there.

271
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,660
You really like him.

272
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,840
Whatever.

273
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,920
But think about it. When you want to protect someone, consider your ability first,

274
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,380
in case you get injured because of it.

275
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,560
Why are you injured?

276
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm fine.

277
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,160
Ji Yunhe did it?

278
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,400
Are you satisfied with this now, Father?

279
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,260
Well done.

280
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Haoqing, you hate me.

281
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,740
I dare not.

282
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,300
Of course, you dare.

283
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,320
You dare to criticize me,

284
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,640
but you don't dare to face me?

285
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,060
I've always wondered.

286
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,900
How do thousands of ordinary fathers and sons live outside the valley?

287
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,500
Is their relation just like ours?

288
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,300
Is it so cold and with no affection?

289
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,100
You were born from an Immortal family,

290
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,160
and will be the master of Thousand Flower Valley.

291
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,700
Why are you envying those ordinary people?

292
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,140
The owner of Thousand Flower Valley?

293
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,780
I've heard a forbidden spell.

294
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,960
Poisonous snakes are put in a pot and they feed on each other.

295
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,100
The final winner will be the most poisonous snake.

296
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,400
Sometimes, I would think...

297
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,420
whether I'm in Thousand Flower Valley or your pot.

298
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,280
Watch your words, Young Master.

299
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,600
Master is your father.

300
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,620
I was born in Thousand Flower Valley and became your son.

301
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,580
Is it fortune or misfortune?

302
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,520
Qing Shu.

303
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,000
- Master.
- Let's go out for a walk.

304
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,540
Okay.

305
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,120
Did I ask you to bring me here?

306
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,320
You often come here when you are upset, Master.

307
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,040
This place was Young Master's favorite place in the past.

308
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,100
When Haoqing was little, he often asked me to play with him here.

309
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,000
And he leaned on my knees and said that

310
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,920
he would help me when he grew up.

311
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,320
But after that thing,

312
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,780
we were not as close as we used to be.

313
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,220
Have you ever regretted that you educated Young Master this way?

314
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,880
It's a pity that a father and son became like this.

315
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,580
But he is still my son.

316
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,840
Things have become like this.

317
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,340
He has no other choice now.

318
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,440
Let's go. Never come to this place in the future.

319
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,520
Master, why are you so harsh on each other?

320
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,420
Drowning in the past will only make us weak.

321
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,800
Haoqing can't, and neither can I.

322
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,240
Whether it's pity or not, we have no choice since we are in the Lin Family.

323
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,820
For the Lin Family,

324
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,620
he needs to sacrifice, tolerate,

325
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,320
and suffer from loneliness and sadness.

326
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,780
Okay.

327
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,320
How is he? Is his fever gone?

328
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,260
His fever is gone,

329
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,840
but I don't know when he will wake up.

330
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,060
Yunhe, are you okay?

331
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,820
My heart aches.

332
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,000
It feels like thousands of worms have entered

333
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,940
and they are biting me, so I can't breathe.

334
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,540
I told you it's not good to fall in love.

335
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,260
Is there really no way for him to recover his tail?

336
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,500
Sorry, Yunhe. I looked through many books, but I couldn't find a way for him to recover it.

337
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,180
And back then, the reason why Fairy Shunde wanted his tail

338
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,260
was that she wanted to punish him

339
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,680
and never let him go back to the sea.

340
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,660
It's also because she likes his tail.

341
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,660
She likes the Scale Dress that can be made from his tail.

342
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:44,360
It really costs a lot only because Fairy Shunde likes it.

343
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,020
She even can distort the truth.

344
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,660
What do you want to do?

345
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,540
Since he can cultivate the merman pearl,

346
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,240
he must be special in the Merman Clan.

347
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,460
Even if he cut off his tail, his clan won't abandon him easily.

348
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,460
I want to find others. I want to take Chang Yi back home.

349
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,460
Lin Canglan is keeping a watch on you now.

350
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,000
We can't even get out of Thousand Flower Valley.

351
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,380
How could we go to the East Sea?

352
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,620
I owe him for what he is now.

353
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,560
I need to pay what I owe him.

354
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,160
Let me go, Luo Luo.

355
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,640
- Luo Luo.
- If you really think you owe me,

356
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,020
I'm the one to decide how you'll pay me back.

357
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,340
Don't you want to go home?

358
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,860
It's okay if I can't go back.

359
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,260
The place where I feel relieved is home.

360
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,580
My home is where you are.

361
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,640
You're good at talking now, why do you still want to learn it?

362
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,980
You're still injured. I'll help you.

363
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,220
Does it still hurt?

364
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,760
Yes.

365
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,640
- Yunhe...
- I'm sorry.

366
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,720
Lin Haoqing forced me, and I cut off my own tail.

367
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,880
Why are you apologizing?

368
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,840
It's all because of me.

369
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,060
If it weren't for me,

370
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,940
Lin Haoqing wouldn't be like this.

371
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,620
Why do you say so?

372
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,380
When I was sent to Thousand Flower Valley,

373
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,360
Lin Haoqing was not the way he is now.

374
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,960
Haoqing, you want to have a sister. Right?

375
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,420
Her name is Ji Yunhe.

376
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,600
She will be your sister in the future.

377
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,300
Don't be afraid. You can call me Brother Haoqing.

378
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,800
It likes to bite flowers and leaves,

379
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,680
so its name is Huahua.

380
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,400
Don't be afraid. Touch it.

381
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,900
When I first came to Thousand Flower Valley, I was lonely and afraid.

382
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,260
I would cry in the Flower Sea.

383
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,720
Lin Haoqing would find me crying in the Flower Sea.

384
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,100
<i>Yunhe.</i>

385
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,800
He gave me Huahua that he liked most,

386
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,960
and let it company me.

387
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,240
Lin Haoqing liked Huahua most.

388
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,820
But one night, Lin Canglan found Lin Haoqing

389
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,980
and asked him to kill Huahua.

390
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,580
Lin Haoqing wouldn't do that.

391
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,540
Then Qing Shu beat him, but he still wouldn't do it.

392
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,900
Lin Canglan told him...

393
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,940
<i>You can only choose one of them, Huahua or Ji Yunhe?</i>

394
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,680
<i>Senior. Senior, help.</i>

395
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,420
<i>Senior, help.</i>

396
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,860
<i>Please don't, Father. I'm begging you, Father.</i>

397
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:56,260
<i>Haoqing, only a strong man can protect the things he treasures.</i>

398
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,280
<i>Have you made your choice?</i>

399
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,240
<i>Qing Shu.</i>

400
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,660
<i>No!</i>

401
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,340
<i>Don't look down, Yunhe.</i>

402
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,080
Lin Haoqing got seriously ill because he was so sad.

403
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,340
When he woke up, he was not as happy as he used to be.

404
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,600
But Lin Canglan was still not satisfied.

405
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,940
Actually, Huahua and I were tools to train Lin Haoqing.

406
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,220
Lin Canglan said Lin Haoqing was too weak.

407
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,539
The death of Huahua was not enough.

408
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,620
<i>Then, you need to push him off.</i>

409
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,820
<i>No. No.</i>

410
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,619
<i>I won't...</i>

411
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,920
Lin Canglan asked me to take Lin Haoqing to cultivate in a cave.

412
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,680
There is a Snake Cave in that cave.

413
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,480
He asked me to push Lin Haoqing into that Snake Cave.

414
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,220
That's when the Frost mark hurt me for the first time.

415
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,980
I didn't want to do that.

416
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,080
I suffered for two days.

417
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,980
When I was dying,

418
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,700
Lin Canglan told me, even if it was not me...

419
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,140
<i>Others would do this thing as well.</i>

420
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,590
I took the antidote.

421
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,260
Since then,

422
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,980
I became Lin Canglan's tool.

423
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,840
Actually, I had the last glimmer of hope.

424
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,000
I thought Lin Haoqing would hate me because of Huahua.

425
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,480
I thought he wouldn't go to the cave with me.

426
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,060
But Lin Haoqing said

427
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,100
that it wasn't my fault.

428
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,040
He said the only thing he could find comfort in this matter

429
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,420
was that he could save me at least.

430
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,760
Thus, he went to the mountain with me.

431
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,360
<i>Don't be afraid, Yunhe. I'm here to protect you.</i>

432
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,000
Then I understood.

433
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,680
Lin Canglan wants a cruel and ruthless son.

434
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,880
- If Lin Haoqing can't become what he wants...
<i>- Yunhe, help.</i>

435
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,280
<i>- Yunhe.</i>
- ...then such things... would never end.

436
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,820
So when Lin Haoqing asked for my help again,

437
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,080
I made my choice.

438
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,620
<i>- Why were you born to be Young Master of Thousand Flower Vally,
- Yunhe, help.</i>

439
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,460
<i>but I have to follow you?</i>

440
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,640
<i>Just stay here, Lin Haoqing.</i>

441
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,740
From then on, it seemed the old Lin Haoqing died in that Snake Cave.

442
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,140
After he was saved,

443
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,180
it seemed he was possessed by a snake.

444
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,740
Brother Haoqing no longer existed.

445
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,540
I thought I made the right decision.

446
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,360
Because from then on, Lin Canglan never tried to embarrass Lin Haoqing again.

447
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,560
But, Chang Yi, my choice hurt you.

448
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,660
Actually, I made you lose your tail.

449
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,380
Don't think too much.

450
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,440
You won't feel hurt after I pat you.

451
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,100
Just cry.

452
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,380
In front of me, there is no need to disguise yourself.

453
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,420
- Master.
- How's Ji Yunhe?

454
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,600
She survived three days and was almost frozen,

455
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,820
but she didn't want to compromise.

456
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,960
After she took the antidote,

457
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,680
she almost recovered.

458
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,940
Ji Yunhe, let me tell you!

459
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,620
You should never push me like that again.

460
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,280
I just wanted to help you.

461
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,100
My bottom still aches now.

462
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,100
Luo Luo, Chang Yi cut off his tail and lost much spiritual power.

463
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,720
He is weak now.

464
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,320
I want him to stay here and rest.

465
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,040
If anyone asks about it, just tell him I'm teaching him manners when facing Fairy Shunde.

466
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,180
Take out all the spirit stones.

467
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,700
Tell the elders about it, and let those guards move to another place.

468
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,040
Okay.

469
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,880
But I'm worried that they won't coordinate with us.

470
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,400
Then ask them, if anything were to happen to the merman

471
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,780
and Fairy Shunde asks about it, can they take the responsibility?

472
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,100
Well, save some spirit stones.

473
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,900
I need to change some spirit pills for Chang Yi.

474
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,500
Okay.

475
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,220
Wait. We only have a few spirit stones.

476
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,240
Some will be given to the elders and some will be given to him.

477
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,300
What about ours?

478
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,300
Yunhe, don't.

479
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,500
Do you want to see our Immortal Island become an illusion?

480
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,340
Is it time to worry about this?

481
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,780
Ji Yunhe, you've changed.

482
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,500
The thing that matters is not Immortal Island,

483
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,540
is the people that will go to the island with me.

484
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,040
You were the only one with me before.

485
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,240
Now we have to take him as well.

486
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,600
Whether I will live or die in the third round,

487
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,880
I'll take him to leave here.

488
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,160
<i>Ji Yunhe, since Huahua died, I only have you now.</i>

489
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,740
<i>Why did you betray me as well?</i>

490
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,660
<i>You hesitated and wouldn't do it,</i>

491
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,080
<i>so I asked Qing Shu to help you.</i>

492
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,460
<i>But you shouldn't do redundant things.</i>

493
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,180
<i>Yunhe, the Lin Haoqing in Snake Cave must die.</i>

494
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,960
<i>Only by becoming the ruthless Young Master in father's mind,</i>

495
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,500
<i>can I protect you.</i>

496
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,240
<i>Even if it means that I have to be your enemy.</i>

497
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,930
♫ <i>Each pair of eyes belongs to a merman</i>♫

498
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,700
