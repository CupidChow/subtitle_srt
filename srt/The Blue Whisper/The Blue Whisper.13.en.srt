Immortal Chengyu.

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,660
Just in time, Guardian Ji.

15
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,240
The merman asked to meet Fairy for a favor. And he wants you to be there.

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,440
I was going to invite you there.

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,740
Immortal, sorry, but I'm sick. I'd better keep my distance from Fairy.

18
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,920
How about I stand outside the door?

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,500
That works, too. I'll tell them about it.

20
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,620
Why are you involved in this?

21
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,660
What is Chang Yi up to?

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,660
You bold merman. Fairy is in a good mood today.

23
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,480
That's why she agreed to your request.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,140
But you keep her waiting!

25
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,060
You shall be punished for this.

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,140
Fairy, Ji Yunhe is here.

27
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,860
But she's sick.

28
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,160
It's better for her to wait outside the door.

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,760
Now, tell me. What do you have to present me?

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,860
If you waste my precious time, your life will be in danger.

31
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,720
I've thought about this for days about how to cheer you up.

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,140
Sadly, I only have a talent for singing.

33
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,940
It's said that the singing of mermen is one of a kind.

34
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,540
That's intriguing.

You've done everything you could for him. Look at him.

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,180
Presenting a song to Fairy!

42
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,980
Ungrateful!

43
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,400
Chang Yi once told me, this is a song about freedom.

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,400
He's not singing it to Fairy Shunde.

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,150
He's singing it to me.

46
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,000
Marvelous. Give out my order. Thousand Flower Valley shall be rewarded.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,860
You said it that as long as I cheered you up, you would redeem my wish.

48
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,260
Exactly. What do you want?

49
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,960
I will join you at Immortal Master Mansion on Lutai Mountain.

50
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,460
I wish that you could spare Ji Yunhe's life.

51
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,080
That's a piece of cake.

52
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,740
However, you haven't given me your merman pearl.

53
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,140
Why would I agree to it?

54
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,880
The pearl is invaluable to a merman. It shall not be given out abruptly.

55
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,320
We'd better select an auspicious day after going back to Immortal Master Mansion.

56
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,700
What's so special about it?

57
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,700
The merman pearls only reside inside talented mermen.

58
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,400
It would take years of cultivation to form one pearl.

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
As such, it's very precious.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,580
It's too precious a gift.

61
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,520
A merman only gives out his pearl to express his deepest affection.

62
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,240
We never take it back.

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,060
Under no condition will we betray the recipient.

64
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,580
I wish that the recipient can get what she seeks.

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,100
Now that it's so precious, I'll have you present it to me

66
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,220
in a grand ceremony to exhibit my grace.

67
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,880
I'm tired. You're dismissed.

68
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,100
Shall I bring Guardian Ji back?

69
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,920
Don't bother.

70
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,560
Are you crazy?

71
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,940
The way Fairy looks at him, you've seen it.

72
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,260
You will be sentenced to death if you set him free.

73
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,280
My life is miserable enough. I have nothing to lose.

74
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,940
All she can do is make me stagger.

75
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,020
I don't care.

76
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,240
But Fairy is a crazy woman.

77
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,320
I'm afraid she'll blame it on Thousand Flower Valley.

78
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,020
What's your plan?

79
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,700
Please escort Chang Yi with me.

80
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,660
On the way, I will take off the chains on Chang Yi.

81
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,880
By that time, please take him away.

82
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,780
Once Fairy finds it out, she'll call you on the carpet.

83
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,180
Just blame it on me.

84
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm afraid I'll be executed, but that makes me the only victim.

85
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,160
That would be a perfect plan.

86
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,740
Why?

87
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,340
Why are you doing this for him?

88
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,200
You value his life much more than yours.

89
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,140
But there are people who are counting on you!

90
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,540
But I'm dying soon anyway.

91
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,060
This is not the Ji Yunhe I know!

92
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,480
Ji Yunhe would never give up.

93
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,860
Right.

94
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,920
I want to live on.

95
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,440
I fought against destiny, resisted, and competed for what I wanted.

96
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,360
I want my life to deserve the beautiful flowers I enjoyed, the food I had, and the journey I took.

97
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,540
I don't want to die.

98
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,120
But it's a solid truth.

99
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,300
That's not how it works!

100
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,140
I couldn't find a solution in the book, but I can ask Immortal Master for help!

101
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,640
He's extremely powerful.

102
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,780
- Maybe he...
- Senior, I want to live badly.

103
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,000
But I'll never have you bend your knees to the enemy.

104
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,380
I will get revenge for my family tragedy.

105
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,880
I will make him pay for what he did to this valley.

106
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,800
But if we don't take this chance,

107
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Ji Yunhe will be gone forever.

108
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,410
If by taking this suffering, your life can be saved,

109
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,460
I'm more than willing to do it.

110
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,400
But I don't want it!

111
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,450
I owe you enough.

112
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,760
I cannot repay you.

113
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,879
Is it worth it?

114
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,440
I've made up my mind a long time ago.

115
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
Since that day, the question of worth was out of my mind.

116
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,980
To be honest, when I first knew that my disease was incurable,

117
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,280
I was afraid.

118
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,760
Fortunately, someone just told me he wishes I could get what I seek.

119
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,140
I yearn for freedom.

120
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,680
But I never had it.

121
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,180
If he could be free again,

122
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,980
I will take that as my last wish.

123
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,620
It's worth it.

124
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,200
Being punished by thunder or by Frost,

125
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,020
I'll take it.

126
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,920
I'm not afraid if it's for his good.

127
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,260
Why don't you believe me?

128
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,100
I do.

129
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,700
But we live in this lousy world.

130
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,360
There are times when we try everything we can yet get nothing in return.

131
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,180
You've done your best to save my life.

132
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,040
In the few days left, I wish I could squander it freely.

133
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,340
Please fulfill my wish.

134
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,960
Luo Luo.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,640
My future path is uncertain.

136
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,140
You don't have to follow me.

137
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,820
Without me, you'd run out of money soon and starve!

138
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Ji Yunhe, I'm your servant.

139
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,980
I stick to you. You can't get rid of me.

140
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,240
Luo Luo, thank you.

141
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Yunhe, Chang Yi is so stubborn.

142
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,880
Are you sure you can set him free without you by his side?

143
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm the greatest Spiritual Master!

144
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,040
This will be the last time to practice taming.

145
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,360
He will listen.

146
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,200
We're setting off tomorrow.

147
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,000
Make sure he's tied up.

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Use all the chains we have.

149
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Once a merman comes ashore, he's no longer precious.

150
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Right now, he's just a servant with no manners.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,600
Do not use that on him!

152
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,800
Are you disobeying me?

153
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,000
I dare not.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
It's just that Fairy doesn't like the chains.

155
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,700
It must have slipped your mind.

156
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,000
What's more, Fairy cherishes him so much.

157
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We must be careful with transportation.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,400
We shall use the fanciest stuff for escort.

159
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Only that lives up to Fairy's standard.

160
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,200
Fairy is on her way back to Lutai Mountain

161
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
because Immortal Master will come out of seclusion.

162
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm in sole charge of escorting the merman.

163
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,800
You're only a low Spiritual Master.

164
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,400
It's not your decision to make.

165
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Ji Yunhe, this merman is still vulgar.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,400
You'll be punished for sure if he hurts Fairy.

167
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,000
I won't harm Fairy!

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,400
Don't you think about hurting her!

169
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000
You!

170
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,800
Tie them up together!

171
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,100
Calm down, Envoy Zhang.

172
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,000
The merman is tamed. It's a cheerful accomplishment.

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,400
I don't want you to be offended by them.

174
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
I'll take it from here if that's okay with you.

175
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,000
Thanks, Immortal Chengyu.

176
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,500
He'll be sent to the Fairy soon.

177
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,200
I wish I could take a walk with him in Thousand Flower Valley.

178
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
Sure.

179
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,600
What if I let him loose?

180
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,000
Fairy Shunde left a mark on the merman.

181
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,900
You cannot run away from her.

182
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,300
Besides, I've witnessed your connection.

183
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm sure he wouldn't run away

184
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,600
and make you suffer.

185
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,100
Thanks.

186
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,100
To my surprise, you stick to your decision firmly.

187
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,200
I've thought about your suggestion.

188
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,000
We stand a higher chance of meeting again in this way.

189
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,700
We might escape together later.

190
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,300
Later...

191
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
I used to dream about getting out.

192
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,100
The scenery here in Thousand Flower Valley has made me bored.

193
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,600
However, I hate having to leave here now.

194
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,000
Is it because I'm by your side?

195
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,100
The virtue of modesty never runs in the merfolks clan, right?

196
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,600
Chang Yi, what will happen if a merman lost his spouse?

197
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Will they remarry?

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,800
We only have one partner for our whole life.

199
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,400
Why is that?

200
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,200
That would be lonely, swimming in the sea alone.

201
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,600
You're not a mermaid. You don't live in the sea, either.

202
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,800
Don't be bounded by our tradition.

203
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Well... What if you hate someone?

204
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,400
Will you splash water on her laying a curse, turning her into a turtle?

205
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Hatred is like foam.

206
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,400
It will disperse soon.

207
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,200
What about it?

208
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,400
I'm wondering if Shunde would turn into a turtle in her next life.

209
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,600
<i>[Encyclopedia]</i>

210
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,100
Why are you holding this encyclopedia?

211
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
If you like it that much, I can get you a new one.

212
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,400
One with gold foil? Whatever you want.

213
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,900
We read this book together. It's unique.

214
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,700
It's a pity that we can't visit the places recorded.

215
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,400
Who says we can't?

216
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,500
On our way to Lutai Mountain, we can visit all the places recorded in this book. What do you think?

217
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,800
Shunde is eager to get us to Lutai Mountain.

218
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,300
She wouldn't allow us to enjoy our journey.

219
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Besides, they're not on the way.

220
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,600
By walking, one makes the road.

221
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Wherever you want to go, just name it.

222
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,700
It's well-known that mermen have only one partner for their whole life.

223
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,800
Living happily ever after may not work for us.

224
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Still, we can go for the next best thing.

225
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,100
Seize the day, don't waste it.

226
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,300
Cherish the time we have now, shall we?

227
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,800
Immortal Chengyu.

228
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,700
I heard that Fairy Shunde wants to present treasures to Immortal Master.

229
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,600
He will come out in a few days.

230
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,800
Is it possible to visit the Human Realm on our journey to Lutai Mountain.

231
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,600
I would like to make a contribution by collecting treasures there

232
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,300
and presenting them to Fairy Shunde.

233
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,200
It also shows Thousand Flower Valley's loyalty.

234
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,100
That's not your decision to make!

235
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,000
If you're overdue, you'd...

236
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,100
That's acceptable.

237
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,300
Immortal Chengyu, I don't think that's appropriate.

238
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,200
All roads will lead back to their origin.

239
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,400
As long as we get to Lutai Mountain in time,

240
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,800
it doesn't matter which path we take.

241
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,100
But I must make this clear.

242
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,400
You shall not cast spiritual spells in the Human Realm.

243
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,100
We must take a carriage on our way.

244
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,000
But keep the time limit in mind.

245
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,800
Don't lose your senses because of greed.

246
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, Immortal.

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Immortal, this way, please.

248
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,300
Let's go.

249
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
<i>Li Shu has been acting wild recently.</i>

250
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,200
<i>He deserves the death sentence.</i>

251
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,800
<i>Thankfully, he still stands a chance.</i>

252
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

253
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,800
<i>You may go to Daiyu and fetch me some spirit herbs.</i>

254
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,300
<i>Maybe, his body can be restored.</i>

255
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,600
<i>Lynx clan!</i>

256
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,000
A Spiritual Master!

257
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,700
Let's go!

258
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,700
Hurry!

259
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Keep running!

260
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,400
Please, Master. Spare our lives.

261
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,600
We didn't harm anyone.

262
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
My wife... she's pregnant.

263
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,800
She can't survive it!

264
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,200
Capture me if you have to.

265
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,000
No way. We're a family.

266
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,300
We will never be apart.

267
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,800
Master, we're making a living by catching fire mice

268
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,000
and making flame-glowing leather from their skins.

269
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,200
We work hard to make a living.

270
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
We observe law and discipline, we have never harmed anyone.

271
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,800
Please spare us.

272
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,200
Don't send us to Thousand Flower Valley, please.

273
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,600
<i>I'm no longer a Spiritual Master of Thousand Flower Valley now.</i>

274
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,200
Thank you, Master!

275
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,300
Thank you for sparing us.

276
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,500
- Thank you!
- Thanks!

277
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
<i>[Juyue Hotel]</i>

278
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,900
Master, if you don't mind,

279
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,700
you can come to our place for rest today.

280
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
Fish soup?

281
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,700
Our food is quite simple. Fish is all we have.

282
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,000
Sorry for being bad hosts.

283
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,300
Dear, are you hurt?

284
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,700
Hold on.

285
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Let me apply this.

286
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Be more careful.

287
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,200
<i>With my beloved one,</i>

288
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,400
<i>even the chores are joyful enough.</i>

289
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
<i>Just tell me.</i>

290
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,400
<i>Do you like this present?</i>

291
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
It's turning red.

292
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,900
Please, be careful.

293
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,200
All right?

294
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,800
I get it.

295
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,800
- I'll be worried.
- It's okay.

296
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Thanks for the reception.

297
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,800
Master! Where are you going?

298
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Do you know the way to Daiyu?

299
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,840
Immortal Chengyu.

300
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,340
Envoy Zhang.

301
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,300
It's only been half a day. This is the third time we have rested.

302
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,000
If we can't get back in time, Fairy will punish us!

303
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,880
Don't worry, I've got this.

304
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,480
Envoy Zhang.

305
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,740
Guardian Ji said that all the treasures collected on the way will be attributed to you.

306
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,680
I envy you so much.

307
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,560
It's such an honor to aid Fairy.

308
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,080
- Do you mind sharing the credit with me?
- Shut up.

309
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,300
You talk too much.

310
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,980
Ji Yunhe is known for being rebellious.

311
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,200
I don't think she'd say such things.

312
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,080
Don't you try to fool me.

313
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,820
I don't want any accidents!

314
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,940
Envoy Zhang.

315
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,200
Envoy Zhang, be careful! What's wrong?

316
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
I should have reminded you.

317
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,880
Guardian Ji just caught this beast yesterday. It's not tamed.

318
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,360
Envoy, it's fierce.

319
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,460
Please be extra careful.

320
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,220
How is my pencil mustache?

321
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,240
It's tilted!

322
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,400
Come on! Why is she so officious?

323
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,640
Secure the beast!

324
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,700
Yes, Envoy.

325
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,880
My mustache!

326
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,880
I can't believe it!

327
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,500
Go check on your mustache!

328
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,040
So annoying!

329
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,920
Enough for the show. He's gone.

330
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,160
Finally, he's away.

331
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,340
I'm tired of putting on an act.

332
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Master.

333
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,940
Are they going out again?

334
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,280
Exactly. They are both too playful.

335
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,140
They go out for a tour at every stop.

336
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,960
Chang Yi will stay in Immortal Master Mansion soon.

337
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,080
It's the last chance for them.

338
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,740
Let them have fun.

339
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,540
I hope this can bluff Envoy Zhang away.

340
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,040
It looks exactly the same as recorded in the encyclopedia.

341
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Only by seeing what it's really like, will we know the fun of it.

342
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,480
Reading it from the book is far from enough!

343
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,180
See if there's anything you like.

344
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,040
Take a look!

345
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,520
Pendants, pretty pendants.

346
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,760
See if you like it.

347
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,720
This one is for you.

348
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,800
I'll take this one.

349
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,360
Both our clothes and accessories should match.

350
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,360
That way, everyone can tell we're traveling together.

351
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,720
That's so considerate of you.

352
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,060
I'll do as you say.

353
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,620
- Here you are.
- But... all the pendants are sold in pairs.

354
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,400
They are meant for couples, so you should buy them in pairs.

355
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,980
The patterns should match.

356
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,320
Besides, you pick a fish and a person.

357
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,920
It's not a match.

358
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,800
Why not?

359
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,800
- But...
- Love is about attraction and appreciation.

360
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,500
There shouldn't be any limits.

361
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,600
Guys, I'll buy all the pendants here for a free giveaway.

362
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,100
Take whatever you like only on one condition.

363
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,520
You don't have to pick two pendants with matched patterns.

364
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,840
Pick the one you like!

365
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,920
<i>- Bravo!
- Bravo!</i>

366
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,440
<i>Come on!</i>

367
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,360
<i>Hurry!</i>

368
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,640
<i>Take it easy!</i>

369
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,300
There's enough for everyone!

370
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,200
<i>- Thanks.
- Here it is.</i>

371
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,040
Now that everyone wears it that way,

372
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
no one will think it's weird.

373
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,060
Maybe it will be the new trend.

374
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
Thank you so much!

375
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,560
Chang Yi, how about leaving our pendants here?

376
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,640
Our future is uncertain.

377
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,840
Leave them here as a mark.

378
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,200
All right.

379
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,080
Whatever you wish for, I'll accomplish it for you.

380
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,240
Yunhe, you just bought so many pendants.

381
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,720
Isn't it costly?

382
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,040
Not at all!

383
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,320
It's worth the money if you like it.

384
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,940
If you like it, we can buy the entire market off.

385
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,640
Take it.

386
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,420
Here's the money!

387
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,800
I'll take them.

388
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,920
- What's wrong?
- Yunhe, that's enough. We've bought enough.

389
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,140
No way. Not until you're satisfied!

390
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,640
The money and the spirit stones don't come for nothing.

391
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,280
I don't want you to spend them recklessly, and make ends meet once I'm gone.

392
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,840
We never know what our future will be.

393
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,060
Instead of planning for the uncertain, it's better to savor the moment.

394
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,760
Do you remember what I said before marching?

395
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,420
Seize the day; don't waste it.

396
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,900
Exactly! We used to be so thrifty that we nearly forgot the joy of shopping.

397
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,360
So much talking. Let's go.

398
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,100
- I'll buy whatever you want. Come on.
- Yunhe.

399
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,880
Luo Luo.

400
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,980
What are you doing? You must not come out before they return. Get in.

401
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,600
Get in. It's been such a long time.

402
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,320
I need to answer a call of nature. Just let me out.

403
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,740
I can't hold it.

404
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,040
Let me go.

405
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,040
You kept bluffing me!

406
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,360
You must be planning on an escape!

407
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,440
Spit it out.

408
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,520
Where did Ji Yunhe take the merman to?

409
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,000
Keeping silent?

410
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,640
What did they do wrong?

411
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,760
I'll punish them myself.

412
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,700
You took the merman away in secret. I doubt your intentions.

413
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,420
Don't you get away.

414
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,720
I took the merman to pick some delicacies on the mountain.

415
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,320
They are a tribute to Fairy.

416
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,920
The merman has returned to his tent.

417
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,720
I can't believe Envoy Zhang forbids it.

418
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,720
That would be disrespectful to Fairy.

419
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,340
Enough talking.

420
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,740
You should have asked if we collected some bees.

421
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,820
Ji Yunhe!

422
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,540
Sorry. I should have returned earlier.

423
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,240
Guardian Ji, you left this behind during the collection today.

424
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,560
I've got it here for you.

425
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,520
Turns out, you know everything about what we did.

426
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,140
Why didn't you nail us?

427
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,260
You're the one who tamed the merman.

428
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,120
It's understandable if you're reluctant to leave him.

429
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,980
As long as you don't escape, I won't bother you.

430
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,520
I just want to remind you

431
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,320
that Immortal Master will come out in two days.

432
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,780
We must arrive at Lutai Mountain by that time.

433
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,060
The merman is a dedication to the Immortal Master.

434
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,160
Being nice to him will only hurt you more.

435
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,720
It changes nothing.

436
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,660
Thanks for the reminder.

437
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,100
I will bear it in mind.

438
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,520
- Yunhe!
- You look pale.

439
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,420
Are you all right?

440
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,920
It's a long walk; quite exhausting.

441
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,160
A few more dishes for dinner would be lovely.

442
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,860
Get Lin Haoqing here.

443
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,720
Thanks, Senior.

444
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,280
Your spiritual power is getting wilder.

445
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,800
I felt your pulse. It's a mess.

446
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,220
I'm afraid in a few days, you'll...

447
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,960
If that's so, I must cherish the days left for me.

448
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,700
I want to leave with no regrets.

449
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,640
Ji Yunhe, you're playing with fire!

450
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,260
I've suffered from the Frost for so long.

451
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,180
I could really play with fire.

452
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,400
I'll get you some medicine to ease the pain.

453
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,920
Do you think it still works?

454
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,660
- Let's have a try. Take care of her.
- Okay.

455
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,560
Are you all right?

456
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,200
Why are you so quiet today?

457
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,100
You would have made a fuss saying that I asked for it.

458
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,020
I've seen more smiles on your face than back in Thousand Flower Valley.

459
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,900
Now that you're happy, I don't want to disappoint you.

460
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,040
I just don't get it.

461
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,280
Love costs so many spirit stones.

462
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,640
Why would they keep pursuing it?

463
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,620
Luo Luo, I'm afraid you'll marry the spirit stones.

464
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,060
I'd love it if I could.

465
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,180
If only Chang Yi were like you.

466
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,300
That way, he'd be less hurt.

467
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,800
Are you sure you're all right?

468
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,840
I heard that mermen are born stubborn.

469
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,220
They would rather die than yield.

470
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,920
I've never seen a tamed merman before.

471
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,480
What did Ji Yunhe do to you?

472
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,720
Why do you submit yourself to her?

473
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,460
She didn't tame me.

474
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,620
Nor did I submit myself to her.

475
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,500
If that is so, I shall turn around and head back to Thousand Flower Valley.

476
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,580
No need for that.

477
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,440
As I said, I will not harm Fairy.

478
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,400
Then it's submission.

479
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,180
It's just... out of protection.

480
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,520
Do you know what your choice means?

481
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,260
I do.

482
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,920
Immortal Chengyu, we'll get to Lutai Mountain tomorrow.

483
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,560
May I take him and take a walk around?

484
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,080
I'd love to show him what life is like outside.

485
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,900
Go ahead.

486
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,140
Thanks, Immortal Chengyu.

487
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,840
Cheng Yi, we will depart tomorrow.

488
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,480
Is there anything you want to see?

489
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,420
What do you want to see?

490
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,600
You keep bringing up requirements.

491
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,760
Why are you so modest all of a sudden?

492
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,840
You've shown me to so many places.

493
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,640
I would like to know what you want to see.

494
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,900
I want to know what you like.

495
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,840
It doesn't matter.

496
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,960
Besides, we don't have much time.

497
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,800
Don't waste it on me.

498
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,100
It matters to me.

499
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,080
I want to know you more.

500
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,500
To hear more about your stories.

501
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,520
Let's go then.

502
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,460
The place I want to go is not far.

503
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,420
Hurry. Come on.

504
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,300
Yunhe.

505
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,760
I think you should change your first name.

506
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,120
What should it be?

507
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,600
It should be Feng (wind).

508
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,720
Feng?

509
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,280
Feng can also mean crazy. Am I crazy?

510
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,740
No, just like the wind, you are free and unconstrained.

511
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,520
Sorry, I shouldn't make fun of you.

512
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,960
You're a man of great wisdom.

513
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,780
Sit down.

514
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,020
The ordinary people envy us, the Immortals.

515
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,860
However, we live in a constrained and boring way, holding back our desires.

516
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,780
What's left for a long life is nothing but loneliness.

517
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,440
I admire ordinary people for being free and easy.

518
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,280
Working according to the sunlight,

519
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,020
living with their family peacefully.

520
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,480
That's why I love the mortal realm the most.

521
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,420
Look. Isn't it beautiful?

522
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,060
Yes, beautiful.

523
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
So are you.

524
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,260
What do you mean?

525
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,100
Just like the scenery here, you're attractive, too.

526
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,340
If only this joyful and peaceful moment can last forever.

527
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,500
I wish that all the creatures in this wide world can live in harmony.

528
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,280
I hope that happiness can last as long as the mountain.

529
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,140
Yunhe, what's that?

530
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,460
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival in their realm. There's a lantern fair.

531
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,960
On this day, couples will appreciate the lanterns, the flowers, and the moon.

532
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,820
Want to take a look?

533
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,040
It looks lively and warm.

534
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,780
Just like you.

535
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,780
Then, let's take a look.

536
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,180
Come on.

537
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,360
Guardian Ji, I warned you.

538
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,600
There's no escape from the departure. Don't waste your time.

539
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,960
Promises matter more to me.

540
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,720
I promised Chang Yi to have fun on this journey

541
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,100
and fulfill all his wishes without any regrets.

542
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,700
Is that all?

543
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,300
Of course.

544
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,620
If I was planning on escaping, we'd be long gone.

545
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,640
Why would I travel with you all the way here?

546
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,580
We'll get to the mountain soon.

547
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,440
Please come back by midnight.

548
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,340
You are a smart person. You know the rules.

549
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,620
Thanks, Immortal Chengyu.

550
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,460
Envoy Zhang is still suffering from the sting poison.

551
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,580
Ji Chengyu took him back to the Immortal Master Mansion for treatment first.

552
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,500
Right now, Yunhe and Chang Yi are at the lantern fair.

553
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,880
She asked me to tell you it's about time to carry out the plan.

554
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,560
What is the plan?

555
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,160
What will you do to Chang Yi?

556
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Don't worry, I will take care of her.

557
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,980
Stay here and notify me if anything happens.

558
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,040
<i>- Bravo!
- Great!</i>

559
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,800

00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,780

561

00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,080
<i>- Bravo!
- Marvelous!</i>

563
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,220
Come on!

564
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,180
Look!

565
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,680
<i>Over there! Let's go that way.</i>

566
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,420
Look!

567
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,220
It's pickled sweet garlic, a famous snack.

568
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,360
The smell isn't very pleasant.

569
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,200
But it has a refreshing sweet and sour taste.

570
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,780
It's your loss if you don't try it out.

571
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,360
Come on.

572
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,120
I'd rather skip it.

573
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,320
Take a bite.

574
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,460
- Hurry!
- I'd rather not.

575
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,560
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

576
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,540
Are you on your own? Where are your parents?

577
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,440
You are beautiful.

578
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,820
The flower is for you.

579
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,100
Just like what you said.

580
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,700
Where are you from?

581
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,940
You have the same taste as I do.

582
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,720
You look beautiful, too!

583
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,760
But the flower should be handed to you by him.

584
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,560
Come on!

585
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,700
Thanks for that. It's my pleasure.

586
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,920
Duo Duo, where have you been?

587
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,220
Don't go too far away.

588
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,720
Goldfish toss.

589
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,000
The winner gets the red thread bracelet.

590
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,320
Red thread bracelet!

591
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,880
<i>Do you know that the red thread links true love.</i>

592
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,960
<i>They will never depart.</i>

593
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,100
<i>Once we're tied, we will never lose our way.</i>

594
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,760
<i>That's to say, if I get to come back,</i>

595
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,080
<i>if we could live a long life together, it all depends on you.</i>

596
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,020
Take a look! A red thread bracelet.

597
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,280
Yunhe.

598
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,940
Take a look around!

599
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,200
Goldfish toss. Try your luck.

600
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,620
- Do you want that?
- Try your luck with the goldfish toss.

601
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,460
I'll get it for you.

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,500
I can even get a merman! The goldfish should be a piece of cake!

605
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,320
Look at them! They're gathering around!

607
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,160
Not bad. You've learned to cheat.

608
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,220
I got it from you.

609
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,920
What have I done?

610
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,240
You used to be a pure and innocent merman.

611
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,000
Got it!

612
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,640
Give it to me.

613
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,520
Sure! Sure!
