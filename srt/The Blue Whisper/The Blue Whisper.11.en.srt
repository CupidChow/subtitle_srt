13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,280
Young Master and Ji Yunhe have made a plan.

14
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,440
When Envoy Zhang visits here in three days,

15
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,720
they'll find a chance to carry it out.

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,340
Nice timing.

17
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,440
I can have one more chance to get the antidote,

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,220
and deal with that person one more time for Haoqing.

19
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,080
Put this in the secret room.

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,560
Later, Haoqing will see it.

21
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,120
Qing Shu, how long have you served me?

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,199
I've served you in Beiyuan. It's been over 300 years

23
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,260
since we came to Thousand Flower Valley.

24
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,660
It's really been a long time.

25
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,780
I love the tea you make.

26
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,200
Make the tea for me once more.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,580
Later, maybe I won't be able to have the tea anymore.

28
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,280
Yes.

29
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,280
Qing Shu, if it's successful,

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,480
go back to Beiyuan to reunite with your brother.

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,920
In the future, do whatever you want.

32
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,160
Yes, Sir.

33
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,740
Great. It's worth a try.

34
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,720
Yunhe, I want to have a talk with you alone.

35
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,140
Okay.

36
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,620
Chang Yi, wait for me outside.

37
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Good boy. If you behave well, I will have them make you another outfit. Is that okay?

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,440
Well. Just a moment, then.

39
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,180
A moment. I'm outside. I'll come in soon.

40
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,580
So eager to leave?

41
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,620
I've been living in a cage for a long time. Now I can be free, of course I'm eager to leave here.

42
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,660
What do you want to talk about with me?

43
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,040
Immortal Fairy is bound to win against the merman.

44
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,130
Are you sure to bring him with you?

45
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,000
If he leaves with you, you'll be Immortal Fairy's target.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
You'll be a fugitive for the rest of your life. Is it the freedom you want?

47
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,520
I know.

48
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,340
Maybe next time when we meet,

49
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,120
I won't be a Spiritual Master anymore,

50
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,500
but the target you want to arrest.

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,980
At that time, please show me your mercy.

52
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,440
Can't you stay?

53
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,820
If Father is not Master,

54
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,640
Thousand Flower Valley won't build a cage for you,

55
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,280
but a shelter for you.

56
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,260
Instead of spending your life with a merman,

57
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,480
how about considering others?

58
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,220
I know you are worried about my future.

59
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,880
But I have made the decision.

60
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,660
I won't change my mind.

61
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,720
<i>Chang Yi is one of a kind.</i>

62
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,180
<i>He is my treasure.</i>

63
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,280
If I can live a secluded life with him, I won't regret it.

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,040
That kind of life, you wouldn't like.

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,440
But for me, it's enough.

66
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,920
Yunhe, how do you know what I want

67
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,620
is different from you?

68
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,520
Now it's dangerous. No more small talk.

69
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,740
I just hope at that time,

70
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,940
both of us can get what we want.

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,640
The merman has cut off his tail willingly

72
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,880
and his scales have became a pearl.

73
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,460
They are being presented to Immortal Fairy.

74
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,720
Good.

75
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,240
Great.

76
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,840
Immortal Fairy will be really happy to have this.

77
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,660
You can leave now, I will stay here to serve.

78
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,260
<i>Yes.</i>

79
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,000
This is the antidote Immortal Master grants you this time.

80
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,080
Thanks, Envoy.

81
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,800
Envoy, please tell Immortal Master,

82
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,460
Thousand Flower Valley is always loyal to Immortal Master.

83
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,200
Well. Immortal Master will finish his cultivation.

84
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,840
Immortal Fairy intends to send the merman to Immortal Master as a gift.

85
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,180
Training the merman is really an emergency.

86
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,920
Please don't worry. Thousand Flower Valley will try our best.

87
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,740
Our valley has also prepared some treasures.

88
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,980
Please wait a moment. I'll have the disciples bring them over right now.

89
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,540
How dare you.

90
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,200
Envoy is here! How dare you break in!

91
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,680
Master Qing Shu, Guardian has an emergency.

92
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,800
So please come and discuss it.

93
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,640
Master, I'll go.

94
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,440
Your people are so rude.

95
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,580
It seems that you don't set strict rules to manage them.

96
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,540
Envoy is right.

97
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,680
I'll manage more strictly.

98
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,180
Young Master and Guardian Ji do not have good intentions.

99
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,900
That depends.

100
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,800
Master Qing Shu is really powerful.

101
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,840
If you agree that you won't be against our plan,

102
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,700
everything can be discussed.

103
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,180
Deal with the Master?

104
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,940
Young Master, are you sure you want to betray Master with Guardian Ji?

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,600
I never agreed with what Father has done. How can you say it's a betrayal?

106
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,820
If you really want what is good for Father, you should persuade him to stop.

107
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,140
Now that the two of you are ready, show me.

108
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,580
Sure enough. A fight is inevitable.

109
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,900
Given your speed, how can you stop my Hidden Soul Needle?

110
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,640
It's not me getting faster, but you getting slower.

111
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,960
<i>Need so much?</i>

112
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,820
<i>Are you fighting against Lin Canglan? Or torturing me?</i>

113
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,220
<i>Luo Luo, it's an emergency. And scale powder will grow back.</i>

114
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,640
<i>It's not enough if it were only scale powder. If we don't have the antidote,</i>

115
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,460
<i>we will also be dazed.</i>

116
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,380
<i>Where is the antidote?</i>

117
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,060
<i>I don't want to tell you.</i>

118
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,900
<i>It says that Phantom Butterfly has two wings;</i>

119
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,720
<i>scale powder on the left one can be psychedelic,</i>

120
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,200
<i>scale powder on the right is soluble.</i>

121
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,636
<i>If you have the antidote in advance, you won't be dazed.</i>

122
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,200
<i>Luo Luo, please.</i>

123
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,960
<i>I will ask for more spirit stones for you from Young Master.</i>

124
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,960
So, you used the scale powder of Phantom Butterfly from the Nanhai Sea.

125
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,540
In order to fight against you,

126
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,820
Luo Luo's wings are almost bald.

127
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,780
I was very careful when I came here.

128
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,480
I didn't smell the scale powder.

129
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,040
When did you use it?

130
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,980
Master Qing Shu is so careful.

131
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,300
If we used it in advance, how could we cheat you?

132
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,920
But if you hide the scale powder in the buds and attack until the flower blooms halfway,

133
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,360
the buds will unfold and release scale powder; it's hard to be aware of.

134
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,340
Thanks to Chang Yi's idea.

135
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,140
Your hand.

136
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,740
Luo Luo.

137
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,020
<i>I'm here.</i>

138
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
<i>I'm here.</i>

139
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,140
- Luo Luo, bring Chang Yi back.
- Let me stay with you.

140
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,600
No. The wound caused by a Hidden Soul Needle must be cured in time or it'll fester.

141
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
And now isn't the right time for you to show up.

142
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,560
You need to go back to cure your wound first. Wait for me here.

143
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,360
Luo Luo.

144
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,860
Come on!

145
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,300
Guardian Ji's training skills are really amazing.

146
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,680
The merman is really obedient to you.

147
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,220
And Young Master doesn't care about his self-esteem,

148
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,320
even cooperating with his competitor.

149
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,860
If one wants to succeed, you don't need to care about the ways.

150
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,140
It was taught by my father.

151
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,280
Young Master is so sincere and educated.

152
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,840
Master would be really happy.

153
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,740
Thanks, Envoy Zhang.

154
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,960
All the treasures Envoy Zhang takes this time are precious.

155
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,520
All of you should go and protect him.

156
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,240
I don't need anyone to serve me.

157
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,280
<i>Yes!</i>

158
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,680
Thanks, Master.

159
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,220
Young Master, Master is back.

160
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,420
All of the people have gone to guard Envoy Zhang.

161
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,220
Now there is no guard in the valley. We can get the antidote now.

162
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,660
But Master is so tough,

163
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,520
what if he won't give the antidote, and even prefers to die?

164
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,480
What should we do?

165
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,680
Senior, you can go.

166
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll watch Qing Shu.

167
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
It should be you who makes the decision on the things between you and your father.

168
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,040
Thanks.

169
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,580
Young Master, is it going so smoothly?

170
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,060
Is it a trap?

171
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,620
Wait for me here.

172
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,600
I'll go in alone.

173
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,300
You're finally here.

174
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,640
Qing Shu has been arrested. It's over now.

175
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,780
Father, hand over the Master Token.

176
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,300
It seems that you've prepared well to take over Thousand Flower Valley.

177
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,860
But you did this rashly, there will be criticism from the valley.

178
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,660
I've gotten rid of all elders who are loyal to Father.

179
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,980
When they come back, they will have no other choices.

180
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,120
But they will strongly oppose you.

181
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,360
Can you deal with that?

182
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,300
Everyone has weaknesses.

183
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,880
Try to tempt them with interests. Use their talents for your own.

184
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,860
Father, that's what you taught me.

185
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,760
I've learned all of their weaknesses.

186
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,440
Taking over Thousand Flower Valley, you don't need to worry.

187
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,120
Really thoughtful. Not bad.

188
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,960
But how will you deal with me?

189
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,820
Just retire peacefully.

190
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,480
I'll find a place for you to enjoy the rest of your life.

191
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
But if I don't die,

192
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,100
your position as Master will not be appropriate.

193
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,500
I won't forget it was you who raised me up.

194
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,800
You're my father.

195
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,600
Don't you want to give up the Frost mark

196
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,000
and be an ordinary father,

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,600
enjoying family harmony?

198
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,960
The one who can achieve the great should be

199
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,760
vicious, cruel, and heartless.

200
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,500
Haoqing, you're mind is meticulous and thorough.

201
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,820
However, it's a pity that your heart is too soft.

202
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,880
Young Master, are you all right?

203
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,560
<i>Young Master.</i>

204
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,040
Your legs...

205
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,500
So you've been fooling everyone.

206
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,980
You knew at the beginning that I allied with Yunhe.

207
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,699
All of this was under your control.

208
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,580
No one knows a son better than his father.

209
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,960
Haoqing, you can't fool me.

210
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,840
Why?

211
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,680
Why do you force me to do this?

212
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,140
Why did you do so much to play this game with me?

213
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,740
I just want to know what you'll do?

214
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,820
You're so disappointing.

215
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,280
Your heart is gentle and lenient but manages at the same time to be continuously undecided.

216
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,160
How can you manage Thousand Flower Valley if you're like this?

217
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,600
So Qing Shu lost to us deliberately.

218
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,740
What are you going to do to Yunhe?

219
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,480
You guess?

220
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,100
You and Lin Canglan, what are you hiding?

221
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,160
You are the strongest nine-tailed fox of Qingqiu Clan.

222
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,980
Even if you were poisoned by scale powder,

223
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,480
you shouldn't have given up fighting so easily.

224
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,360
The only reason is that you have another plan.

225
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,660
My life is already in the hands of Guardian.

226
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,940
What can I hide?

227
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,140
If you're worried, just kill me.

228
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,680
I won't kill you.

229
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,480
But don't you want to spend your life with Lin Canglan?

230
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,480
You moved from Qingqiu to Beiyuan, always hiding from the world.

231
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,520
But you gave up your whole family

232
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,460
just for Lin Canglan, to follow him.

233
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,640
It's not difficult to understand.

234
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,940
Do you want to control my heart, too?

235
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,480
Thousand Flower Valley has a strict rule that love is forbidden here.

236
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,440
Staying here, you two won't have a future.

237
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,400
But if you leave, everything is possible.

238
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,620
Your whole life is for Lin Canglan.

239
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,400
Don't you want to live for yourself?

240
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,500
I met him as an acquaintance in our early period.

241
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,740
I did have some feelings.

242
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,140
But what Master bears is more than anything else.

243
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,120
It's fated that he can't fall in love.

244
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,500
He must hide his true feelings, and keep his best stuff under his hat.

245
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,780
Even deceive his beloved ones.

246
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,400
I wouldn't ask for nothing,

247
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,500
only to hope that I can help him with what he wishes.

248
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,420
This is enough for me.

249
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,640
I told you...

250
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,840
only the strong can protect what they love.

251
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,680
Father, I can do anything you want me to do.

252
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,600
Please don't hurt Yunhe.

253
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,620
Fine.

254
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,200
Just do me one thing.

255
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:53,200
Kill me.

256
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,660
If you want to save Ji Yunhe, then you should kill me.

257
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,220
If I live,

258
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,160
she... must die.

259
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,280
Do it.

260
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,460
If I live, she must die.

261
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,620
Haoqing, you can't achieve anything for you're too kindhearted,

262
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,540
but you still stood on the right side when you were at your last gasp.

263
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,480
I feel so relieved.

264
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,660
This is... what I can't do forever.

265
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,160
What do you mean?

266
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't you want to kill me?

267
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,300
What I've done is for His Master's great achievements.

268
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,600
And you're important to his plan.

269
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,600
It's the time.

270
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,960
I should say farewell to him for the last time.

271
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,880
Last time?

272
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,460
Father! Father!

273
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,080
Father!

274
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,940
Why is that?

275
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,740
Why?

276
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,680
You cast the Frost marks on others,

277
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,040
but why did you have one on your neck?

278
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,040
I didn't do it.

279
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,480
Haoqing, don't try to save me.

280
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,080
My last day... has come.

281
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,540
Now, even the antidote can stop the Frost

282
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,320
spreading all over my body.

283
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,120
Ji Yunhe... is still alive.

284
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,980
She's useful for our Thousand Flower Valley.

285
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,020
So you threatened me

286
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,980
with our valley and Ji Yunhe

287
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,280
so as to force me to kill you,

288
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,320
but what is all of this for?

289
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,860
You are a good boy,

290
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,680
but I have no chance to live a new life.

291
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,400
I thought that...

292
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,740
he was way too powerful,

293
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,240
so if I fail to become stronger and more invulnerable,

294
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,560
I won't take him down.

295
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,780
And to win at the end,

296
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,560
anyone's life can be wasted

297
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,320
and they all can be used for it.

298
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,980
Haoqing, don't end up...

299
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,340
living a life... like me.

300
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,540
Father.

301
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,820
Father. Father.

302
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,880
Father!

303
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,080
He's not dead yet, right?

304
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,760
He's acting to give me a lesson.

305
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,400
Right?

306
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,520
Master has passed away.

307
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,540
I'm sorry, Young Master.

308
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,780
This is the path that Master had long chosen for himself.

309
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,500
What's the meaning of what he just said?

310
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,460
There's a backroom.

311
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,180
When you go in there,

312
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,240
you'll know everything.

313
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,160
I know Master has been very strict with you,

314
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,460
but his love for you was true for sure.

315
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,880
Young Master, please don't hate him for what he's done to you.

316
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,440
You told me to return to my hometown.

317
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,960
But for me,

318
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,880
my hometown has long faded away from my heart.

319
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
If I leave your side,

320
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,290
I don't know where I could go.

321
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,040
I'd like to accompany you for this last time.

322
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,620
No.

323
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,740
No!

324
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Stop.

325
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,220
Can't you be quiet even when you've been locked up?

326
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
<i>Master Qing, please don't drink anymore.</i>

327
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,880
Li Shu? Why are you alive?

328
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,280
<i>Master Qing, what are you talking about?</i>

329
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,320
<i> I'm... not dead.</i>

330
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,420
<i>Don't you remember? As a lynx, the descendant of Lu Wu,</i>

331
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,820
<i>we can live nine times.</i>

332
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,960
<i>I got seriously injured at Ten Directions Formation.</i>

333
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,720
<i>I lost most of my power,</i>

334
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,060
<i>but fortunately I survived.</i>

335
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,720
<i>The only problem is that I can't have a real body.</i>

336
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
In the whole world,

337
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,440
you're the only one who thinks of me.

338
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,880
Not him,

339
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,520
who just left without telling me.

340
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,320
<i>Master Qing, you haven't been fully recovered</i>

341
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,120
<i>because of the Ten Directions Formation.</i>

342
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,060
<i>If you keep drinking like this, it will get worse.</i>

343
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,760
You know nothing.

344
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,160
The hardest thing in this world is not to die,

345
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,260
but it's to live.

346
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,000
Loving him like an idiot for my whole life,

347
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,040
my life is totally a joke.

348
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,000
If it ends like this,

349
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,640
you shouldn't have saved me before.

350
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,320
And even now,

351
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,860
you also lost your power.

352
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,520
<i>Master Qing, don't feel bad for me.</i>

353
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,800
<i>Anyway, I have to practice transforming into my real body.</i>

354
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,160
<i>Otherwise, just take me as that bastard Ning Ruochu.</i>

355
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,560
<i>I'll be there with you, no matter what you ask me to do.</i>

356
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,100
<i>I'll do as you want, as long as you can calm down.</i>

357
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,900
What if I accidentally kill you with my sword out of rage?

358
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,760
<i>You saved my life.</i>

359
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,080
<i>Of course, you can take it back.</i>

360
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,320
What about that Spiritual Master?

361
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,400
Can you leave her alone?

362
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,640
<i>In my heart, you're the most important one.</i>

363
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,440
<i>From the beginning, my love for her was a lie.</i>

364
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,480
<i>I won't feel sorry to leave her.</i>

365
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,400
Do you really think so?

366
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,440
I've been fed up with her.

367
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,800
So, tomorrow, I will kick her off of this mountain.

368
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,120
Then, you can only be with me

369
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,280
in this Le You Mountain till the end of your life.

370
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,400
<i>If you can be safe and sound,</i>

371
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,320
<i>I'll be with you whenever you need me, Master Qing.</i>

372
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,680
Li Shu.

373
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,120
I didn't waste my time on you.

374
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,800
<i>Master Qing. Master Qing.</i>

375
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,040
Only a coward would lock me in here.

376
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,720
Come out to fight me if you dare.

377
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,200
Why did you lie to me?

378
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,260
Why did you save me?

379
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,940
Why?

380
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,320
Why did you protect me from the last attack?

381
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,620
<i>Sanyue, don't hurt yourself anymore.</i>

382
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,600
<i>Master Qing set this barrier for you especially.</i>

383
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
<i>You can't get out.</i>

384
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,240
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

385
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,340
<i>I can't protect you anymore.</i>

386
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,760
<i>If you can get better by forgetting me,</i>

387
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,540
<i>just do it.</i>

388
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,040
<i>Sanyue, take care.</i>

389
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,860
Li Shu,

390
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,580
you went out secretly at midnight.

391
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,440
What if the wind blows your soul into pieces?

392
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,420
<i>Master Qing, I just took a breath of fresh air.</i>

393
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,400
You lied to her before,

394
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,299
and now you've just lied to me.

395
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:24,520
The barrier only works for Sanyue,

396
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,360
but I'm the one who set it,

397
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,460
so do you think I don't know who has tried to get in through it?

398
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,460
<i>I... I...</i>

399
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,259
What you feel for Xue Sanyue,

400
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:36,000
is it real love

401
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
or fake love?

402
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,960
<i>Master Qing, I dare not to lie to you.</i>

403
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,760
<i>I got close to Xue Sanyue on purpose for real.</i>

404
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,540
<i>But since then, I did fall for her.</i>

405
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,420
<i>For me, Sanyue is not just a weapon to use,</i>

406
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,980
<i>she is the one I truly love.</i>

407
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,600
So, why did you lie to me earlier?

408
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,960
<i>Sanyue once told me that</i>

409
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,160
<i>what she hates most is to be cheated.</i>

410
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,080
<i>She tried her best to protect me,</i>

411
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,640
<i>but I told so many lies to her</i>

412
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,820
<i>and she has no home to go back to.</i>

413
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,260
<i>She will never forgive me, I think.</i>

414
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,580
Can you really go through it if you leave her alone?

415
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,760
<i>What else can I do?</i>

416
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,880
<i>She's born to live her own life.</i>

417
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,920
<i>She definitely won't stay here.</i>

418
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,560
<i>But look at me now,</i>

419
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
<i>my power is almost lost,</i>

420
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,940
<i>how could I protect her?</i>

421
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,400
<i>If I insist on being there, what awaits her is only trouble.</i>

422
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,720
<i>I'd better set her free to do what she wants to do.</i>

423
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,920
<i>And here's one thing. If l leave here, who can take care of you, Master Qing?</i>

424
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,000
<i>You can't even blow off steam if you're angry.</i>

425
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,640
You don't have to pity me.

426
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,360
In Le You Mountain,

427
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,500
it's enough that I'm the only one living in pain.

428
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,940
Listen. Tomorrow, I'll help you to practice to get your body back.

429
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,560
But during this period, you can't have delusional thoughts

430
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,320
and meet that Spiritual Master again.

431
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,080
After you get your body,

432
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,740
then let's see what will happen

433
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,200
between the both of you.

434
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,520
<i>Thank you so much, Master Qing.</i>

435
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,060
<i>But before we set out,</i>

436
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,980
<i>Master Qing, may I ask a favor from you again?</i>

437
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,680
Don't you want to fight this time?

438
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,440
I'm not sure I can win,

439
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,220
so there's no need to risk my life.

440
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,440
I will find a chance to do it again.

441
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,980
It's good to know that you won't sacrifice your life for nothing.

442
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,380
Well, you can leave the mountain.

443
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,600
What's that soup about?

444
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,520
Li Shu came into my dream last night,

445
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,100
and he begged me to give you food.

446
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,520
He wouldn't give up if I said no.

447
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,000
So... he dares not come to see me in my dream.

448
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,600
Due to what he's done all these years,

449
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,720
he deserves to be punished by losing his body.

450
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,960
But there's still a chance for him to live again.

451
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,180
If you feel all right, go to Daiyu Mountain,

452
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,100
which is located overseas and full of spiritual energy.

453
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,320
You can find some spirit medicine for me.

454
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,400
Maybe we can help him recover.

455
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,120
Why do I have to save him?

456
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,640
I just hate him and can't wait to kill him.

457
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,840
How can you kill him if you don't save him first?

458
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,680
Master Qing, why did you lie to her?

459
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,760
Of course, you don't know.

460
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,820
She's too naive and impulsive.

461
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,900
She should go through hardships by this trip to learn something.

462
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,420
<i>Sanyue, stay safe.</i>

463
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,080
<i>Lin Canglan has died.</i>

464
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,240
<i>But there are more mysteries I can't understand.</i>

465
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,700
<i>What Master Qing Shu did before she died is weird.</i>

466
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,040
<i>She said it's for Lin Canglan's achievements, so what did she mean?</i>

467
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,780
Yunhe.

468
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,280
Here. Try this sweet soup.

469
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,800
You look so cloudy,

470
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,280
even darker than dark clouds.

471
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,640
It's been a while since Lin Canglan's death went public.

472
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,720
Why didn't Lin Haoqing give you the antidote?

473
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,280
When will we go to buy an Immortal Island?

474
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,580
Lin Canglan is not a good person,

475
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,760
but he's the father of Haoqing.

476
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,160
He lost his family member,

477
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,440
he still needs time to overcome it.

478
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,280
If we ask for it now, it's too cruel for him.

479
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,400
Ji Yunhe. You understand him but does he understand you?

480
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,980
You are too...

481
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,960
You shouldn't have agreed to be his ally.

482
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,400
It's okay for him to hurt himself, why close the door of the inner hall?

483
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,760
It means he blocked our way for the antidote.

484
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,240
Lin Haoqing.

485
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,040
He's locked himself there for many days.

486
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
He has talked to no one.

487
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,400
I don't know if he is all right now.

488
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,180
<i>Don't make any emotional mistakes anymore.</i>

489
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,360
<i>There won't be any mercy</i>

490
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,200
<i>like what I did for you if you meet him someday.</i>

491
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,320
<i>There's a backroom.</i>

492
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,140
<i>When you go in there, you'll know everything.</i>

493
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,260
<i>My son, Haoqing.</i>

494
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,800
<i>When you come into this room,</i>

495
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,760
<i>I've already died.</i>

496
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,600
<i>I'm sorry for not telling you the truth before.</i>

497
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,020
<i>It's hard for you to accept.</i>

498
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,720
<i>But now here we are,</i>

499
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,820
<i>you have to face everything alone.</i>

500
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,520
<i>The Frost mark originated from Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

501
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,440
<i>Its power does not originate from me,</i>

502
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,160
<i>but another source.</i>

503
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,300
<i>Breaking the Frost and restoring the Lin family are all tied to Ji Yunhe.</i>

504
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,160
<i>Now I've told you everything.</i>

505
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,820
<i>If you are resolute to live with a kindness and benevolence,</i>

506
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,760
<i>I'd like to see what kind of life you will live in the future.</i>

507
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:37,280
♫ <i>Each pair of eyes belongs to a merman</i> ♫

508
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:43,620
♫ <i>A drop in the ocean</i> ♫

509
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:50,420
♫ <i>Time is dreamy and turns into scales </i>♫

510
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:56,140
♫ <i>The Milky Way ripples </i>♫

511
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:03,820
♫<i> I'm flying in the Milky Way like wind </i>♫

512
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:09,300
♫ <i>Passing through the sea of stars</i> ♫

513
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,500
♫ <i>Enter the forest of light </i>♫

514
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,180
♫<i> Leap over the stream in the sky </i>♫

515
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:23,920
♫ <i>My shadow is like a smile curve </i>♫

516
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,380
♫<i> My heart leaves a projection </i>♫

517
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,500
♫ <i>The projection of a world </i>♫

518
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,860
♫ <i>My leap reflects the mountaintop</i> ♫

519
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:43,380
♫<i> From the sun, the moon to the dust</i> ♫

520
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:50,180
♫<i> I just want to come and go with love </i>♫

521
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,460
♫<i> My heart leaves a projection </i>♫

522

♫ <i>The projection of a world </i>♫

523

♫ <i>The will of Heaven is disclosed </i>♫

524
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:28,780
♫ <i>The love remains silent </i>♫

525
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,100
♫ <i>My heart leaves a projection</i> ♫

526
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,340
♫ <i>The projection of a world </i>♫

527
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,740
♫ <i>The sky is slightly rolled up</i> ♫

528
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:44,860
♫ <i>The longings emerge from the sea</i> ♫

529
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:53,940
♫ <i>The heart of infinity turns into scales </i>♫
