20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,380
Lin Haoqing has blocked all the paths to North Abyss.

21
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,700
These three formations line horizontally.

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,580
I guess he'll arrange three Spiritual Masters to set up the formation.

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,860
Others will assist them into blocking us.

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,040
Those three Spiritual Masters are critical.

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,200
As long as we catch them,

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,220
the blockade will collapse.

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,540
How could you know their plan?

28
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,900
Because it's the most reasonable plan.

29
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,320
Besides, I know him well.

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,400
Don't stare at me. As North Abyss is involved, do not overlook them.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
They're troublesome.

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,580
It would be best for you, Kong Ming, and Qing Ji to be the leaders of the three groups.

33
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,060
No problem.

34
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,600
I'll be in charge of this group.

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
I'll go and persuade Qing Ji.

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
It's an urgent matter. It must be foolproof.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
Of course, it will!

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
I'll coax her to find wine.

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,840
When we're halfway, I'll hold her feather

40
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,360
and force her to be there.

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,220
So can you call it "persuade"?

42
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,780
I'm afraid Qing Ji will beat you to death after hearing it.

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,520
I think you'd better stay here and wait for us.

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,640
Otherwise, you'll cause us trouble.

45
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,320
Don't overlook me.

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,820
When have I caused you trouble?

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,900
Am I right? Yunhe?

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,120
The last team must be led by an elite.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,460
Ji Yunhe, you're so deliberate in wanting to give the merman pearl back.

50
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,960
Your idea also sounds reasonable.

51
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,460
Why are you on my side this time?

52
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,340
Shunde hates me so deeply.

53
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,520
Actually, I've done it all for myself.

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,380
Have you made up your mind?

55
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,900
We need a commander.

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,880
I see.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,100
I'll be back in two hours.

58
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,580
Okay.

59
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,920
It's urgent and the time is limited, so when shall we start?

60
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,180
Tomorrow morning.

61
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,960
It means you have to kiss her again?

62
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,940
It's the same as how I sent it to her.

63
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,140
I see.

64
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,640
Do you need my help?

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,060
Why did you pull me?

66
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,260
Haven't you said that you wanted to persuade Qing Ji?

67
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,920
Oh, yes.

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,280
Be at ease. I'll solve the case. Well, how are you going to give the pearl...

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,980
- Let's leave!
- I...

70
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,500
Wait!

71
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,540
<i>The pearl will only leave me for two hours.</i>

72
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,260
<i>When I'm without it, I'll become weak.</i>

73
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,560
<i>Though I don't know how long I can talk with Ning Xiyu in the dream,</i>

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,420
<i>it's still fine to have only two hours.</i>

75
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,540
That merman said that no one could take Ji Yunhe away.

76
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,980
He's still that stubborn. What else did you learn?

77
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,000
Lake Island is heavily guarded.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,780
- Besides...
- Go ahead.

79
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,960
If I saw it clearly,

80
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,440
there's a Merman Mark behind her ear.

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,580
It has the ability of perception,

82
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,700
so it won't be easy to get her out.

83
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,440
We've done so many things. Which one is easy?

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,020
As she can't come out,

85
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,020
I'll go inside there.

86
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,680
She knows my strategies.

87
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,340
So do I.

88
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,660
I guess she'll ask them to attack from these three paths.

89
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,780
When I pretend to be captured in Lingshuang Pavilion, then I can see her.

90
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,680
Master, it's too risky.

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,180
Are you using yourself as a pawn?

92
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,080
It's all a game of chess by the Immortal Master.

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,100
None of us can get out of it.

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,500
Kong Ming and Luo Jinsang have set off.

95
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,620
So you're going to get back the pearl, right?

96
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,880
Yunhe.

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,660
Are you really on my side this time?

98
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,220
No other intentions, right?

99
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,400
Master, are you ready?

100
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,660
Things are changing all the time. You'd better speed up.

101
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,720
He's right.

102
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,460
Things are changing all the time.

103
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,900
Be at ease.

104
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,840
I promised you that I'd wait for you here.

105
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,440
Go ahead.

106
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,700
I'll be right back in two hours.

107
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
<i>Forgive me, Chang Yi.</i>

108
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
<i>I've schemed against you again.</i>

109
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,560
<i>Except for helping you,</i>

110
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,180
<i>it's also my only chance</i>

111
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,440
<i>to get rid of the merman pearl reasonably.</i>

112
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,300
<i>I must know the truth about that year.</i>

113
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,480
You've taken a huge risk to do this.

114
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,940
You'll be weaker and weaker without the pearl.

115
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,080
You are one step away from perishing.

116
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,380
That's why I have to grasp the time.

117
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,600
Above all else, I hate being controlled by others.

118
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,559
I have to know the truth and then make the decision myself.

119
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,040
What do you want to know?

120
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,760
You're Ning Xiyu, the master of Ning Ruochu and Ning Qing.

121
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,340
Yes.

122
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,000
- Senior.
- No need to be too polite.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
You can just ask me your questions.

124
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,160
What I want to know is... Immortal Master is obviously bringing chaosto the world

125
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,400
but why do you want to atone for his sin?

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,020
And how did he become like this?

127
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,980
When I first met Ning Qing, I was traveling the human world with Ruochu.

128
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,020
<i>Master! Beware of the attack of evil spirits!</i>

129
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,580
<i>Wait!</i>

130
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,000
I sensed his spiritual power.

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,360
He's an offspring of Spiritual Masters

132
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,060
but no one knew why he was left there.

133
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,180
<i>Pretty nice. I love your painting.</i>

134
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,860
<i>When can you draw one for me?</i>

135
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,320
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

136
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,540
<i>Where's your home?</i>

137
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,820
<i>I'll bring you home, okay?</i>

138
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,960
I brought him back to Thousand Flower Valley.

139
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,320
He had low self-esteem for he had no home and no background at the beginning.

140
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,600
<i>What's your name?</i>

141
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,200
<i>I have no name.</i>

142
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,600
<i>I don't need one.</i>

143
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,600
<i>Though you don't need it, I want to give one to you.</i>

144
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,000
<i>Could you please accept it, young boy?</i>

145
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,100
<i>What about having the same surname as me?</i>

146
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,400
<i>Just like Ruochu.</i>

147
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,700
<i>What about "Ning Qing"?</i>

148
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,800
<i>Do you know its meaning?</i>

149
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,700
<i>You're a unique person in the world.</i>

150
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,300
<i>Be magnanimous like the wind and the snow.</i>

151
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,800
<i>Do you like it?</i>

152
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,000
Then he became my disciple.

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,200
I taught him skills.

154
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
But he was different from Ruochu.

155
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,600
Ruochu was frank and bright.

156
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
He was straight.

157
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,800
So I taught him sword skills.

158
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,200
Ning Qing was sensitive and delicate.

159
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
He was unsuited to swordsmanship

160
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,400
so I taught him formations, which needed patience and ingenuity.

161
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,400
What happened later on?

162
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
You're the Master of Thousand Flower Valley,

163
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,000
but why is there nothing about you in the valley?

164
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Just like you've never existed before.

165
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,400
As Ruochu's relationship with Qing Ji became serious trouble,

166
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,600
I stood out and spoke for them.

167
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
Anyhow, common people despised and censured me.

168
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,900
They accused me of lax discipline, connivance, and protection of my disciples,

169
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
so I didn't deserve to be the master of the valley anymore.

170
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,200
At that time, Family Lin coveted my position

171
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
and they added fuel to the flame secretly.

172
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
Then I became the target for all.

173
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,600
They even instigated the elders to convict me

174
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,400
and abolish half of my power.

175
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,200
In the end, they expelled me from Thousand Flower Valley.

176
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,400
Ning Qing caught up with me when I left.

177
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,900
He said he would leave with me.

178
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,300
Thousand Flower Valley thought I shamed them,

179
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:44,000
so they finally erased all my traces of existence under Family Lin's agitation.

180
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,200
And my name became their taboo.

181
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
Did Grandmasters Ning and Qing know about it?

182
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm their master so I should protect them.

183
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Why do I need to tell them?

184
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,000
It will only make them apologetic.

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
You're so righteous.

186
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
I respect you so much.

187
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,800
Later on, I brought Ning Qing to the human world.

188
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,400
We'd been to so many places there.

189
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,900
We went back to the cottage where I found him at leisure.

190
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,200
I'd written down many travel notes there,

191
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,400
recording all the scenery and creatures we saw.

192
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,000
All his cherished travel notes were written by you?

193
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,200
- Including the encyclopedia?
- I love traveling.

194
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,600
I'd finished the encyclopedia before I left Thousand Flower Valley.

195
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,200
I just forgot to pick it up.

196
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,300
I know it's finally in your hands.

197
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,700
It seems we have a deep bond.

198
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,800
According to your words,

199
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,400
Ning Qing should have affection and faith.

200
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,800
But why did he become like that?

201
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,500
When we were in the human world,

202
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,000
I still brought him to eliminate evils.

203
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,700
I gradually found he became different.

204
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,000
<i>Please pardon me sir!</i>

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,400
His skills became violent and ruthless.

206
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,400
I knew he hoped to make some contributions as soon as possible

207
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,400
so that it could help me back to Thousand Flower Valley.

208
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
I thought to persuade him step by step.

209
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,000
I'd never thought I had no chance.

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,400
That day, we were besieged by evil spirits.

211
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Ning Qing sent a message to Thousand Flower Valley for help

212
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,700
but no one came.

213
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,200
In the end, I was killed by them.

214
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,000
Maybe it's my fate.

215
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,800
I made strenuous efforts to complete the encyclopedia

216
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,000
so my spirit didn't totally disappear after my death.

217
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,500
There's a little existence in the encyclopedia.

218
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,300
Then I became a part of the world.

219
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Ning Qing cared about me the most

220
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
and he couldn't accept my death.

221
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Therefore, he was emotionally crippled.

222
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,800
<i>Common people hated you.</i>

223
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,400
<i>Family Lin framed you.</i>

224
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,000
<i>Thousand Flower Valley expelled you.</i>

225
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,200
<i>Evil spirits killed you.</i>

226
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,200
<i>Ning Ruochu and Blue Feather Phoenix were the beginning of all these things.</i>

227
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,300
<i>I won't let all these guys off.</i>

228
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:32,500
<i>I will let them all go to accompany you!</i>

229
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Ning Qing went back to Thousand Flower Valley and told them about my death.

230
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
He'd knelt there for three days and nights

231
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,800
so that the valley finally took him in.

232
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,600
But he'd chosen the way with no return.

233
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
He told Ruochu about my death

234
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,600
and taught him the Ten Directions Formation.

235
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,300
<i>Senior, as Master has gone,</i>

236
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,800
<i>the disciples here might bring you and Qing Ji trouble.</i>

237
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,600
<i>Master always hoped you could live in peace.</i>

238
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
<i>So do I.</i>

239
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
<i>I found an ancient formation.</i>

240
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,000
<i>It can help you live there with her forever.</i>

241
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
<i>It's called Ten Directions Formation.</i>

242
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>Senior.</i>

243
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,400
<i>Junior Brother.</i>

244
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

245
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,800
<i>I want to tell you something.</i>

246
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,600
<i>Go ahead.</i>

247
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,200
<i>Take care!</i>

248
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
<i>Why?</i>

249
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,800
<i>You and Blue Feather Phoenix are the banes.</i>

250
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,000
<i>You caused her death!</i>

251
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,600
<i>How dare you still live safely?</i>

252
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,000
I have inescapable responsibility for it.

253
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you want me to tell Qing Ji the truth?

254
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
And ask her to find him?

255
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,200
In this world, only Qing Ji can fight against him.

256
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,000
Time is almost up.

257
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,600
Kong Ming and Chang Yi have completed the mission.

258
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
Now, we only need to wait for Qing Ji.

259
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,000
Your time is limited.

260
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,200
Could you please show me the situation?

261
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,700
I'll lend you my eyes.

262
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
As we're here, why don't we have a fight?

263
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,100
Besides, they've already surrounded us.

264
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,400
If you don't defeat them, they won't let you off either.

265
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,500
She's Blue Feather Phoenix!

266
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,000
Go to find Master for help!

267
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,400
Hurry up!

268
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Come on. We've done nothing yet.

269
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,200
Are you deceiving me to beat these losers?

270
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,000
Do you underestimate me too much?

271
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
What are you going to do?

272
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,500
You told me as we're here,

273
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,800
we should do something to them.

274
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
Blue Feather Phoenix is here!

275
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Protect our master!

276
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,000
Have we broken in?

277
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's so exciting.

278
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,300
Little girl, will you leave me alone

279
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,000
if I catch him for you?

280
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,600
Yes.

281
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,400
It's him.

282
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Don't chase them.

283
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Master has said not to chase him.

284
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,800
I asked them to catch those three Spiritual Masters,

285
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,040
but why did they catch Lin Haoqing?

286
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,240
So reckless.

287
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,060
Ji Yunhe, have you made up your mind? Will you help me?

288
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm not the only one who knows Blue Feather Phoenix.

289
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,680
Why did you choose me?

290
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,500
I don't belong to the world.

291
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,460
My existence violates natural laws.

292
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,140
As you have two veins, you're the same as me.

293
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,800
Fate binds us together.

294
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,620
And you're the only one who's at an impasse and suffers a lot,

295
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,020
but you still love this world.

296
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,000
I used to think it was my fate to confront these calamities,

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,420
but I'd never thought it would leave me with such an opportunity.

298
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,160
It seems my misfortune is not that bad.

299
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,760
Do you promise me?

300
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,680
Yes. I'll keep my words.

301
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,100
I only hope you can leave me some time.

302
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,740
As North Abyss is still in danger,

303
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,160
though my lifetime is limited,

304
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,600
I still want to protect it for my love.

305
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,340
Senior!

306
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
You've completed the mission?

307
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,940
Yes.

308
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,540
So fast.

309
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,660
You always keep your words.

310
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,260
Chang Yi, how can you ask Luo Jinsang to attack Lin Haoqing?

311
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,860
Now that we have both returned, there is no news from her at all.

312
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,420
What if she meets with anything?

313
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,780
I didn't ask her to do so.

314
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,360
Sir, please calm down.

315
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,260
She'll be fine as Qing ji is with her.

316
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
She will be fine?

317
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,760
The merman is right here, so of course you...

318
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,780
Yunhe!

319
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,280
Senior Qing Ji and I captured Lin Haoqing.

320
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,420
He's now arrested in Insanity Cave.

321
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,440
Who asked you to do so?

322
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,560
What are you thinking? Don't you know how dangerous it is!

323
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,480
Can you do things without being reckless?

324
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,380
You're hurting me.

325
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,640
Why are you so rude?

326
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,020
Don't you think it's awesome to catch their commander?

327
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,860
Are you angry because we're better than you?

328
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,940
You've thought too much.

329
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,820
Incorrigible.

330
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,580
Did he scold me?

331
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,920
Come back! Let's see who's right!

332
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,900
Come back!

333
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,560
Chang Yi.

334
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,800
As Qing Ji has brought him here,

335
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,200
just let me go to see him.

336
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,260
You know me well. I'll do what I want.

337
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,400
You just fetched the pearl and you're still so weak.

338
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,860
Why are you in a hurry?

339
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,260
As you're here, what should I fear?

340
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,720
I see. I'll go with you.

341
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,220
You only have 30 minutes.

342
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,560
You can't stay longer.

343
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,600
I'll go in to find you after 30 minutes.

344
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,140
Okay. I'll be right back.

345
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,160
Senior, since we parted at Immortal Master Mansion,

346
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,920
I never thought to meet you again here.

347
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,020
Hardships can't stop you from going to North Abyss with him.

348
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,480
Is this what you were wanting to do?

349
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,460
I came to have peace talks with you here in spite of illness.

350
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,160
Senior Brother, won't it touch you

351
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,060
and show you my sincerity?

352
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,840
You first planned for them.

353
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,700
And now you have come to talk with me yourself.

354
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,440
You really think highly of North Abyss.

355
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,980
That's it.

356
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,560
The fight between us will only satisfy the villains.

357
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,000
We should collaborate in fighting against

358
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,860
the common enemies of the Immortal Realm and us.

359
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,600
You're smart.

360
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,340
You know the pros and cons.

361
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,980
We do have the same goal.

362
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,000
Anyhow, you know Fairy Shunde's temperament.

363
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,520
She has Frost mark seals,

364
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,040
threatening all the lives of the Spiritual Masters in Thousand Flower Valley.

365
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,100
The Spiritual Masters hunting Chang Yi didn't go back,

366
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,240
I thought you had asked scouts to check here.

367
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,880
I think you know Kong Ming has the medicine.

368
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,260
So what?

369
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,300
Though it was Shunde who asked to trap and torture Chang Yi,

370
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,300
it's those Spiritual Masters that implemented it.

371
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,520
How could he let them off?

372
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:57,060
Senior, he's more broad-minded than you have imagined.

373
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,160
Recently, many Spiritual Masters have fled to North Abyss.

374
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,980
Chang Yi overrode all objections to leave them here.

375
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:10,180
It's also Chang Yi who saved those scouts' lives.

376
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,080
Spiritual Masters here can be protected.

377
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,920
What about those in Thousand Flower Valley?

378
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,400
You uncharacteristically led troops to attack without any resistance, and were deliberately captured.

379
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,020
Now you are still confirming with me step by step North Abyss' attitude of accepting surrender.

380
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,840
So I think you've decided how to solve it.

381
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,460
You tried a lot to see me.

382
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,420
I think I'm the key.

383
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,180
Is that right?

384
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,920
That is right.

385
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,420
I gave you 30 minutes,

386
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,720
and you actually came out in 30 minutes.

387
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,940
Why are you laughing?

388
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,180
Nothing.

389
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,740
What's the result?

390
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,940
He hopes to make peace.

391
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,740
But it's a little complex.

392
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,380
We need to learn concrete conditions.

393
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,160
Shall I come to discuss it with him tomorrow?

394
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,100
I can't let North Abyss suffer losses.

395
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,580
Once is enough.

396
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,340
Kong Ming will handle the rest.

397
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,360
Now, let's go back.

398
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,340
We've already come here.

399
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,400
Don't you want to see the views here?

400
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,100
No.

401
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,520
Can you think over my plan again?

402
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,420
- Don't you want to...
- No.

403
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,300
Big-tailed Fish, you are so domineering now.

404
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,920
Let's leave.

405
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,320
<i>Siyu, lead the troops and make a feint tonight.</i>

406
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,740
<i>I'll find a chance to bring Ji Yunhe away.</i>

407
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,600
Siyu, Master was arrested.

408
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,040
As there's no commander, Zhu Ling wants to replace him.

409
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,080
So, why are you still stopping us from saving him?

410
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,320
Even though Master said not to act recklessly,

411
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,780
why did he give such an order?

412
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,000
Doesn't he fear meeting anything?

413
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,460
Make a feint tonight?

414
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,500
He's going to bring Yunhe back?

415
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,780
I see. It's so great!

416
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,200
Remember. It's the feint.

417
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,240
No fight, no casualty.

418
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,740
I see. Don't worry.

419
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,580
I'll go and prepare for it.

420
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,560
<i>Master, why don't you tell Qu Xiaoxing your plan?</i>

421
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,040
<i>He's loyal but reckless.</i>

422
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,200
<i>It's a life-and-death matter. The fewer people who know, the safer we'll be.</i>

423
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,940
<i>We can't let Shunde find a flaw and suspect us.</i>

424
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,600
<i>What about Ji Yunhe?</i>

425
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,220
<i>Do you really have the heart to hurt her?</i>

426
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:34,300
<i>Master, can you really give up on her?</i>

427
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,950
You're so happy to meet Lin Haoqing again?

428
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm just happy that he agrees to make peace

429
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,340
and there will be no fight in North Abyss.

430
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,200
I can finally be at ease now.

431
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,400
What? Are you jealous?

432
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,600
What if it's true?

433
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,860
Do you want to explain anything to me?

434
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,020
I'm tired. I want to sleep now.

435
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,640
You can chat with everyone happily except for me.

436
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,200
How do you think of me?

437
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,520
I've already told you before.

438
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,300
Chang Yi, you already know the answer,

439
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,060
so you don't need to bother me with this.

440
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,960
What if I don't believe in your words?

441
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,600
Ji Yunhe!

442
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,910
As long as you tell me you haven't betrayed me

443
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:55,340
and all your words are against your will, I will trust you.

444
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,360
As long as you think something between us is true,

445
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,940
I'll trust you whatever you explain to me.

446
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,620
Say something.

447
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,640
Come on!

448
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,920
North wind comes.

449
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,140
Great cold will follow.

450
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,680
The biggest snow of the year might come.

451
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,340
I don't know whether I can see it or not.

452
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,260
Come on, Yunhe. Don't be sad.

453
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,480
Have a seat.

454
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,360
Yunhe, I think Chang Yi believes in you.

455
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,520
He doesn't blame you.

456
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,280
He just wants to hear your explanation.

457
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,460
Why don't you explain it to him?

458
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,160
I'm about to die.

459
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,640
Why do I need to do so many twists and turns, and ups and downs?

460
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,780
Maybe I'm just a hypocrite.

461
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,020
As the situation here is so complex,

462
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,600
I don't want to bring him more trouble.

463
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,420
Yunhe,

464
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:45,080
didn't you tell me love will make people happy?

465
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,400
But why do you and Chang Yi look so miserable?

466
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,900
I really don't understand it.

467
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,779
Both of you are clever,

468
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:55,800
but why must you make such a simple thing so complicated?

469
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,220
Some kind of love means to be with him at all costs.

470
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,920
Some...

471
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,540
mean to bring him a peaceful life.

472
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,060
I don't want to covet the temporary happiness

473
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,280
which will leave him more miserable and in deeper sorrow.

474
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,880
You'll understand it someday later.

475
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,500
If love means to be like yours, then I don't want it.

476
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,860
What about Kong Ming?

477
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:32,100
Yunhe, I obviously made a contribution, and he scolded me badly.

478
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,720
Is there anything wrong with him?

479
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,580
It's because he cares about you.

480
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,500
I don't agree with you.

481
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,720
If he cares about me, he shouldn't be rude to me.

482
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,260
Besides, whenever I meet him, he seems to be angry with me.

483
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,860
I hate him.

484
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,640
Come on. Forget it. I'll go and fetch your medicine.

485
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,280
Smile for me.

486
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,040
Luo Luo likes your smile. See you.

487
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,920
<i>Chang Yi.</i>

488
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,100
<i>You're the sunshine in my life.</i>

489
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,820
<i>Just like the fire in the winter,</i>

490
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,700
<i>the light in the darkroom,</i>

491
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
<i>the boat on a hopeless sea.</i>

492
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,640
<i>So I don't want you to feel despair with me.</i>

493
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,700
<i>If you want to protect them, the only solution...</i>

494
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,440
<i>is to go back with me to meet Shunde.</i>

495
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,060
<i>Does it mean she wants my life?</i>

496
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,620
<i>Yes.</i>

497
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,980
<i>Fine.</i>

498
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,280
<i>If you can bring me out,</i>

499
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,680
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

500
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,160
<i>Did you hear my words?</i>

501
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,400
<i>lShunde wants to kill you.</i>

502
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,360
<i>You've seen that my lifetime is limited.</i>

503
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,820
<i>It's better for me to do something useful</i>

504
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,720
<i>rather than be trapped here till my end.</i>

505
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,520
<i>If my death can help you succeed,</i>

506
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,400
<i>I'm willing to do so.</i>

507
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,820
<i>I'll ask Siyu to make a feint. I'll take you out at that time.</i>

508
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,780
<i>Activate it when the action starts.</i>

509
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,620
<i>The Merman Mark will be banned for two hours.</i>

510
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,380
I still have to deceive you again,

511
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,540
even for this time...

512
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,460
and for this life,

513
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,980
you may not forgive me.

514
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,320
Sister Yao.

515
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,840
Are you still angry with me?

516
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,620
I started the attack that day

517
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,460
because I wanted to get rid of the enemy for North Abyss as soon as possible.

518
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,820
It wasn't for myself.

519
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,700
His long-term plan was inherently problematic.

520
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,480
Only defending and not attacing. Of course, it gave the opponent a chance to counterattack.

521
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,720
If you had listened to me, we might have defeated them.

522
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,780
We don't have so much trouble now.

523
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,880
Do you lack punishments?

524
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,740
Can't it make your mind clear?

525
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,560
Why are you as same as them? Only know to blame me.

526
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,860
As you don't think you're wrong, I have nothing else to tell you.

527
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,160
Come on. I'm wrong, okay?

528
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,680
I don't think you admitted your fault in your heart.

529
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,180
You're right.

530
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,900
I'm bitter about it.

531
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,740
Even though Chang Yi has been seduced by Ji Yunhe, you still protect him a lot.

532
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,500
I'm caring for you.

533
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,640
You think for him and forbear yourself.

534
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,000
But what about him?

535
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,340
Has he come to see you once after he came back?

536
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,220
If he comes to see me, it means he's kind. But it doesn't mean he has to do so.

537
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,900
So what are you waiting for?

538
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,140
Aren't you waiting for him?

539
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,180
Young Lord! Young Lord!

540
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,720
Young Lord! General Qifeng.

541
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,920
Why are you in a hurry?

542
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,920
It's the king. The king is awake!

543
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,080
Let's go!

544
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,040
Go!

545
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
Father!

546
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,380
- Father!
- Uncle!

547
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,740
- Father!
- Uncle!

548
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,630
Yao'er.

549
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,420
You finally woke up.

550
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,200
You're thinner.

551
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,740
My stupid girl.

552
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,820
You've been entrusted with urgent tasks. You should take good care of yourself.

553
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,060
Why did you waste your power to save me?

554
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,960
As long as you can wake up, I'm willing to do everything for you.

555
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,660
How about you now?

556
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,620
I've asked Chang Yi to take care of you.

557
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,300
Is everything okay?

558
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,000
Uncle, I'm afraid you may not know

559
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,720
that Chang Yi not only betrayed your trust

560
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,320
but also bullies her a lot.

561
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,760
If you had remained unconscious, North Abyss might have fallen into perdition.

562
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,540
Cousin, he has just awoken.

563
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,200
Don't say these trifles to bother him.

564
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,040
Do you want them to ruin North Abyss?

565
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,980
What's going on?

566
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,660
Tell me the whole story.

567
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,480
Where's Chang Yi?

568
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,660
He should be on patrol.

569
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,660
I see.

570
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,980
Don't tell him I'm awake. Don't startle him.

571
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,940
Quickly send someone to Lake Island to monitor Ji Yunhe's movements.

572
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,700
If she colludes with Lin Haoqing,

573
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,620
convey my order.

574
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,880
Kill them on the spot.

575
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,620
Yes.

576
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,160
Hold on, Father! Chang Yi said not to hurt Ji Yunhe.

577
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,700
He listens to you the most. Shouldn't you persuade him?

578
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,780
Tell him not to trust Ji Yunhe.

579
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,700
Yao'er.

580
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,820
What on earth is Chang Yi's and Ji Yunhe's relationship?

581
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,900
Didn't you tell me you got engaged with Chang Yi?

582
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,360
So why does he always protect Ji Yunhe?

583
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,760
Did he cheat on you?

584
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,280
No...

585
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,520
I deceived you,

586
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,940
because I hoped you could save him.

587
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,100
Actually, he...

588
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,780
he doesn't like me.

589
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
He protects Ji Yunhe with all the power of the North Abyss.

590
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,280
I think he likes that Spiritual Master.

591
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,080
She has cast a spell on Chang Yi's mind.

592
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,200
There will be serious trouble.

593
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,380
We can't take any risk at this critical juncture.

594
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,820
We must be decisive.

595
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,880
If she really meets something, Chang Yi won't forgive me.

596
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,940
Remember.

597
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:12,440
You gave up a lot for him when his elixir was broken.

598
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,140
He won't censure you.

599
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,100
Besides, even if you put aside your relationship with him,

600
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,780
he's now the master of North Abyss.

601
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,980
Even more so, he should not fail the people because of his own selfishness.

602
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:32,080
If the soldiers are demoralized, how can we resist the enemy?

603
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,320
<i>It's mature when its gold edge disappears.</i>

604
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,800
<i>But you still need to take care.</i>

605
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,280
<i>Nectar Ganoderma is intelligent.</i>

606
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,920
<i>It will disguise itself to be mature in order to protect itself.</i>

607
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,280
<i>Check it carefully before doing it.</i>

608
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,060
<i>If you need help, you can send me a message.</i>

609
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,640
<i>We'll come to help you.</i>

610
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,080
It does have disguises.

611
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,200
I thought it was mature.

612
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,580
I wanted to pick it for you, but...

613
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,380
It's Infinite Gold Thunder!

614
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,740
It's rare to meet it.

615
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,340
Why does it appear at this moment?

616
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,900
That place is... Leader Xue!
