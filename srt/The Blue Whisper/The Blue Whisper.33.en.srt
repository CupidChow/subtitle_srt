20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,500
Master.

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,400
That medicine can help Ru Ling cure the skin on her face.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,600
Add it to her medicine tomorrow.

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,400
Okay.

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Also, Fairy Shunde met Zhu Ling last night.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,200
I know.

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
She asked Zhu Ling to tell you,

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,600
she wanted apprentices in Immortal Master Mansion,

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
to listen to her orders and go to the human world

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
and catch the escaped Spiritual Masters.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,000
But this betrays the order of the Heavenly King.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,800
Should we stop her?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
Just let her do it if she likes.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
When the kids are making trouble,

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,300
it's a good idea to give her some candies.

35
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,600
Master, I think although they escaped, they shouldn't be killed.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,200
And Fairy Shunde may hurt innocent people in the human world.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,000
Apprentices in Immortal Master Mansion are to supervise Spiritual Masters,

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
kill evil spirits, and shall not be used for other purposes.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Fairy Shunde is trapped in her hall and is not allowed to leave there.

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,000
Without your support, she can't do whatever she wants.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Chengyu, the one who is holding the pawn shall never regret it.

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,300
As for what the pawn is thinking,

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,800
if it's obedient, it shall be my pawn.

44
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,800
If it betrays my will, it will be my enemy.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,500
Sorry, Master.

46
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,100
I went too far.

47
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Let Zhu Ling deal with it.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Okay.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Thank you, Immortal Chengyu.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,900
I'll gather apprentices and go to the human world.

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,300
Zhu Ling.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
You're one of Spiritual Masters.

53
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,200
You should be with your colleagues.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,200
But now, you're helping Fairy Shunde kill your colleagues and do evil things.

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,600
Do you really have such a clear conscience in your heart?

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Immortal Master planted a Frost mark on everyone in Thousand Flower Valley.

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,500
And he calls it supervision.

58
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Isn't it an evil thing as well?

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now, you're still working for Immortal Master

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,800
as Immortal Chengyu without any guilt.

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,300
Ji Chengyu, let me tell you.

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,000
Fairy Shunde will always be Fairy Shunde.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
Although she seems to lose power now,

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,000
she will gain it back.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,900
Maybe someday, everything will be under her control.

66
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,100
Why can't you be smart?

67
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,700
Can you get any benefit by being obedient?

68
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,400
We are just Fairy Shunde's pawns.

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,900
When she wants to abandon it one day,

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,600
she will do it without hesitation.

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
When you had trouble,

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,700
did she say anything and plead for you?

73
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,000
You are just useful to her.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
The Spiritual Masters you are chasing after are powerful.

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,200
You barely survived after experiencing sky thunder and haven't recovered yet.

76
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Why do you risk your life to take this mission?

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Zhu Ling, listen to me. Just stop.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,600
You know nothing!

79
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,200
The game has just begun.

80
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
We don't know who will win yet.

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,100
What I, Zhu Ling, hate most in this life is mediocrity, even if it's just being a pawn.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Even if I'm just a pawn,

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
even if I'm useful to her,

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
at least, Fairy Shunde is willing to give me a chance.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
I'll risk my life for a reputation.

86
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,200
I want the world to know my name, Zhu Ling.

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,100
Even if it's a notorious one?

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
A good or a bad reputation,

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
is written by the winner.

90
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Ji Chengyu, just wait and see.

91
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,800
Here is the token.

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
You know the consequence if you betray my will.

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,200
I think you all know Fairy Shunde's order.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,900
Go to the human world, to catch and punish the escaped Spiritual Masters.

95
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,600
Let's go!

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Just go!

97
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,500
<i>Senior, can you just let me stay here?</i>

98
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
<i>I don't want to hurt my colleagues.</i>

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
<i>Ji Ning, we're apprentices in Immortal Master Mansion.</i>

100
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>Master has educated us.</i>

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
<i>We must be loyal to him.</i>

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,500
<i>This is Master's order.</i>

103
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,200
<i>We have no choice.</i>

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,400
<i>Since you also don't want to hurt colleagues,</i>

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
<i>you should do something, just like Senior Kong Ming.</i>

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
<i>Kong Ming asked me to tell you,</i>

107
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,100
<i>he hopes you can find your own faith,</i>

108
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,400
<i>instead of just being loyal to Immortal Master.</i>

109
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,600
Commander Xue, are you sure the place mentioned in the encyclopedia is here?

110
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Yes.

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,800
According to the book, the mountain appeared around here.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,600
But there is no peak here.

113
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,700
Your Majesty, the encyclopedia was written a thousand years ago.

114
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,600
During these years, things may have changed a lot.

115
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
The terrain may have also changed.

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Maybe there is a record in the books in the Water Room.

117
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
How about going back to Heavenly Palace and check the books,

118
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,900
to see if there is a record?

119
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Immortal Book contains records from a thousand years ago.

120
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,000
I think the record is in the Water Room.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Immortal Book records everything in the world.

122
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
It would be laborious to check it.

123
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,400
Why don't we split up?

124
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,000
- Master Fei Lian and Shen Ze, go to Heavenly Palace with me.
- Okay.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,100
- Commander Xue and Prince Li Shu, you can stay here and search for any news.
- Okay.

126
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,500
But the Water Room came from the Void Territory.

127
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,600
It's huge.

128
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,400
Once we enter, we can't get any news out to the outside world.

129
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,400
If there is anything, we may not be able to help in time.

130
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,600
Be careful in the human world.

131
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,800
We're familiar with this place.

132
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,600
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

133
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,400
Besides, I'm with Sanyue.

134
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Ordinary scoundrels dare not come close to us.

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,600
Okay. Let's go.

136
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,200
Prince Li Shu, when we met in Daiyu Mountain,

137
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,400
I saw you spend much effort getting back together.

138
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,800
Now I have the chance to prepare a gift for you.

139
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
You'll surely like it.

140
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,500
What is it?

141
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
You will know by then.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,900
So mysterious.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
Let's go.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,800
<i>Senior.</i>

145
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,800
<i>Here is your birthday present.</i>

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
<i>I'm too old to accept a gift.</i>

147
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,800
<i>When we were in the human world, you'd been staring at it for a long time.</i>

148
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,400
<i>We are both orphans.</i>

149
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,800
<i>We never played with this when we were little.</i>

150
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,200
<i>I heard this is used to expel evil spirits in the human world.</i>

151
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,400
<i>It means auspiciousness, strength, and courage.</i>

152
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,900
<i>Today, I'm here to give it to you.</i>

153
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,000
<i>It's just a good omen.</i>

154
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,600
<i>Well, you look similar to this little tiger.</i>

155
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,700
<i>To expel evil spirits, to be strong and brave.</i>

156
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,200
<i>Senior, is this what you want to tell me?</i>

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,200
<i>Senior, Master is letting Fairy Shunde do evil things.</i>

158
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
<i>Please stop her, Senior.</i>

159
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
<i>I am ashamed to face Master.</i>

160
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,500
<i>I can't be disloyal to Master.</i>

161
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,600
<i>This is all I can do.</i>

162
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
You only have one empty room?

163
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,900
Yes.

164
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,100
But all hotels in this town are full. And you only have one room left?

165
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,600
I don't know what happened either.

166
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,400
There aren't that many customers in this town normally.

167
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,700
<i>Now I have the chance to prepare a gift for you.</i>

168
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,800
<i>You'll surely like it.</i>

169
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Strange.

170
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,400
Have some rest please.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,200
<i>It seems Master Fei Lian prepared this gift with good intentions.</i>

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,700
Sanyue, if you don't want to sleep in the same room with me, I can go out.

173
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,600
After all, I can fall asleep anywhere.

174
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,400
Wait.

175
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,400
Since we are searching for news,

176
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,200
we'd better act together.

177
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,200
It's okay. I'll sleep on the floor.

178
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Dear customers, I forgot to tell you.

179
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,700
Because the rooms are full, there are no spare quilts.

180
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,600
Please forgive us.

181
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
You...

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
If so, we can do nothing about it.

183
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
<i>[To Kong Ming]</i>

184
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,000
Sir.

185
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,000
Sir. Well, please go and see Master.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think he will burn out if he keeps being like this.

187
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,000
How long hasn't he slept?

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,200
Since Ji Yunhe died, he has barely slept.

189
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,800
He has been keeping busy.

190
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
When he has spare time,

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
he will stand on the Ice Lake.

192
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,800
Although he has the merman pearl back and has restored his power now,

193
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
he can't keep being like this.

194
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,300
Well, Sir, isn't Master tired?

195
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,700
He is tired,

196
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,200
but he doesn't dare to stop and think.

197
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Okay, you shall go back.

198
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,000
Thank you, Sir.

199
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
I received Chengyu's letter.

200
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,200
Your Junior, the apprentice in Immortal Master Mansion?

201
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,300
Yes.

202
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,000
He told me, according to the situation in Immortal Master Mansion,

203
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,800
Shunde is going crazy.

204
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,200
She heard some Spiritual Masters escaped into the human world.

205
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,600
She sent apprentices to Immortal Master Mansion to catch them in the human world and punish them.

206
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
You want to save them?

207
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I can bring them to the North Abyss,

208
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,600
or use them as examples to persuade those Spiritual Masters

209
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,200
who no longer trust Immortal Master and Shunde,

210
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,100
and ask them to join the North Abyss to strengthen our power.

211
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,900
By doing so, you won't be worried about the North Abyss so much.

212
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,300
Okay. I'll guard this place.

213
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,600
You can take some men to save them.

214
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,000
About Ji Yunhe,

215
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,000
If I give you another chance,

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,600
you would still make the same choice, wouldn't you?

218
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,800
That's Yunhe's own decision.

219
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,900
No one can stop her.

220
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,500
Get some rest.

221
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,400
You can't keep being like this.

222
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,200
Things have become like this.

223
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
No matter how hard you punish yourself,

224
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,900
nothing will change.

225
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,700
What are you doing?

226
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,200
Digging a hole. And bury you in it.

227
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,800
Well, I've figured it out.

228
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,400
I wouldn't be happy if I drank all day.

229
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,000
It's better to do some exercises.

230
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,500
On the one hand,

231
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,300
I can work hard and forget unhappy memories.

232
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,200
On the other hand, people in North Abyss have never seen this new brewing method in the human world.

233
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,800
I can sell the wine and get some spirit stones.

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
Let me help you.

235
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
No, thanks.

236
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
I had a deal with Ji Yunhe.

237
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
We'd buy an Immortal Island where spring stays all year round.

238
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
When I get enough spirit stones,

239
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,700
I'll leave this place.

240
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,700
I'll stay away from the things and people which annoy me.

241
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Good.

242
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,600
I... I'm leaving.

243
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm here to tell you.

244
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,300
Well, I've told Luo Suo about it.

245
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,600
You can ask him for help if you need it.

246
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
I shall leave now.

247
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,500

264
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,200
You all abandoned me and left.

265
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,000
Why am I staying here?

266
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm so pitiful.

267
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
Guess who I am.

268
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,300
You're Wangcai.

269
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,200
No.

270
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,600
Then you're Cuihua.

271
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,000
There are only Sister Siyu, you, and me in the barrier.

272
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
You've read so many books.

273
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,400
You're not smarter than me.

274
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
You're the smartest, Ji.

275
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Master, here.

276
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,900
Here's the wreath I made for you. Is it beautiful?

277
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,500
Yes.

278
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
You look beautiful.

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
It smells delicious.

280
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Sister Siyu must have prepared a lot of delicious food.

281
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Master, I'm hungry.

282
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
Go and have lunch.

283
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,600
But, Master, why won't you be hungry?

284
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,800
You don't need to eat, but I'm different from you.

285
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Because you're still growing.

286
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,200
You need to eat to cultivate power.

287
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,000
But I don't want to eat alone.

288
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Come to eat with me, Master.

289
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,500
Master, hurry up.

290
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
Are you full?

291
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,600
You asked Master to eat with you?

292
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,600
You are so gluttonous now. In the past, you can't eat...

293
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Siyu.

294
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
In the past?

295
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,200
What happened in the past?

296
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,100
You were not so gluttonous in the past.

297
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,700
Peach blossom cakes from the human world?

298
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,800
You can only eat one.

299
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,170
Eat the rest when you're hungry at night.

300
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm sleepy again.

301
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,300
Then go to sleep.

302
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
She grows after having some sleep.

303
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,200
It has only been a dozen days.

304
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
If she continues to grow like this, the room won't be able to hold her anymore.

305
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,400
She will stop growing when she grows to what she was.

306
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,500
Let her sleep.

307
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,620
Siyu, thank you.

308
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,620
I thought you didn't want to take care of A'Ji.

309
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,140
I just want to help you, Master.

310
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,760
If she was not here, you wouldn't smile like that.

311
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,200
But, A'Ji grows so fast.

312
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,180
After she grows to what she was,

313
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,720
if her personality is just like Ji Yunhe,

314
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,160
I'm afraid, this barrier won't stop her.

315
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,120
What do you want to do, Master?

316
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,060
I didn't want to stop her.

317
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,420
I just hope she can live a simple life happily.

318
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,060
Then you'll let her wander outside?

319
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,740
If Shunde and Immortal Master caught her...

320
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,920
I'll figure out a way.

321
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,220
I brought you a bowl of sweet soup.

322
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,840
When you escaped that night,

323
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,520
you came here to view the night scene. Right?

324
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,340
You made a good choice.

325
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,280
Outside the North Abyss, there should be a lot of such beautiful sceneries.

326
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,040
I decided to watch those sceneries for you.

327
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,240
One of us should realize our dream. Right?

328
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,160
Actually, I'm out for personal reasons.

329
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,380
I saw you suffered a lot for the love you said.

330
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,360
I would laugh at you and said you were silly.

331
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,180
But I really envy you now.

332
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,920
Yunhe,

333
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,960
Kong Ming left.

334
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,680
How could he leave?

335
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,440
I just wanted to know about...

336
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,160
the love you spoke about.

337
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,560
Why would my heart hurt?

338
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,340
Yunhe, I'm leaving as well.

339
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,180
Drink this sweet soup, and wish me all the best.

340
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:37,520
♫ <i>Hey, if I weren't me and you weren't you</i> ♫

341
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,760
<i>Yunhe, you can't die. Yunhe.</i>

342
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,840
<i>Yunhe!</i>

343
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,100
♫ <i>Hey, think more... think more</i> ♫

344
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,420
<i>Let me pat you,</i>

345
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,840
<i>and it won't hurt anymore.</i>

346
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,680
<i>It won't hurt...</i>

347
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,880
♫ <i>Any fool looking up can't keep the light</i> ♫

348
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,220
Master, now everyone has left the North Abyss.

349
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,080
If you really feel uncomfortable, just travel outside.

350
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
Young Lord Qing Yao can take care of this place.

351
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
Nothing will happen.

352
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,480
♫ <i>I hope your wishes will come true</i> ♫

353
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,180
No need.

354
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,580
This is where Yunhe left me.

355
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,340
This is also where I belong.

356
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,120
♫ <i>Let regret not grow</i> ♫

357
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,660
Why would I have such a strange dream?

358
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,820
Who is the man in my dream?

359
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,520
A'Ji.

360
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,920
What happened?

361
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,700
Master, I had a nightmare.

362
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,920
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

363
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Master, there is something I can't figure out.

364
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,180
What is it?

365
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,240
Sister Siyu will talk about the past things to me.

366
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,180
But why can't I remember what happened to me in the past?

367
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,960
As long as you remember you're my apprentice, that's enough.

368
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,760
But I want to know more.

369
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,960
Although you gave me many storybooks,

370
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,840
I know little about the outside world.

371
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,580
I can only wander within the barrier.

372
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,680
I feel bored.

373
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,400
Master, why won't you let me go out?

374
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,960
This time, you still want to go out?

375
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,120
Still?

376
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,240
Master, what are you talking about?

377
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,320
From tomorrow, I'll teach you spells that can protect yourself.

378
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,760
After you've learned about it, I'll take you to the outside world. Okay?

379
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,500
You mean...

380
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,720
This time, I'll be with you, to see the outside world.

381
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,800
Really?

382
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,320
Yes.

383
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,380
Great! I can go to the outside world.

384
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,940
Great. I can't wait to go outside.

385
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,960
Great!

386
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,460
It's delicious.

387
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,080
Master, what spell will you teach me today?

388
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,680
You've been cultivating hard.

389
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,540
And you've mastered the spells I taught you.

390
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,040
Today, I'll teach you the most powerful spell.

391
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,140
The most powerful spell?

392
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,940
What is it?

393
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,740
Look at the mirror.

394
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,020
Is this me, Master?

395
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,420
It's incredible!

396
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,160
Why did the spell disappear so soon?

397
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,960
Master, what kind of spell is this?

398
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,860
Put it on me again.

399
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,440
If you want the spell to last, you need to cultivate yourself.

400
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,660
You're a nine-tailed fox.

401
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,140
You can use Illusion Art.

402
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,780
Others will think you're the young man in the mirror.

403
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,040
As long as red nevus remains on your forehead, others can't see who you really are.

404
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,120
Remember, when using this spell, you can't have too much emotion,

405
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,760
so you must stay calm.

406
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,040
Master, you're almighty.

407
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,540
You can use many spells.

408
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,240
But why haven't you used Illusion Art?

409
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,560
Because only nine-tailed foxes can use Illusion Art.

410
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,500
Although Master knows how to teach you, he can't use it himself.

411
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,520
Well, if I learned this spell,

412
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,080
you can take me to the outside world. Right?

413
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,040
Then you have to promise me three things.

414
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,560
Only three? I can promise you whatever you said.

415
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,700
Never go to Lutai Mountain.

416
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,200
Never show others your real face.

417
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,880
Never go to the North Abyss.

418
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,880
I swear, I'll never go to Lutai Mountain,

419
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,760
never show others my real face,

420
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,400
never...

421
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,980
never... never go...

422
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,320
North Abyss.

423
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,520
Never go to the North Abyss.

424
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,560
North Abyss is a deserted place.

425
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,920
I didn't imagine it would become like this now.

426
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,600
Master said that we should make this place as lively as the human world.

427
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,500
I didn't trust him.

428
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,400
Now many Immortals have gathered here.

429
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,880
This place is more like a home to us.

430
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,160
I think he just wants to consolidate his position and monopolize power.

431
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,440
Look at these Spiritual Masters.

432
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,980
Why can they live in the North Abyss?

433
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,360
Life was better when Uncle was here.

434
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,800
Young Lord, there is a conflict.

435
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,380
It's those Spiritual Masters brought by Lu Jinyan.

436
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,200
They want to live in Fu Residence, but they wouldn't allow them.

437
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,620
They are fighting now.

438
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,040
Master has the order that there shall be no conflict in the city.

439
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,320
Cousin, they are fighting there.

440
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,700
Stay here. I'll have a look.

441
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,560
Lu Jinyan, don't push us too far.

442
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,900
We occupied this place first.

443
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,460
I pushed you too far, so what?

444
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,920
There are only a few people of you.

445
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,880
You don't need such a huge residence.

446
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,360
Just give us this place.

447
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,640
You are so aggressive. Why don't you find trouble for Immortal Master?

448
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,260
Why did you come to the North Abyss?

449
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,360
You are just a demon, shut up.

450
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,520
We can continue to fight.

451
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,200
Who did you say is a demon?

452
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,020
Although we are snakes, we are from the Immortal Clans.

453
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,020
If you don't agree with me, let's continue to fight!

454
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,480
Come on!

455
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Stop! Stop!

456
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,600
Here is North Abyss. How dare you cause trouble here!

457
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Imprison them in Insanity Cave!

458
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,500
How dare you!

459
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,600
Do it!

460
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Wait!

461
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,280
I know you occupied this place first,

462
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,100
but I hope you can understand each other.

463
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,280
This place is warm.

464
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,500
Lu comes from the south and is afraid of the coldness in North Abyss.

465
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,900
Compared with him, you prefer to live in cold places.

466
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,940
You don't have to live here.

467
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,720
I wonder if you can give this place to Lu to settle in.

468
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,020
I would appreciate it.

469
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,860
Give this place to them? Where should we go?

470
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,260
I can give one-third of my clan's residence for you to live.

471
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,360
Cousin, what are you doing?

472
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,660
Why do we have to sacrifice a lot for them?

473
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,380
Master said, we finally gathered them here. We can't let the alliance break.

474
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,320
Besides, Lu Jinyan came to the North Abyss himself.

475
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,040
If he can work for Master and the North Abyss, a little sacrifice is nothing.

476
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,560
Lu, this way.

477
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,640
Your cousin is smarter than you.

478
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,240
Well, prepare some good wine for us.

479
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,900
In such a cold place, we can only drink some wine.

480
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,040
Please.

481
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,640
Let's go.

482
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:18,160
I didn't imagine the almighty General Qifeng

483
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,720
would become so cowardly under the control of Master.

484
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,100
Since you are so generous, we're willing to do so.

485
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:30,660
Did you hear it?

486
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,860
Clean up one-third of your residence as soon as possible.

487
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,780
Don't let us wait for too long.

488
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,199
Master, I've settled Lu Jinyan and his party.

489
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,440
Mr. Kong Ming also sent a message.

490
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,200
There are more and more Spiritual Masters that are angry with Immortal Master.

491
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,860
He wants to persuade them on the way back. It may take some time for him to come back.

492
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,600
I know.

493
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,080
These are all letters from elders in my clan to blame you?

494
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,740
Don't mind it.

495
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,340
Others may think you only ingratiate Spiritual Masters.

496
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,760
But I know what you really mean.

497
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,080
Although North Abyss has the support of Thousand Flower Valley,

498
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,600
we are still not strong enough to fight against Immortal Master.

499
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,360
Only by gathering talents and gathering strength, can we have a chance to defeat him.

500
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,040
All you do is for North Abyss.

501
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,040
But if you don't say it, how will others understand it?

502
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,840
I don't need others to understand.

503
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,900
I know you don't care about others' opinions.

504
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,760
I just don't want you to be criticized every day.

505
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Master, she has died.

506
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,880
You shouldn't be drowned in the past.

507
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,920
North Abyss is not only your responsibility but also the place where you belong.

508
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,920
You should have your own life.

509
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,260
Sometimes I think,

510
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,800
Ji Yunhe is free, but she trapped you here.

511
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,020
<i>What happened?</i>

512
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,500
<i>Why am I here?</i>

513
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,620
<i>Why can't I move?</i>

514
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,980
<i>Who are you?</i>

515
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,600
<i>Why are you looking at me this way?</i>

516
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,180
It's so scary.

517
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,380
Why do I always have strange dreams recently?

518
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,480
It's becoming scarier and scarier. I even vanished.

519
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:52,240
But... he was good-looking.

520
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,160
It's useless.

521
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,500
He still made me cry.

522
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:06,040
A'Ji, Master wants to examine your fox fire spell.

523
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,520
I'm sick.

524
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
I'm afraid I can't go there,

525
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,720
unless you tell me when you will take me to the outside world.

526
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,900
Master has told you. When you can master the Illusion Art, you can go out.

527
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,260
Okay.

528
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,560
Today, what delicious food did you make?

529
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,880
To be taught by Master in person, that is something many people dream of.

530
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,360
But you let Master invite you there with delicious food.

531
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:42,000
Because I'm beautiful, and Master likes me.

532
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,320
I've tasted peach blossom cake, almond cake, and chestnut cake.

533
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,800
I asked Master to bring jade wine cake for me last time.

534
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,280
Will I eat that today?

535
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,400
If it is, I can share it with you.

536
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,640
Let's talk about it after you passed Master's test.

537
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,360
Otherwise, you can only receive punishment.

538
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,800
Don't worry.

539
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,240
I've learned every spell Master taught me.

540
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,080
This is called talented.

541
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,420
Just go. Master is waiting for you at Flower Sea.

542
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,800
Thank you, Sister Siyu.

543
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,900
I shall go now.

544
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,220
Do you have eyes on the back of your head? How could you escape it?

545
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,680
Fox fire is the most powerful spell you master. This is all you can do?

546
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,660
Of course not. I was afraid you'd get hurt, so I didn't use all my strength.

547
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,880
And you are scolding me. I won't take care of you in the future.

548
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,260
Look.

549
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,360
What's this?

550
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,760
These are called fireworks.

551
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,920
I asked apprentices to bring it back from the human world. Do you like it?

552
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,440
Yes.

553
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,080
Master treats me the best.

554
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,640
<i>Yunhe, if you hadn't experienced the misfortunes in Thousand Flower Valley,</i>

555
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,460
<i>you should have been so innocent and happy.</i>

556
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,360
<i>This is the first time that I've seen fireworks.</i>

557
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,660
<i>Why do I feel it's familiar?</i>

558
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,840
But you used to prepare some dessert for me.

559
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,320
Why did you change it to fireworks today?

560
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,560
Do you really want to know why, or do you want to ask for delicious food?

561
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,680
I want to know why.

562
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,100
Today is your birthday.

563
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,540
The fireworks are a gift for you.

564
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,460
Today is my birthday?

565
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,760
Well, where is jade wine cake?

566
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,320
How's your Illusion Art?

567
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,000
The spells Master taught me are all easy.

568
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,320
I can master them immediately.

569
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,720
Only this Illusion Art, when I can't stay calm, my real face will be revealed.

570
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,380
Master, what about giving me another few days to practice?

571
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,860
Okay, continue to practice.

572
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,320
If you can't do well, you can get nothing to eat.

573
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,540
Master...

574
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,280
Because of you silly fish!

575
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,120
I can't practice Illusion Art well, so I can't have delicious food on my birthday.

576
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,040
If I knew who you were,

577
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,700
I'd make you into a jade wine cake and eat you!

578
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,080
I'm so hungry.

579
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,900
Even if I eat you now, I'm still hungry.

580
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,020
I can't even sleep now.

581
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,020
Will Master be so cruel and make me starve on my birthday?

582
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,820
Master! Master.

583
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,880
I knew you wouldn't let me starve.

584
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,040
Of course, I wouldn't. I know you like things from the human world.

585
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,500
Since it's your birthday, I prepared birthday noodles from the human world.

586
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,280
Actually...

587
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,520
Actually, it's not that I haven't cultivated hard enough.

588
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,120
I've been having nightmares, so I can't stay calm.

589
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,080
What kind of nightmare is it?

590
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, I dream of myself lying on huge ice.

591
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,200
It's snowing and very cold.

592
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,840
A man is holding me in his arms.

593
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,160
And I saw his face.

594
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,240
He looks... nice.

595
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,120
He has a huge tail.

596
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,500
It's long and shining.

597
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:38,080
