He comes to enjoy flowers at midnight.

14
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,400
Interesting.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,160
Yunhe, what have you discovered?

16
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,080
I think there's nothing unusual.

17
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,980
One more lesson.

18
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,200
When you judge a person, study not only his appearance but also what he wants to hide.

19
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,510
Li Shu.

20
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,260
Wisteria tree?

21
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,560
What are you doing?

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,380
Sanyue, what day is it today?

23
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,120
The 5th day of the month.

24
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:39,140
Going outside at night is not allowed.

25
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,522
Go back.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,340
Well, punish me.

27
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,960
In fact, I should punish you.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,320
On the same day three years ago, I met you. Did you forget?

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,240
I should give you a gift today.

30
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,400
There was also a Wisteria tree where we first met.

31
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,300
When I found it in the valley, I wanted to give you a surprise.

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,280
It's also unsuitable.

33
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,580
If someone discovers, you'll be in trouble.

34
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,380
It was you who was the most unruly and fell in love with me.

35
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,400
Don't worry. It's just the two of us tonight.

36
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,430
Just tell me...

37
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,940
...if you like my gift.

38
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,420
How will you repay me?

39
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,849
What are they doing?

40
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,250
I...

41
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,040
Is that true?

42
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,880
Li Shu was nibbling Xue Sanyue's lips.

43
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,480
Xue Sanyue is usually indifferent.

44
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,260
But she's no different from any other in terms of love.

45
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,780
How dare they?

46
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,200
Once Zhuyan seduced Earth Immortals into rebellion.

47
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,160
After it was suppressed, the control over Earth Immortals was strengthened.

48
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,060
Especially in Thousand Flower Valley in charge of training and defense.

49
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,120
To avoid favoritism due to affection, Spiritual Masters mustn't fall in love with Earth Immortals.

50
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,440
Shall we report them?

51
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,440
In Thousand Flower Valley, no one can survive without support.

52
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,100
We should make friends with them.

53
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,907
Master.

54
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,180
- Commander Xue.
- I've sealed off this place.

55
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,760
There is no entry.

56
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,440
Guardian Ji, go back.

57
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,900
I'm here not to see the merman, but you.

58
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,120
Guardian Ji, we don't seem to have any special friendship.

59
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,040
Yesterday, I saw something under the Wisteria tree.

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,480
Take it easy, Xue.

61
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,180
If I wanted to make trouble, I wouldn't have come to see you.

62
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,000
I would have told Master Qingshu directly.

63
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
What do you want?

64
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,840
Cooperation.

65
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,960
You're courageous and abide by morality.

66
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
Me, too.

67
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,120
Since we're the same, why not help each other?

68
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,300
You're good at judging others' inner thoughts.

69
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,080
But you fail to find that I hate being threatened.

70
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,000
Since you saw that, I must kill you.

71
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,869
Come with me! Let's go!

72
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,240
Sanyue, pay attention to the merman.

73
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,900
He was caught by Ji Yunhe.

74
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,646
He won't fight.

75
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:32,032
Li Shu, keep away.

76
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,220
It's my turn.

77
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,680
Don't hurt her!

78
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,200
A merman speaks because of you?

79
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,300
What happened?

80
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,760
<i>Young Master,</i>

81
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,880
<i>someone saw Ji Yunhe and Xue Sanyue enter the Reflect Cave.</i>

82
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,180
<i>I'm afraid there's something unusual.</i>

83
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,420
They're coming!

84
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,380
Big trouble is coming.

85
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,920
Lin Haoqing heard some news.

86
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,380
He's coming from there with a group of people.

87
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,980
Endless trouble today.

88
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,200
Li Shu, those three must die today.

89
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,226
You!

90
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,560
Why are you so naive? Why not make peace?

91
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,120
It's not easy.

92
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,460
I want to but...

93
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,420
Commander Xue, could you calm down and talk with me?

94
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,719
It's meaningless.

Commander Xue, see?

102
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,740
Chang Yi and I are lovers.

103
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,480
We both violated the rules. So I won't report you.

104
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,280
Can you believe me?

105
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:54,380
Chang Yi, Lin Haoqing is coming.

106
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,191
Hide inside.

107
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,280
They're coming!

108
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,820
So many people are here.

109
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Commander Xue, you said no one was allowed to enter.

110
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,920
Commander Xue, how will you explain?

111
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,640
<i>Chang Yi and I are lovers.</i>

112
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,720
<i>We both violated the rules. So I won't report you.</i>

113
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,580
<i>Can you believe me?</i>

114
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm sure Guardian Ji broke into the cave. You went too far!

115
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,551
Stop.

116
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,740
I once heard Ji can make the merman speak.

117
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,660
Out of curiosity, I asked her to come to confirm that.

118
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,680
Young Master's attendant is really self-assertive.

119
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,140
Before he speaks, you declared Ji guilty.

120
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,020
You want to confirm that the merman can speak?

121
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,620
Okay.

122
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,920
Everyone in the valley trusts you. You won't play favoritism.

123
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,100
Prohibition for three days. It's the rule you made.

124
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,660
Pay attention to discretion so as to avoid giving grounds for talk.

125
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,800
Well. Since there's no misunderstanding now,

126
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,140
let's leave.

127
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,680
- Sanyue.
- Li Shu, step aside.

128
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,040
What's your purpose?

129
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,020
Why must you cooperate with me?

130
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,500
Commander Xue, if it's connected to your life,

131
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,800
would you be confused for good

132
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,120
or risk your life to wake up?

133
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,940
Is there a Frost mark on the back of your neck?

134
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,020
So what?

135
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,180
It's a sign for Spiritual Masters here.

136
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,400
Every new Spiritual Master must be planted this mark

137
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,820
by Master to show loyalty to Thousand Flower Valley.

138
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,577
Loyalty?

139
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:28,680
Okay.

140
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,380
Let me show you what loyalty is.

141
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,540
Where are we? It's freezing cold.

142
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,120
Why have I never heard of such an evil place?

143
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,820
It's hidden by Thousand Flower Valley on purpose.

144
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,220
It's also the last destination for all those with cold Frost.

145
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,920
Cold Frost?

146
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,840
It's the mark on the back of your neck.

147
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,800
It's not just a sign.

148
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,560
It's a name.

149
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,920
It is a Frost flower from a very cold place.

150
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,880
As long as this Frost flower is planted,

151
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,100
it will form an unbreakable seal.

152
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Each time the Frost appears,

153
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,120
it freezes the meridians

154
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,200
and blocks your spiritual power, causing great pain.

155
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,580
Cold Frost is a trick from Lin Canglan to control all the Spiritual Masters here.

156
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,278
During these years,

157
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,860
he puts me into an important position and teaches me ostensibly.

158
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,320
In fact, he wants to stimulate the Frost inside me.

159
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,980
I have to suffer a lot every time to get the antidote.

160
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,120
If so, why has my Frost never been unusual?

161
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,160
As long as you are obedient and at his disposal,

162
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
he will let you take the antidote without your knowledge.

163
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,840
But, Commander Xue, are you willing to be manipulated all your life?

164
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,120
Master raised me up.

165
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,040
Why should I believe you?

166
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,880
Lin Canglan has ruled Thousand Flower Valley for hundreds of years.

167
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,160
Do you remember that

168
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,400
there are always some Spiritual Masters that leave suddenly?

169
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,920
Of course.

170
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
Master said those who are unwilling to stay

171
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,640
shall leave after erasing the Frost sign on their own.

172
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,040
Thousand Flower Valley won't stop them.

173
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,520
If you don't believe me,

174
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,140
try to erase it.

175
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,479
Sanyue!

176
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,200
The frost she mentioned is true!

177
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,300
Understand?

178
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,440
No one can erase the seal.

179
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,120
Since it was planted in your body,

180
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,500
you've been a pawn of Lin Canglan.

181
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,740
All rebellious people will finally be brought here

182
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,760
into endless ice and eternal sleep,

183
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,740
so it is particularly cold here,

184
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,900
which is called the Cold Grave.

185
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,720
<i>Master, please be lenient with me.</i>

186
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,240
<i>Master, show some mercy.</i>

187
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,720
<i>Please be lenient with me.</i>

188
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,000
<i>I won't violate your orders, Master.</i>

189
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,901
<i>Master.</i>

190
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,200
<i>Be lenient with me.</i>

191
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,226
<i>Master. Master.</i>

192
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,520
<i>Remember. This is the consequence of betraying Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

193
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,100
Once upon a time, Thousand Flower Valley was a paradise.

194
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,320
But now it's a place where Lin Canglan imprisons us.

195
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,900
In fact, we're not even as free as an Earth Immortal.

196
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,980
You kept it under wraps for years.

197
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,240
Why are you suddenly telling me?

198
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,300
Because I want a friend who will never betray me

199
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,440
and escape from Thousand Flower Valley together.

200
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,500
Haven't you ever thought about

201
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,560
leaving here and living the life you want?

202
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,740
You can also stay with the man you love,

203
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,740
instead of meeting him secretly late at night.

204
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,140
It's too dangerous.

205
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,893
I can't risk Li Shu's life.

206
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:23,340
Sanyue, I'm not afraid of risks.

207
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,839
I'm only afraid that your life will always be manipulated by others.

208
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,100
That's more terrible than death to me.

209
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,840
Ji Yunhe, I believe your story.

210
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,240
But I don't trust you.

211
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,700
I'm not sure if you really love a merman.

212
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,760
You saw that just now. He and I have...

213
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,308
A kiss can't prove anything.

214
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:47,880
I can't entrust the life of Li Shu and me to an unreliable person.

215
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,520
You must prove you really love each other.

216
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,137
Well...

217
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,020
When the spirit of the Fei monster made trouble,

218
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,660
Chang Yi was locked up in Reflect Cave.

219
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,880
He was at odds with me.

220
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,480
You want me to prove it?

221
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm afraid...

222
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm afraid it's the best chance.

223
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,380
I'll prove we love each other deeply in three days.

224
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,260
We're absolutely reliable.

225
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,360
Okay.

226
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,860
During the three days, you shall see him secretly.

227
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,740
But if I find that you have cheated me three days later,

228
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,060
I'll kill you.

229
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,820
Well. Is this the end of it?

230
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,300
You kissed a merman recklessly.

231
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,600
You make your bed, so you must lie in it.

232
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,700
If I didn't do that, we would have been killed.

233
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,080
Do you really want to make an alliance with Xue Sanyue?

234
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,060
She's quite strong.

235
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,920
If we make an alliance with her, we'll have more chances to escape from Thousand Flower Valley.

236
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,560
But how will you please Mr. Fish?

237
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,260
First, you cheated him. Then, you kissed him.

238
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,460
Now you want him to play a trick with you?

239
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,480
I'm worried.

240
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,560
<i>Big-tailed Fish, I had no choice but to treat you in that way.</i>

241
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,600
<i>If you help me this time,</i>

242
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,900
<i>I'll raise you with lots of meat and wine.</i>

243
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,220
<i>Chang Yi is my lover.</i>

244
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,620
<i>Ji Yunhe, it's your fault.</i>

245
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,158
<i>You deserve it.</i>

246
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,920
<i>But... maybe it's easy to please him.</i>

247
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,807
Big-tailed Fish, are you still angry after one night?

248
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,740
It's important.

249
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,140
You should be angry.

250
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,040
I made a big mistake.

251
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,980
But... it was really urgent yesterday.

252
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,840
I had no time to think carefully so I kissed you.

253
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,980
Don't be angry. Can you forgive me?

254
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,320
You can imagine you were bit by a dog.

255
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,960
Dog?

256
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,500
Are you angry because that was your first kiss?

257
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,540
It was also my first kiss.

258
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,540
Big-tailed Fish.

259
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,420
Smelly!

260
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,780
You've been locked up for days. You're smelly!

261
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,560
What about a bath?

262
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,200
I'll treat you well.

263
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,600
If I can make you happy, will you forgive me?

264
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,100
Okay. That's a deal.

265
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,520
I'm sure you'll take a good bath.

266
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,377
You won't have any loss.

267
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,460
Although there's not much water, it's better to have than not.

268
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,640
Let me help you.

269
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,978
Come on. Is that okay?

270
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:32,120
With water, are you happier?

271
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,440
As long as you forgive me, I can do anything for you.

272
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,760
Tell me what you want.

273
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:43,260
Your apology etiquette is really special.

274
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,376
Do you like it?

275
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,918
Come on.

276
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,060
Are you touched?

277
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,100
It dropped inside.

278
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,518
Let me help you.

279
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,132
Come on.

280
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,660
<i>Ji Yunhe and Xue Sanyue looked strange that day.</i>

281
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,860
<i>Are they plotting anything secretly?</i>

282
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,862
Any progress?

283
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,760
You failed again?

284
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,960
During the three days, you've pleased him many times.

285
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,760
You've tried anything, including food, drinks, and toys.

286
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,000
Many of my spirit stones have been wasted.

287
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,440
How long will that fish keep up appearances?

288
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,920
Come on. Three days will pass.

289
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,040
Xue Sanyue will go to Reflect Cave to prove your words soon.

290
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,440
Luo Luo, I offered to train the merman. Was I wrong?

291
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,660
I used to be quite confident

292
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,300
that I can see people's inner thoughts easily.

293
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:20,200
But I don't know what to do when I meet Big-tailed Fish.

294
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,220
Will I fail this time?

295
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,660
Stop.

296
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,400
You never give up easily.

297
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,320
You said we should stand in someone else's shoes.

298
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,060
You're the same as that fish.

299
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,960
I'm sure you know how to make him happy.

300
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,180
I'm the same as him?

301
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,480
He's the most stubborn merman.

302
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,080
Meantime, you're the most stubborn Spiritual Master.

303
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,520
You're both controlled but unwilling to surrender.

304
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,680
You're the same.

305
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,760
Come on.

306
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
I'll give you a bowl of sweet soup.

307
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
After you drink it,

308
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,900
go to Reflect Cave again.

309
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,960
And this bowl of soup is for him.

310
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,800
He's a lonely fish.

311
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,780
He has no friends or family on Earth. So unfortunate.

312
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,558
- Here you are.
- Luo Luo.

313
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,920
You are the smartest person in the world.

314
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,560
I know that.

315
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Here you are.

316
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,349
I have an idea.

317
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,560
Won't you have the soup?

318
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,450
No!

319
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,539
I'll have the soup.

320
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:32,340
Big-tailed Fish, it doesn't matter if you don't forgive me.

321
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,360
It's my fault.

322
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,200
During these days, I've always been thinking about

323
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,960
how to please you with nice food and something interesting.

324
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,760
But I failed.

325
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,610
In the end,

326
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,160
I just have such a worthless thing.

327
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,720
I don't know other mermen.

328
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,600
I don't know what mermen like.

329
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,600
However, people who are displaced and lonely

330
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,160
should miss home most.

331
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,160
Although this conch is not as precious as other magic instruments,

332
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,513
it's said that you can hear the sound of the sea in it.

333
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:12,040
I hope it can make you happy when you're lonely.

334
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,340
♫ <i>Each pair of eyes belongs to a merman</i> ♫

335
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,340
♫ <i>A drop in the ocean</i> ♫

336
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,440
♫ <i>Time is dreamy and turns into scales</i> ♫

337
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,240
♫ <i>The Milky Way ripples</i> ♫

338
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,440
♫ <i>I'm flying in the Milky Way like wind</i> ♫

339
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,040
♫ <i>Passing through the sea of stars</i> ♫

340
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,040
♫ <i>Enter the forest of light</i> ♫

341
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,840
♫ <i>Leap over the stream in the sky</i> ♫

342
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,200
♫ <i>My shadow is like a smile curve</i> ♫

343
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Why are you...

344
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,220
so nice to me?

345
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,580
Because...

346
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,680
Because I like you.

347
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,342
<i>I like you. I like you. I like you.</i>

348
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:32,158
I like you.

349
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,278
I appreciate you.

350
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,880
I want to be your lover.

351
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,700
I want to be with you all the time.

352
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,160
But...

353
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,480
We're not familiar.

354
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,540
But you help and protect me.

355
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,620
You show me everything about you.

356
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,700
Big-tailed Fish, love has nothing to do with time length.

357
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,460
It only relies on your heart.

358
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,463
And you?

359
00:27:07,463 --> 00:27:09,118
Do you like me?

360
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,640
Will you think of me from time to time?

361
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,820
Do you want to be with me?

362
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,540
Shall I kiss you one more time...

363
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,240
to make you more clear?

364
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,440
Father said...

365
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:54,220
I should hug a loved one before kissing.

366
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,738
Be careful. Rules.

367
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,360
Sanyue, you're always lonely.

368
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,440
How do you feel about having an ally?

369
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,080
Just out of common interests.

370
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,820
We're allies, no need to be friends.

371
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,520
Now, are we called...

372
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,320
Do you mean to say that we are in love with each other?

373
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,960
Chang Yi, you're not used to the language on shore yet.

374
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,520
It's a book on shore with characters and pictures.

375
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,680
It can help you learn our language quickly.

376
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,240
It's said that you mermen are smart.

377
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,040
I'm sure you'll learn quickly.

378
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,020
Luo Luo and I will come to teach you when we are free.

379
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,140
Any progress? Did he believe it?

380
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,080
Yunhe, why are you unhappy?

381
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,760
I'm fine. A bit tired.

382
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,080
Since he believes in you,

383
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,160
shall we persuade him into cutting off his tail?

384
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,360
So quickly.

385
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,838
Quickly?

386
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,820
We must win twice to have the chance to win in the end.

387
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,160
Yunhe, what's wrong?

388
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,440
I'm fine. Go on.

389
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,540
I have an idea.

390
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,040
Your encyclopedia is of a little use.

391
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,600
It includes a lot of nice food and many interesting things.

392
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,160
You can tempt him

393
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,980
that he can get anything on shore and you want to enjoy life with him.

394
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,200
I'm sure he'll give up his tail and go ashore.

395
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,740
It's you who wants to have fun outside.

396
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,240
I'm not such a person.

397
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,100
Anyway, tell him that life on shore is much better than that at sea.

398
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,800
<i>Shall I take her back to the sea</i>

399
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,040
<i>since I like her?</i>

400
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,280
The prohibition period is over.

401
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,000
The following three days belong to you.

402
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,080
But three days later, it will be the turn of Lin Haoqing.

403
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,600
Thank you, Xue.

404
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,400
Don't be close to me.

405
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,820
I have no interest.

406
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,840
No. Why?

407
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,980
As long as you go ashore, you can enjoy lots of table delicacies from land and sea.

408
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,240
Why not?

409
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,960
Food from land is not yummy.

410
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,080
As to the latter, I can find them in the sea.

411
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,961
No need to go ashore.

412
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:56,660
Strange. Why are you speaking so fluently overnight?

413
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,040
Yunhe, what did you do yesterday?

414
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,860
Did you teach him to speak secretly?

415
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,940
Did she nibble your lips?

416
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,160
Don't talk nonsense.

417
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,340
Big-tailed Fish, apart from food,

418
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,380
there are many interesting things on shore.

419
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,600
One more thing. The sea must be dark and you can't see anything.

420
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,480
The sea is not as bright as the land.

421
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,960
I live in a big clam.

422
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,720
There is a big pearl inside that shines on itself

423
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,100
and can illuminate everything.

424
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,960
Just a pearl. How big? One more thing.

425
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,140
Nearly the same size as you.

426
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,275
So big!

427
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,680
You must be upset inside.

428
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,160
The clamshell I live in is ten times bigger than here.

429
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,500
Father's residence is also larger than Thousand Flower Valley.

430
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,480
If you like it, I can take you back to the sea.

431
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Big-tailed Fish, is there anything on shore that you don't have in the sea?

432
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,080
Father said the cunning villains on shore are greedy for a fish's tail.

433
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,981
There is no such person in the sea.

434
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,000
Why do you mermen cherish such a flashy tail?

435
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,720
Is it that important?

436
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,400
The tail is the source of our spiritual power.

437
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,240
Unless we volunteer, our tails will not break

438
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,260
even if it's chiseled with a knife or ax.

439
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,680
But once the tail is broken off,

440
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,518
we'll lose much spiritual power

441
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,300
and won't be able to return to sea anymore.

442
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,320
The loss of a tail has such terrible consequences.

443
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,520
You can't even go home?

444
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,680
If a merman breaks from his tail, he'll feel like he is being boiled in water.

445
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,800
We'll consider him a betrayer.

446
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,900
So Father said we'd rather die than break from our tails.

447
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,200
Yunhe, shall we grow a tail and enter the sea?

448
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,720
I have something to do. We should leave.

449
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,199
What's the matter?

450
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,816
Luo Luo.

451
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,080
<i>She's angry.</i>

452
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,180
<i>Did I say anything wrong?</i>

453
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,838
<i>But once the tail is broken off,</i>

454
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,078
<i>we'll lose much spiritual power</i>

455
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,720
<i>and won't be able to return to sea anymore.</i>

456
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,980
<i>If a merman breaks off his tail, he'll feel like he's being boiled in water.</i>

457
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,940
<i>We'll consider him a betrayer.</i>

458
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,980
<i>From the very beginning,</i>

459
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,980
<i>my goal was to tame mermen.</i>

460
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,720
<i>But why was I so sad when hearing that he wouldn't be able to go home...</i>

461
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,140
<i>once the tail is lost?</i>

462
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,760
Sanyue, my swordsmanship is not as good as yours.

463
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,540
But we cats do better in cooking fish.

464
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,620
Do you know that

465
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,460
men plow and women weave in the human world?

466
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,500
We don't have such rules.

467
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,200
As long as you like,

468
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,560
laundry and cooking are full of happiness.

469
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,840
By the way, I don't have much power.

470
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,600
If I'm not good at cooking, how can I be your husband?

471
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,060
Commander Xue! Commander Xue.

472
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,080
Yunhe said we're allies. We should help each other.

473
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,940
Just out of interest. I won't help her.

474
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,720
I'm here not to see you, but Li Shu.

475
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,020
You want me to teach Ji Yunhe to attract Chang Yi more?

476
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,240
I can't say more.

477
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,720
In a word, only if Chang Yi likes Yunhe more will he go ashore willingly.

478
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,080
By the way, among us,

479
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,100
you know best what love is.

480
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,600
Why?

481
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,480
You can even win Xue Sanyue's heart!

482
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,080
So I'm sure you have ideas.

483
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,560
Or I can give you some spirit stones.

484
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,800
Considering your weak power, you need them.

485
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,480
Come on, little butterfly.

486
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,240
Save your stones.

487
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,320
Since you trust me, I'll do you a favor.

488
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,620
But it's no use teaching Ji Yunhe.

489
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,080
It's that dull fish that should learn.

490
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,800
A cat teaches a fish?

491
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,004
Will he agree?

492
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,400
You don't understand.

493
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,048
Yes. You know what's best.

494
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,480
I want to help you, but you don't buy it.

495
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,880
I shouldn't have come to teach you.

496
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,878
There's a feud between us two clans.

497
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,200
Why do you want to help me?

498
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,560
If you make up with Ji Yunhe,

499
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,560
I'll be able to escape Thousand Flower Valley with Sanyue and lead a happy life.

500
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,740
By the way, aren't you upset since Ji Yunhe is at odds with you?

501
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,520
Don't you want to see her bright smile again as soon as possible?

502
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,980
You have little spiritual power. How will you teach me?

503
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,640
When it comes to love, fighting is useless.

504
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,020
When I first met Sanyue, I was nearly killed by her.

505
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,220
I was once a king on a mountain and admired by people.

506
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,160
At that time, Sanyue fought with a beast and was badly hurt.

507
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,000
When she passed by Mountain Qiongling,

508
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,980
I met her by chance.

509
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,880
<i>Rascal!</i>

510
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,200
<i>- Awake?
- Let me go!</i>

511
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,920
<i>It's hard to meet a beauty.</i>

512
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,000
<i>I can't let you go.</i>

513
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,560
<i>I need a wife.</i>

514
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,880
<i>Are you willing to be my wife?</i>

515
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,640
<i>You...</i>

516
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,860
<i>Is she dead?</i>

517
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,780
<i>It's Cold Pond Fish soup.</i>

518
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,260
<i>Shall I cook for you every day?</i>

519
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,284
<i>Beauty.</i>

520
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,120
<i>Beauty, don't beat me.</i>

521
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,700
<i>You'll be ugly if you get injured.</i>

522
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,400
<i>Get some good rest.</i>

523
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,160
<i>I'll cook fish soup for you every day, okay?</i>

524
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,980
When Sanyue was nearly cured, my men found her.

525
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,020
They were afraid that a Spiritual Master would cause endless danger.

526
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,940
So they forced me to send Sanyue to the beast she hurt.

527
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,360
<i>Take out the Spiritual Master!</i>

528
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,760
<i>Yes! Take her out!</i>

529
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,440
<i>She's a Spiritual Master. Take her out!</i>

530
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,200
<i>- Ask her to come out!
- Take her out! Hurry up!</i>

531
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,600
<i>- She's a Spiritual Master!
- Take her out!</i>

532
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,774
<i>If you protect her...</i>

533
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:17,400
<i>I don't mind if she is a Spiritual Master.</i>

534
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,000
<i>She's my treasure. You can beat me.</i>

535
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,400
<i>We've endured you, a useless leader, for a long time.</i>

536
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,620
<i>Let's go! We'll leave such a bad place!</i>

537
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,340
<i>- Go!
- Go!</i>

538
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,520
<i>Beauty, today's fish soup is very fresh.</i>

539
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,060
I thought Sanyue would never return.

540
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,880
So I decided to leave Mountain Qiongling to make a living.

541
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,220
<i>Beauty?</i>

542
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,660
<i>Am I daydreaming?</i>

543
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,240
<i>Why are you back?</i>

544
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,540
<i>Except Mountain Qiongling, where else can you go?</i>

545
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,400
<i>I'll find a place sooner or later.</i>

546
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
<i>I lost my stockaded village.</i>

547
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,400
<i>So I can't catch you as my wife.</i>

548
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,340
<i>Beauty, shall I follow you?</i>

549
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,040
<i>I was driven away because I saved you. You should be responsible for me.</i>

550
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,780
<i>How?</i>

551
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,880
<i>I need nice food and sugared words.</i>

552
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,700
<i>Then I'll follow you to every corner of the world.</i>

553
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,980
<i>In fact, I can live without nice food. It's easy to raise me.</i>

554
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,200
<i>As long as you accept me, I'll take care of you.</i>

555
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,840
<i>Shall I cook fish soup for you every day?</i>

556
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,300
<i>Please talk to me.</i>

557
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,161
<i>How about that?</i>

558
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:02,610
♫ <i>Each pair of eyes belongs to a merman</i> ♫

559
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:09,880
♫ <i>A drop in the ocean</i> ♫

560
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:15,660
