20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,080
Well, I dream of myself lying on huge ice.

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,500
It's snowing and very cold.

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,020
A man is holding me in his arms.

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,240
And I saw his face.

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,520
He looks... nice.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,580
He has a huge tail. It's long and shining.

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
And?

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,680
And he looked sad.

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,520
A bead fell from his eye.

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,760
Just like this.

30
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,640
Master, you told me it was on me when you found me.

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,900
What is it?

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,940
Is it the one that was in my dream?

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,100
It's called a pearl.

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,800
There are thousands of bright pearls in the vast world.

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,720
It's an ordinary one.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,040
Just like your dream.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,320
It's also the most common one in thousands of dreams.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,220
Don't think about it.

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,760
It's just this?

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,080
I thought it had something to do with my past.

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,440
Jade wine cakes.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,120
Master, you really brought them for me.

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,580
A'Ji, I used to have a dream, too.

44
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,528
There was someone I liked and someone I hated in my dream.

45
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:00,260
The one I liked wanted to leave.

46
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,680
I wanted to keep her at all costs, even at the cost of my life.

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,180
But the one I hated told me,

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,900
there were so many things I have to do with my life.

49
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,300
They were far more important than my life, my love and hatred.

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Master, I can't understand.

51
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,160
Forget it.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,980
You will be happy if you can't understand, right?

53
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,040
Let the dream stay in the dream.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
A'Ji, remember.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,360
Time flies year after year.

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,000
You shouldn't go back.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,300
But, Master...

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,820
Are you going to practice? Do you want to leave here?

59
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,760
Of course.

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,540
I'll practice Illusion Art hard.

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,140
Master, you can't break your promise by then.

62
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,380
I've waited for this day for a long time.

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,420
The antidote is almost made.

64
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,742
Now we just need the cold-resistant Jibai herb.

65
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:40,720
Donglian sent me a letter that he got a clue in the human world the other day.

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,800
If he can take the herb back, the antidote will be made.

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,540
That's why you promised that A'Ji could get out of here soon. Right?

68
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,814
All Spiritual Masters of Thousand Flower Valley can be free when the antidote is made.

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,440
By then, I'll find a good man for you.

70
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,960
What about you, Master?

71
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,440
I'll travel around the world with A'Ji to fulfill my wish.

72
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,060
Master, I'm happy for you that you can get what you want.

73
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,720
General, you're drinking too much.

74
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,060
Too much?

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,580
Qing Yao is going to give up the North Abyss.

76
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:48,700
I can't understand why she can't let that merman go.

77
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,320
Qifeng.

78
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,500
I'm here to take over your station.

79
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,440
I heard your fox hole was pretty good.

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,280
How about I take over there?

81
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,560
Don't go too far.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,700
So what?

83
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,840
You're just an errand man of Master.

84
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,040
What makes you arrogant?

85
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,340
Oh, yeah. Your cousin is always clinging to Master.

86
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,980
I don't think Master is interested in her.

87
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,260
Let her be my woman.

88
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,900
General, he's dead.

89
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,320
How dare you piss me off?

90
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,760
Who do you think you are?

91
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,820
What should we do if the merman learns of it?

92
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,520
Why panic?

93
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,660
We've already got a scapegoat.

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,440
Master, something happened.

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,320
What's up?

96
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,640
A Spiritual Master called Lu Jinyan

97
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,440
had a quarrel with the Fu brothers when they fought over the station.

98
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,040
Lu Jinyan was so angry that he killed Fu Heng while under the influence.

99
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,320
Now the two groups are fighting.

100
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,360
Many guys have been hurt.

101
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,720
My brother had your waist tag in his hand when he died.

102
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,540
Don't try and deny it.

103
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm not trying to deny it.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
Let me tell you again.

105
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
I fell asleep after I drank too much.

106
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,840
And you framed me for murder when I woke up.

107
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,020
I dare to act and dare to bear responsibility.

108
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,620
I didn't kill him.

109
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,720
Enough!

110
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,300
You're so noisy. How can Master make a judgment?

111
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,220
Master, it's all over North Abyss. And it's a pretty big event.

112
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,400
He must be punished severely.

113
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,080
Master, it was unexpected and strange.

114
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,760
Why not let me look into it first?

115
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,680
Why bother? I didn't kill him.

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,080
Even if you want to, you should find out who planted it on me.

117
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,920
I regret listening to Kong Ming's nonsense.

118
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
I shouldn't have been here.

119
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,310
Weren't you being arrogant on Ice Lake just now?

120
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,800
Where did you catch them?

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,460
Master, we chased him all the way to Ice Lake.

122
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,520
Lock the two up in Insanity Cave.

123
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,760
Kill them on another day.

124
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,100
Master.

125
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,240
Master, you... you kill him because he's guilty.

126
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Why catch me?

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,720
That's impressive.

128
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
- Master.
<i>- I turn to you...</i>

129
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,640
- No. We haven't figured it out yet.
<i>- Take them away.</i>

130
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,840
We can't just finish it.

131
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,460
- What if someone else did it?
<i>- You!</i>

132
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,820
No disputes are allowed in North Abyss's law.

133
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,240
Troublemakers must be killed without mercy.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,100
Stop interceding for him.

135
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,000
Master!

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,019
General, you're wise.

137
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,620
Lu Jinyan and Fu Heng argued with each other in front of everybody.

138
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,360
The living one is drunk and confused.

139
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,980
He couldn't explain it and he's easily offended.

140
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,420
No one will associate this matter with you.

141
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,940
When Lu Jinyan is killed, it'll be completely finished.

142
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,180
I was sort of anxious when Qing Yao interceded for him.

143
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,600
Luckily, that merman had no reason at all when it came to Ji Yunhe.

144
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
Thanks to your plan.

145
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,080
You pushed Lu Jinyan to Ice Lake secretly, which pissed that merman off.

146
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,680
After this, I don't think those Spiritual Masters dare to show off.

147
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,720
Master, you don't have a quick temper usually.

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,260
What's wrong with you?

149
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,620
Send someone to keep an eye on Qifeng.

150
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,340
Qifeng?

151
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,120
Shouldn't it be Lu Jinyan?

152
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,840
Lu Jinyan just came to North Abyss.

153
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,880
His residence was from Young Lord Qing Yao.

154
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,642
How could he sneak into Fu Heng's place and kill him when he was drunk?

155
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:40,160
He's not as capable as they think.

156
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,220
Master, you'd already made a judgment.

157
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,620
Lu Jinyan isn't the murderer.

158
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,700
But how are you sure that it's Qifeng?

159
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm not sure.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,300
I just think he's suspicious.

161
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,800
Since Spiritual Masters of Thousand Flower Valley came to North Abyss,

162
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,420
his resentment has gotten deeper.

163
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,560
He's getting very offhand with business.

164
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,680
He has never been as active as today.

165
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,560
Besides, didn't you say

166
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,020
Qifeng was there when Lu Jinyan quarreled with Fu Brothers?

167
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,880
He was upset, too.

168
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,480
Master, you know it clearly.

169
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,240
But why did you want to kill them?

170
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,640
Is it because they broke into Ice Lake and disturbed that one?

171
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,860
I was pretending to punish them.

172
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,120
Only in this way can Qifeng take it lightly and slip up.

173
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,560
Anyway, they did break North Abyss's law.

174
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,800
I should give them a lesson so that they'll learn.

175
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,660
As for Ice Lake, no one is allowed to disturb its peace.

176
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,860
Whoever breaks in by mistake must also be punished.

177
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,840
I see.

178
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,120
Sister Siyu, I've gained what my master asked me to practice.

179
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,740
Does his word still count?

180
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,460
My father's cause is about to be done.

181
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,060
Thousand Flower Valley will be free soon.

182
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,840
Master.

183
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,240
A'Ji said she's finally mastered Illusion Art.

184
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,160
And she asked if you will still keep your promise that she could leave here?

185
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,520
She's so impatient.

186
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,540
Ask her to wait for me.

187
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,920
Donglian has gotten the Jibai herb.

188
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,060
They're on their way back.

189
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,480
When we get the antidote and can cure everyone's Frost mark seals,

190
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,660
I'll leave here with A'Ji.

191
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,420
It's you.

192
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,980
- Where's Elder Donglian?
- He hasn't come back yet.

193
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,360
Maybe something came up on the way.

194
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,740
Master.

195
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,140
It's broken.

196
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,980
We can make the antidote again when Elder Donglian comes back.

197
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,760
Master, we were ambushed by Zhu Ling.

198
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,140
I'm afraid I can't help you this time.

199
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,440
You must take care of yourself.

200
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,820
Take all of them to Immortal Master Mansion.

201
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,260
I'm to blame.

202
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,480
Master.

203
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,340
Why hasn't Master come back yet?

204
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,400
Master, it's after midnight.

205
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,900
A'Ji is still waiting for you. What to do?

206
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,240
I must save Donglian and the other guys.

207
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,460
Master, are you going to Immortal Master Mansion?

208
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,540
Master, you're finally here. I almost fell asleep.

209
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,860
Where do you want to go?

210
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,000
Go wherever there's good food and fun.

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,260
It's rainy down the hill and there are many snakes and insects.

212
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,420
Though you have immortal arts, you're not good at them.

213
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,680
You should take some herbs and magic weapons with you.

214
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
- Siyu.
- Here.

215
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,360
You're going to leave here alone tomorrow.

216
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,220
Why just me? I thought you'd go with me.

217
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,040
I have something important to do.

218
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,100
It could be a month or six months.

219
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,000
Can you wait?

220
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,080
Six months?

221
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,300
I know you're in a hurry. So I want you to go first.

222
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,560
Master, you make it sound like I only think about having fun.

223
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,340
Some of my father's former subordinates live in the south.

224
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,260
I've written to them about leaving you with them.

225
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,060
The map is in the package. Just follow the map.

226
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,820
Master, will you go to meet me after you're done?

227
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,080
Of course.

228
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,900
You'll pass through the human world along the way.

229
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,880
There'll be a lot of delicious food and fun.

230
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,760
Explore the way for me. I'll be right there.

231
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,960
Well, we can say that I have it all covered!

232
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,060
Master, you're afraid Shunde and Immortal Master will get here and find A'Ji when you're out.

233
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,940
That's why you sent her away. Right?

234
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,240
My life is no longer mine.

235
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
Since I'm the master, I should do the job.

236
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,660
Donglian is still waiting for me.

237
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes. I'll go to prepare my luggage now.

238
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,800
- I'll go with you tomorrow.
- No need.

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,040
This trip is dangerous. I'll go alone.

240
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,360
Siyu.

241
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,500
You've been my attendant for 100 years.

242
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,960
From now on, we're not connected.

243
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,520
Go to the south with A'Ji tomorrow.

244
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,840
- Master.
- The way my father chose for me...

245
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,899
makes me live and die alone.

246
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:23,140
It's enough for you to be with me until now.

247
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,300
No, I don't accept it.

248
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,460
If you want to take care of A'Ji, do it by yourself.

249
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
No.

250
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,540
No. No.

251
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,840
I know the way you chose is extremely difficult.

252
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,120
I want nothing more than to be your shadow

253
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,080
and follow you everywhere you go.

254
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,080
At least, you won't be too lonely all the way.

255
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,980
Did you forget that I said I wanted to be with you forever,

256
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,400
no matter if I were alive or dead?

257
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,600
Please fulfill my wish.

258
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:25,480
I won't follow your orders this time.

259
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,060
Master, you should come and meet me when you're done.

260
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,600
Master, would you accept a pinky swear?

261
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,620
From today, you're free.

262
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,480
You can go wherever and do whatever you want.

263
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,300
You don't have to find me if I don't come and meet you.

264
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,520
No way!

265
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,760
How can you break your promise so soon?

266
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,940
No. You should come with me.

267
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,740
Okay, I promise you. I'll come and see you soon.

268
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,300
You can punish me as you want if I'm late. How is that?

269
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,900
Really?

270
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,660
Then I should think about how to punish you.

271
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,380
Actually, besides eating and having fun,

272
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,340
I didn't think about what I wanted to do.

273
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,320
You'll know what you want to do and where you want to go someday.

274
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,900
But you should remember what you promised me.

275
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,100
Don't go to Lutai Mountain. Don't show who I am. Never go to North Abyss.

276
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
Send more letters to Thoudand Flower Valley.

277
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,620
I will send letters every day.

278
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,020
Go.

279
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,780
Master, I'll follow this route. By then...

280
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,580
I'm going to leave. Remember to meet me soon.

281
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,120
<i>A'Ji, remember.</i>

282
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,620
<i>Don't go back.</i>

283
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,020
I used to think there was so much fun around the human world.

284
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,960
But why does it look so boring now?

285
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,942
<i>[Guilai Hotel]</i>

286
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:31,920
You should be careful on this trip to the human world.

287
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,140
If you meet fugitive Spiritual Masters, bring the seriously injured ones to Mr. Kong Ming.

288
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,320
And send the others to North Abyss.

289
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,680
- Okay.
- It'll protect them.

290
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,660
Okay.

291
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,520
Qu Xiaoxing.

292
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,760
Friend. She's my friend.

293
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,240
Luo Luo, what are you doing here?

294
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,820
- I...
- You must be here to see Mr. Kong Ming.

295
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,700
He's healing someone upstairs. He'll be right down.

296
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,080
I'm not here to see him.

297
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm just hanging out and looking for a good man.

298
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,580
What?

299
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,620
Why are you laughing?

300
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,120
Nothing. I just felt it might be a little hard for you

301
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,580
to find a good husband with your looks.

302
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,120
Yeah. Right.

303
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,640
I just have some freckles.

304
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,540
I'll be beautiful after some spiritual practice.

305
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,760
Why can't I look for a better man?

306
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,500
Well.

307
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,080
Luo Luo, what are you going to do?

308
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,500
Show them I'll be pretty after spiritual practice.

309
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,860
I don't think it's appropriate.

310
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,920
You're my friend. I can't do that to you.

311
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Don't worry. I'll be responsible for you after that.

312
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,500
How many people are you going to be responsible for?

313
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,660
Mr. Kong Ming, I can explain it.

314
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,540
What are you explaining?

315
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,040
They laughed at me.

316
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,360
Should I be laughed at without doing anything?

317
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,420
Come with me.

318
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,840
Come in!

319
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,680
Luo Jinsang, didn't you tell me you wanted to live on Immortal Island?

320
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,040
There's nothing for me to do. Okay?

321
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,460
Leave me alone.

322
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm here to drink.

323
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,940
Drink. And then you'll sleep with someone else?

324
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,820
You left me.

325
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,400
You hated me.

326
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
There are a lot of men who are better than you.

327
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,140
Give it to me.

328
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,842
Let me tell you.

329
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:54,900
No matter how many men there are, you can only be responsible for me.

330
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,480
I can do that.

331
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,720
But do you accept me?

332
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,020
You avoid me when I get close to you.

333
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,500
Get away from me if you hate me like that. I don't want you at all.

334
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,840
I'll find a handsome man who's a thousand times better than you.

335
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,740
I'll let you know there's someone who loves me.

336
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,560
My freckles have gone.

337
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,220
Do I look beautiful?

338
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,800
Yes. You're always pretty.

339
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,980
You're lying.

340
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,500
No, I'm not lying to you.

341
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,780
And I never judge a girl by her looks.

342
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,140
I value a beautiful heart.

343
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,660
You... have a beautiful heart.

344
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,120
Then, why do you always despise me?

345
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,600
I've never despised you.

346
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,100
Well, at first,

347
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:44,040
I sensed that there were some complicated and strange feelings.

348
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,660
Every time I saw you, there were butterflies in my stomach.

349
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,720
But when I couldn't see you, I felt...

350
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,980
Well... That feeling, do you know?

351
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,060
I don't know when I became like this.

352
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,320
Until Yunhe died.

353
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,020
I'm sorry, Luo Luo.

354
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,200
Actually, I don't blame you for Yunhe's death.

355
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,960
She's just relentless.

356
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,740
No one can stop her.

357
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,920
I was just...

358
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,580
I was just sad.

359
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,780
I only wanted to blame someone.

360
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,780
Luo Luo... Put anything on me.

361
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,980
Beat and scold me as you like. Okay?

362
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,400
Mr. Kong Ming, you're so good.

363
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,160
Did you really fall for me?

364
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,920
Come on. What do you mean?

365
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,640
No. I was just saying.

366
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,220
- Just saying?
- No.

367
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,420
What about you?

368
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,040
Others are not as fun as you.

369
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,160
Fun?

370
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,480
- No.
- You.

371
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,493
I don't mean that.

372
00:26:45,493 --> 00:26:46,898
I...

373
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:50,020
Anyway, I did think you were annoying.

374
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,080
I haven't seen you for a while.

375
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,320
I found I really missed you.

376
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,220
But the thought that you disliked me made me sad.

377
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,340
Anyway, drinking is not fun without you.

378
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,600
And it's getting boring outside.

379
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,460
Let me ask you.

380
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,840
Is it because you want a good man to have fun with you

381
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,420
or because you like me?

382
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,780
Mr. Kong Ming, why are you more foolish than me?

383
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,030
I want you.

384
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,160
I only want you.

385
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,080
Do you hear me?

386
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,860
<i>Master, I've arrived in the human world.</i>

387
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,540
<i>It's my first time here alone.</i>

388
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,380
<i>But I'm not afraid of it at all.</i>

389
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,560
<i>I'm so awesome.</i>

390
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,120
<i>I used to think the Immortal Realm was pretty good.</i>

391
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,620
<i>Now I finally know how big the world is.</i>

392
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,320
<i>The Immortal Realm is noble.</i>

393
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,860
<i>While the human world is bustling.</i>

394
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,940
<i>Master, I guess you're right.</i>

395
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,040
<i>I'll get where I want to go and know what I want to do.</i>

396
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,440
Guilai Hotel.

397
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,200
<i>It's my first time here.</i>

398
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,740
<i>Why do I feel like I've been here?</i>

399
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,700
<i>Could it be related to that big-tailed fish in my dream again?</i>

400
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,840
<i>Master doesn't like me to mention the dream.</i>

401
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
<i>I shall wipe it out.</i>

402
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,260
I bought so many colors.

403
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,920
Which one should I try first?

404
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,520
<i>Someone is using spiritual power outside. Maybe master is coming.</i>

405
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,240
<i>It's not Master.</i>

406
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,860
A lackey of Immortal Master Mansion. Where are you going?

407
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,440
<i>Immortal Master Mansion?</i>

408
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,480
<i>Immortal Master Mansion on Lutai Mountain?</i>

409
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,740
I was forced.

410
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,760
It's Fairy Shunde's order. I had to come.

411
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,920
But... But I didn't hurt anyone.

412
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,940
You're just the same. How dare you deny it?

413
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,240
You should know this day would come since you colluded with Immortal Master and Shunde.

414
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,700
Come on. You're ganging up on him.

415
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,040
Oh, it's a fox.

416
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,060
I warn you to get out of here.

417
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,700
How could I get out of here?

418
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
It's a matter of life and death.

419
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,720
He told you he was forced.

420
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,860
Why must you kill him?

421
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,680
When they killed other Spiritual Masters,

422
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,040
they didn't show any mercy, either.

423
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,340
- Miss Luo.
- I didn't kill anyone.

424
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,960
Kong Ming and Qu Xiaoxing are rounding up your fellows nearby.

425
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,958
They'll be right here.

426
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,420
Miss Luo, this fox seems to be with him.

427
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,020
Why don't we catch him as well?

428
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,660
Don't being so judgmental.

429
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,360
I don't know him. I'm not with him.

430
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,760
You were implicated by me.

431
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,440
I'll hold them off and you can run.

432
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,980
Just for that, I know you're not a bad guy.

433
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,998
Don't worry.

434
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,440
Heroes in the script won't run away at this time.

435
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,620
Heroes in the script don't look like you.

436
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,360
Catch them and take them to North Abyss.

437
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,980
<i>North Abyss? Isn't it the place that Master asked me not to go to?</i>

438
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,600
<i>All of them are frightening.</i>

439
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,020
The script says, to cut off the head of the snake.

440
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,640
Let me go. You shit fox.

441
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,080
Do you know who I am?

442
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,128
People of North Abyss won't be easy on you if you dare touch me.

443
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,160
- You.
- So many spiritual stones.

444
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,660
I guess you took them from others.

445
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,400
Are you people of North Abyss so rich?

446
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,860
Give them to me.

447
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,140
I managed to save them with Yunhe.

448
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,520
Shut up.

449
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,580
Immortal, I don't think it's right to do that.

450
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,520
Come on. She took them from others.

451
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,660
Why should I give them up?

452
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,880
I saved you, but you're lecturing me.

453
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,580
Take it.

454
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,080
I'm Ji Ning. Thank you for saving me.

455
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,820
May... May I ask your name?

456
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,460
Call me A'Ji.

457
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,160
Oh, yeah! They seemed to say that the people of Immortal Master Mansion are not good.

458
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,720
I think you're quite good.

459
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,840
You're kind. That's why I saved you.

460
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,600
Don't be with them anymore.

461
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,480
In fact, people of Immortal Master Mansion are not all bad.

462
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,860
Many of my fellows have been forced to follow orders.

463
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,240
Why "huh"?

464
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,000
After all, he tried to rescue me.

465
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But you catch people indiscriminately.

466
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,080
In my opinion, you people of North Abyss are bad.

467
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,920
However, it's hard for me to catch you.

468
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,700
What should I do to you?

469
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,780
Shall I see what else you have?

470
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,160
Brother Ji, well, I don't think it's right for you to touch her.

471
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,560
What are you talking about?

472
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,760
She did something bad. I should give her a lesson.

473
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Look! You're such a beautiful girl.

474
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,540
Why are you always being fierce?

475
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,460
Are you afraid?

476
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,200
Let me see where I should touch.

477
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,920
I'll let you go.

478
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,380
Luo Luo.

479
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,840
Are you okay?

480
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,620
- Kong Ming.
- It's okay.

481
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,380
Luo Luo, did this fox dally with you?

482
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,040
No, he failed.

483
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,840
He failed.

484
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,460
Sir, this man of Immortal Master Mansion seems to be with this fox.

485
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,360
What should we do with them?

486
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,240
He's a junior fellow of Cheng Yu.

487
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,720
Take them into custody to North Abyss.

488
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,980
- Xiaoxing.
- Yes.

489
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,460
- Go back with Luo Luo.
- Go.

490
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,160
Yes.

491
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,159
Why? You're driving me away again?

492
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,040
Absolutely not.

493
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,639
Qing Yao sent me a message that there was a case in North Abyss.

494
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,380
An offender broke into Ice Lake.

495
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,480
Chang Yi sentenced that guy to death without investigating it.

496
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,200
Now more and more people are disagreeing with him.

497
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,040
I'm worried about him.

498
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,460
No matter how confused he is, he can't punish people like that.

499
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,099
Chang Yi wouldn't act so recklessly.

500
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:35,040
He must have another plan.

501
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,620
Luo Luo, I haven't solved the problem of the Spiritual Masters yet.

502
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,479
I really can't go.

503
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,240
Xiaoxing, take care of her for me when you get there.

504
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,339
You want to leave me alone in North Abyss again.

505
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,700
I'm here with you.

506
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,040
You're not Kong Ming.

507
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,679
All right. Be good.

508
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,460
As soon as I heal these Spiritual Masters,

509
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,340
I'll go back to meet you. Okay?

510
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,780
Is there any news of Immortal Master?

511
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,560
Heavenly King went to the Water Room to look into it.

512
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,320
Li Shu and Xue Sanyue are still in the human world.

513
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,100
For now, Immortal Master has made no other moves.

514
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,320
He's quite patient. Never mind.

515
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,300
I've been waiting for 1,000 years. I'm not in a hurry.

516
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,560
Well, how is North Abyss going?

517
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,680
I heard there was trouble there.

518
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,520
Qifeng is a man of no patience.

519
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,780
He'll mess up and show himself if given enough time.

520
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,060
By then, I'll punish him.

521
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,280
Now, you're becoming more like a fisherman.

522
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,800
It's been so long.

523
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,380
Now you can hold your alcohol better.

524
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,400
Every time I drink with you,

525
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,040
you don't say anything else but business.

526
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,820
You're so boring.

527
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,110
I can't sleep until I drink when I'm in a blue mood.

528
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:42,960
Do you drink to compose yourself or to meet an old friend in your dreams?

529
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,950
I drank as much as you did when I was in Ten Directions Formation.

530
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,720
How would I not know your feelings?

531
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,200
You're trying to ask me to let it go.

532
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,440
I never let it go. Why do I bother?

533
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,440
All right. I've asked what I had to ask.

534
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,760
I should go.

535
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,160
Return to Leyou Mountain?

536
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,480
Or what?

537
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,480
I'm out to stretch my legs and get some fresh air.

538
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,100
Of course, I should go back.

539
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,720
That's where I belong.

540
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,440
Only by enjoying the alcohol can you be an Immortal of Alcohol.

541
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,340
Otherwise, it'll make you a dumb drunk.

542
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,280
Chang Yi, if Ji Yunhe were still alive,

543
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,560
do you think she'd want to see you dead on the inside?

544
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,920
<i>It's okay.</i>

545
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,100
<i>As long as I can see her again in my dreams.</i>

546
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
<i>Where is this place?</i>

547
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,360
<i>Why are they fighting?</i>

548
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,900
<i>What's that guy doing?</i>

549
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,860
<i>Yunhe!</i>

550
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,540
Brother A'Ji. Brother A'Ji.

551
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,220
Brother A'Ji.

552
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,960
It hurts. Where is this place?

553
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,640
This is Insanity Cave of Lingshuang Pavilion in North Abyss.

554
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,000
We were brought here.

555
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,160
Where?

556
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,860
North... North Abyss?

557
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,200
<i>Oh, no.</i>

558
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,020
<i>Master will be angry with me.</i>

559
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,240
Damn it! The people of North Abyss catch men indiscriminately.

560
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,040
They're real bastards.

561
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,200
You're right.

562
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,100
No one of North Abyss is good.

563
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,740
You were caught, too?

564
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,920
You're a bit silly.

565
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,280
Do you think I volunteered to come to this shit place?

566
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,820
I'm just asking. Why are you mad at me?

567
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,940
Young man, he's going to be executed by the merman soon.

568
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,680
Just let him be arrogant for a few more days.

569
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,760
Shut up!

570
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,580
What... What are you saying?

571
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,980
This is a jail?

572
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,900
Oh, no. I'm over.

573
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,000
I should have listened to Master.

574
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,380
I'm going to die here.

575
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,100
I can't keep my life.

576
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,420
The merman you just mentioned is in charge of this place, right?

577
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,800
Is he agreeable?

578
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,320
I'm treated like this. What do you think?

579
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,020
Why did they arrest you? What's your crime?

580
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,220
I killed someone out of spite.

581
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,200
Look at you.

582
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,060
Let me tell you. I was framed.

583
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,240
No matter how bad my temper is, I won't kill innocent people.

584
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,880
All right. Enough.

585
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,840
You said you were wronged.

586
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,420
It's more unfair to me.

587
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,440
Isn't it because of Ji Yunhe?

588
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,100
Why must she persuade 3,000 Spiritual Masters to surrender before the battle?

589
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,760
If I knew that merman was so cruel and heartless,

590
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,660
I'd rather be killed by Immortal Master and Shunde.

591
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,840
Brother A'Ji, we're not really going to die here.

592
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,360
No way.

593
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,300
My master will come to meet me.

594
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,480
I have to survive.

595
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,520
It's useless. I've tried many times.

596
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,560
We can't get out of here.

597
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,640
This place is not different from Congji Jail of Immortal Master Mansion.

598
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,040
You're a snake, right?

599
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,230
<i>Yunhe.</i>

600
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:59,020
<i>You haven't even shown up in my dream for such a long time.</i>

601
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,960
<i>Do you hate me like that?</i>

602
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,740
<i>You don't want to see me again?</i>

603
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,820
Oh, no!

604
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,220
What happened?

605
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:18,558
Go check. That snake is digging a hole. He's going to run.

606
00:41:18,558 --> 00:41:19,820
- What? Digging a hole?
- Yeah.

607
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,360
- Go.
- Go check.

608
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,280
Come on.

609
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,540
Really.

610
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,700
Well.

611
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,400
Where is he?

612
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,560
Where's he going?

613
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,500
Where? Where's he going?

614
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,680
He's here. He's coming.

615
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,380
Hurry up.

616
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,100
Where's the snake going?

617
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,620
Can't you see him? He's here.

618
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,700
- Where?
- Come on. Over there.

619
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,760
Is it a hole? He's over there. Come on.

620
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,940
- No.
- On the small hole.

621
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,840
He slipped inside like an earthworm.

622
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,650
No.

623
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,680
Amazing. Young man.

624
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,040
Brother A'Ji, there must be a lot of guards outside.

625
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,600
Are we able to get out of here?

626
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,500
Anyway, we were caught. Just try it. I've always been lectured by my master.

627
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,240
I finally got a chance to lecture others.

628
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,620
Yeah. Try it.

629
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,480
Go. We must hurry. Are you waiting for the merman?

630
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,880
Okay.

631
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,020
Go.

632
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,180
Oh my god.

633
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,160
They're not coming after us?

634
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,880
Look, A'Ji. You're capable.

635
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,460
You have a secret special skill.

636
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,480
You know what?

637
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,760
Now that you're capable of it, why don't you go to Lingshuang Pavilion

638
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,160
to kick that merman's ass. Right?

639
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,120
And then you can take over North Abyss. Wouldn't that be great?

640
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,800
If that happens, I'll keep my promise to stay here

641
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,360
and try my best to help you. Think about it.

642
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,560
Lingshuang Pavilion sounds as cold as ice.

643
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,320
And that merman is horrible. I'm trying to avoid him.

644
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,960
Do you two want to split up or keep fighting?

645
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,740
Well. Look, you're lucky today.

646
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,040
You won't be so lucky the next time I see you.

647
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,220
Buddy A'Ji, I'm going to leave.

648
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,800
Go.

649
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,120
You devil.

650
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,140
All right, Buddy A'Ji. You're a good friend.

651
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,600
We're connected. I hope to see you around.

652
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,200
I'm leaving.

653
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,740
Brother A'Ji, where are you going?

654
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,960
I'll listen to my master and go to the south first.

655
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,680
Leave the North Abyss with me.

656
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,400
Or they will bully you if you stay here.

657
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,040
Maybe the whole Lingshuang Pavilion is coming after us.

658
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,120
We have to get directions first, to avoid those pursuers.

659
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,020
- Well...
- Brother A'Ji, do you really know the way?

660
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,400
It's lighting up.

661
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:38,320
♫ <i>Hey, if I weren't me and you weren't you</i> ♫

662
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:45,220

672
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,190
♫<i> Like fireflies pursuing waves </i>♫

♫ <i>The uncatchable light</i> ♫

674

♫ <i>Never again recalling anything about me</i> ♫

of light years have passed</i> ♫
