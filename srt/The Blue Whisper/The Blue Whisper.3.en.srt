"Mermen in the deep sea, their hearts are like mirrors.

14
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,740
If broken, they are hard to fix."

15
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,420
Yunhe! Yunhe, something is wrong.

16
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,900
Lin Haoqing knows that mermen can't stand the heat.

17
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,680
In order to force him to speak, Reflect Cave is like a furnace now.

18
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,040
How can he do that?

19
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,620
The merman won't give up.

20
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,460
What should we do?

21
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,820
Look.

22
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,160
This ancient book says a fisherman helped a stranded merman back to the sea,

23
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,900
and the merman repaid him for his kindness.

24
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,100
It says mermen are grateful and won't forget the kindness they've received.

25
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,760
Now Lin Haoqing is going to bet on the merman.

26
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,900
He's going to hurt him.

27
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,060
But I'll save him.

28
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,780
Young Master.

29
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,340
Come in.

30
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,880
Young Master.

31
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,340
Guardian Ji and Qu Xiaoxing are going to Reflect Cave.

32
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,420
Remove all guards of Reflect Cave.

33
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,020
Just leave several for show.

34
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,320
Yes, Sir.

35
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,100
Why would you deliberately send the news to Ji Yunhe?

36
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,600
Is it a good chance for her to show her kindness to the merman?

37
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,620
If you were Ji Yunhe, how would you show your kindness?

38
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,660
Of course, to save him and get his trust.

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,930
If she'd like to save the merman, she must break the barrier to help him escape from Reflect Cave.

40
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,340
she must break the barrier to help him escape from Reflect Cave.

41
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,940
What you did today is not forcing the merman, but Ji Yunhe.

42
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,160
Releasing prisoners without permission is a felony in our valley.

43
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,640
If today we can get this evidence, then later no one can compete with you.

44
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,260
<i>Yunhe, you can't fall into this trap.</i>

45
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,940
Big-tailed Fish!

46
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,500
Yunhe.

47
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,100
Let me tell you. It's Lin Haoqing's trap. Let's go.

48
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,960
I know.

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,400
Then, why did you break in?

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
Do you know releasing prisoners is a felony.

51
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,630
If you're caught by Lin Haoqing and he kills you,

52
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,820
no one can say it's his fault. Let's go.

53
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,680
Luo Luo, do you know the difference between me and Lin Haoqing?

54
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
My bottom line is life.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,360
I can't watch him die without trying to save him.

56
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,980
Moreover, the merman knows I risk my life to save him.

57
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Only then will he let his guard down and have the chance to be educated by us.

58
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,080
It's good for both of us.

59
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,540
It's so unlucky to be your attendant.

60
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,300
You carry Xiaoxing, and help me divert Lin Haoqing and his guards away.

61
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,340
I... I'll leave with Big-tailed Fish.

62
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,460
I carry him? It's so unfair.

63
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,840
Let's go.

64
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,540
Ji Yunhe, you'd better come back safely.

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
Follow me.

66
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,940
You don't trust me?

67
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,120
You knocked over my Snow Pills.

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,520
I won't let you run away easily.

69
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,580
Now, leave with me.

70
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,180
Stop!

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,080
Stop! Stop!

72
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,120
Qu Xiaoxing, stop.

73
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,440
Please stop, Guardian.

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,820
Guardian?

75
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,440
Where is she?

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,220
Why is it you?

77
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,740
Why not me?

78
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,560
I and Qu Xiaoxing are friends. Good friends.

79
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm tired, so he carried me. What's wrong with that?

80
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,380
Then why did you cover yourself with her coat?

81
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,360
We were just joking around, is that now allowed?

82
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,640
Right. We had a bet.

83
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,560
I said she was really ordinary, not pretty at all.

84
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,480
If she covers her face, no one would recognize her.

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,140
And she borrowed the Guardian's cloak to give it a try.

86
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,800
And you didn't recognize her.

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,320
What? Just a joke between friends. Is it under your management?

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,920
Oh no! Back to Reflect Cave.

89
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,500
Go!

90
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,600
Great. Well done.

91
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,040
Why did you say I was really ordinary, not pretty at all?

92
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,720
I am in good shape. Can't you see that?

93
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
Where are we now? Do you still care about that?

94
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,400
Forget it. Never mind.

95
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,860
Yunhe should have left with the merman now. I'll go and meet them.

96
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,520
Take it.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,120
Do you feel better?

98
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,260
Don't be scared.

99
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,920
Now that the alarm bell rings in Thousand Flower Valley,

100
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,760
the guards will be much more than usual.

101
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,380
With your current physical strength, it is not suitable to fight them recklessly.

102
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,020
Lin Haoqing will be here soon. You must hide yourself.

103
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,080
Just hide here.

104
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,840
No matter what happens, don't go outside.

105
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,360
You can't think of a reason why I would help you.

106
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,620
Probably because we are in similar situations.

107
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,340
Big-tailed Fish, you should live in the sea,

108
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,680
where you can enjoy freedom and show your beauty.

109
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,770
Though I don't know what Lin Haoqing said to you,

110
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,840
there is one common thought between us.

111
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,820
Both of us want to survive in this hell place.

112
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,880
I don't want you to die here.

113
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,440
Are you starting to worry about me?

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,540
<i>Please Guardian Ji come out.</i>

115
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,320
What will be, will be.

116
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,239
You can stay here. I'll go and deal with them.

117
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:36,420
Don't worry. I've been competing with Lin Haoqing for so many years.

118
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,440
I have my own way to deal with him.

119
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,360
Yun... Yun...

120
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,500
he.

121
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,940
You can call my name.

122
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,220
You're not mute.

123
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,740
Dangerous.

124
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,600
Since you trust me, I'll protect you.

125
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,260
There is nothing I can't solve.

126
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,040
There is a rule on land.

127
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,460
You must pay what you owe.

128
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,440
Before paying for my Snow Pills, you're not allowed to run away secretly.

129
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
Mermen value promises.

130
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,840
I trust you.

131
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,940
What's wrong, Young Master?

132
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,120
Guardian Ji, don't blame me for not reminding you.

133
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,700
Releasing prisoners without permission is a felony.

134
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,580
In order to win this competition, Young Master put a lot of thought into it this time.

135
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,880
At this point, you're still worried about that.

136
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,440
If you give up training the merman now, I will help ask Father's forgiveness for you.

137
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,420
It is a great plan.

138
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,960
But you're wrong.

139
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,500
The merman is not here.

140
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,780
Men, search!

141
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,480
How dare you!

142
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,640
It's my place. How dare you break in without permission.

143
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,740
Then, how about if it's my order?

144
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,800
If you insist, then we have to fight over it.

145
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,560
Yunhe! Yunhe!

146
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,660
It's over. You can't beat so many people.

147
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,400
You, annoying snake, how dare you.

148
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,920
How dare you fight with Guardian Ji.

149
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,560
Jin Yunhe hid the merman without permission, which breaks the rule of the Thousand Flower Valley.

150
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
She should be killed.

151
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,940
What happened?

152
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,680
Master Qing Shu.

153
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,060
What happened?

154
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
Jin Yunhe hid the merman without permission,

155
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,400
I was going to search her room.

156
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,240
Guardian Ji, is it true?

157
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,680
To be honest, I can rest assured now that you are here.

158
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,960
Yes, the merman is in my room.

159
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,740
But I didn't release the merman without permission.

160
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,560
Young Master was so aggressive just now.

161
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,520
I was worried the merman would be in danger.

162
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,760
That's why I did that.

163
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,380
Master Qing Shu, please tell Master that I have made the merman speak successfully.

164
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,680
Is it true?

165
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,840
However, his emotions are not stable now.

166
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,000
Why don't you leave him in my room?

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,600
Otherwise, I am afraid that once the merman resists, it will be another time-consuming and labor-intensive fight.

168
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,480
It's about Fairy's order.

169
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,400
It should be decided by Master and the elders.

170
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,100
Young Master and Guardian Ji, please go to Shrillwind Hall with me.

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,360
- Yunhe.
- Luo Luo, watch over the merman carefully.

172
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,340
Don't let anyone in, and don't let him get out.

173
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,820
Be careful!

174
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,420
Guardian Ji, since that merman was tamed by you and can speak now,

175
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,480
then why don't you bring him to us?

176
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,820
The merman is terribly afraid of Young Master.

177
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,300
If I bring him here rashly, he will be frightened and not speak again,

178
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,000
then our efforts will be in vain.

179
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,280
I've ordered Luo Jinsang to watch over him.

180
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,500
He can't escape.

181
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,840
So Young Master didn't act properly this time.

182
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,140
Haoqing did this recklessly,

183
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,080
I should be punished.

184
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,820
Yunhe, did you do this to ask for an award from me?

185
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,600
I will ask for an award.

186
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,680
Because I've already spent a lot training the merman.

187
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,720
But it's not the most important.

188
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,960
Then, tell me. What is the most important thing?

189
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,600
I have my own ways of spiritual discipline.

190
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,380
Now I've made the merman speak, which proves my method works.

191
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,560
Master, please promise, to not allow others to torture the merman.

192
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Master, only Guardian Ji witnessed the merman speak.

193
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,600
There is no evidence.

194
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,240
If you award her rashly, it's a little unfair.

195
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,620
Elder Donglian is right.

196
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,760
Thousand Flower Valley has strict rules.

197
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,160
I can't break the rules because of you.

198
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,740
Yunhe will prove it in my way.

199
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,720
Tomorrow, everything will be clear.

200
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,860
Okay.

201
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,820
Then, tomorrow, I will be there with others to check if the merman speaks.

202
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,340
If it's true, then your request will be naturally granted.

203
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,840
But if you dare to lie, I will never show you any mercy.

204
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,560
Yunhe obeys.

205
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,320
Young Master, don't worry.

206
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Ji Yunhe has just taken the upper hand for now.

207
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,000
- As long as we...
- Who told you to poison Ji Yunhe?

208
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,040
Ji Yunhe always gets in your way all the time.

209
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,000
Isn't it good that we have a chance to kill her?

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,020
Young Master, don't worry. I'll make sure that she won't succeed tomorrow.

211
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,460
And then, you'll be the next master.

212
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,500
What else did you do?

213
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,260
You are a hook snake. Your blood is poisonous.

214
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,980
You refined the poison with your blood.

215
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,260
Where did you use it?

216
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,420
On the hidden weapons.

217
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,400
With only a small wound, one won't survive tonight.

218
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,560
You don't have the right to decide her life.

219
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,440
I did this for Young Master.

220
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,280
I won't regret it.

221
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,700
Antidote.

222
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,480
Antidote!

223
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,500
Yunhe.

224
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,920
What's the matter? Did you win the first round?

225
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,780
Lin Canglan doesn't believe it.

226
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,180
He said he would be here to check to see if the merman speaks.

227
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,580
He will stay here for one more night?

228
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,200
Yun... Yunhe.

229
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,100
Luo Luo, let me get some sleep.

230
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,280
Talk later.

231
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,360
Yunhe, are you all right?

232
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,580
I've been poisoned.

233
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,760
Siyu, that bitch.

234
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,260
Come on. Let me help you get some rest.

235
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,580
Yunhe! Yunhe.

236
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,280
Yunhe.

237
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,000
Yunhe, please wake up.

238
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,280
Yunhe.

239
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,820
Yunhe, you promised you'd be okay. Yunhe.

240
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,080
Yunhe, wake up. Yunhe.

241
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,800
You promised we would escape here together, Yunhe.

242
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,600
Yunhe, wake up.

243
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,680
Yunhe!

244
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,020
Yunhe, wake up.

245
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,480
Please hang on, Yunhe.

246
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,030
♫ <i>Floating across the galaxy, across the Netherworld,
injury and parting</i> ♫

248
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,270
Big-tailed fish.

What are you doing?

♫ <i>falling into the sky...</i> ♫

260
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,700
The scales of mermen can detoxify hundreds of poisons.

261
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,380
But I remember that a book said mermen scales can't be removed,

262
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,220
or it will... will...

263
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,560
Big-tailed Fish!

264
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,400
Big-tailed Fish, thank you.

265
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,440
But I'm sorry.

266
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,740
Later you'll know I'm not worthy of your kindness.

267
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,380
Yunhe. Yunhe, I found it out.

268
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,780
Though merman scales have miraculous effects, removing one scale is unforgettably painful.

269
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,440
That's why he is like this.

270
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,360
Unforgettably painful.

271
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,160
Now I think this Big-tailed Fish is not bad.

272
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,760
He must have a lot of treasures.

273
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,560
Yunhe, go and check it out.

274
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,180
Stop.

275
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,680
He is awake.

276
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,660
Big-tailed Fish, does it hurt?

277
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,640
Actually, it's just a small favor for me to help you.

278
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't need to do so much for me.

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,200
You saved me.

280
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,820
So I give you medicine.

281
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,780
You didn't speak just because you are not familiar with our language.

282
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,120
That's easy.

283
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,320
I read a book before. If you want him to speak fluently, bite his mouth.

284
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
Let me help you.

285
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,500
What weird book did you read? Don't scare him.

286
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,360
Thank you.

287
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,760
You're welcome.

288
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,060
He's really polite.

289
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,720
Big-tailed Fish, I know you were brought here and want to go back home.

290
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,420
And I do want to leave this hell place.

291
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,660
Why don't we run away together?

292
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,400
Run, together?

293
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,740
I know all of Thousand Flower Valley's ways, defenses, barriers, and formations.

294
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,800
But I haven't recovered yet.

295
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,020
You also consumed a lot of your energy.

296
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,860
There are too many of them. We can't win.

297
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,240
Just get some good rest.

298
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,060
When I prepare well tomorrow, let's find a chance to escape.

299
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,260
Get some good rest, Big-tailed Fish.

300
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,500
Luo Luo, let's go.

301
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,140
Chang...

302
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,520
Yi.

303
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,380
What?

304
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,760
Yunhe, it may be his name.

305
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,580
The book said mermen only tell it to their intimate relatives or their friends.

306
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
Friend?

307
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,800
Friend.

308
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,660
I think I should introduce myself again.

309
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,780
My name is Ji Yunhe.

310
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:57,420
Nice to meet you, Ji Yunhe.

311
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,380
<i>Yunhe, it's dangerous.</i>

312
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,960
Yunhe, you're such a good actress.

313
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,240
You tricked him to use his scale for you.

314
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,860
You're so cold-blooded. I did get hurt.

315
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,900
Okay.

316
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,080
But... what's wrong?

317
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,920
That merman can speak now. Why do you look so gloomy?

318
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,620
I mean, tomorrow, if he realized that he was cheated, would he feel sad?

319
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,660
Maybe.

320
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,340
But if he can obey Fairy Shunde and be a good attendant,

321
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,970
he will live a rich and happy life, he can even have a golden tub.

322
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,280
It's even better than living in the sea. Right?

323
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,060
Now we can't make more mistakes.

324
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,660
Go and watch over the merman.

325
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,200
Got it.

326
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,060
The result is about to be unveiled soon.

327
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,780
I don't think it's good to hang around here, Senior.

328
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,330
You came to give me the medicine?

329
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,670
Today, you were in the limelight today.

330
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,600
If anything bad happened to you, Thousand Flower Valley would blame me.

331
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm taking precautions.

332
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,760
Throw it away if you don't need it.

333
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,580
I'm afraid you misunderstood something.

334
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,060
I just wanted to win the game.

335
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,460
I never meant to blame anyone.

336
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,280
Do you have to win?

337
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,160
I must win.

338
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,140
So behave with propriety or you will hurt yourself.

339
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,720
Yunhe, are you all right? Did he try to bully you?

340
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,420
No. I was just overreacting a bit.

341
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,020
But why did you get out again?

342
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,060
Yunhe, I'm scared.

343
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,220
Of what?

344
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,720
I'm afraid that if I stay inside,

345
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,060
I'll feel so sorry and set him free.

346
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,760
Tomorrow, compensate Yunhe.

347
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,320
<i>Big-tailed Fish, I'm sorry.</i>

348
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,880
You know why you're being punished?

349
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
I don't understand.

350
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,560
It doesn't make sense to me.

351
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,380
How long have you been with me?

352
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,080
Since Master took me as your attendant, it's been a hundred years till now.

353
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,360
Then you should know who I am.

354
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,460
I hate people making decisions without thinking.

355
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,980
If you try to lay a finger on Yunhe again without my permission,

356
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,500
you won't get out of here alive. Understand?

357
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,160
Young Master, what do you actually feel for Ji Yunhe?

358
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,540
The way you treat her... is not your style.

359
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,620
If you say it again, I'll kill you.

360
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,060
I did it only for Young Master.

361
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,940
We can't let her win tomorrow.

362
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,000
She won't win.

363
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,500
Do you have a plan, Young Master?

364
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,060
Don't worry. I've settled down everything.

365
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,020
When you trick that merman into talking, we will take action immediately.

366
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,380
He won't have a chance to escape.

367
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,940
If we win this time, buy us some wine.

368
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,760
Xiaoxing, do me a favor.

369
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,520
When we catch the merman, you need to catch me, too.

370
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,380
I don't want him to know that we're a team.

371
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,520
He's lost his freedom,

372
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,640
and he'll be melancholy if he knows that he was betrayed.

373
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,480
What's wrong?

374
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,940
In the past, you weren't emotional when you were taming creatures.

375
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,200
What is so special about that merman?

376
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,620
There's nothing special.

377
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,020
It's only because he'll be the attendant of Fairy Shunde.

378
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,300
If he were to learn that we played a trick on him, we'll suffer a lot in the future.

379
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,660
You shoul have told me earlier.

380
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,220
Fine. Leader Xue has headed to Western Mountain to hunt fierce beasts but hasn't returned.

381
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,180
I'm currently in charge of the Combat Force and have the final say.

382
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,520
I'll do what you've asked.

383
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,980
Yunhe.

384
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,960
Master.

385
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,260
The merman is in my house now.

386
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,800
Please watch it outside,

387
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,120
I will prove everything to you.

388
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,740
Big-tailed Fish.

389
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,140
Big-tailed Fish.

390
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,960
Stay here and wait.

391
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,960
<i>[Xue Sanyue, Leader of the Combat Force of Thousand Flower Valley]</i>

392
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,240
Yunhe, are you all right?

393
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,500
Xue Sanyue, from the Combat Force.

394
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,740
Honor to meet you, Master.

395
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,200
Well done.

396
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,220
As the best warrior of our Thousand Flower Valley,

397
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,220
you can take down the spirit of a Fei monster by yourself.

398
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,060
The lion monster of Western Mountain has been caught.

399
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,040
Here's the spirit elixir.

400
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,240
Father.

401
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,740
Leader Xue.

402
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,220
Guardian Ji, you invited us to hear the merman speak. Right?

403
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,920
What is it now?

404
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,420
Senior, you just came in time.

405
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,680
Master, the barrier is set around our valley.

406
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,360
How could the devil get in here?

407
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,120
There must be something wrong.

408
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
We once kept a Fei monster here.

409
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,740
It kept doing all kinds of evil at its will.

410
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,400
I took an order from Immortal Master to destroy its elixir.

411
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,760
It seems that its desire to live made him become the evil spirit in our valley.

412
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,460
Unfortunately, it interrupted your plan to tame that merman.

413
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,720
It's all right.

414
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,420
Just a few evil spirits flying around.

415
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,340
Nothing to worry about.

416
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,500
The most important thing today is to hear the merman speak.

417
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,120
Yunhe, does he want to talk to us?

418
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,660
Big-tailed Fish, I'll explain to you later about what just happened today.

419
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,940
Could you just give me a hand?

420
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,300
No, it's all over.

421
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,180
Yunhe, it seems you were too impatient for success.

422
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,100
I'm sorry to let you down, Master.

423
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,160
I was too eager to show off.

424
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,860
You once had a chance to escape after you left Reflect Cave.

425
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,720
But you were determined to follow Ji Yunhe.

426
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,880
How stupid you are.

427
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,300
Now, Ji Yunhe can't take care of herself or even of you.

428
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,340
Behave yourself.

429
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,640
<i>Big-tailed Fish, you should live in the sea</i>

430
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,980
<i>where you can enjoy freedom and show your beauty.</i>

431
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,800
<i>Though I don't know what Lin Haoqing said to you,</i>

432
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,560
<i>there is one common thought between us.</i>

433
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,040
<i>Both of us want to survive in this hell place.</i>

434
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,500
<i>So I don't want you to die here.</i>

435
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,860
Guardian Ji made a nonsense statement before,

436
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,180
but now, she achieved nothing in the end.

437
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,760
To tame a merman, she ignored the rules of our valley,

438
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,020
hid the merman for her own purpose.

439
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,320
Father, please ask her to quit our mission of taming the merman.

440
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,620
I'll keep taming the merman even if I quit being a guardian.

441
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,280
Ji Yunhe, how dare...

442
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,360
It's Fairy Shunde's order to allow Young Master and me to tame the merman.

443
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,460
I'll quit when Fairy Shunde says so.

444
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,120
Are you going to take Fairy's position and violate her order?

445
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,960
Yunhe, stop it.

446
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,400
Ji Yunhe, are you threatening our master?

447
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,820
No, I'm just thinking if Young Master tried to win without honor,

448
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,460
how would people trust and respect him?

449
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,040
Father, I'll win the game of taming the merman by my capability.

450
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,620
We should obey the rules.

451
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,060
Yunhe, I know you can see through everything.

452
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,180
I'm a reasonable man.

453
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,880
You can continue to work with Haoqing to participate in this merman-taming thing.

454
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,220
Father.

455
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,220
But remember, what I want to see is the result in the end.

456
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,719
I'll seclude myself for some time.

457
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,320
In terms of taming the merman,

458
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,740
we should set some regulations.

459
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,180
Sanyue, do you have any suggestions?

460
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,960
Master, it's fair that they should be allowed to take turns taming the merman for three days separately.

461
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,400
When the time is up, they can't stay involved of it any longer.

462
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,060
What if someone cheats?

463
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,440
They'll be surely punished.

464
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,139
Fine.

465
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,580
Well, I think Sanyue should take the job to watch over them.

466
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,940
When I return, I hope to hear some good news.

467
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,420
Yes, Master.

468
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,980
Yes, Master.

469
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,920
Why?

470
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,020
What do you mean "Why?"

471
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,480
That merman has lost faith in you, so you can't win.

472
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,020
Why didn't you give up?

473
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,240
He doesn't trust me.

474
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,060
But he won't give in to you.

475
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,400
Today's game ended in a tie, so why do I need to give up?

476
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
Just stay where you are as a guardian.

477
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,760
Why do you want to compete against me?

478
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,600
Can't you just give up that merman?

479
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm not competing against you.

480
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,860
What I've been thinking is that, if I give up,

481
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,180
that idiot merman will be tortured by you guys.

482
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,020
I can't stand it.

483
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,380
So I have to be your rival for now.

484
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,520
Master, why did you permit Yunhe to tame the merman

485
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,800
as she wanted today?

486
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,900
Only if Haoqing wins this time by his capability over Ji Yunhe,

487
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,660
then our people will truly have faith in him.

488
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,000
But... now is the most important moment to tame the merman.

489
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,380
If you don't go out to help him, what if he can't defeat Yunhe?

490
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,900
So...

491
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,120
It's nothing.

492
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,320
As long as Haoqing is resolute to do it,

493
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,700
no matter whether he wins or not in the end,

494
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,420
it'll be the honor and compliment of our valley.

495
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,760
Yunhe, how is Chang Yi?

496
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,660
Spiritual Masters tortured him again.

497
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,960
Lin Haoqing exposed everything we did to Chang Yi.

498
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,480
Do you think he still believes in you?

499
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,740
What if he fights against you once you get inside?

500
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,160
If he hadn't believed me at all,

501
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,540
he wouldn't have done what I told him and got caught.

502
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,700
Now I'm going to see how much he believes in me.

503
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,280
Leave us a moment. I'll guard him.

504
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,760
Guardian, I'm afraid we can't.

505
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,880
What's wrong with it?

506
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
I asked you to leave, so I'm responsible for it.

507
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,440
This merman is related to the fate of our valley,

508
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,980
I don't think you can take responsibility.

509
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,800
It's my turn to take care of him for three days.

510
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,380
I'll do it in my way.

511
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,100
You don't have the right to interfere.

512
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,140
I know you had a reason to release him before,

513
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,240
but you did break our rule.

514
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,700
You're grounded for three days as punishment. Get out.

515
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,500
What if I insist on staying here?

516
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,240
This is the order of His Master.

517
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,480
You'll be severely punished.

518
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,860
Yunhe, we can't defeat her if there's a fight. Listen to her.

519
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,580
Leader Xue, we know your power to fight is above ours except Master.

520
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,480
You serve according to the rules,

521
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,700
but now Yunhe has been punished.

522
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,700
I can take the turn to take care of this merman.

523
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,540
It must be tiring supervising us, Leader Xue.

524
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,540
Young Master wants to send it to you to express his gratitude.

525
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,320
The reason Ji Yunhe failed to get the merman to speak

526
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,280
was because the spirit of the Fei monster broke out at her place.

527
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,880
It was Young Master who planned it, right?

528
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,520
You also broke the rules for keeping a monster secretly.

529
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,000
Like Ji Yunhe, you'll be grounded for three days.

530
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,540
In case anyone decides to cheat me, Reflect Cave will be forbidden for others to get in.

531
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,820
Young Master and Guardian. Please.

532
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,080
I've taken your order, so I will leave now.

533
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,640
Leader Xue, I think I should leave, too,

534
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,080
Master Sanyue.

535
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,700
I told you that you don't have to come here.

536
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm here to be your companion.

537
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,840
Luo Luo.

538
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,480
Do you know anything about him, Li Shu?

539
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,880
The attendant of Xue?

540
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,880
I know he a member of the lynx tribe. The side branch of the mythical beast Lu Wu.

541
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,300
They're not nice like me. Not good-looking like me.

542
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,680
Their power is weak. They're far off from my power.

543
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,120
What's wrong with it?

544
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,540
Nothing. Let's go.

545
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,220
Yunhe, why did you bring me here?

546
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,140
Not only Lin Haoqing, now Xue Sanyue has also hindered our plan.

547
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,640
I need to find a way to take her down.

548
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,560
Or Chang Yi won't believe in me again.

549
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
I know you're stressed out.

550
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,000
But why do you hide outside her house and watch her?

551
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,140
If you come for a fight, how could you defeat her?

552
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Do I have to destroy a person by fighting?

553
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,680
Everyone has their own weakness.

554
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,600
Xue Sanyue is not an exception.

555
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,080
How would you know that?

556
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,680
Xue Sanyue was born with the gift,

557
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,760
and Lin Canglan invited her to join our valley.

558
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,160
She'd say nothing if it can be solved by fighting.

559
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,400
And she's a stickler to our rules, never breaking them.

560
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,280
So she has no weakness at all.

561
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,660
Yunhe, I'd say don't screw with her.

562
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,800
I know you want to win this game because you want to get out of here.

563
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,220
We've tried to evoke his sympathy, but it's exposed.

564
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,480
Why don't we try another way?

565
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,520
What if I didn't only want his sympathy?

566
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,840
What do you mean?

567
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,360
If someone owes you, will you forgive that guy?

568
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,660
I'll burn him down.

569
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,220
So actually I still owe him an apology.

570
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,180
I know I have to tame him,

571
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,240
but I don't want to owe him anything.

572
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,700
But...

573
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,420
Why is Li Shu sneaking around?

574
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,280
He must have his secret, so he looks suspicious.

575
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,180
What do you want to say?

576
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,560
If everything happens as I expect,

577
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,320
we'll find something no one knows about Xue Sanyue.

578
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,940
What do you mean?

579
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,000
How could a barrier be set here?

580
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,520
We'll know if we get inside.

581
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,940
