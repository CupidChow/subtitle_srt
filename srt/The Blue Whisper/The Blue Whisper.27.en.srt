21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
Master!

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,600
From now on, as long as they don't attempt to take Ji Yunhe away,

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,580
if they want to enter the Cloud Quarters,

24
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,491
just let them in.

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, Master.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm a little confused.

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,920
Isn't Ji Yunhe your prisoner?

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,120
But now you live with her, find doctors for her,

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,020
and allow her friends to talk to her.

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,800
What... What are you really going to do?

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,400
Ma-Master?

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,800
Sir.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,640
What... What's the matter with Master lately?

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,320
Does he want Ji Yunhe to be good or bad?

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,120
Anyway, as long as Ji Yunhe can't leave Cloud Quarters,

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,520
you don't have to care about anything else.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,040
I don't think your master can figure it out, let alone you.

38
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,740
But...

39
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,960
This so-called Blue Feather Phoenix is more useless than Kong Ming.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Little Butterfly, don't talk nonsense if you don't understand.

41
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,100
Master Qing, you do know how to extend Yunhe's life, don't you?

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,000
When we were at Cloud Quarters,

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,820
you said that a few more days would only add to her misery.

44
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,420
Then you definitely know how to keep her alive a few more days.

45
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,500
It's just because Chang Yi had a bad temper and you didn't want to tell him. Right?

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,120
What makes you think I'd be happy to tell you?

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,440
I would give up anything if you could instruct us.

48
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,000
You're just like Chang Yi,

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,600
so obsessed with hopeless things.

50
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,960
Everything in the world happens for a reason.

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,540
Being pushy is useless.

52
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,820
The harder you try, the more disappointed you will be in the end.

53
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,100
I've been through this before.

54
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,520
No one knows it until the end.

55
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,340
Please show us the way.

56
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,560
Even if we should end up in despair, we will accept it.

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,719
It's said that there is a precious mushroom named Nectar Ganoderma on Daiyu Mountain,

58
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:19,280
which can extend one's life.

59
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,420
Maybe it'll help her live a few more days.

60
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,800
Even one more day would be good.

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,140
All right, I'm off.

62
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,560
Thank you very much.

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,580
Sanyue, I'll go with you.

64
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,460
Hold on. You're not going.

65
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,720
Chang Yi is ungrateful.

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,360
If he goes crazy and tortures Yunhe, you can stop him.

67
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,280
That fish is different now.

68
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,300
I don't know if I can stop him.

69
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,980
Luo Luo does make a point.

70
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,200
I've been to Daiyu Mountain and I'm familiar with it. I can go alone.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
But I... I want to go...

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,880
I'll go and return quickly.

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,160
Can you stay and guard our home?

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,860
Our home?

75
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,200
Okay, well.

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Come back soon!

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,880
Be safe!

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,320
<i>I hope it turns out differently for you this time.</i>

79
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,560
Ru Ling, I brought you a salve made from Herb Duanxu.

80
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,040
I've heard that if you put Herb Duanxu on your skin,

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,600
it'll hurt like hell.

82
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,920
As long as it can cure your face.

83
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,440
From now on, I'll never mess up when you treat my facial trauma.

84
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,060
For the sake of all the pain that I have endured to fulfill your wishes,

85
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,060
can you give me a reward?

86
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,700
Tell me about it. What do you want?

87
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,140
I want the spells as powerful as yours.

88
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,040
You can get anything you want as long as it makes you happy.

89
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,440
Can all the Spiritual Masters in the world be at my disposal?

90
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,580
Of course.

91
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,460
Thank you, Master.

92
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,160
Yunhe!

93
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,460
Yun...

94
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,400
Yunhe, how are you?

95
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,560
How are you doing here? Are you lonely?

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,080
Did you miss me?

97
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,360
Is the barrier in Cloud Quarters still there?

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,160
Yes, it is.

99
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
But for some reason, Luo Suo didn't stop me.

100
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,840
I'm free to come and go.

101
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,820
It's weird, isn't it?

102
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,020
Silly fish.

103
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,280
What do you mean?

104
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,640
Is it Chang Yi's order?

105
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,660
Is it because you've cleared the air with him,

106
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,600
so he let me in?

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,840
No.

108
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,200
Why?

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,520
He doesn't listen to our advice.

110
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
Why don't you tell him the truth?

111
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,660
Why do you make him hate you all the time?

112
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,640
He hates me but is still very nice to me.

113
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,500
Wouldn't he be nicer to me if he knew the truth?

114
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,380
I can't do that.

115
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,400
There are so many people in North Abyss who need his care.

116
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,000
He's busy enough.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,900
Now, he's the Master of North Abyss.

118
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,880
He's not my Big-tailed Fish anymore.

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,280
Ji Yunhe, sit still and listen to me.

120
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,760
Don't be paranoid anymore.

121
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,740
We're all trying to help you in any way we can.

122
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,200
Even if Chang Yi becomes Master and leaves you alone,

123
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,040
I'll try my best to take care of you.

124
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,220
If you keep thinking like that, I... I'll hit you!

125
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,000
Luo Luo, it's so nice to see you every day

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,160
and talk to you like this.

127
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
All right.

128
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Here you are, Master Qing. Fish soup.

129
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,560
What's the point of you staying here

130
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
if you can't even make fish soup?

131
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,660
Just go with her if you miss her.

132
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,880
But Sanyue told me to stay and guard our home.

133
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,540
Don't be so sentimental.

134
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,960
How can you help people with their relationship problems like that?

135
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,120
Master Qing, don't blame me.

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,760
Blunt are those concerned.

137
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,960
All right. Off you go!

138
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,660
I'm here.

139
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,720
Even the Master of North Abyss has to show me some respect.

140
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,560
Whatever happens, I'll just fight against him.

141
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,920
Thank you, Master Qing.

142
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,480
I-I... I'll take good care of you later.

143
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,080
What are you going to do?

144
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,400
Little Butterfly, take care of Master Qing.

145
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,640
Master, where is he going in such a hurry?

146
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,920
One day goes like many years without her.

147
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
He's going for Xue Sanyue.

148
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,400
Why didn't you stop him?

149
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,760
He was supposed to stay and keep an eye on Chang Yi!

150
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,880
I let him go.

151
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,160
Then you're also unreliable.

152
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,760
You silly girl.

153
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,000
You need to respect your elders, okay?

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,240
Fine.

155
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,020
If you piss me off, I'll let you stay here alone.

156
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,960
Anyway, I don't want to get involved in your troubles.

157
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,720
Master Qing, I didn't mean it that way.

158
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
I mean...

159
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,620
You see, the North Abyss is a beautiful place.

160
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,200
You should stay here and keep an eye on Yunhe for me.

161
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
At your convenience.

162
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,680
She's already taken care of.

163
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,640
Isn't Kong Ming treating her?

164
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,400
You might as well bother him instead of me.

165
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,680
Let him take care of her.

166
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,700
What are you doing here again?

167
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,600
I thought you said you were sick of me.

168
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,840
I was way out of line earlier.

169
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,720
I understand you're annoyed with me.

170
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
The sweet soup... You didn't drink it, did you?

171
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,980
See, I made you another bowl of it to ask your forgiveness.

172
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,140
I don't mean to be conceited, but it's really delicious.

173
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,460
Yunhe used to drink at least three bowls.

174
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,760
You don't really need to please me because of Ji Yunhe.

175
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,000
I promised Chang Yi that I would do it.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
I believe you'll do it.

177
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,040
But I want you to do better.

178
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,160
Besides, you are so busy.

179
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,060
You need to take care of Yunhe and deal with the affairs of North Abyss.

180
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,740
Maybe I can help you.

181
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,880
That's not necessary.

182
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,200
No, you need help.

183
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,920
I know I'm not good at anything,

184
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,840
but I can help you boil medicine.

185
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,140
You can use all the time and energy saved to take care of Yunhe, okay?

186
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,640
Luo Jinsang, the process of boiling medicine is onerous.

187
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,280
You need to keep your eyes fixed on it without even blinking.

188
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,780
Are you sure you can do this?

189
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,840
Of course, I can.

190
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,720
You really didn't blink?

191
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,240
That's enough.

192
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,360
Get some rest.

193
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,120
It's Yunhe's medicine. How could I not take it seriously?

194
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,880
It needs four hours, so even one second less doesn't work.

195
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,820
You're just an attendant.

196
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,320
Why do you care so much about your master?

197
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,460
Yunhe once said that all beings are equal without distinction.

198
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,360
Besides, she and I are not master and servant.

199
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,000
We are best friends and best sisters.

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,080
Isn't this what you're supposed to do for your best friend?

201
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,600
Don't you have a best friend

202
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,880
or best brother?

203
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,180
Except for that Mr. Cold Shoulder, Chang Yi,

204
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,300
he doesn't count.

205
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,580
I had a best friend once, too.

206
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,180
But he died?

207
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,600
You have me.

208
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,060
I have a big heart.

209
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,140
I wouldn't mind caring for one more friend.

210
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,240
From today, I'm your friend.

211
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,820
Do you feel happy?

212
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,480
Yes. I'm happy.

213
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,220
Boil your medicine.

214
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,960
Why did he go away again?

215
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,500
So am I successful at coaxing or not?

216
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,320
Whatever.

217
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,460
Master, I got news.

218
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,360
The disciples we sent to North Abyss were suddenly covered with frost.

219
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,260
I think it's because of the Frost mark.

220
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,300
How are they right now?

221
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,540
Don't worry, Master. They're fine.

222
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,800
It's said that Kong Ming of North Abyss gave them the medicine that eased the Frost.

223
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
They're so lucky.

224
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,860
We don't have the medicine right now, but there's some hope.

225
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,900
Why are you still worried?

226
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,880
Immortal Master Mansion gave an order.

227
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,460
They're delaying delivery of the antidote by two days.

228
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,120
Is it because Immortal Master found out about your plan?

229
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,640
He's warning me not to have improper thoughts.

230
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,440
So do you have a countermeasure?

231
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,420
At this point, the only way to survive is to take risks.

232
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,520
Fairy Shunde.

233
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,840
This tiny fruit tastes just like any other fruit,

234
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,180
but it's fun to step on it.

235
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,600
Master Lin, maybe you should try it.

236
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,480
You're in such a good mood. Maybe you've finally realized something.

237
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,660
More preparation may quicken the speed in doing work.

238
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,120
Congratulations.

239
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,900
I should thank you, Master Lin.

240
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,700
"All tenderness is false and illusory.

241
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,760
Only when you become stronger do you not have to rely on the handouts of others."

242
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,380
I don't mind pretending to be someone else right now.

243
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,620
One day I'll get everything I want,

244
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,740
and no one can stop it,

245
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,020
let alone take it.

246
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,420
Enduring is bad for your health.

247
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,560
How about taking it out on the person you hate.

248
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,540
That merman hurt you; even grinding his bones to dust isn't enough to offset his sins.

249
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,380
How could he be allowed to be so free?

250
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,279
You told me the secret of Quiet Chamber before,

251
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,179
and today you came to visit me again,

252
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:14,060
recalling the sins of the merman.

253
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,279
Is this because you're faithful,

254
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,060
or you have an ulterior motive?

255
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,480
I do have an ulterior motive.

256
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,200
Please allow me, on your behalf, to march on the North Abyss to punish sinners,

257
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,920
to quell your rage, and to wash away the disgrace of Thousand Flower Valley.

258
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,840
That's all?

259
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,380
Yes.

260
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,460
Of course you can.

261
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,480
Thank you, Fairy Shunde.

262
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,720
But... there is a condition.

263
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,960
This time, when you go to attack the North Abyss, I want you to kill Ji Yunhe.

264
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,200
I know your relationship with Ji Yunhe.

265
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,560
But if you want to join me, you have to show your sincerity.

266
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,780
I want to trample Ji Yunhe's eyes

267
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,740
underfoot like these grapes.

268
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,520
If you can't do it,

269
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,440
I'll let the whole Thousand Flower Valley bear your sins.

270
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,560
Master Lin, what do you say?

271
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,700
Fairy Shunde, you'll get you want.

272
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,000
Master, are you really going to attack North Abyss?

273
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
It's Fairy Shunde's order, not a joke.

274
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,940
The merman rebels against us in the North Abyss.

275
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,440
If we can't defeat them, there will be no peace in the world.

276
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,840
Since Thousand Flower Valley has the responsibility to punish sinful immortals,

277
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,500
we should share Shunde's worries.

278
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
Master, with all due respect,

279
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,100
the cause of the so-called "rebellion" in North Abyss is well known to us all.

280
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,240
Heavenly King has not yet denounced them.

281
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,220
He must sympathize with them and wants to let them go.

282
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,540
Fairy Shunde holds a personal grudge against them.

283
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,960
She's actually using public power for personal purposes.

284
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
Please be discreet, Elder.

285
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,580
All the Spiritual Masters are under the command of Immortal Master Mansion.

286
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,280
Fairy Shunde is supported by Immortal Master.

287
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,540
All her orders are military orders.

288
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,400
Master, of course military orders are important.

289
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,360
However, in the past two days, several Spiritual Masters in our valley have

290
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,380
suffered from unknown emergencies and died one after another.

291
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,000
Now, the Thousand Flower Valley is in a panic.

292
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,140
At this time, if we act rashly, it'll definitely cause death and injury.

293
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,740
Master, please solve this internal problem first, then...

294
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm not negotiating with you.

295
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
Every order of Master must be executed without fail.

296
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,180
You are not allowed to bargain.

297
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,260
Or do you want to disobey his orders?

298
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,340
We dare not.

299
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,520
As Master commands.

300
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,240
Military orders?

301
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,320
He served Fairy Shunde for so long in Lutai Mountain.

302
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,240
As soon as he came back, he is rushing out to solve her problem.

303
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,560
The old master had some moral integrity.

304
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,160
But now, this master just wants to take shortcuts.

305
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,980
Donglian, you used to say he was ambitious.

306
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,220
His ambition, I think, is not to make the world better,

307
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,220
but to ascend by the power of Fairy Shunde.

308
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,940
Fine, you're right.

309
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,620
I was wrong about this person, okay?

310
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,980
What do you want?

311
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,340
You're not going to fight me over this, are you?

312
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,460
No, I'm not.

313
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,080
I've always felt cold these two days.

314
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,900
My symptoms are the same as those of Elder Liuying who died of that emergency.

315
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,680
Seriously?

316
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,580
You... You also...

317
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,120
I heard rumors in the valley that the elders and disciples were not ill at all.

318
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,380
It's said that they died of something called...

319
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,940
Frost!

320
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,400
Where did you get this information?

321
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,820
They said it came from the North Abyss.

322
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,060
I'm afraid it's not entirely misplaced.

323
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,200
We'd better ask Master.

324
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,480
Forget it.

325
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,760
He's too busy fawning on Fairy Shunde

326
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,660
to care about the lives of others in the valley.

327
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,700
Frost?

328
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,900
What is Frost?

329
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,260
There's no such thing, is there?

330
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,220
But you...

331
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,260
<i>[Qu Xiaoxing, Commander of Combat Force in Thousand Flower Valley]</i>

332
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,460
Master, the antidotes have been sent here,

333
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,740
but there have been rumors about the Frost mark in the valley.

334
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,320
Lots of elders and disciples are suffering from it in our valley.

335
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,320
We can't hide it. It's time to let them know about it.

336
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,920
Let them go.

337
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,720
Master.

338
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,640
You're the commander of the Combat Force, but you can't be so unruly.

339
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,300
I'm anxious for Master.

340
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,440
Master, there are rumors in the valley

341
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,880
that you're a snob and you fawn on Shunde.

342
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Even worse, they...

343
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,140
they said you are like Shunde's dog.

344
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,060
So what?

345
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,600
I just don't understand why.

346
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,480
Master, now we can't keep Frost mark a secret.

347
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,700
Why do you suddenly attack North Abyss at this moment?

348
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,460
Qu Xiaoxing, just obey my orders. Don't ask any more questions.

349
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,560
Don't forget that you're a Spiritual Master of our valley. Just do your job.

350
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,300
Well. You're still trying to unseal the Frost mark

351
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,100
and get Yunhe back, right?

352
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,680
That's good. As long as you can save Yunhe.

353
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,860
Master, why don't you tell Qu Xiaoxing about your plan?

354
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,380
He is loyal but impetuous.

355
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,600
It's a matter of life and death. The fewer people who know it, the safer we'll be.

356
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,160
If we reveal any weak point, it'll make Shunde suspect us.

357
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,160
I'm sure all the people of Thousand Flower Valley will know how hard you've worked for them.

358
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,780
But, Master, what about Ji Yunhe?

359
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,180
When you get to North Abyss, can you really kill her?

360
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,480
<i>Delaying the delivery of antidotes. Letting the rumor of the Frost mark spread.</i>

361
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,580
<i>Forcing Lin Haoqing to take action. You're doing a good job.</i>

362
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,240
<i>Without the spiritual power of sinners, I've got the aura of killing.</i>

363
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,420
<i>Very good.</i>

364
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,080
<i>But it doesn't feel very strong. You need to push harder.</i>

365
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,360
<i>I've found you're paying less and less attention to me.</i>

366
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,400
<i>You spend all your time treating her facial trauma. Too boring.</i>

367
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,360
You were not satisfied when you didn't have anything to absorb.

368
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,540
Now you've got the aura of killing, but you're still not satisfied.

369
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,660
Your greed is like a bottomless pit. Of course, I can't satisfy you.

370
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,460
No wonder it's so hard to reinvent your body.

371
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,200
<i>And because of it, once I manage to reinvent my body,</i>

372
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,340
<i>the power that comes with it will be unparalleled.</i>

373
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,740
<i>You'll see!</i>

374
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,380
<i>Is there really going to be a war?</i>

375
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,900
<i>Is there really going to be a war?</i>

376
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,420
<i>Should we fight against them?</i>

377
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,820
I told you Spiritual Masters were bad.

378
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,940
And we were kind to the Spiritual Masters of Thousand Flower Valley.

379
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,500
But now, everyone of that valley is out, and they'll be at our door soon.

380
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,020
North Abyss is short of soldiers. What are you going to do?

381
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,800
<i>You can't do that.</i>

382
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,380
So what?

383
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,340
It's cold in North Abyss and the roads are covered with ice. That's a favorable climate.

384
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,460
We know the terrain. That's a topographical advantage.

385
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,780
Spiritual Masters are proud and impetuous;

386
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,180
but we have many good fighters with the strong support of our men.

387
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,440
Our North Abyss holds all the aces.

388
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,380
Why should we be afraid?

389
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,020
<i>Yeah, he's right.</i>

390
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,260
<i>Master's right. It makes sense.</i>

391
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,220
I, Chang Yi, am willing to lead the army,

392
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,680
to guard the North Abyss with all of you.

393
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,860
Qing Yao's willing to guard North Abyss with Master.

394
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,480
<i>We're willing to guard North Abyss with Master.</i>

395
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,660
Let's discuss important military affairs in the hall later.

396
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,180
Do not let Ji Yunhe know about the Thousand Flower Valley's attack.

397
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,700
Master, you're so wise. After all, Ji Yunhe comes from Thousand Flower Valley.

398
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,620
If she finds out about this, maybe she'll be a spy of Thousand Flower Valley.

399
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,840
We do have to watch our backs.

400
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,540
Do you think that's what he's worried about?

401
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,700
Let's go. Let's go to the back hill to find herbs for her?

402
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,940
Don't let her know about this either.

403
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,780
After everything you've done for her, one less thing doesn't matter.

404
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,920
Ji Yunhe is involved in it, so she's not rational and has been deceived by you.

405
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,180
Sir, you're not much better.

406
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:22,320
I... I'm not like you, such a love-struck guy!

407
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,100
So why are you blushing and sighing these days

408
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,160
because of Luo Jinsang?

409
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,380
I... I'm not blushing because I'm shy.

410
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,940
It's because I'm mad at Luo Jinsang.

411
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm annoyed.

412
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,760
Sir, I've heard about Miss Luo, too.

413
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,740
If you're really upset with her, I can help you.

414
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,480
You're cute when you keep silent.

415
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,180
Master.

416
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,180
You've just finished a meeting and must be tired.

417
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,060
How about going for a walk with me?

418
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,960
No thanks. I'll go to the back hill to search for herbs.

419
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,940
You can go and get some rest.

420
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,720
Young Lord, Master wouldn't be looking for herbs for that sick Ji Yunhe, would he?

421
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,960
Young Lord, I beg your pardon. Wei Yan shouldn't talk about that unlucky woman.

422
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,560
Wei Yan is here to inform you that all the battle armor is ready,

423
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,660
including the one you specifically ordered.

424
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,780
What?

425
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,620
Lin Haoqing's going to attack North Abyss with all the strength of Thousand Flower Valley?

426
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,600
Chang Yi told us not to tell you. I found out about it by accident.

427
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,580
That's weird.

428
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,370
Given Lin Haoqing's personality,

429
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,220
he should have watched the fight between Immortal Master, Shunde, and North Abyss

430
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,860
reaping advantages when all the sides are exhausted.

431
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,660
It's very suspicious.

432
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:07,380
Whatever, we have nothing to be afraid of with Qing Ji here.

433
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,680
Just because of the drinking competition and the sweet fermented-rice wine,

434
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,660
you want me to fight for you, treat her illness, and have a chat with you?

435
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,200
You really think I'm that idle?

436
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
You do have lots of leisure.

437
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
By the way, I once risked my life to get you a drink.

438
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,840
You have to remember that.

439
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,120
It gives me a shiver just to think of Jiuhan Cave.

440
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,600
Fortunately, I did a spiritual practice with Kong Ming and saved my life.

441
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,080
And I looked more beautiful.

442
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,660
You and Kong Ming... do what?

443
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,240
Spiritual practice!

444
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,860
You know, that light was so big and beautiful.

445
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,660
He struggled for a long time. I put him down in one fell swoop.

446
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,460
I'm your attendant.

447
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,420
Wouldn't it be a shame if I couldn't handle such a little thing.

448
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,060
So it's your master who taught you by precept and example.

449
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,040
Sorry I didn't know that before.

450
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,620
If little Li Shu knew half as much as you did,

451
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,560
he wouldn't have suffered so much before.

452
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,220
Luo Luo, you just said "put him down."

453
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,220
Does it mean what I think?

454
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,600
What do you think it means?

455
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Senior, let's enjoy the tea. Please.

456
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,320
<i>Smell it.</i>

457
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,580
<i>Sir, how is it? Does it smell good?</i>

458
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,640
<i>You know, girls love things that make them look good.</i>

459
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,940
<i>This coral powder is a treasure I've collected.</i>

460
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,940
<i>You can use it to get rid of that Luo Jinsang if she bothers you again.</i>

461
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,440
Mr. Kong Ming.

462
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,660
Mr. Kong Ming.

463
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,820
Mr. Kong Ming, you must be tired. I made you some sweet soup.

464
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,500
I brought it over for you to taste.

465
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,100
I added a few more spices this time.

466
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,080
It's more delicious. Try it.

467
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,700
No... thanks.

468
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,040
I knew it wouldn't work. I was just wasting my time.

469
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,600
I drank that bowl of sweet soup last time.

470
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,620
It's sweet.

471
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,340
Thank you.

472
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,860
Really? Did you like it?

473
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,640
If you like it, I'll make it for you every day.

474
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,100
In that case, can we get back to spiritual practice?

475
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,980
Don't worry, I'll take responsibility.

476
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,900
It's different.

477
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,640
You should probably go back.

478
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,180
I need to prepare Yunhe's medicine now.

479
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,460
No. If you like the sweet soup, I'll make it for you every day.

480
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,760
Why don't you help me become more beautiful through spiritual practice?

481
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,980
Are all the men in the world as unpredictable as you?

482
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,200
Do you just want to be more beautiful by spiritual practice?

483
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,100
It's for you. Don't bother me again.

484
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,520
It's a gift?

485
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,440
I can't believe you are giving me a gift.

486
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,880
No one has ever given me a gift except Yunhe.

487
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,840
It smells so good. Smell it.

488
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,520
In romance novels, this is how you respond to a gift.

489
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,460
Am I right?

490
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,100
Mr. Kong Ming.

491
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,300
You're smiling!

492
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
<i>Why?</i>

493
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,300
<i>Why is she so haggard?</i>

494
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,720
What are you doing here?

495
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,680
Have you been here watching over me?

496
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,760
No.

497
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,360
I don't buy that.

498
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,800
Are you afraid that one day I will close my eyes and not open them again?

499
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,920
Take it.

500
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,940
Where did you get that?

501
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,600
Why does it smell so bitter?

502
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,239
Just drink it.

503
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,200
Okay.

504
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,240
For the sake of its effect,

505
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,160
I'll take it.

506
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,580
Chang Yi, Lin Haoqing is going to attack North Abyss.

507
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,980
How are you going to deal with it?

508
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,619
He can't defeat North Abyss and can't take you away.

509
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:31,560
You don't have to worry about it.

510
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,760
And don't think about playing tricks.

511
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:59,780
Well, if you say so.

512
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,300
I'm too weak to fight anyway.

513
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,380
But you didn't say I wasn't allowed to help.

514
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,420
Your Majesty, it's no use searching blindly every day.

515
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,580
In my opinion, why don't you come with me to fight beasts and monsters?

516
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,600
It can also improve your power.

517
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,840
That will be more effective.

518
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,080
For the nature of the Tao, it's shapeless and formless.

519
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,000
From ancient times, no one can prove it by strength alone.

520
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,040
What did you say?

521
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,000
You won't understand.

522
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,700
I'm not going to fight against monsters, okay?

523
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,206
You're talking about those words all the time, as if you can solve this mystery.

524
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,280
Oh that reminds me, Your Majesty.

525
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,360
On Daiyu Mountain, there is a miraculous plant growing from the spirits of Heaven and Earth.

526
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,780
I'll take you to find it.

527
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,980
Perhaps, with its nourishment,

528
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,820
you can suddenly understand

529
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,640
the meaning of this picture in an instant.

530
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,280
Is there such a magical plant?

531
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,700
Come with me and you'll see. Let's go.

532
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,860
Okay.

533
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,480
Your Majesty, there it is. I'll get it for you.

534
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,820
Hold on.

535
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,500
Don't pick it.

536
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,580
Pals, forgive me.

537
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,180
But I need this ganoderma urgently.

538
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,800
No, don't pick it.

539
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,820
I want to pick it to save someone.

540
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,260
I hope you can give it up.

541
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,080
I'm not stopping you because I want this ganoderma.

542
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,020
The reason is it's not the time to pick it.

543
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,160
Why?

544
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,540
The Nectar Ganoderma is a miraculous plant with its own kind of spirituality.

545
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,200
When it is immature, if it feels any threat,

546
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,740
it'll attack you back with much more energy.

547
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,480
If you want to pick it safely, you must wait until it's ripe.

548
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,080
I've never heard of it before.

549
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,000
If you don't believe me, I'll show you.

550
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,960
I need you to step back.

551
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,620
What I know is superficial.

552
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,320
You're so knowledgeable, Heavenly Emperor.

553
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,120
Heavenly Emperor?

554
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,780
Heavenly Emperor, what are you doing here?

555
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,340
Every 50 years, His Majesty will come to Daiyu Mountain to practice.

556
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,980
You were so agile just now.

557
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,600
What's your name?

558
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,280
Xue Sanyue greets Your Majesty.

559
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,360
You're Ji Yunhe's friend, the top warrior of Thousand Flower Valley.

560
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,700
On that day, Guardian Ji and I could free all the immortals in Congji Jail,

561
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,640
thanks to your help.

562
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,020
How's Guardian Ji doing in North Abyss?

563
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,280
That's it.

564
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,520
So, she has suffered so much.

565
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,020
I neglected it before.

566
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,580
I came to Daiyu Mountain just to pick the Nectar Ganoderma to save her life.

567
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,920
We used to get along so well.

568
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,200
Now she is in trouble, I will certainly help.

569
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,020
But this ganoderma still needs a few days to be ripen.

570
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,300
If you pick it early, it'll be dangerous, and its effectiveness will be reduced.

571
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,900
Leader Xue, you might as well stay here a few more days.

572
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,660
I'll help you pick it, then.

573
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,080
You can come with me to take a break.

574
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,860
Thank you.

575
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,980
But I'm still worried about it.

576
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,140
I'll rest assured if I guard it here.

577
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,620
You're right.

578
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,700
Can you smell where Sanyue is?

579
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,620
Prince, it's the east.

580
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,120
East?

581
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,140
The land in the east is so barren.

582
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,320
Why did Sanyue go there to look for the ganoderma?

583
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,960
Prince, we have the best sense of smell among the lynx.

584
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,860
We've worked so hard for you along the way.

585
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,020
I can't believe you don't trust us.

586
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,420
All right. I'll go to the east to have a look.

587
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,180
You two, stay here and take a break.

588
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,700
Here.

589
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,760
Actually...

590
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,500
Stop it.

591
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,080
But... isn't that vile spawn out west?

592
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,300
Why did you lie to him?

593
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,240
Smell again. What else did you smell besides that woman?

594
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,720
Another man.

595
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,980
The man seems pretty close to her.

596
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,600
Yes. Think about it...

597
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,940
A man and a woman... in a wild mountain region...

598
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,340
What will they do?

599
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,440
What?

600
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,540
Let's go and check it out first.

601
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,600
<i>I didn't expect that the little power</i>

602
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,080
<i>to make a soft armor would consume my body so much.</i>

603
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,440
You don't look very well today.

604
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,020
I told you to sleep more but you never listen to me.

605
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,560
Now you even can't see clearly.

606
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,320
Doesn't my voice sound healthy?

607
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,800
What's this?

608
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,160
Sweet garlic. You remember I like it.

609
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,940
It's because I want to eat it, not because of you.

610
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,460
Then eat one.

611
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,520
Let me see how much you like it.

612
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,280
Don't you want any?

613
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,400
I won't contend for it.

614
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,520
It looks like something hasn't changed.

615
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,780
For the sake of sweet garlic, I send you a gift in return.

616
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,900
Those men from Thousand Flower Valley are aggressive.

617
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,320
With so many Spiritual Masters gathering together,

618
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,920
this is no trivial thing.

619
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,740
The battlefield is so dangerous.

620
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,200
It's better to have a suit of soft armor than nothing.

621
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,900
Petty favors can't please me.

622
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,820
Then you can refuse it.

623
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,520
Forget it.

624
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,320
You've learned how to say one thing and mean another.

625
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,220
You haven't eaten anything. Where are you going?

626
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,060
I have some business to attend to. I'll be back later.

627
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,740
You don't have to wait for me.

628
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:12,840
♫ <i>Hey, if I weren't me and you weren't you</i> ♫

629
