20
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:39,540
Master, everything has been delivered.

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,700
Various items have all been prepared per your request.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,280
All the treasures from Heaven and Earth are found to be very good for her body and effective for her recovery.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,220
But... her reactions looked weird.

24
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,620
I think... you haven't told her about it, right?

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,640
Where on earth did you collect so many wonderful treasures?

26
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,700
As the Master of North Abyss, you'll be taken over if you're so extravagant.

27
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,900
It has nothing to do with you if I can stay at my position, right?

28
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,060
It has something to do with me,

29
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,060
because if you're taken down, I'll have a chance to run away. Would I not?

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,120
On the contrary, I wish you could be a little less extravagant.

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,260
Guardian Ji, I'm afraid you're dreaming.

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,320
I've never seen this merman trying so hard to find these for anyone else.

33
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,140
If I'm not wrong, you must be Mr. Kong Ming.

34
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,280
It's been long awaited.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,700
I dare not.

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,740
Guardian Ji should be the person well known through the world.

37
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,800
Just like thunder, why are you angry at me when this is our first meeting?

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,780
Did you forget the evil things you've done years earlier?

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,260
You're right. I've hurt Chang Yi before.

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,160
As his good friend, of course you should hate me.

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,360
That's enough.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,380
I didn't invite you here to chat.

43
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,120
Show me your wrist.

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,360
I didn't know you were a doctor.

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,100
Once a man fell off an extremely high cliff, he was seriously injured and almost died.

46
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,560
But I saved him and cured him.

47
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,680
How is she now?

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,460
I can't save her.

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,940
But she still has one month to live.

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,899
Look at me now, so lucky to have one month to go.

51
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,140
My life will last much longer than I expected.

52
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,860
This is not what I want to hear.

53
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,900
The backfire will break her down step by step. She is in God's hands now.

54
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,980
No matter how talented I am, I can't change her fate.

55
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,240
If you say so, please, just kill me now.

56
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,740
Shut up!

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Fine.

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,980
I will change her fate.

59
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,420
All you have tried till now wasto save Ji Yunhe's life?

60
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,340
Is this your answer?

61
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,160
I have my way.

62
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,380
All you need to do is to find a way to save her life.

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,060
I told you that I can't save her.

64
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,480
But in this world by your wisdom, there's no one that you can't save.

65
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,780
If I am not willing to do it?

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,440
Chang Yi, you should know to give up so as to get something.

67
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,360
You're so occupied with official business now,

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,180
so why do you still stay around her every day?

69
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,900
You're the Master of North Abyss now, so you have to figure out what is lighter and more important,

70
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,140
to carry those responsibilities on your shoulders.

71
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,700
Compared with the great ambition of the North Abyss,

72
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,680
she's nothing at all.

73
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,380
Please tell me, Mr. Kong Ming, who is more important between one man or a hundred men?

74
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,500
Who should I give up between a hundred people or ten thousand?

75
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,920
If it were an innocent man, I'd try my best to save her life.

76
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,160
I would never give up no matter who it was.

77
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,460
But if it's a villain, her life is none of my business.

78
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,340
On the day when Ji Yunhe left Immortal Master Mansion,

79
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,600
she disregarded her own safety to help a group of Immortal friends out of a sea of ​​misery.

80
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,460
In your eyes, is it kindness or evil?

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,460
Mr. Kong Ming, you have compassion in your heart to save the world.

82
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,620
If you don't save a person around you, so how can you save the rest of the world?

83
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,300
And Yunhe is being tortured now,

84
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,400
afterall, it must be the results from the Frost mark seal.

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,800
I believe you will follow your true heart, right?

86
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,220
A merman shouldn't have been taught how to speak.

87
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,700
The medicine works. I'm sure it'll heal soon.

88
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,060
Master, do you want to treat me...

89
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,740
or my face?

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,200
Ru Ling, that's not a good question.

91
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,140
Sister, I'm here to say goodbye.

92
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,220
Please take care of yourself. I have to leave for a while.

93
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,860
Where are you going?

94
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm going to practice at Daiyu Mountain.

95
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,000
During this time, you can go back to our palace.

96
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,600
The doctors there will also help you. The side effects of this therapy are way too strong.

97
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,760
I'm so worried about you if you stay here.

98
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,500
Daiyu Mountain? Is it the place where Master saved both of us?

99
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,580
Do you remember you bumped into a monster while having fun?

100
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,260
I went to look for you. Master happened to pass by and kill the monster.

101
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,080
Then we were sent back to Heavenly Palace.

102
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,140
He took me as his apprentice and taught me magic skills and how to fight.

103
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,100
Why did you say this?

104
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,620
I only remember that you risked your life to protect me.

105
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,940
Please trust me.

106
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,860
When I come back, I can be the one to protect you.

107
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
Just go, Ru Jun. Don't waste your time here.

108
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,540
I won't leave for our palace now.

109
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm leaving. Take care, Sister.

110
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,040
Master! Master!

111
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,860
<i>If you want to make sure about what I told you, why don't you go to Immortal Master's Quiet Chamber to have a look?</i>

112
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,080
<i>There is a secret room. The answer is there.</i>

113
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,940
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

114
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,840
It turns out she is the one in his heart.

115
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,440
Ru Ling, you're not supposed to be here.

116
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,580
Throughout the whole world, where am I not allowed to go?

117
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,820
I have a question for you, Master.

118
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,540
Who is the one in the portrait?

119
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,240
Leave now.

120
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Promise me. Never do these meaningless things again.

121
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,880
Or it's not good for your face.

122
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,340
She looks so similar.

123
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,360
The dress. The sword.

124
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,160
Even the face.

125
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
All these are to imitate her.

126
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,380
In your eyes, you'd taken me as a substitute all along.

127
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,440
But how dare you take me as a substitute for someone else?

128
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,340
Don't. Don't.

129
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,640
Ru Ling, hang in there for a while.

130
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,960
It will be over soon.

131
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,900
Drink it now.

132
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,780
Will I be healed if I drink this?

133
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,280
No, you won't.

134
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,320
So why should I drink it?

135
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,200
Your body now is like this cup of tea.

136
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,480
All you have now is within this small cup.

137
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,780
The medicine is like two pieces of dried fruits.

138
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,260
I can't prolong your life,

139
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,000
but I can make your life a bit fuller.

140
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,420
And you'll look better.

141
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,600
As long as you use less magic, the less pain you will suffer.

142
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,220
What if I use my magic?

143
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,400
The pain will be doubled and you'll be dead as soon as scheduled.

144
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,160
If I have to die, why don't you do some changes to my therapy?

145
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,920
Just kill me directly.

146
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,040
Chang Yi knows nothing about how medicine is used.

147
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,980
He won't blame you for it.

148
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,180
Who told you that he doesn't know it?

149
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,640
A patient knows much as a doctor, didn't you hear about it?

150
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,580
He managed to climb back from the gates of hell.

151
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,220
But there are days that aren't so good.

152
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,480
I really want to know what you did when you were at Thousand Flower Valley?

153
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,200
What tricks did you use for him to do so many things for you with such sincerity?

154
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,980
Sincerity?

155
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,700
I just lied to him.

156
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,640
He's just taking people too seriously.

157
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,820
Only kids behave like him.

158
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Is it difficult to lie to a kid?

159
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,460
How dare you hurt such a pure man?

160
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,700
Till now, you still don't regret it at all?

161
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,880
Back then, I was bent on seeking power and making mistakes.

162
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,320
If I made mistakes, it was the abyss.

163
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,500
What shame and regret do I have if I admit defeat?

164
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,020
You didn't regret?

165
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,600
But did you know what he has done for you?

166
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,940
He carefully planned just to find a good opportunity to rescue you from the Immortal Master Mansion.

167
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,460
The day you tried to commit suicide, he was at his enthronement to becoming the North Abyss Master.

168
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,720
But when he felt you were in great danger, he left immediately. People there were astonished.

169
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,560
<i>He came for me and left such an important ceremony.</i>

170
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,880
Guardian Ji, taking my medicine is like lying to yourself.

171
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,360
But for you, how are you not?

172
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,980
What do you mean?

173
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,360
Like you said, you were bent on seeking power.

174
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,800
Then why have you not taken the opportunity to charm Changyi's heart and kill him,

175
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,300
then take him back to the Immortal Master Mansion? That's a great achievement.

176
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,040
You do you need to annoy everyone here, only asking for your death.

177
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
In the past, at the cliff

178
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,560
or at North Abyss now,

179
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,360
you're protecting him wherever you are.

180
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,300
Am I right?

181
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,000
You already know about it, Mr. Kong Ming.

182
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,259
But it won't change anything, right?

183
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:14,520
You won't tell Chang Yi, will you?

184
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,020
I won't.

185
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,440
Chang Yi is way too sentimental.

186
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,340
He's Master of the North Abyss now, and everyone here has faith in him.

187
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,960
If I tell him, he'll hardly concentrate on his business here.

188
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,300
So I won't do it.

189
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,280
I won't allow anyone to hinder us from realizing our great ambition.

190
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,600
Mr. Kong Ming, thank you so much. Please keep it for me.

191
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,660
And I'll give you my word.

192
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,820
I'll do whatever I can for Chang Yi,

193
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,620
although I'll die soon.

194
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,020
Don't say these fine words now.

195
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,120
You should take your medicine.

196
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,180
Or he will come to watch over you again.

197
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,560
Master, Fairy Shunde went to Quiet Chamber and is causing trouble,

198
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,900
even having conflicts with Immortal Master.

199
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,340
That's good to hear.

200
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,580
But I heard that Immortal Master has punished her for sneaking into his room.

201
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,480
Even Shunde couldn't even fight back against him.

202
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,680
Master, what if our plan is wrong?

203
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,000
Shunde has pride, so she won't give up on herself

204
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,120
nor let others humiliate her.

205
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,600
Now a sense of animosity grows between them.

206
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,540
Its consequences will come sooner or later.

207
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,560
What should we do?

208
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,420
Fairy Shunde, please stop drinking.

209
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,800
If you want to let out your anger, just tell us about it.

210
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,100
<i>Get out!</i>

211
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,080
Lin Haoqing, your home is at Thousand Flower Valley not at Immortal Master Mansion.

212
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,420
Do you think Fairy Shunde will think highly of you for your little help?

213
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,220
She has an order that no one shall go into her room.

214
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,580
I have the balls to go in. I'm not afraid of the consequences.

215
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,658
If you're not worried, you can enter with me.

216
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,620
<i>[Immortal Fairy Hall]</i>

217
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,700
You haven't fully recovered yet. Don't drink too much.

218
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,340
You came again.

219
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,460
How dare you come in here.

220
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,040
You want to be whipped by me?

221
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,820
I came here to ask if you are willing to admit defeat.

222
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,500
Admit defeat?

223
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,480
As you see, I've already lost! Right?

224
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,860
I totally understand what it feels like when two people fall in love at first sight.

225
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,540
But the way Immortal Master sees you is without love and warmth.

226
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,340
He can't reciprocate your love.

227
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,080
Who the hell are you?

228
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,060
How dare you come and comment on what has happened between Master and me.

229
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,000
I can tell from the way you see him.

230
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,140
Don't lie to yourself.

231
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,800
What do you know?

232
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,100
What can you know?

233
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,380
Before my father and mother died, they asked me to raise Ru Jun.

234
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,100
Since then, everyone kept telling me about responsibility.

235
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,020
No one has wondered if I was willing to stay at Langfeng Peak all alone.

236
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,100
And no one has asked me what I wanted actually.

237
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,340
They keep saying that I must take care of my brother.

238
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,600
But Master is different from them.

239
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,200
He is the only one who told me I could be whoever I wanted to be.

240
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,820
Thanks to him, I know that my feelings are also important.

241
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,080
He is the only one I can lean on.

242
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,580
Only he cares about my feelings.

243
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,200
With him, I can know who I am.

244
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,300
I am not only the sister of Heavenly King.

245
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,920
Even though all Immortal Master sees in you is merely

246
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,520
the one who had passed away so long ago?

247
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,160
As long as I don't know it,

248
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,040
it's no big deal for me.

249
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,280
Without your big mouth,

250
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,400
I would have thought of nothing.

251
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,320
Why did you break up my dream?

252
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,880
Why did you want me to see through everything?

253
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,440
Lin Haoqing, do you think I can't kill you?

254
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,040
I just think that waking up from the dream is painful,

255
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,120
but it's more pathetic to know nothing.

256
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,000
It's not good to keep delving into it,

257
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,460
you must overcome it to make a change.

258
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,318
Have you ever thought that if you get stronger,

259
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,820
you can forever keep the one you love by your side.

260
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,560
His body and soul will belong to you.

261
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,760
<i>Since that day, I've never had a dream of that strange woman.</i>

262
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,400
<i>Was it just an illusion?</i>

263
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Are you awake?

264
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,820
Take your medicine if you're awake.

265
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,700
<i>I feel much better after taking Kong Ming's medicine.</i>

266
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,360
<i>But now, every day I open my eyes and close my eyes, I'm being watched by this big ice cube.</i>

267
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,220
<i>It was self-inflicted.</i>

268
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,100
<i>It's been a few days since he has moved here.</i>

269
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,220
<i>Why is he busy every time I go to sleep?</i>

270
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,520
<i>Even after I get up, he's buried in work.</i>

271
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,800
<i>Could it be that he never slept at all?</i>

272
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,840
You stay up every day without a break,

273
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,780
but what if you burn out?

274
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,460
You don't have to worry.

275
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,360
Take your medicine.

276
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,940
Watching me take my medicine every day,

277
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,160
you should pay more attention to yourself.

278
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,060
Are you trying to see who dies first after a month?

279
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,440
Easy. You won't die.

280
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,680
Even if I don't die,

281
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,700
but if you're so stubborn, you might be wiped out before me.

282
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,480
You should feel happy if I die earlier.

283
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,700
Why are you so worried?

284
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,920
Take your medicine.

285
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,700
<i>I have to figure out a way not to really let this fish boil to death.</i>

286
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,300
Don't you want a win-win situation for us?

287
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,860
If I... treat you like before,

288
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,300
you will do what I want. Right?

289
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,600
That's your wishful thinking.

290
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
I won't.

291
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,300
Why don't you give it a try?

292
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,398
Fine. Let's try.

293
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:19,180
♫ <i>Heaven is silent, all is quiet</i> ♫

294
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:25,180
♫ <i>Yourself in the mirror, can't see clearly in the fog</i> ♫

295
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:31,480
♫ <i>Floating across the galaxy, across the Netherworld,
injury and parting</i> ♫

296
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,380
♫ <i>Broken dreams are locked deep at the bottom of the sea</i> ♫

297
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,180
♫ <i>Fog and clouds disperse between heaven and earth </i>♫

298
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,500
♫ <i>The rain washed the dust away, who is waiting for me</i> ♫

299
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:51,980
♫ <i>Our fated love can light up the starry sea of time</i> ♫

300
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,180
♫ <i>I come on my own for you, searching for you step by step</i> ♫

301
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,180
♫ <i>Getting into my blood through every breath</i> ♫

302
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:04,380
♫ <i>Love is reborn on its own</i> ♫

303
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,400
I tried. It didn't work.

304
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,440
That...

305
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,280
I fell and knocked over the medicine.

306
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,360
You must be more careful.

307
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,800
Just take my pulse.

308
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,120
Don't ask anything else.

309
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,920
Sure, I will.

310
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,080
You can fall while sitting?

311
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,900
Has her condition improved?

312
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,260
If she keeps taking the medicine,

313
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,040
she will get better to some extent.

314
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,320
But would you please behave properly

315
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,480
when you're alone with her?

316
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,900
Don't waste my medicine again.

317
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,840
You know, today her heartbeat is much faster than in the past.

318
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,040
Didn't you come over once at noon,

319
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,800
so what made you come here again?

320
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Didn't you beg me to come and see her?

321
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,400
Now that I'm working hard, it's my fault?

322
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,160
I just see that you rarely have free time.

323
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,320
It's a little weird.

324
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,780
Where's Luo Jinsang?

325
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,040
Isn't she bothering you to see Ji Yunhe?

326
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,920
She doesn't come to pester me,

327
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,280
but my ears are much cleaner.

328
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,400
If you're free tonight,

329
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,720
can I go to your room for business?

330
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,900
- Stay up all night?
- Inconvenient?

331
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,100
No.

332
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,360
I... I just... Of course, I'm free tonight.

333
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,420
I'm afraid that if you suddenly move the nest, you won't be used to it.

334
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,560
I'm not used to it.

335
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,620
<i>Shouldn't he hate me a lot</i>

336
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,780
<i>because the past still lingers around him</i>

337
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,720
<i>and he can't let it go?</i>

338
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,240
<i>But why did he do that?</i>

339
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,800
More guards have been designated to the region that we discussed that day.

340
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,200
The route along the river is the same direction within this region...

341
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,740
The waterway is icy and slippery, which is not conducive to marching.

342
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,440
What do you think?

343
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,960
You told me to talk about business tonight.

344
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,680
But you are the one who is absent-minded.

345
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,760
What are you thinking actually?

346
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,420
You don't have to tell me, but I know it must be Ji Yunhe.

347
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,520
I'm not thinking about her.

348
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,098
You aren't? You said you aren't?

349
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:41,200
The eyes are straight and the face is red.

350
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,320
Chang Yi, you're here with me now, but you're thinking of someone else.

351
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,360
You'd better head for Cloud Quarters,

352
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,200
leave me alone to rest.

353
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,240
You're thinking too much!

354
00:29:51,198 --> 00:29:54,220
Listen. Let's analyze the situation of this river route.

355
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,560
I just explained it to you.

356
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,880
Well... then again.

357
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,240
What are you doing now?

358
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,720
I can't sleep. So I'm waiting for you.

359
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,520
Can you explain to me about the kiss yesterday?

360
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,200
You said we could give it a try.

361
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,580
But I didn't mean the kiss.

362
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,640
You know what I meant.

363
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,100
You asked for it first, but now you blame it on me?

364
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,440
I don't know what you are implying.

365
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,720
Well. I will ask you clearly this time.

366
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,880
As a merman, you're paired with one love for the rest of your life.

367
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,520
You dared to kiss your enemy,

368
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,480
are you going to break the rules for me?

369
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,720
I've been abiding by the rules of the merfolk.

370
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,860
I didn't break them at all.

371
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,120
You'll always be the one for me.

372
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,640
Because of the Merman mark,

373
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,840
I can feel where you are and see what you're doing.

374
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,440
So you're in my hands

375
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,800
wherever you are or whatever you do,

376
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,120
as long as I want to know.

377
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,000
This is the mark left by us for the destined one.

378
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,780
It explains why you could come and save me in time.

379
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,900
Chang Yi, what do you feel for me?

380
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,800
Do you want to control me as a puppet?

381
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,500
No.

382
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,260
You're a creature locked in my cage.

383
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,340
It's enough for me to lock you by my mark.

384
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,720
You're out of your mind.

385
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,600
You would rather give up your feelings in this life and imprison me for a lifetime.

386
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,960
You haven't answered me.

387
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,640
Sleep now.

388
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,620
<i>It's lucky that I won't live for a long time,</i>

389
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,540
<i>so he won't be alone for his whole life.</i>

390
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,040
<i>But a merman can't love someone else.</i>

391
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,240
<i>That's enough.</i>

392
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,200
<i>He won't listen to me if I tell him what I think.</i>

393
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,080
<i>I'd better sleep.</i>

394
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,840
<i>Ji Yunhe, the only way to stop you from leaving here,</i>

395
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,080
<i>is to lock you here.</i>

396
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,520
<i>That's what I truly want.</i>

397
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,240
What Chang Yi said is right.

398
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,360
It might be worse for me to pick up Yunhe now than to stay here.

399
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,600
But she's locked up like this.

400
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,920
What if she gets bored to death?

401
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,040
Mr. Kong Ming?

402
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,180
It's been a long time since the battle at Immortal Master Mansion.

403
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,540
Why does Yunhe still need to meet him?

404
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,240
What if she's still sick now?

405
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,600
Young Master.

406
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,500
Young Master, it's so cold outside.

407
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,300
What are you doing on Lake Island?

408
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:52,000
Young Master, I know you are in a bad mood, so why come to see Ji Yunhe again?

409
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,800
She interrupted the enthronement ceremony.

410
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Master promised you that he would explain it to you,

411
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,200
but instead moved into Cloud Quarters right away.

412
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
He didn't respect you at all.

413
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,600
<i>The Young Master of the Fox Clan hates Yunhe deeply for what happened to Qing Shu. Right?</i>

414
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,800
<i>What did she come for?</i>

415
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,000
She must have lured Master and pretended to kill herself.

416
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,100
That's all an excuse to have Master around her.

417
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,800
It's true that she almost lost her life when the ceremony was held.

418
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,000
I believe Master has his own plan.

419
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,300
Let's wait and see.

420
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,300
<i>Ceremony? Kill herself?</i>

421
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,200
<i>Almost dead?</i>

422
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,600
<i>Something happened to her.</i>

423
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,900
Kong Ming! Kong Ming.

424
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,600
- Kong Ming!
- Why are you here again?

425
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,200
On the day of Chang Yi's ceremony, something happened. Right?

426
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,900
What's up with Yunhe?

427
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,700
You don't have to know because you can't help her.

428
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,500
Leave now. I have to make medicine.

429
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,800
Who did you make it for?

430
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,200
You made it for Yunhe?

431
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,000
Her injuries haven't gotten healed. Or she's sick again?

432
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,300
Chang Yi told me he locked her up for her safety. He lied to me, didn't he?

433
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,900
Where is he?

434
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,400
Luo Jinsang. Don't be so silly.

435
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,900
Chang Yi did this for Yunhe. Okay?

436
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,200
She can live for a few days more thanks to Chang Yi.

437
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,800
If you go there to disturb them, the reverse effect will be worse...

438
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
and she won't get better.

439
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
The reverse effect?

440
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,200
What is it?

441
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,800
Please tell me what has happened to her?

442
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,200
She's seriously hurt through the Lin Canglan's trial.

443
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,000
From the current situation,

444
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
she only has around one month to live.

445
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,100
I couldn't tell you because I was afraid you wouldn't be able to face it.

446
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,000
Mr. Kong Ming, you're an excellent doctor.

447
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,800
You must have a way to save her. You can do it, right?

448
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,400
Please don't give up on her.

449
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
I can't do anything, either.

450
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
You can't do anything?

451
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,200
How could it be?

452
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,200
You can save Chang Yi, but you say you can't save her life?

453
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,700
You must say it on purpose.

454
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,200
You are doing this for revenge because Yunhe made the ceremony into a mess, didn't you?

455
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,800
I don't care whatever you think.

456
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,600
If you want her to live a bit longer,

457
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,000
don't impede any of my work.

458
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,700
Fine. If you can't do it, I'll do it by myself.

459
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,900
I can't stand to see such a cold-blooded man like you.

460
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,300
Master.

461
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,860
I don't think your wine is good enough, try this one.

462
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,700
Mine tastes better.

463
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,200
What do you want from me?

464
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,800
Master, please go to visit Yunhe.

465
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
I'm so concerned for her.

466
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,000
What's wrong?

467
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,600
Kong Ming told me some reverse effect is torturing Yunhe.

468
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
She only can live for a month.

469
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,400
Although Chang Yi asked Kong Ming to cure her,

470
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,300
but he is unstable mentally, so I can't count on him.

471
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,200
Cloud Quarters is also forbidden for me to get into.

472
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,600
Master, due to your status and power,

473
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,700
Chang Yi may not be able to stop you from getting in so we can check it out.

474
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,300
If we have to, I'm ready to fight anytime.

475
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,500
I've told you, we can't help anything since it's their business.

476
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,900
But I can't just wait and see as she is imprisoned.

477
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,000
Master, please help her.

478
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,600
I won't ask for anything else.

479
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
If you stay here, Master, I'm going to see her.

480
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,300
And I can't wait to fight Chang Yi.

481
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,900
Sanyue, we can't start a fight with him.

482
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,500
If we start a battle with him and end our peace, we can't stay here any longer.

483
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,400
At that time, no one can help Yunhe anymore.

484
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
She'll be more desperate.

485
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
Wait a second.

486
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,600
Master Qing Ji, you always live in a clear-cut way.

487
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,800
But Yunhe and Chang Yi are trapped in the mire of love.

488
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,200
How could you let it happen?

489
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Master Qing, if you can visit Yunhe,

490
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,800
at least we can know how she is for sure.

491
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,200
And obviously you have nothing to do right now.

492
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,400
Nothing to do?

493
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,000
Nothing but drinking.

494
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,200
You annoying girl.

495
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,300
Master, I know it's hard to cure the heart.

496
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,000
But she can only have a chance to cure it when she is still alive.

497
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If she can't live any longer, there will be lifelong regrets for them.

498
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,200
And they can't make it up anymore.

499
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,000
Haven't you ever regretted your past?

500
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,100
Don't you feel what she's suffering now?

501
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,000
What I regret most now...

502
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
is that I did what you asked

503
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,400
and drank her wine.

504
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,100
Let's go.

505
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,500
- Chang Yi, get out of the way. Let us in.
- Shut your mouths.

506
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,000
I won't.

507
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,800
I will keep shouting till we can meet her.

508
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,500
Kong Ming doesn't really want to save her.

509
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,000
Can her injuries recover if you don't try another option?

510
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,200
Master Qing might be able to help her, don't you think so?

511
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,600
She has lived longer than any of us,

512
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
she may have a way to save Yunhe.

513
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
But I have to tell you,

514
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,000
I can't save her for sure.

515
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,200
If these best friends can reunite, why do you stop them?

516
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,500
One more thing, there's nothing good if Yunhe stays alone sadly.

517
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,400
Maybe what she needs most is to be with her friends for fun.

518
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,100
Tell me. How long has it been since you last saw her smile brightly?

519
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,900
Let's go, Sanyue.

520
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Yunhe.

521
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,200
I can finally see you.

522
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,900
Am I dreaming now?

523
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,000
Why are you here?

524
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,600
Even Master Qing Ji is here.

525
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,200
It's true, not a dream. Everyone is here.

526
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,900
We're here for you.

527
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,800
The day we farewelled at Thousand Flower Valley, feels like yesterday,

528
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,200
but it also feels like a half century ago.

529
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm so happy to see you again.

530
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,800
I feel the same.

531
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,400
Too many unforeseen things have happened.

532
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,800
You're here with me,

533
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,400
so it feels like nothing has ever changed.

534
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
It has changed.

535
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,500
We're together every day.

536
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,000
Closer than in the past.

537
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,700
Yunhe, look at your hands and face.

538
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,400
You're losing weight.

539
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,500
Luo Luo, don't cry. Cry baby.

540
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,800
We haven't seen each other for so many days,

541
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,300
so tell me what has happened to you.

542
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,400
<i>Now she has seen her old friends,</i>

543
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,000
<i>she'll have a lot of mood swings.</i>

544
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,900
<i>Can her body stand all of these emotions?</i>

545
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,080
So we begged Master Qing to take us in.

546
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,200
She slowed us down.

547
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,000
If she allowed us to come earlier, you wouldn't have suffered all this.

548
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,500
How can you complain about me?

549
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,500
The merman treats her as his most beloved one, so he can't let her go.

550
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,400
What else can I do?

551
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,800
Beloved?

552
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,400
Look at her face and her hands,

553
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,500
who will love a person by torturing her?

554
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,900
I thought you came to treat her illness.

555
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,400
Yes, that's right. That's more urgent.

556
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,800
Master Qing, please check her health condition.

557
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,600
Master Qing, how is she?

558
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,000
She will suffer a lot for the rest of her life.

559
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,200
It's better to kill her once and for all.

560
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,400
That's what I want.

561
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,600
Don't say it.

562
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,700
Kong Ming said we still have one month to save you.

563
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,900
Master Qing, you're experienced and sophisticated.

564
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,000
It's impossible that you would get the same conclusion as Kong Ming.

565
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,600
Although we can extend her life for a couple of days,

566
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,800
but there's nothing but pain.

567
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,900
Well. If you can't solve the problem, just leave now.

568
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,400
Master, can you check it again?

569
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,600
The host has asked us to leave,

570
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,500
it's not helpful... if we insist on staying here.

571
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,400
Sanyue, let's go.

572
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,800
Now she has gotten better, so she needs more rest.

573
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,400
Little Butterfly, come on.

574
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,200
I won't leave her. I've tried hard to get inside, so I won't leave her.

575
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,400
Luo Luo, I'm exhausted.

576
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,600
You don't have to stay, because we can meet again.

577
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,200
Leave.

578
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,200
Luo Luo is a little girl,

579
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,000
there's always laughter no matter where she is.

580
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,100
Please allow them to come and see me.

581
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,300
You're so delighted to see them?

582
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,600
I've been here for a long time,

583
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,200
but it's the first time that I can feel alive.

584
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm so happy to see them.

585
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,100
We will talk about it later.

586
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,000
You should sleep now.

587
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,700
<i>If these best friends can reunite, why do you stop them?</i>

588

00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,600
