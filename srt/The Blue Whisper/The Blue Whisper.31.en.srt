and aggravation of the pain.

A brilliant moment is enough.

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,160
It's also good for the best Spiritual Master

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,320
of Thousand Flower Valley to leave in this way.

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,920
Thank you for your help.

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,600
I'll never tell Luo Luo and Chang Yi about this.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,940
True love is rare to be found.

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,660
But there are things that we have to do.

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,540
And these things weigh more than love and our lives.

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,920
So even if they find out about this,

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,840
I'll never regret it.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,040
Ji Yunhe, the North Abyss and Thousand Flower Valley are now incompatible.

34

How are you going to stop this war?

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,160
May I ask you to take me to see someone?

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,120
Father, I'm going to the battlefield.

37
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,040
Rest assured.

38
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,820
I will certainly avenge you.

39
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,540
It's just that Chang Yi has lost half of his spiritual power,

40
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,060
and I don't know whether we'll survive the war.

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,360

Ji Yunhe, how dare you come in here. Guards!

46

Young Lord, don't bother.

47
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,280
I've sent all the guards away.

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,560
The enemy is approaching, and what do you think you're doing?

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,280
Don't blame Mr. Kong Ming.

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,800
I made him bring me here.

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,540
The Fox King died because of me.

52
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,960
I should come to pay respects

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,080
and take this chance to tell you how to save Chang Yi.

54

Young Lord.

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,240
When I was imprisoned at Immortal Master Mansion,

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,560
the Immortal Master told me there's a way

57
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,080
for mermen to restore their spiritual power.

58
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,820
As long as Chang Yi can get the merman pearl back in his body,

59
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,480
his spiritual power will surely return,

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,340
or even grow stronger.

61
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,060
You think I didn't come up with this solution?

62
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,000
If I could kill you and get the pearl,

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,760
I would have done it.

64
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,480
But he would never agree.

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,720
What's the point of saying that?

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,240
You couldn't, but that doesn't mean I can't.

67
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,660
I let him give it to me,

68
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,880
and I'll make him take it back.

69
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,000
Mr. Kong Ming can testify to it for me.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,920
Ji Yunhe, what exactly are you up to?

71
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,100
Nothing.

72
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,000
I just don't want to see the war happen.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,780
North Abyss has got such a good view.

74
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,200
Isn't it nice for us to drink and enjoy the snow together?

75
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,620
Observer. The merman has taken the Immortals in North Abyss to the border.

76
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,200
They've confronted the Thousand Flower Valley. And the North Abyss is in high spirits.

77
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,560
Please order our troops to stay where they are so as to avoid casualties.

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
No need.

79
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,200
It doesn't matter how many of them die.

80
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,340
Well, to be exact, the higher the casualties, the better.

81
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,780
When they're both weakened, we'll bring our men there.

82
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,480
Whether it's the North Abyss or the Thousand Flower Valley,

83
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I'll finish them off in one go.

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,360
Master, they're suffering from low morale

85
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
and seem a little bit weird.

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,080
Everyone, the North Abyss isn't militant.

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
If you're willing to retreat,

88
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,560
I'll let Lin Haoqing return safe and sound.

89
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,640
I promise you in the name of North Abyss's Master,

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,560
that I won't send troops to hunt him down.

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,840
From then on, we shall live in peace

92
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,900
and never aggress each other.

93
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,380
But if you insist on fighting against us,

94
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,280
I'll let you see how fearless the North Abyss is!

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,620
Elder Donglian, what should we do now?

96
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,920
Do we have to fight?

97
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,280
All lives in Thousand Flower Valley are in Zhu Ling's hands.

98
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,560
We have no turning back.

99
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,320
The only way is to fight.

100
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,680
Chang Yi, this war isn't our intention.

101
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,800
But we have no other choice.

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,260
It won't help to explain.

103
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,440
Attack!

104
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,440
Stop it.

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
It's Yunhe.

106
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,800
Why are you here?

107
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,720
I insisted. Don't blame them.

108
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,000
Chang Yi, now it's not only between you two,

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,460
but it also concerns the North Abyss.

110
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,260
Chang Yi, let her go!

111
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,880
Yunhe, leave with us.

112
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,000
Chang Yi, don't frown.

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
It doesn't look pretty.

114
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,920
Relax. I'm not running away.

115
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,000
I was kept in confinement for a long time,

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,760
and just want to talk to my old friends.

117
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,520
Ji Yunhe! What do you think you're doing?

118
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,900
Are you helping the North Abyss fight against Thousand Flower Valley?

119
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,840
Yunhe, you have to know everything Master does is for your sake.

120
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,220
Thousand Flower Valley and North Abyss shouldn't be at war.

121
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,220
Lin Haoqing went to the battle not only for me,

122
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,640
but also for all of you.

123
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,840
He brought you here so you could surrender.

124
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,140
What did you say? You've met Master?

125
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,560
Just stop.

126
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Neither of us is going to win this battle.

127
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,120
Though you've captured our master,

128
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,800
the spiritual masters of Thousand Flower Valley still have our pride.

129
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,480
We allow no one to disdain and insult us.

130
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,680
I'm not disdaining you,

131
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
nor am I insulting you.

132
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,660
But back then when Immortal Master used Frost marks to subdue Thousand Flower Valley,

133
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,720
you were already on the losing side.

134
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,720
That's right.

135
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,920
Now all Spiritual Masters of Thousand Flower Valley

136
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,360
are controlled by Immortal Master and Shunde.

137
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,560
But even the lowly cricket and ant cling to life.

138
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,840
Our lives depend on them,

139
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,680
so we don't have a choice.

140
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,720
You can't determine your fate,

141
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,080
but you can decide what you think.

142
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,120
It's never late to correct the wrongs.

143
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,000
Thousand Flower Valley has been in a no-win situation for hundreds of years,

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,820
Do you want to keep it like this?

145
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,920
But the Frost marks are still with us.

146
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,400
If we don't fight now,

147
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,200
Thousand Flower Valley will never be saved!

148
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,140
If you pay allegiance to North Abyss,

149
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,240
the situation can still be remedied.

150
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,920
Everyone,

151
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,520
I've developed a new drug which can suppress Frost marks.

152
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,240
The fellow Immortals you sent to Lingshuang Pavilion

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,820
also suffered from Frost marks.

154
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,400
But after taking the drug, they're now doing fine.

155
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,180
I believe that one day

156
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,900
we'll find a way to treat Frost marks.

157
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,760
Frost marks can be removed,

158
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,280
but the grievances between the Immortals of North Abyss and the Spiritual Masters can never be resolved.

159
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,820
Besides, the Fox King died.

160
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,940
You'll definitely vent your anger on the Spiritual Masters of Thousand Flower Valley.

161
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:48,200
It's by no means easy to let it all go.

162
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm the daughter of the Fox King, Qing Yao.

163
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,860
The one who killed my father was the Immortal Master.

164
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,020
And the one who subjugates all the Immortals is Shunde, his spoiled disciple.

165
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,500
No hatred is without a cause.

166
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,420
I'm making a vow now that Spiritual Masters who're willing to join the North Abyss

167
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,480
and fight against Immortal Master and Shunde will all be accepted by us.

168
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,920
We have no intention of revenge.

169
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,900
<i>Really? We'll be saved, won't we?</i>

170
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,080
Everyone, I was a Spiritual Master.

171
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,680
I know you risked your lives to this bitter cold realm unwillingly.

172
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,260
But think about who made you come here

173
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,840
and who you are fighting for.

174
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,080
Will someone sober up

175
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,660
and think about how we lost our passion,

176
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,600
how we're trapped in a cage,

177
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,260
and why we are being intimidated and threatened?

178
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,020
Where should your swords point to?

179
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,160
And what should you spill your blood for?

180
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,240
I'll point my sword at the executioner outside the cage,

181
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,840
instead of the sufferers struggling for survival.

182
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,660
The Immortal Master can't trap me and Thousand Flower Valley.

183
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,220
Frost marks can control our body, but it can't take away our belief and hope.

184
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,060
Every Spiritual Master has a free soul!

185
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,500
North Abyss isn't afraid of war.

186
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,440
But we'd rather join hands with you to fight against the enemy.

187
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,940
Everyone who joins the North Abyss will be treated as he deserves.

188
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,900
Yunhe, I once said I'd always trust you no matter what.

189
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,320
Qu Xiaoxing will join North Abyss!

190
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,240
Qu Xiaoxing!

191
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,500
Don't you get it?

192
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,120
Submission or hope, which one do you choose?

193
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,080
I'll join North Abyss!

194
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:55,960
<i>I'll join North Abyss! I'll join North Abyss! I'll join North Abyss! I'll join North Abyss!</i>

195
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:07,840
<i>I'll join North Abyss! I'll join North Abyss! I'll join North Abyss!</i>

196
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,240
You useless losers!

197
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,320
Qu Xiaoxing, I order you to attack,

198
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,120
but you talked them into surrendering.

199
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,280
Good. You chose hope, didn't you?

200
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,400
I'll let you see how North Abyss will save you!

201
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,360
You've got an antidote?

202
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,120
There are 3,000 Spiritual Masters in Thousand Flower Valley,

203
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,180
let's see how many you can save before it's too late.

204
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,560
Yunhe.

205
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,940
Yunhe!

206
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,520
Big-tailed Fish, I'm turning into the wind this time.

207
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,300
Yunhe.

208
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,080
Isn't it too cold here?

209
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,240
It's warm in Cloud Quarters. I'm taking you there.

210
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,660
Why did the drums stop?

211
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,400
Is the war over?

212
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,980
It's Yunhe's spiritual power.

213
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,140
Why is her power scattering away?

214
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,080
She survived the Frost mark attack and her spiritual power could suppress it.

215
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,880
Could it be... Ji Yunhe...

216

Yunhe, you still haven't told me the answer.

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,380
actually, I wanted to tell you that I've never betrayed you.

239
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,380
But I didn't dare to.

240
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,900
I looked at the bigger picture and told a lie.

241
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,420
I've fooled everyone, including myself.

242
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,140
I'm just afraid...

243
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,340
that everything I did was wrong from the very beginning.

244
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,980
I was wrong to make the decision for you.

I was wrong to force you to leave.

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,840
I was wrong to stab you on the cliff and dishearten you.

I was wrong to break your heart.

I was also wrong to turn you into this.

249

But it's too late to tell you this.

250
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,740
We can never go back to how we were.

251
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,440

She never told me the truth.

she lied to me and tried to kill me.

320
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Yunhe! Yunhe!

321
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,180
- Yunhe, come back!
- Stop it.

322
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,960
- Yunhe, I'm not letting you go! Come back.
- Don't hit it.

323
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Yunhe. Yunhe!

324
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,080
Stop it, Luo Luo.

325
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,360
Luo Luo! Luo Luo!

326
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,640
She's about to disappear.

327
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,920
It's fated and this is her last wish.

328
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:55,060
That day, you didn't look me in the eye.

329
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,820
You promised me you'd keep Yunhe safe.

330
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,000
I told you not to lie.

331
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,540
But you didn't look me in the eye.

332
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,440
So you already decided to let Yunhe die, right?

333
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,300
So you've been lying to me, right?

334
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,720
Sorry.

335
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,480
Don't you know you killed Yunhe?

336
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:01,240
Don't you know your apology killed Yunhe?

337
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,180
I don't want to see you again.

338
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,380
And I'm done being responsible for you.

339
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,680
- Luo Luo.
- Don't come over!

340
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,260
Don't come over.

341
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,680
If you dare to get near me,

342
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,520
I'll kill you.

343
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,380
Master Qing.

344
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,540
Master Qing, I came to drink with you.

345
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,220
Where's she?

346
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,820
It won't hurt after I drink this.

347
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,180
<i>Girl, I went back to Leyou Mountain.</i>

348
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,140
<i>Don't look for me. We'll meet again.</i>

349
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,580
Everyone's gone.

350
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
<i>[Tablet of the Fox King Qing Xuan]</i>

351
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,460
<i>I don't have much time left,</i>

352
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,220
<i>so it's better to find something meaningful to do.</i>

353
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,680
<i>This way, someone will remember my kindness.</i>

354
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,300
<i>It's a good bargain.</i>

355
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,800
<i>Are you sure you're doing this?</i>

356
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,320
<i>If I return the pearl to Chang Yi,</i>

357
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,840
<i>it'll be easier for you to reassure the elders.</i>

358
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,700
<i>I just hope that you can take my old friends in.</i>

359
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,540
<i>After all, the Fox King didn't want a war,</i>

360
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,220
<i>but that you could lead North Abyss</i>

361
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,360
<i>to live a peaceful and free life.</i>

362
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
<i>Ji Yunhe,</i>

363
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,540
<i>what kind of person are you?</i>

364
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,020
<i>Some say I should be like the wind.</i>

365
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,760
<i>The wind is free and can never be stopped.</i>

366
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,320
<i>Likewise, no one can stop me, either.</i>

367
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,200
Father, Ji Yunhe's dead.

368
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,360
She was still thinking of North Abyss.

369
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,200
Maybe I've misunderstood her all along.

370
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,780
I was biased and aggressive.

371
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,540
Now I know what the big picture is.

372
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,840
I've also avenged you.

373
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,980
But why...

374
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,380
Why am I still thinking I did something wrong?

375
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,640
Why am I feeling miserable?

376
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,640
Master, don't worry.

377
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,600
Perhaps Ji Yunhe found another way and stopped the war.

378
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,780
She was deathly sick.

379
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,900
If she used spiritual power, she wouldn't survive.

380
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,440
She gave everyone an explanation

381
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,140
at the cost of her own life.

382
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,520
She was still so harsh on herself.

383
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,880
Ji Yunhe.

384
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,600
You were the same as before.

385
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,420
Luo Luo, look. We found the Nectar Ganoderma.

386
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,040
Come on, let's go find Yunhe.

387
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,860
Yunhe, she...

388
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,080
Your Majesty, why don't we stay for a few more days?

389
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,760
We haven't solved the puzzle.

390
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,680
I'm worried about my sister, and also Ji Yunhe.

391
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,320
There are lots of physicians in Heavenly Palace.

392
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,540
Perhaps we can find a way to ease her passing.

393
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,980
Please wait for me at Daiyu Mountain. I'll be right back.

394
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,420
Okay.

395
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,340
What's wrong?

396
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,840
I heard a falling meteor means a virtuous person died.

397
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,180
And just now I felt that

398
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,680
one important friend of mine is gone.

399
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,780
An important friend?

400
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,820
Your Majesty, Commander Xue sent news that Fairy Shunde sent an army to North Abyss

401
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,580
and Ji Yunhe... has died.

402
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,280
What?

403
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,400
Loser!

404
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,800
Immortal Fairy. Immortal Fairy.

405
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,040
I asked you to observe the army, but you lost it.

406
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,440
You still had the nerve to come back?

407
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,480
Zhu Ling, one was a mistake.

408
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,180
But how could you fail twice?

409
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,980
What can you do for me?

410
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,300
Immortal Fairy, Ji Yunhe is dead!

411
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,780
What?

412
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,900
I... I saw her die, so I fought my way back to report to you.

413
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,400
Please give me another chance. I'll take North Abyss for you.

414
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,000
<i>Take North Abyss?</i>

415
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,700
Ru Jun, how come you're back?

416
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,700
Did you accomplish your cultivation?

417
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,420
You said Ji Yunhe is dead.

418
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,820
Yes. Immortal Fairy asked me to observe the army

419
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,000
and I saw it with my own eyes

420
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,340
that Ji Yunhe ran out of power and died.

421
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,080
Your Majesty, Ji Yunhe seriously injured Immortal Fairy.

422
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,960
She asked for it.

423
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,020
Immortal Fairy has had her revenge.

424
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,640
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

425
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
Congratulations, Immortal Fairy!

426
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,540
You observed the army yourself?

427
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,860
Exactly.

428
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,040
Master Fei Lian, what's the heaviest punishment in the Heavenly Palace?

429
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,500
Your Majesty, killing innocent people against the law of Heaven,

430
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,260
he shall be punished with 12 lightning strikes

431
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,940
and have his veins peeled and bones crushed.

432
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,780
Okay. Someone!

433
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

434
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,200
Take Zhu Ling down.

435
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,040
Immortal Fairy. Immortal Fairy.

436
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,320
Immortal Fa-Fairy.

437
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,020
Your Majesty.

438
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,380
12 lightning strikes. Not one less!

439
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,740
Master Fei Lian will supervise the execution.

440
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,240
Yes.

441
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,960
Ru Jun, what do you mean?

442
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,160
Sister, go somewhere with me.

443
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,560
Where are you taking me?

444
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,060
Let's go.

445
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,500
Langfeng Peak?

446
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,840
Why did you bring me here?

447
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,300
Sister, do you still remember this Bodhi tree?

448
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,740
Of course, I remember.

449
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,700
Back then, our parents both passed away,

450
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,380
and I had to keep your spirit in this Bodhi tree.

451
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,660
I watered and pruned it every day,

452
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,580
hoping you could be born earlier.

453
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,780
This way, I'd feel less lonely

454
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,340
and I'd have a companion.

455
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,040
Right.

456
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,220
You took great care of me. It felt like yesterday.

457
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,680
But it's in the past.

458
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,460
I'd never expected

459
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,640
we'd get to this point someday.

460
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,050
Ru Jun, what do you mean?

461
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,860
At that time, you were gentle and empathic.

462
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,980
But now you've become cruel and violent.

463
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,840
I don't want you to go on like this.

464
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,740
This is my last chance for you.

465
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,980
Please retract from the wrong path and don't go any further.

466
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,240
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

467
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,440
Why would I turn back?

468
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,740
You feel grieved for Ji Yunhe and North Abyss,

469
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,860
but what about me?

470
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,460
Ji Yunhe ruined my face.

471
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,120
Immortal Master used me as someone else's stand-in.

472
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,180
They've hurt me and harmed me.

473
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,100
I'm just trying to get back what I lost.

474
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,660
What have I done wrong?

475
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
But it's not the reason for you to kill innocent people.

476
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,440
Besides, it served you right considering what you did.

477
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,460
You're still not repenting?

478
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,340
Repent?

479
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,060
Ru Jun, I'm the only family you have.

480
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,840
Are you sure you want to turn against me

481
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,220
for Ji Yunhe and the lowly immortals of North Abyss?

482
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,500
I'm not heartless.

483
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,380
But every creature in the four seas and eight wastelands,

484
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,320
no matter if they are noble or ignoble, are all my responsibility.

485
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,700
You're like my mother.

486
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,800
In the past, I was being kind to you because you raised me.

487
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,440
Now I'm not repeating my mistake.

488
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,060
This time, you started a war against North Abyss and it's against the Heavenly Rules.

489
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,920
I'll deprive you of the title and ground you in your bedroom.

490
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,180
Without my order, you shall never leave.

491
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,580
You can't do this to me.

492
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,660
I'm the noblest fairy in the whole world.

493
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,020
You can't ground me. And you won't ground me!

494
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,560
This Bodhi tree was planted by our parents.

495
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,400
It has lived for tens of thousands of years.

496
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,200
Even the tree thinks you're wrong.

497
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,200
You have a noble status and you should be more careful of what you do and say than others.

498
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,960
I hope you can figure this out when you're grounded.

499
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,000
If you bring me dishonor again,

500
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,100
I won't take you as my sister.

501
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,620
You can't do this to me.

502
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,720
Let me go!

503
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
Ru Jun!

504
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,200
<i>Master Qing,</i>

505
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,660
<i>when you see this letter, I should have already left.</i>

506
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,360
<i>I've been hiding one thing.</i>

507
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,280
<i>Ning Xiyu came to my dream and asked me to tell you</i>

508
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,100
<i>that Grandmaster Ning didn't lie to you.</i>

509
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,650
<i>He wanted to get into the Ten Directions Formation and stay with you.</i>

510
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:27,060
<i>But he was tricked by Ning Qing and got killed outside the formation.</i>

511
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,460
<i>That's why he didn't show up.</i>

512
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,980
<i>I admire your free soul</i>

513
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,720
<i>and didn't want to involve you in this.</i>

514
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:41,100
<i>But I realized it'd be unfair to you.</i>

515
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,760
<i>I've explained the truth to you in the cover letter.</i>

516
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,680
<i>I have nothing more to hide.</i>

517
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,900
<i>I only hope that you remember</i>

518
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,820
<i>Ning Qing is now almost invincible.</i>

519
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,120
<i>If you seek vengeance hastily, you'll definitely fail.</i>

520
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,100
<i>Please make your own decision about the future.</i>

521
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,240
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

522
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,980
<i>Master Qing, take care.</i>

523
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,020
<i>We're similar in strength, but why do I always lose to you?</i>

524
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,780
<i>You're just too impatient.</i>

525
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,200
<i>You're like this when playing chess and practicing swordplay.</i>

526
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,980
<i>You're anxious to win.</i>

527
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,300
<i>We should guard against arrogance and rashness.</i>

528
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,140
<i>To defeat the enemy, the key is not to attack but to wait.</i>

529
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,900
<i>Wait for the right moment.</i>

530
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,380
<i>Ruochu, I'll wait patiently this time.</i>

531
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,980
<i>When the right time comes,</i>

532
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,880
<i>we'll avenge you together.</i>

533
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,380
<i>How does it sound?</i>

534
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:19,300
♫ <i>Hey, if I weren't me and you weren't you</i> ♫

535
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:26,200
