00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,100
- Well...
- Brother A'Ji, do you really know the way?

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,460
It's lighting up.

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,620
Is it pointing the way?

23
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,640
But it looks pretty deserted over there, and gloomy, too.

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,720
Can we count on it?

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,040
The more deserted it is, the fewer enemies we will meet.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,000
It might be a shortcut for us to leave North Abyss.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,480
If you really want to help us, show us the right way.

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,320
Don't let us get caught by that merman.

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,720
Let's go.

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,920
Brother A'Ji, it's getting colder as we go further.

31
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,000
Why don't we take a different route?

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,940
I also find this place a bit weird.

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,320
Listen. Wait here for me.

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm going to scout around.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,760
Maybe there's another way ahead.

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,400
I always felt we were on the right track.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,520
Why does this place feel so familiar?

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,440
There's a man there!

39
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,160
<i>What an alcoholic.</i>

40
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,680
<i>It's a pity to be frozen to death here.</i>

41
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,280
<i>He's the freak I dreamed about!</i>

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,520
<i>Why is he here?</i>

43
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,900
<i>Big-tailed Fish, you're really agile.</i>

44
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,080
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

45
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,040
<i>Chang... Yi...</i>

46
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,440
Chang Yi.

47
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,380
Who are you?

48
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,820
<i>Black robe. Hidden pattern.</i>

49
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,460
<i>Only people of high standing could wear this in North Abyss.</i>

50
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,120
<i>Could he be...?</i>

51
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,160
Brother A'Ji, run!

52
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,660
He's the master of North Abyss, Merman Chang Yi!

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
Ji Ning, run!

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
<i>And he said we'd break into Lingshuang Pavilion,</i>

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,480
<i>replace the merman as the master?</i>

56
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,440
<i>Lu Jinyan is just a liar!</i>

57
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,840
<i>I used all my strength, but he easily toppled me.</i>

58
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,530
<i>And he did that with one swipe.</i>

59
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,120
Master, keep your cool.

60
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
Who sent you here?

61
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,440
Big-tailed Fish!

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,760
Ma... Master.

63
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,440
Well, we were just passing by.

64
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,880
I didn't know you were resting here.

65
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm not lying. It's true.

66
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,600
Master! Master!

67
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,760
Miss Luo said a fox took Lu Jinyan, Fu Chao,

68
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,360
and apprentices of Immortal Master Mansion to... to break out of prison.

69
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,440
Why are you so surprised? I'm right in front of you.

70
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,880
Take them all back.

71
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
Yes.

72
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,320
<i>So the man I dreamed of is the master of North Abyss.</i>

73
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,720
<i>Could he be the reason why my master doesn't allow me to come to North Abyss?</i>

74
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,200
<i>Is there enmity between us?</i>

75
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,000
So, you led the breakout?

76
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
This little fox looks delicately pretty.

77
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,540
Go.

78
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,840
<i>Yes, it must be the reason.</i>

79
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,760
<i>My master is well-meaning.</i>

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,080
<i>I can't let this merman recognize me.</i>

81
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,680
<i>Otherwise, I'll get myself killed</i>

82
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,940
<i>and my master implicated.</i>

83
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,520
The merman said Lu Jinyan would be executed.

84
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
Why hasn't he done anything?

85
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,120
Did he find something?

86
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,180
General, I got news from Insanity Cave that someone took Lu Jinyan out of jail.

87
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,760
Prison break?

88
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,160
Who did that? Did they catch him?

89
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,320
I don't know yet.

90
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,200
I only heard that person offended the merman on Ice Lake.

91
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,320
He was taken back to Lingshuang Pavilion with Lu Jinyan.

92
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,760
Crime upon crime.

93
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,420
I do not believe Lu Jinyan will survive again.

94
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,040
Go to Lingshuang Pavilion with me.

95
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,040
Master, the escapees are here.

96
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,920
According to the jailer,

97
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,080
this fox took the lead.

98
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,320
I accept the consequences.

99
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,600
I did it all by myself.

100
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,680
Don't get others involved.

101
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
Who are you?

102
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,700
How dare you lead people to escape?

103
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm just a faceless Immortal.

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,520
I didn't mean to offend you.

105
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,620
You didn't mean to?

106
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,200
But you went to Ice Lake.

107
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,960
- Master.
- Master.

108
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,080
Young Lord Qing Yao has always been interested in North Abyss's business.

109
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,640
But General Qifeng has been unusually hardworking.

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm the supervisor of Lu Jinyan's case.

111
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,220
I should be hardworking.

112
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,840
Lu Jinyan is unforgivable.

113
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,520
Today, he committed another crime.

114
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,700
Take them to the execution ground.

115
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,680
You can't kill me.

116
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,620
Not only me, you can't kill everyone present today.

117
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,720
What makes you think I will keep you alive?

118
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,280
Well...

119
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,920
<i>North Abyss isn't afraid of war.</i>

120
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,200
<i>But we'd rather join hands with you against the enemy.</i>

121
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,480
You said North Abyss isn't afraid of war,

122
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,360
but you'd rather join hands with the Spiritual Masters against the enemy.

123
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,960
A man who said such things wouldn't be a fatuous tyrant.

124
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,140
Otherwise, you will fail everyone,

125
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,820
and betray North Abyss's trust in you.

126
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,200
How did you know I said that?

127
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,420
I heard about it along the way.

128
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,240
Immortals come to North Abyss to survive and live with dignity.

129
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,580
If you kill us without investigation,

130
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,560
you will deprive us of life,

131
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,140
and let down all the Immortals who're turning to you.

132
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,440
If we die here, you'll be telling everyone

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,920
that North Abyss is no different from Immortal Master Mansion.

134
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,920
Aren't you afraid of death?

135
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,460
You could easily kill me,

136
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,300
but I have faith in you that you won't kill me.

137
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,440
Utter nonsense. She offended Master and is unforgivable!

138
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,400
Take them to the execution ground!

139
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,000
Have I allowed anyone to touch him?

140
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,460
What's your name?

141
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,160
A'Ji.

142
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
A'Ji.

143
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,160
Your lives are saved.

144
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,740
Though the death penalty is exempted, punishment is still inevitable.

145
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,400
Take them to Ape Wing Camp to do hard labor.

146
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,960
Come on, go.

147
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,680
You guys work hard here.

148
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,280
Got it.

149
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,040
Hey, Brother A'Ji. You're just amazing.

150
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,760
You were calm and brave enough to make such a persuasive speech.

151
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,680
For the first time, I feel I'm really important.

152
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,760
I'm talking to you.

153
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,240
I wasn't brave at all.

154
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,600
I was so scared that my tail almost came off.

155
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,280
Brother A'Ji.

156
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,640
You just made an impassioned speech.

157
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,580
But what about now?

158
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,160
You seem distracted.

159
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,300
I just think it was not my speech that saved us.

160
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,680
Then, what was it?

161
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,400
Was it because of your name?

162
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,380
Come on.

163
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,680
My name...

164
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,100
seems to be exactly the reason.

165
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,540
Master.

166
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,140
Why did you pardon Lu Jinyan and Fu Chao all of a sudden?

167
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,200
Didn't you want to lead Qifeng into a pit?

168
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,960
It's all about patience and timing.

169
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,380
Send men to keep an eye on him.

170
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,920
So you did it on purpose

171
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,320
to let Qifeng feel guilty and fall into the pit?

172
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,240
Master, you're wise.

173
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,720
Leave me now.

174
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,880
Enjoy your tea, then.

175
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
Enjoy it.

176
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,500
<i>You said North Abyss wasn't afraid of war,</i>

177
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,120
<i>but you'd rather join hands with the Spiritual Masters against the enemy.</i>

178
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,260
<i>Big-tailed Fish!</i>

179
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,740
<i>I didn't expect the merman to spare us.</i>

180
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,060
<i>It seems he isn't that brutal.</i>

181
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,940
<i>But why did my master forbid me to come to North Abyss?</i>

182
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,100
<i>And those terrible dreams.</i>

183
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,400
<i>Are there any personal grudges between us?</i>

184
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,860
Come on, don't think too much. Come, be seated. Sit down.

185
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,120
Drink tea. Let's drink tea.

186
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,760
Come on.

187
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,940
Well, Brother Ji, since you're so capable,

188
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,620
could you help me find out

189
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,880
who set me up to take the fall?

190
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,360
If you can help me find it out, I'll give you everything you want.

191
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,580
I don't have time.

192
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,140
If it weren't for you guys, I wouldn't have gotten involved.

193
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,600
I want to get out of here and meet my master.

194
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,840
No, please help me.

195
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,760
Where will you meet him?

196
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,240
Nowhere.

197
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,080
Master, you must have a million things to do.

198
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Why did you come to this crappy place?

199
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,920
To drink tea.

200
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,740
<i>He comes here to drink tea?</i>

201
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,620
<i>Is he regretting not killing us?</i>

202
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,580
<i>Or did he recognize me and come to give me trouble?</i>

203
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,480
Aren't you going to sit?

204
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,980
Master, bathroom emergency. I have to go.

205
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,720
Hold on. Immortals never have such an emergency.

206
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,420
I... I haven't cultivated enough.

207
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,810
We... We haven't done enough cultivation. Yes, he's right.

208
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,700
Yes, he's right. Yeah, yeah.

209
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,020
Do you have an emergency, too?

210
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,360
I...

211
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,440
Can I?

212
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,020
You'd better not.

213
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,820
<i>Why is this feeling of guilt also familiar when I'm in front of him?</i>

214
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,720
<i>He must have been an enemy.</i>

215
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,980
In North Abyss, you're a newcomer,

216
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,000
but you're resourceful.

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,620
Who on earth are you?

218
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,720
You flattered me, Master.

219
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,340
I'm just a wild fox, slacking off all day.

220
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,140
My master's always saying I waste food.

221
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,620
So, Master, don't think too highly of me.

222
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,880
Your master taught you about this.

223
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,450
May I have his name?

224
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,900
My master...

225
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
My master...

226
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,820
<i>Look at my big mouth.</i>

227
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,400
<i>Now the merman is doubting me and my master.</i>

228
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,640
Master, I really have to relieve myself.

229
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,080
Why don't you wait till I get back?

230
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,480
I can't hold it anymore.

231
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,560
<i>Why don't I change back to girl clothes,</i>

232
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,740
<i>pretend to be an attendant and find a chance to sneak out?</i>

233
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,820
Master, why are you everywhere?

234
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,860
Can't you just give me a break?

235
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,960
You said you wouldn't run away.

236
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,300
What are you doing now?

237
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,200
I can explain.

238
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,000
I was going to...

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,840
North Abyss is preparing for war,

240
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,580
and we have no tolerance for liars.

241
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,300
Do you want me to send you back to Insanity Cave?

242
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,780
You're caging me again?

243
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,360
Do you have a mania for caging people?

244
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,340
You have such a big tail, but why are you so narrow-minded?

245
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,100
<i>Chang Yi, why do you have such a big tail and a narrow mind?</i>

246
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,520
How do you know about it?

247
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,760
<i>Oh, no.</i>

248
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,940
<i>I dreamed of his tail and it just came out of my mouth.</i>

249
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,360
Women's clothes.

250
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,200
You're a girl?

251
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,460
Why did you call me Big-tailed Fish?

252
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,800
How did you know my nickname?

253
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,800
I...

254
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,820
Who are you?

255
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,540
<i>Oh no! I'm done for.</i>

256
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,000
<i>My real identity will be discovered.</i>

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,060
I'm just a stray fox who got abandoned.

258
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,720
My master found me and raised me up.

259
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,120
What? Don't fish all have tails? Why can't I call you that?

260
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,260
Well...

261
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,300
These clothes...

262
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,519
Can't I have a peculiarity?

263
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,820
It's none of your business.

264
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,700
You're lying again.

265
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,820
<i>The Illusion Art I learned will transform me into a different person.</i>

266
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,740
<i>I'll use it in the worst case.</i>

267
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,900
If you don't believe me, examine me.

268
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,880
We're both men. You can examine my body.

269
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,900
Come on.

270
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,940
Touch me. We're men. Don't be shy. Come on.

271
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,040
Come on, do it.

272
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,040
I finally got away.

273
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,480
Why does he keep picking on me?

274
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,800
Master. Master!

275
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,780
Master, where did you go?

276
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,220
I was looking for you.

277
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,620
An elder asked to see you.

278
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,960
Master? What... What are you thinking?

279
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,040
That man named A'Ji. Watch him.

280
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,600
Let me know immediately if you find anything out of the ordinary with him.

281
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,500
A'Ji? But why... why should I watch him?

282
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,580
That merman is finally gone.

283
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,540
I'll think about how to escape tomorrow.

284
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,140
But from the way he looked at me, he didn't seem like my enemy.

285
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,100
And in his eyes...

286
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,980
there was no hatred.

287
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,600
But longing, like he'd waited for me for a long time.

288
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,280
Forget it.

289
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,920
When I leave North Abyss and meet my master,

290
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,620
I'll ask him about it.

291
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,680
I'm sleepy.

292
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,960
I'm going to bed.

293
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,360
<i>[Fairy Shunde's Manor]</i>

294
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,960
Master of Thousand Flower Valley, Lin Haoqing, is here to see Fairy Shunde.

295
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,120
Master, you've been kneeling here for days.

296
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,360
How about I take you back and kneel here for you instead?

297
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,060
Master of Thousand Flower Valley, Lin Haoqing, is here to see Fairy Shunde.

298
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,680
Master of Thousand Flower Valley, Lin Haoqing, is here to see Fairy Shunde.

299
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,940
You still haven't given up?

300
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,880
Immortal Fairy was merciful enough not to kill a dead dog like you.

301
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,940
You...

302
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,160
But you dared to come.

303
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,380
She's no longer a fairy.

304
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,700
But you look domineering now.

305
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,640
Master of Thousand Flower Valley, Lin Haoqing, is here to see Fairy Shunde.

306
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,800
Why should she see you?

307
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,020
Everyone in Thousand Flower Valley surrendered to North Abyss.

308
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,580
Who knows if you're a traitor or not?

309
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,920
If I surrendered to North Abyss, I wouldn't have come here.

310
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,200
Whether to kill me or not is Fairy's decision to make.

311
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,280
My duty is to show my loyalty.

312
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,320
Master of Thousand Flower Valley, Lin Haoqing, is here to see Fairy Shunde.

313
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,600
<i>Let him in.</i>

314
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,200
Yes!

315
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,300
Don't you want to show your loyalty to Immortal Fairy?

316
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,800
Here's your chance.

317
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,820
Please, Master Lin.

318
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,520
Master.

319
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,820
- Greetings, Immortal Fairy.
- Greetings, Immortal Fairy.

320
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,720
Now I've lost all my power, only to have this title left,

321
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,980
and can't even go out of this chamber.

322
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,340
I wonder what Master Lin wants from me.

323
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,240
No matter what happens, you're always the Immortal Fairy.

324
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,240
My loyalty to you won't be shaken.

325
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,000
In this case, I'll take your word for it.

326
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Master!

327
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,060
- Immortal Fairy.
- What did you do to me?

328
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,920
Turns out the spiritual power I cultivated

329
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,540
is not compatible with yours.

330
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,080
I feel terribly sorry.

331
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,360
There's more that you should feel sorry about.

332
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,800
You said you did what was best for me

333
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,420
and took 3,000 Spiritual Masters to North Abyss.

334
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,700
But all of them surrendered

335
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,180
and I had the most to lose.

336
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,040
And now you have the nerve to come to me!

337
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,320
Several Spiritual Masters were taken away by you in the human world.

338
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,440
Please return them back to me.

339
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,560
Lin Haoqing, do you want their lives

340
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,600
or this?

341
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Master, it's Jibai Herb.

342
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm not a fool.

343
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,440
This is what I found on them.

344
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,800
The Jibai Herb can resist great cold,

345
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,860
and the Frost marks are the coldest among all.

346
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,640
You wanted to use me against Immortal Master Mansion,

347
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,360
that'd be a good scheme.

348
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,200
It takes guts.

349
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,080
Immortal Fairy, you should know that the enemy of the enemy is our friend.

350
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,140
I don't need friends.

351
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,160
I only need them to work for me.

352
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,400
- Zhu Ling.
- Yes.

353
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,680
Drag them two and those Spiritual Masters out.

354
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,600
- Kill all of them.
- Yes.

355
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,080
No, Immortal Fairy. No!

356
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,460
Immortal Fairy, it's true that I wasn't selfless.

357
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,860
I'll take any of your punishments.

358
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,380
But please spare them.

359
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,740
I want Thousand Flower Valley to be safe.

360
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,800
My life will be at your disposal.

361
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,540
Why would Immortal Fairy need a loser like you?

362
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,920
If you need someone to catch Spiritual Masters for power,

363
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,280
I'm a better choice than Zhu Ling.

364
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,120
I still remember how high-spirited you were

365
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,960
when I first met you in Thousand Flower Valley.

366
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,920
Will someone proud like you

367
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,960
be willing to serve as my dog?

368
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,160
All living beings should be on their knees at your feet.

369
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,760
I'm no exception.

370
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,560
But I won't unchain a fierce dog just like Immortal Master Mansion.

371
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,960
Master Lin, if you want to save Thousand Flower Valley,

372
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,140
show me how much you mean it.

373
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,440
Master, don't! The Jibai Herb is fairly rare to be found.

374
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
If we miss this one, we'll have to wait for a hundred years.

375
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,580
Master Lin, your attendant is being disobedient.

376
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,520
Fine. I'll return them to you.

377
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,080
But remember, wag your tail in front of me.

378
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,920
I only keep the useful ones alive.

379
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,360
Yes.

380
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,360
- Master.
- Elder.

381
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,940
Master.

382
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,540
You've suffered, Elder. You too, everyone.

383
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,180
Master, the Jibai Herb doesn't come easily.

384
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,380
You shouldn't have traded it for my life.

385
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,900
It's not worth it.

386
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,600
That's not true. And I didn't destroy the herb.

387
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,060
You...

388
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,480
This... Then what about the one that Shunde destroyed?

389
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,020
That was a fake one Master made before he came to see Shunde.

390
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,560
I have to thank you, Siyu.

391
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,500
She provoked Shunde so I had the chance to get the real herb back.

392
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,400
<i>But you dared to come.</i>

393
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,360
So everything happened was part of your plan.

394
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,500
Yes. Shunde is being suppressed by the Heavenly King and Immortal Master.

395
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,760
Only guys like Zhu Ling are around. She needs men to work for her.

396
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,540
If I defect to her, she certainly won't kill me.

397
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,920
It's just she's bossy and ruthless by nature and likes to juggle others.

398
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,520
She wouldn't let me resist her control by resolving the Frost marks.

399
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,140
If she has the Jibai Herb, she wouldn't give it to me even if she destroyed it.

400
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,860
So I could only pretend to destroy it and replaced it with a fake one.

401
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,660
That was the safest way.

402
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,140
But we heard...

403
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,620
that you were disgraced by Shunde for our sake.

404
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,820
We don't deserve to have your dignity trampled.

405
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,700
Elder, nothing is worth more than life.

406
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,720
Master, now we've saved them, shouldn't we hurry back to Thousand Flower Valley?

407
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,700
I just showed my loyalty, and can't jump into action.

408
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,620
Elder, please take them to Thousand Flower Valley to recuperate first.

409
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,980
I'll stay and work on the antidote.

410
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,280
In the meantime, I can watch Shunde's every move.

411
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,880
Okay.

412
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,700
Sorry to put you through that.

413
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,000
Master, this trick was used by Ji Yunhe

414
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,120
to replace the Mirror of Love, wasn't it?

415
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,500
Why are you still holding a grudge?

416
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,360
I just feel happy for you.

417
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,780
You were devoted to the great cause and hadn't had a breather.

418
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,100
There wasn't a single day that you felt relaxed.

419
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,240
But now, though in a dangerous situation,

420
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,140
you finally have a twinkle in your eyes.

421
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,020
Probably because I know someone was waiting for me, I have hopes now.

422
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,500
I promised A'Ji that I would survive and go back to her.

423
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,020
I'll keep my promise.

424
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,180
Yes. I will also help you reunite even at the cost of my life.

425
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,000
You must be careful, too.

426
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,180
If she knew something happened to you, she would be sad.

427
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,600
I know.

428
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,180
<i>Lin Haoqing's gimmick could only fool Shunde.</i>

429
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,380
<i>Aren't you going to do something?</i>

430
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,240
As futile as an ant trying to shake a tree, his courage is admirable,

431
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,020
but what difference can he make?

432
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,100
The end has already been written.

433
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,320
<i>You're right.</i>

434
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,740
<i>Lin Haoqing is just as insensible and naive as his father.</i>

435
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,420
<i>But Ning Qing, Shunde is sending all the apprentices away.</i>

436
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,340
<i>Aren't you afraid it'll get out of hand?</i>

437
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,280
That will suit your wishes.

438
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,820
Didn't you know it when you got into her dream?

439
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,940
<i>You knew I saw her behind your back, but you weren't offended.</i>

440
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,340
<i>Instead, you are cooperative. I'm very touched.</i>

441
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,940
<i>Looks like we make a great team.</i>

442
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,420
<i>Besides, the Heavenly King has returned to the Heavenly Palace,</i>

443
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,580
<i>but those two are still in human world.</i>

444
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,300
<i>Once they find the mountain, our cover will be blown.</i>

445
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,360
<i>Get rid of them.</i>

446
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,040
My men are on it.

447
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,760
<i>Ning Qing, oh Ning Qing. You're the one who knows me the best.</i>

448
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,280
<i>But the apprentices of Immortal Master Mansion are everywhere, who have you sent?</i>

449
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,720
<i>Could it be...</i>

450
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,860
<i>You're pushing your luck.</i>

451
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,280
<i>I felt more relieved when you were a cat.</i>

452
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,680
<i>In the future, we'd better have a litter of kittens.</i>

453
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,880
Who said you could return to human form?

454
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,320
The bed is only this big. You deserve it.

455
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,680
Sanyue, I was wrong.

456
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,760
Come on, take it up with me. Pull my hair.

457
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,920
It's prickly. I won't.

458
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,560
Then I'll turn into a cat so you can pet me.

459
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,360
Don't try to make me smooth your hair.

460
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,340
Get up now. It's late in the morning.

461
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,800
We still need to inquire about information.

462
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,980
But I just fell off and hurt my waist.

463
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,860
I don't know if we can still have kittens.

464
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,460
You!

465
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,300
We've asked everyone in town who knows about the terrain, local conditions,

466
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,300
as well as anecdotes, but found nothing;

467
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,280
not a trace of the unknown mountain.

468
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,920
Sanyue, tell me. Are you sure Ning Xiyu wasn't wrong about it?

469
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,380
His Majesty will soon ascertain the truth.

470
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,720
We can keep asking around and maybe we can find some other clues.

471
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,500
Who are you?

472
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,440
Ji Chengyu from Immortal Master Mansion.

473
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,400
So you're Kong Ming's junior fellow apprentice.

474
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,160
Li Shu from Chongwu Mountain, and Xue Sanyue from Thousand Flower Valley.

475
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,960
You let Blue Feather Phoenix stir up trouble, and I'm here arresting you under Immortal Master's order.

476
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,640
That was ages ago.

477
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Even His Majesty let it go, but Immortal Master is bringing up old scores.

478
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,600
Don't bother to find a charge against us.

479
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,060
Take them down.

480
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,240
Li Shu.

481
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,400
Ji Chengyu, Kong Ming was wrong about you.

482
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,400
He was fool enough to believe that you'd clean up your act.

483
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,360
Let's go.

484
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,760
Follow them.

485
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,140
We finally got rid of them.

486
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,680
No one can match lynxes in escape.

487
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,380
How are you?

488
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,880
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

489
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,000
I didn't expect Ji Chengyu to be so blindly loyal.

490
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,880
They came here all of a sudden, so they must have found out that we're asking about the unknown mountain.

491
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,260
We should find a shelter first, and wait for His Majesty to return.

492
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,760
Okay.

493
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,660
Prince Li Shu?

494
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,160
Honey! Come out! We've got visitors.

495
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,860
Miss Spiritual Master. This is...?

496
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,760
Prince! Prince Li Shu!

497
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,580
Prince Li Shu!

498
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,980
Watch your manners.

499
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,200
Prince.

500
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,960
You still remember me after such a long time?

501
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,880
Thanks to your help, we got where we are today.

502
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,100
Though we met you only once, we will never forget your great kindness.

503
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,780
Come on in, please. Come on, Prince.

504
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,380
Come on in.

505
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,820
Be careful. Okay.

506
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,700
So Prince Li Shu is the one you've been hoping to see.

507
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,600
- Are you going to Daiyu Mountain again?
- Not this time.

508
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,420
We have more important things to do and need to find shelter.

509
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,819
If you don't mind, you can stay at our place.

510
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,519
Right, right.

511
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,420
It's dangerous. We'd better find another place.

512
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,360
How could it be more dangerous than when Prince Li Shu helped us?

513
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,320
- I'm not afraid.
- I'm not afraid, either.

514
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Moreover, no one can match lynxes in escape.

515
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,359
You learned my catchphrase.

516
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,360
Relax, Prince. Our place looks ordinary, but I've set up barriers around it.

517
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,939
Once danger comes near, we'll see warnings.

518
00:34:57,939 --> 00:34:59,380
Just put your mind at ease.

519
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,400
Then, sorry to trouble you.

520
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,700
- No trouble at all.
- Yeah, no trouble at all. We would love to help you.

521
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,400
Exactly.

522
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,400
I beg your pardon. Xue Sanyue and Li Shu escaped under my nose,

523
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
and now they're nowhere to be seen.

524
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,200
You took three gold talismans

525
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,000
and didn't capture them.

526
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,900
Yes.

527
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,000
Master, what are you looking at?

528
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,800
I'm looking at my favorite apprentice.

529
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,600
Sure enough, you've grown up.

530
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,600
You're not the same as when I brought you back.

531
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,600
I used to think that you'd never betray me...

532
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,800
like your senior did.

533
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,200
Master.

534
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,600
Everyone has natural sympathies,

535
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,800
but not everyone deserves them.

536
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,200
Some things can never be done again.

537
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,800
Remember what I said.

538
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,700
Don't disappoint me once again.

539
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,000
Master, are you busy?

540
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,400
I can report to you in a minute.

541
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
It's about A'Ji. Not that big a deal.

542
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,300
It's fine. Go ahead.

543
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,400
A'Ji works in Ape Wing Camp every single day.

544
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,600
That's all.

545
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,800
He didn't do anything else?

546
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
He swears at you once in a while.

547
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
But he does nothing else.

548
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,000
Master, isn't it a waste to send so many men to watch over A'Ji?

549
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,400
Ask them to keep watching.

550
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,300
You may leave.

551
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,800
<i>Master, the flower has withered,</i>

552
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,900
<i>but its spirit is still wandering in the world.</i>

553
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,000
<i>Be true to what you believe in, and you'll see hope.</i>

554
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,900
<i>Maybe thousands of years later, you'll reunite with an old acquaintance.</i>

555
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,500
<i>Sir, will the old acquaintance return to me like you said?</i>

556
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No one is allowed to go back if you don't pick up enough sticks.

557
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Don't slack off!

558
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,600
Brother A'Ji, why haven't you tried to run away these days?

559
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,000
That's not like you.

560
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,200
You think I don't want to?

561
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,000
Look. That merman had his men keeping such a close eye on me.

562
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
How can I run away?

563
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Will we be trapped in North Abyss and do hard labor all our lives?

564
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,600
That won't do. I have to find another way.

565
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,000
Don't look away.

566
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,200
I'm talking to you.

567
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,800
Go and tell your master that I need to see him.

568
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,400
Master, we're still not certain whether Lu Jinyan killed Fu Heng.

569
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,900
There are rumors in North Abyss.

570
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,400
Please give a decision soon to pacify the crowd.

571
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,000
Master, A'Ji asks to see you.

572
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Don't bother Master with such a trifle.

573
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,600
I'm going to see him now.

574
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Young Lord, you've been tired. You should rest early.

575
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,600
I already have a plan for Lu Jinyan's case.

576
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,500
You tried hard to avoid me,

577
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,700
but why do you want to see me now?

578
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,400
Looks like you've got quite an uncertain temper.

579
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
What? I'm only allowed to flatter you

580
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,900
- and I can't complain?
- Complain?

581
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,400
You've caged and punished me.

582
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,000
When are you going to let us go?

583
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,800
When have I ever said I'd let you go?

584
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,200
Anyone who has anything to do with Immortal Master Mansion

585
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,400
cannot leave North Abyss.

586
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,000
But if I redeem myself,

587
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,600
will you make an exception for me?

588
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,400
You're just a wild fox

589
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,000
who got knocked out by Master.

590
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,600
How... How will you redeem yourself?

591
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
What if I can catch a big fish for Master?

592
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,800
Get this straight.

593
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,100
Don't beat about the bush.

594
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,900
You can stay there.

595
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,800
Lu Jinyan said he was wronged.

596
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
The real murderer who killed Fu Heng was someone else.

597
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,600
I believe someone as smart as you

598
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
should have figured as much.

599
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,400
So, you know who the murderer is?

600
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,000
No debts without creditors.

601
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,600
We'll find out after we ask Fu Heng.

602
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,000
That's utter nonsense.

603
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,400
Fu Heng is already dead.

604
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,600
How can we ask him?

605
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,600
The Fus take over the bloodline of Xiangliu and have nine lives.

606
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,200
If we wake him up using this secret art, he'll come back to life.

607
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,700
I've got everything prepared.

608
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,800
Master, would you like a try?

609
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
I can't just give it to you.

610
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,600
Since you take the secret art,

611
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,800
you have to let me and Ji Ning leave North Abyss.

612
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,200
Trading our freedom for your people's hearts, that's a good bargain.

613
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,000
You're being unreasonable again.

614
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,600
Since it's a deal, I should check it first.

615
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,600
You created this secret art alone?

616
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,700
Of course not. I'm not that smart.

617
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,800
Ji Ning thought of it.

618
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,200
How is it, Master?

619
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,700
Do you want to trade or not?

620
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,700
Guards.

621
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,800
Take him back and wait for news.

622
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,200
You're caging me again?

623
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,300
From now on, they can move about freely in North Abyss.

624
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,400
Wait for my order later on.

625
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,900
You took my secret art away,

626
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,300
and you can't break your word.

627
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,000
Please go back.

628
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,600
Bring him away.

629
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,300
Don't go back on your word.

630
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,600
Go, go, go.

631
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,000
Master, what secret art is that?

632
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,300
Look.

633
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,300
A'Ji really can do anything.

634
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,800
Work on it in secret,

635
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,100
and don't let others know.

636
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,600
Relax, Master.

637
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,500
I'll find a few confidants and won't let Qifeng notice.

638
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,800
All clear. No one is stalking us.

639
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,400
Good.

640
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,900
Is it with you?

641
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,200
Everything you asked for is in here.

642
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
Will Master wake him up?

643
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,500
Just relax. Master tells no lies.

644
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,200
Let's start.

645
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,600
Buddy!

646
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,100
This secret art works well.

647
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,600
Brilliant!

648
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,400
Take Fu Heng back to Lingshuang Pavilion.

649
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Master needs to know what happened that day.

650
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,000
Brother!

651
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,600
Brother!

652
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,000
Qifeng, what are you doing?

653
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,200
What do you think?

654
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,000
Waiting for you to come and arrest me

655
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,400
when you find out the truth?

656
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,200
So it was you who killed him.

657
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
You did put on a good show!

658
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
So what if I did it? Relax.

659
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,000
You can reunite with him very soon.

660
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,200
So it was you who set me up.

661
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,500
Lu Jinyan. Why is it you?

662
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,400
No arts can bring the dead back to life.

663
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:24,400
♫ <i>Hey, if I weren't me and you weren't you</i> ♫

664
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:31,400
♫ <i>Hey, think more... think more</i> ♫

665
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,600
♫ <i>Hey, where are you going?</i> ♫

666
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,600

♫ <i>Hey, just follow the flow</i> ♫

668
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,000

to a bright place</i> ♫

669

♫ <i>Let regret not grow</i> ♫

672
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,200
♫ <i>From now on, you don't have to be scared of anything</i> ♫

673
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,000
♫ <i>Wanting and lacking nothing</i> ♫

674
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,200
♫<i> Like fireflies pursuing waves </i>♫

675
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,400
♫ <i>The uncatchable light</i> ♫

676
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:32,600
♫ <i>is left for one person to recall</i> ♫

677
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,400
♫ <i>The wind blows causing the flower petals to fall</i> ♫

678
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
♫ <i>Sand is washed away by the rain</i> ♫

679
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,700
♫ <i>I think you are someplace else, singing happily</i> ♫

680
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:52,000
♫ <i>Never again recalling anything about me</i> ♫

681
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,800
♫ <i>The flowers here are blooming once again</i> ♫

682
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,600
♫ <i>As bright as you are, in the blink of an eye, tens of thousands
of light years have passed</i> ♫

683
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:13,700
♫ <i>Have you ever seen this world as you thought it would be?</i> ♫
