00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,700
Master Fei Lian, what brings you here?

21
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm concerned about the Ganoderma and your safety.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm here to check on you.

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,000
Thanks for that.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,100
I heard that you'd left Thousand Flower Valley.

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,800
There were many things that were not available to me at the time.

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Anyway, I don't regret it.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm wondering what your plan is.

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,800
What's your suggestion?

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Heavenly King is pursuing the Great Cause.

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,100
It will be a tough journey.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,800
We are in need of more help.

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,600
You're known for your superb swordsmanship.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
Would you like to join us

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,000
and aid us for a fair and peaceful world?

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Well. It looks like they're talking business.

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,400
It's now or never.

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,600
Just make a match between them. That's all.

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,400
But there's a great age gap!

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
Forget about it.

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,200
Do you have some herbs with you?

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,200
Prince, let go. It hurts.

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,000
How dare you!

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Setting me up already?

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Did you really think you could hide it from me?

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
I've never seen anyone as good at acting as you.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Prince, it's for your own good.

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,700
Think about it. The lynx on Chongwu Mountain, isn't she beautiful?

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,200
And there's the hot leopard.

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Why do you have to stick to the jinx?

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,900
He has a point! You fooled us first!

51
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,000
You said that once that jinx was eliminated,

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,300
you'd go back to Chongwu Mountain and inherit the crown.

53
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,200
Now, that jinx has been deceived by you.

54
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Why aren't you leaving with us?

55
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,800
Jinx?

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,700
Exactly! Prince said you were a jinx.

57
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,500
You're the obstacle in his cultivation.

58
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,200
He also said if he didn't wipe you out,

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
he would be condemned as a sinner through the ages.

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,400
What's more, once he settled the scores with you,

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
he could be free and blameless.

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,900
There are plenty of female cats waiting for him.

63
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,200
Sanyue. Sanyue. Let me explain.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,000
That's the truth! No need to explain.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,700
Is that...

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thunderbolt Talisman of Thousand Flower Valley?

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,400
From now on, keep 10 meters away from me.

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Now you call me a jinx,

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,200
I shall show you what a real jinx will do.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,100
Sanyue!

71
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,800
Would you like to tell me about them?

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,100
Just ignore them. They're insignificant.

73
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,400
But I can tell that he is in deep love with you.

74
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
But he's being disrespectful.

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,500
He deserves it.

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,700
- You two!
- Prince...

77
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,600
Get lost!

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,600
<i>She enjoys sending me gifts</i>

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,200
<i>just like the old times.</i>

80
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,700
Master, I ordered this soft armor for you.

81
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,800
Would you like to try it on?

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,900
I have gotten one already.

84
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,200
You may save it for another general.

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,400
The armor you got looks delicate.

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm wondering who made it for you?

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,600
I would like to learn from her.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,300
It's by a random person.

89
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,800
It's far worse than the one you made. No need.

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
All right.

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Now that you've gotten one already,

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,400
I shall pack this one away.

93
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,700
I'll send it to you later when needed.

94
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:55,778
By the way, Master,

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm here to brief you on the preparations of the war material supplies.

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,800
If there are any deficiencies, you can bring it up.

97
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll arrange it.

98
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Young Lord. Sit down, please.

99
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,800
<i>I've managed to hold on for a day.</i>

100
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,200
<i>It's really exhausting.</i>

101
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,400
<i>I didn't expect that I'd be so weak now.</i>

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thankfully, Chang Yi didn't find it out.

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
You have shown up at last.

104
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Who on earth are you?

105
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,100
Why did you come into my dream last time?

106
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,200
You were in the way.

107
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,800
I come and go by the wind.

108
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,700
When the wind blows,

109
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,100
I sense it.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,100
So, it was you!

111
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,600
What are your intentions?

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm asking you for a favor.

113
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Now that you're so powerful,

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
why do you need my favor?

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,000
Only you can meet me. Only you can help me.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
What am I supposed to do?

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,700
Here, I'll show you everything.

118
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>- Senior Brother.
- Junior Brother.</i>

119
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,600
<i>Qing'er, let me introduce him to you.</i>

120
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
<i>This is my senior brother, Ning Qing.</i>

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,600
It turns out, Ning Ruochu was a senior to Immortal Master.

122
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,000
What I saw...

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What you saw is the past.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Back then, Ning Ruochu fell in love with Qing Ji,

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
which was opposed by the people in the world.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
So they went to Leyou Mountain

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
and lived in seclusion.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Later, Ning Ruochu sent a message to Ning Qing.

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,100
That was the first time Ning Qing visited Leyou Mountain.

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,000
There, he met Qing Ji.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,200
But from what I saw, they seemed friendly.

132
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,500
Why did they become enemies in the end?

133
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,400
Maybe their love was doomed from the start.

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,800
Later, their hideout was exposed.

135
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,400
Qing Ji harmed the spiritual master coming for her.

136
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,200
As the message spread out,

137
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,800
it got even worse.

138
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Later, Ning Ruochu got a message from Ning Qing

139
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,400
and met him in Thousand Flower Valley.

140
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,400
<i>This formation is the Ten Directions Formation.</i>

141
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Grandmaster Ning learned the formation from Immortal Master!

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,200
But Grandmaster perished outside Ten Directions Formation.

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,300
He didn't join Qing Ji in the formation.

144
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,000
Could it be...

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Right.

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,800
Ning Qing killed Ning Ruochu.

147
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Why would he do that?

148
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
They were brothers of the same sect!

149
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
That's all the supplies we have.

150
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
What do you think, Master?

151
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,400
I know I can trust you with the arrangement.

152
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,600
Master, where are you heading?

153
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
What's so urgent in the middle of the night?

154
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Please check on her.

155
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,400
What's going on?

156
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,000
Her pulse is getting weak.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,400
The backlash is hurting her heart.

158
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,100
Yunhe!

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Yunhe.

160
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Please save her. Save her life.

161
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,100
If you want her to live, leave her to me and walk out.

162
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,000
Do not disturb me.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,800
You can leave!

164
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,580
You can only meet me in your dream at your weakest moment.

165
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
But falling into a dream for too long, you might perish.

166
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
I must send you back.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,400
Why do you show me your memory?

168
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,300
Who are you?

169
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,500
You're the lady Immortal Master can't forget.

170
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Master.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,800
What brings you here?

172
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,400
I saw you leave in a hurry, looking worried.

173
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I was concerned about you. I came here to check on you.

174
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,000
What's going on?

175
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,900
Not a big deal. Don't worry, Young Lord.

176
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:07,900
Tell Qing Ji that it was Ning Qing who killed Ning Ruochu.

177
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,200
Tell her that Ning Qing must be stopped.

178
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Why are you doing this?

179
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,800
You can't hold any longer.

180
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Let me take another look.

181
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,700
<i>Towering aloof in this grand world,</i>

182
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,300
<i>enjoying the snow in the breeze.</i>

183
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,600
That was Ning Qing as a kid.

184
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,200
- So...
- You must go now.

185
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,000
Be sure to stop Ning Qing.

186
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
- That is my...
<i>- ...redemption.</i>

187
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,300
She's awake!

188
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,100
Finally, she made it.

189
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,200
Yunhe.

190
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,400
You frightened me! Don't you do this again.

191
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
I only took a nap.

192
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Why are you all here?

193
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
A nap?

194
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,000
You almost died in your dream!

195
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,600
The backlash is hurting your heart.

196
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,200
They'd think I drugged you.

197
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,000
I was too tired, that's all.

198
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,400
Calm down.

199
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,000
♫ <i>Hey, if I weren't me and you weren't you</i> ♫

200
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,900
Master!

201
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,400
♫ <i>Hey, think more... </i> ♫

202
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,100
Why did he kiss her?

203
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,000
♫ <i>Hey, where are you going?</i> ♫

204

♫ <i>Any fool looking up can't keep the light</i> ♫

205
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,700
Chang Yi!

206
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,800
Are you crazy?

207
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,300
♫ <i>Hey, just follow the flow</i> ♫

217
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Ma... Master...

218
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,800
Are you insane?

219
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,400
Lin Haoqing is about to attack the North Abyss.

220
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,400
How could you pass on so much spiritual power in your merman pearl?

221
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
How will you fight against the Spiritual Masters now?

222
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,800
You're asking for death!

223
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Passing on power?

224
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,900
You're saving Yunhe.

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,800
It's meaningless.

226
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,500
You tried it before. It won't work.

227
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,800
Chang Yi, are you crazy?

228
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,400
Take your merman pearl back.

229
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,800
I gave it to you.

230
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
You have to take it.

231
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,100
You have no other options.

232
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't cherish your life, all right.

233
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,800
But what if Immortal Master ambushes us?

234
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,000
What could we count on? The snow outside?

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,300
Fairy Shunde hasn't recovered.

236
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
He won't be here.

237
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,200
Fine. Fine.

238
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
You've made up your mind a long time ago.

239
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,700
Master of North Abyss, huh?

240
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm not worthy of you, Master!

241
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Do as you wish.

242
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Calm down.

243
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,600
Luo Luo, please leave.

244
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,980
- Should I stay here and...
- Just leave.

245
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,000
I need to talk to him.

246
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
All right.

247
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,300
Don't be angry.

248
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,800
- What did Master do...
- Piss off!

249
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Luo Suo, what happened in there?

250
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,500
Well.

251
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,800
Nothing. It's just...

252
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,600
Didn't you see the beam of light?

253
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,000
That was the merman pearl.

254
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,600
Chang Yi used it to save Yunhe.

255
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,500
Shut up! Shut up! Don't talk about it.

256
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,800
The pearl is inside Ji Yunhe now?

257
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,700
Don't you know about our situation?

258
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,200
Master is responsible.

259
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
How could you cheat him out of the pearl and waste his power?

260
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,600
What on earth are you thinking?

261
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,300
We didn't cheat him!

262
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,200
Chang Yi had given his pearl to Yunhe a long time ago.

263
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
It's his choice.

264
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,600
He only cares about Yunhe.

265
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,400
Chang Yi, I don't care about other things.

266
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,000
But this is not child's play.

267
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,700
Take the pearl back.

268
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,600
Child's play?

269
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
So, let it be child's play.

270
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
It's not your problem.

271
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,400
Why do you insist on returning it to me?

272
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,600
Are you thinking about bossing me around like Kong Ming?

273
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
North Abyss isn't for yourself.

274
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,000
We're all a part of it.

275
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,800
You have no right to teach me what to do.

276
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,400
You shouldn't turn back.

277
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,700
You shouldn't become like this.

278
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,600
Don't be obsessed with hatred.

279
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,800
What obsesses me was never hatred

280
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,200
from the very beginning.

281
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,800
What is it then?

282
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
What do you think?

283
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,000
Chang Yi, even though I'm about to die,

284
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm in sole charge of my life.

285
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
You shouldn't have wasted your spiritual power.

286
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,300
I don't want you to suffer.

287
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,700
You've cut off your tail. Now, the pearl isn't with you.

288
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,800
How will you secure North Abyss?

289
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,900
The way I secure it doesn't require a merman pearl

290
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,100
nor my spiritual power.

291
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400
Master, what on earth really happened?

292
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,300
Did you really give your merman pearl to Ji Yunhe?

293
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,800
Is she that important to you?

294
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,900
Young Lord, you should get some rest.

295
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,900
Yunhe. Good for you.

296
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,300
All right. I'm sorry that I frightened you.

297
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,600
Luo Luo, would you do me a favor?

298
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,800
What's that?

299
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,100
Please ask Qing Ji to come here.

300
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,200
Why are you looking for her?

301
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Talk about the good old days.

302
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,500
Father, I should have known.

303
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,000
I kept lying to myself.

304
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,800
But now... I cannot stand it anymore.

305
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,100
Chang Yi keeps saying that he hates Ji Yunhe,

306
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
but he cherishes her the most.

307
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,200
She's the most important one to him.

308
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,600
I cannot hold him back.

309
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,200
What should I do?

310
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,340
Father.

311
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,040
Father? You can hear me, can't you?

312
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,900
Father, please wake up soon.

313
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,140
Right now, you might be the only one to stop him.

314
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,260
You look lively!

315
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,000
So the spiritual power in the pearl does work!

316
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,260
If the pearl can prolong one's life,

317
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,520
merfolks should have been wiped out to make medicine from their pearls.

318
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,240
What do you mean? Can't it help Yunhe?

319
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,500
Just like Kong Ming's medicine.

320
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,040
Injecting spiritual power into the pearl can only make her look good.

321
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,220
Her life cannot be saved if the time has come.

322
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,660
Does Chang Yi know this?

323
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,260
Even if he does, he won't take it back.

324
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,660
Big-tailed Fish is so disobedient.

325
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,560
How will he fight Lin Haoqing? Is he out of his mind?

326
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,300
In my opinion, he's been crazy for a long time.

327
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,960
It's good that way.

328
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,020
Look at me, even if I want to be crazy,

329
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,880
I cannot find the reason.

330
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,760
Madam, I heard that Immortal Master and Grandmaster Ning were apprentice brothers.

331
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,220
Were they close? Was there any division?

332
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,060
Apprentice brothers?

333
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,780
Why isn't it recorded in the books in Thousand Flower Valley?

334
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,900
I never heard about it before. How do you know?

335
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,180
I heard about it from Immortal Master back in Congji Jail.

336
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,720
I don't think there was any division.

337
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,160
The two of them and Ning Xiyu grew up together. They were like a family.

338
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,620
If Ning Xiyu were alive, Ning Qing wouldn't have been insane like he is now.

339
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,200
Who is Ning Xiyu?

340
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,060
Ruochu's master.

341
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,080
She was the only female master of Thousand Flower Valley.

342
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,380
Master of Flower Valley?

343
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,320
Didn't you know?

344
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,980
I see.

345
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,460
Now that you brought it up, there must be a reason.

346
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,280
What do you want?

347
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,420
<i>What I saw in the dream is too suspicious.</i>

348
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,240
<i>Shall I tell her about it?</i>

349
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,420
Senior, do you still hold a grudge

350
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,320
for Grandmaster's absence in Ten Directions Formation?

351
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,100
Yunhe, you shouldn't rub it in.

352
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,760
It's all right.

353
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,060
To be honest, I hated him and blamed him.

354
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,200
But it's getting vague now.

355
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,560
After many years, I can finally laugh at the grudge I held.

356
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,740
I was kept in the formation for a 1,000 years.

357
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,640
Why should I keep my heart locked up?

358
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,060
That's right.

359
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,540
Live freely in a wide world with wine and snow.

360
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,380
That's satisfying enough.

361
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,520
Why should we be bothered by the past?

362
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,800
Senior, I'd love to make a toast with tea instead of wine.

363
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,980
<i>It took a long time for Qing Ji to move on.</i>

364
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,200
<i>I shouldn't bother her and ask her to fight with Immortal Master</i>

365
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,420
<i>for the sake of a foamy dream.</i>

366
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,900
<i>Fine.</i>

367
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,940
<i>The next time I met Ning Xiyu, I'll ask her for details.</i>

368
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,740
Now that you don't need my help, why do you bring me here?

369
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,160
The terrain here is steep and complex.

370
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,580
Spiritual Masters will come through the forest to save up energy.

371
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,640
I'm thinking about setting up a formation here and luring them out.

372
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,620
What do you think?

373
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,800
Are you serious about asking me for advice? You're determined to go your own way.

374
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,060
Your pearl and your power were sent to Ji Yunhe generously.

375
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,940
How can you win this battle?

376
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,400
Shunde's intention is to drain our energy using Thousand Flower Valley's troops.

377
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,840
Then, she can reap the benefits. We can't let that happen.

378
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,680
Thousand Flower Valley's troops traveled all the way here.

379
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,620
It must be against their will. That way, there will be a crack.

380
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,600
Are you suggesting peace talks?

381
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,200
Immortal Master and Shunde are scourges to our realm.

382
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,758
Immortals have suffered from being suppressed for a long time, but they are powerless.

383
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:55,120
Right now, North Abyss is gaining strength. Thousand Flower Valley is the leader of all spiritual masters.

384
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,060
If we can make peace, maybe there will be more immortals on our side.

385
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,820
We can wipe out the demons.

386
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,600
However, Thousand Flower Valley is too proud to cooperate with us.

387
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,340
To persuade them, we must attack them and drain their energy.

388
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,280
Once they let their guard down, can we negotiate with them.

389
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,780
So, even though I have an obsession,

390
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,730
I have never forgotten about my identity.

391
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,590
Thankfully, you are clear-minded.

392
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,720
I thought love turned your head.

393
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,120
Still, I must warn you whether it's love or hate,

394
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,620
the obsession with a certain person is not beneficial for the great cause.

395
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,900
But I haven't made any trouble.

396
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,320
Don't quibble.

397
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,520
What about you? Don't you love Luo Jinsang?

398
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,360
Haven't you done anything following an impulse?

399
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,200
We're talking about you! What about her?

400
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,560
I just want to tell you

401
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,880
that I can separate my private interest from my obligation.

402
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,400
And I know what I'm doing.

403
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,180
Why? Are you telling me that you still don't know if I'm the one?

404
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,000
Stop talking about the Golden Lotus.

405
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,760
It's a good thing you know it.

406
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,080
It's a lousy world. We can never be too careful.

407
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,160
With an obligation, I dare not slack off.

408
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
I cannot do that.

409
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,620
Sanyue, I only said it to fool Da Huan and Xiao Huan. I didn't mean it.

410
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,980
Nor did I talk about some cats.

411
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,740
They made it up.

412
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,620
I'm afraid that's exactly what you're thinking.

413
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,960
Of course not! I improvised!

414
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,660
Stay away.

415
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,620
Give me some time.

416
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,300
For what?

417
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,700
So I can think about us.

418
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,360
Since the day we met, joy and peace seldom come to us.

419
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,140
Maybe you got it right. I am your jinx.

420
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,300
Maybe, we shouldn't be together.

421
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,400
It's best for you to keep a distance from me.

422
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,460
That's not up to you!

423
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,980
You're the best for me. The best thing of all!

424
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,520
Don't you dump me.

425
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,180
Li Shu, just leave me alone, all right?

426
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,700
I'll talk to you later.

427
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,000
Please, stop overthinking. Okay?

428
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,880
That's not the right way to picture our relationship. Don't make it worse.

429
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,160
Thanks for your hard work, Commander Xue.

430
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,220
Master Fei Lian.

431
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,180
Nectar Ganoderma will be ripen soon. Heavenly King is concerned about you.

432
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,700
He sent me here to see if you need help.

433
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,020
Thanks, and please transfer my gratitude to His Majesty.

434
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,940
Li Shu has been bothering you recently.

435
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,120
Shall I send him away from Daiyu Mountain?

436
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,820
Don't bother. I can work it out on my own.

437
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,000
No need for this. He's far away.

438
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,900
You kept talking about keeping a distance.

439
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,460
But I can tell from your eyesight that you still love him.

440
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,698
So? You're forgiven him about the jinx?

441
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:57,960
It's just a joke. We've witnessed life and death.

442
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,700
It doesn't bother me.

443
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,020
Even if I was mad, I'd forgive him soon after.

444
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,060
Then, why don't you remove the talisman?

445
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,920
You talk in a detached way and ask him to stay away.

446
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,480
Is it... you're worried that something will go wrong with picking Nectar Ganoderma?

447
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,420
You're protecting him.

448
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,320
Why don't you tell him about your intention?

449
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,960
He's done enough for me.

450
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,200
It seems that I always take it for granted.

451
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,100
But now, I realized it and I cherish our relationship.

452
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,820
At least, I'll try to keep him away from the danger.

453
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,220
Once I get the Nectar Ganoderma, I'll remove the talisman.

454
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,440
I'm touched by your sincere love.

455
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,940
It's just...

456
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,720
Please go ahead.

457
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,080
It's just Li Shu is persistent in staying by your side.

458
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,020
He doesn't care about the efforts you have made.

459
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,480
Sometimes, what you have in mind isn't what he wants.

460
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,800
Whether you're good to him isn't solely up to you.

461
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,800
His feelings matter. Don't you think so?

462
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,580
Do you think I did it the wrong way?

463
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,820
It's your relationship. I have no right to judge you.

464
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,360
You know it better than anyone else.

465
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,920
Report!

466
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,840
Young Lord. General. Just as Master expected,

467
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,640
Thousand Flower Valley's troops are marching through the woods, unguarded.

468
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,940
Their troops have entered the formation we set up.

469
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,060
We're all prepared. Thousand Flower Valley's troops have been attacked in the woods.

470
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,160
No wonder he's the master.

471
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,580
All right, it's our show.

472
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,060
Wait. What do you want?

473
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,340
The enemy is trapped.

474
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,780
They cannot escape from us.

475
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,240
If we attack them now, we can wipe them out once and for all.

476
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,100
Don't!

477
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,000
Master ordered us to defend here and cooperate with the others.

478
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,100
How could you disobey the order and walk away from the post?

479
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,130
Behind us is the natural defense.

480
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,980
To attack or to defend, it's up to us.

481
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,960
It's now or never.

482
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,400
You can't go against Master.

483
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,280
Are you sure that Chang Yi is always right?

484
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,720
Uncle hasn't woken up.

485
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,160
We must fight for our glory.

486
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,320
Come on. Time to attack.

487
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,640
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>
- Qifeng!

488
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,260
<i>Chang Yi has been out for a long time.</i>

489
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,550
<i>Is Lin Haoqing being besieged already?</i>

490
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,300
Yunhe! Yunhe.

491
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,840
Thousand Flower Valley's troops have been ambushed.

492
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,780
They are trapped in the woods near the border.

493
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,760
Great!

494
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,130
As long as they're willing to negotiate,

495
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,240
North Abyss will be safe.

496
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,600
Lin Haoqing!

497
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,920
How did you lead the troops?

498
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,300
You brought us into a trap!

499
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,440
Thankfully, Lin Canglan already passed away.

500
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,780
If he found out you got Thousand Flower Valley into this embarrassment,

501
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,440
he'd be furious!

502
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,940
You!

503
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,820
This time, I volunteered myself to Immortal Fairy to be the observer.

504
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,580
This is your luck.

505
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
Think about it.

506
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,320
I'm the only famous Spiritual Master in the entire world.

507
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,380
Exactly. The observer's reputation is far reaching.

508
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,460
You handed over your territory and gave out Lingshuang Pavilion.

509
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,740
Everyone knows about your behavior.

510
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,320
How dare you!

511
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
She's my attendant. I will discipline her.

512
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,160
I have my plan for commanding the operation.

513
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,680
Don't forget, Immortal Fairy nominated me to be the commander.

514
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,240
Even though you're the commander, so what?

515
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,720
Immortal Fairy can dismiss you from this post easily!

516
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,540
She sends me here as the observer only because she doesn't trust you.

517
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,080
Don't be smug.

518
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,100
You'd better know what you're doing.

519
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,880
Or I'll report to Immortal Fairy and let her punish you!

520
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,620
Report!

521
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,200
Master, we've explored the area.

522
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,740
There are formations everywhere. We cannot move.

523
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,960
Besides, the potential breaches here are heavily guarded.

524
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,180
We cannot make it.

525
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,500
See? What did I say?

526
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,580
If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have ended up here.

527
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,040
You'd better listen to me and hand out the seal.

528
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,100
I can lead the troops and fight our way out.

529
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,200
I will not sacrifice my men for a mission impossible.

530
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,280
They all have a Frost mark inside.

531
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,600
They will die anyway.

532
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,700
Is there an enemy at the mountain pass in the north?

533
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
It feels strange.

534
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,020
No one attacks us but there.

535
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,860
A troop is attacking us from the north mountain pass.

536
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,380
Break out from there.

537
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,060
Lin Haoqing, are you deaf?

538
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,860
They are attacking from the north. You're asking for death.

539
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,200
Now we're trapped here.

540
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,180
North Abyss could have taken us over.

541
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,660
There must be something wrong.

542
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,500
It could be an internal discord.

543
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,100
Give out my order, break out from the north mountain pass.

544
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,400
We must strike them while they're celebrating.

545
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,680
Yes, Master.

546
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,740
Hold on!

547
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,120
That's too arbitrary.

548
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,480
What if something goes wrong? Can you take the blame?

549
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,640
I will take it!

550
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,940
Give out my order!

551
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,440
Yes, Master.

552
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,000
Chang Yi, you're back.

553
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,300
How is the fight?

554
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,160
I heard it from Ming that you stayed up all night. Waiting for the update?

555
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Anyway, I have plenty of time to sleep.

556
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,560
Just let me hear about it.

557
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,060
I heard that Lin Haoqing has been trapped in the woods.

558
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,720
Who will you send to talk to them?

559
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,420
It cannot be you.

560
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,380
Just let me go.

561
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,820
I grew up with Lin Haoqing in Thousand Flower Valley.

562
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,200
We're friend and foe.

563
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,740
In a way, he's my last family left in this world.

564
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,460
I'm sure no one knows about him better than I do.

565
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,480
Family?

566
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,900
I didn't know you were that close to him.

567
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,120
Are you plotting for Lin Haoqing to take you away?

568
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,580
I...

569
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,260
Master!

570
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,160
Lin Haoqing distorted the formation and got out of the woods.

571
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,360
How is that possible?

572
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,960
Where's the breach?

573
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,560
North mountain pass, Qing Yao and Qi Feng were supposed to hold it.

574
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,580
Qi Feng again! Being greedy and aggressive.

575
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,200
He didn't listen to Qing Yao and launched the attack.

576
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
The enemy took the chance and fought back.

577
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,380
Although our troops have withdrawn to a safe place,

578
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,080
the enemy has the upper hand now.

579
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,100
Where's Qi Feng?

580
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,620
He's been caned 300 times.

581
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,240
That's too easy for him!

582
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,580
Anything else?

583
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,200
Lin Haoqing sent a messenger for negotiation on one condition.

584
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,780
What's that?

585
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,800
To meet Ji Yunhe.

586
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,580
Who's the messenger?

587
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,440
Siyu.

588
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,000
Siyu?

589
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,180
Right. I should have told you earlier.

590
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,340
Siyu didn't die.

591
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,100
Lin Haoqing hid her away.

592
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,360
I thought he was too harsh on Siyu.

593
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,500
No wonder, it was a show...

594
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,000
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.

595
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,720
The point is how will we settle the attack.

596
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,600
Chang Yi, please let her meet me.

597
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,020
We can't afford the delay.

598
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,720
Bring her to Cloud Quarters.

599
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,320
Yes, Master.

600
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,680
Lin Haoqing.

601
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,860
Now we've broken out.

602
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,980
Why don't you take the chance and attack Lingshuang Pavilion?

603
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,400
You're dawdling. What's on your mind?

604
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,620
Fairy asked me to be the observer.

605
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,780
Don't you dare fool me!

606
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,440
We cannot settle this battle in a short time.

607
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,360
- You should know it better than I do.
- You!

608
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,940
Besides, the priority isn't the North Abyss.

609
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,700
What matters to Immortal Fairy is capturing Ji Yunhe.

610
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,780
I've sent a messenger to Lingshuang Pavilion

611
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,240
and asked them to hand her out.

612
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,420
What's the condition?

613
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,320
What will you do if they hand her out?

614
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,540
Retreat?

615
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,180
I'm telling you. That's impossible.

616
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,160
Immortal Fairy wants Ji Yunhe's life.

617
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,080
And she wants to destroy the whole North Abyss.

618
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,140
There's no compromise.

619
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,200
Lin Haoqing, you know perfectly what Thousand Flower Valley is to Immortal Fairy now.

620
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,360
If you screw it up,

621
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,240
Immortal Fairy will abandon you at any time.

622
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,980
By that time, Thousand Flower Valley will be doomed.

623
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,260
Master. Guardian Ji.

624
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,520
Siyu, just tell us straight.

625
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,220
What does Lin Haoqing want?

626
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,920
You.

627
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,900
Master wants no trouble with the North Abyss.

628
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,720
Casualties aren't what he wants.

629
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,740
As long as you hand Guardian Ji out,

630
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,100
we can agree to your conditions.

631
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,920
Is that all?

632
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,980
Right.

633
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Listen up and transfer my reply to Lin Haoqing word by word.

634
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,520
We've shown our kindness.

635
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,880
We wanted to cooperate with Thousand Flower Valley to wipe out the common enemy.

636
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,720
But you insist on standing on the wrong side and keep pushing our limit.

637
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,640
We will fight to the end.

638
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,560
Don't think about taking Ji Yunhe from me.

639
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,160
Nor will I hand out Kong Ming.

640
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,600
I will not give you anyone sheltered by North Abyss.

641
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,000
Yunhe, I've never seen him talk so seriously.

642
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,340
Even I want to refer to him as Master.

643
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,200
<i>Big-tailed Fish,</i>

644
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,380
<i>you've changed a lot.</i>

645
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:37,088
You've made your point clear. I'm leaving.

646
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,738
Hold on.

647
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:39,920
Leaving like this?

648
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,100
Luo Jinsang, it's not permitted to harm the messengers from your enemy.

649
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,620
Let her go.

650
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,980
I'll see you off.

651
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,720
Hold on.

652
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,200
She's a cunning snake.

653
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,620
I must follow her in case she harms us.

654
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,420
Let's go.

655
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,960
Chang Yi.

656
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,720
I know what you're going to say.

657
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,320
I don't want to hear it.

658
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,680
Well, what was I about to say?

659
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,080
You want to tell me that you are not someone who wants to be sheltered by North Abyss.

660
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,760
Ji Yunhe, I don't care about what others say.

661
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,880
But you, you have no other option but to take this shelter.

662
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,580
Big-tailed Fish, you have it wrong.

663
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,780
I want to tell you...

664
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,180
that I really like the way you talked to her.

665
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,959
You're tough enough to be North Abyss's master.

666
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,140
This time, I'm here to help you.

667
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,120
We've got a hard battle to fight.

668
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:18,660
