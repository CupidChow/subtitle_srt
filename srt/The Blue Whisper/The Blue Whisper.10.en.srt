00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,638
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,160
Young Master.

15
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,260
I must find out what your intention is towards Yunhe.

16
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,440
That's not your concern.

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,560
You dragged me in!

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,540
After the breakdown of the Ten Directions Formation,

19
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,240
you've been acting weird.

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,400
You kept talking about giving her a hard time.

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,120
But it seems that what you did meant her no harm.

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,100
It's the same this time. You had Chang Yi cut off his tail which upset Yunhe.

23
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,240
However, you saved her life once again.

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,060
Lin Haoqing, what are you up to?

25
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,540
What will you do if you find it out?

26
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,420
Make it clear today.

27
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,800
If it's not good for Yunhe in the future, stay away from me.

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,880
I won't believe you again.

29
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,860
You're trying to help her. Why?

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,420
For money? Or for power?

31
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,640
Must one help others in pursuit of a reward?

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,920
When I arrived at Thousand Flower Valley, weak as I was,

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,940
I was despised and bullied badly.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It was Yunhe who helped me, taught me secret spells, and helped me grow.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,660
What was in it for her?

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,000
She's my friend.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,740
I want to help her, wholeheartedly.

38
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,740
You can't help her by spying on me.

39
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,460
If you want to be helpful,

40
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,400
I can give you a hint.

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,128
What are you thinking?

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,020
Qu Xiaoxing, she's not the only victim.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,640
You, I, and all the Spiritual Masters have the Frost mark inside.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,240
With that, Father controls everyone.

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,480
Ji Yunhe included.

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,880
Do I have that, too?

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,320
Well... When will it strike me?

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,360
As long as you follow my father's orders,

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,860
he'll feed you the cure in secret.

50
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,860
That's why you never found out.

51
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,840
Why are you telling me this?

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,160
Father is spying on me.

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,878
The more I do for her, the more he hates her.

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,840
I need help, someone trustworthy.

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,600
From now on, come work with me. Okay?

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,620
Me?

57
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,540
Since you really care about her.

58
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,920
At least, we share one common purpose. Am I right?

59
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,500
Anyway, you're doing it for Yunhe's sake, I'll believe you.

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm in.

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,120
Young Master, I'm helping Yunhe for her kindness.

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,340
What's in it for you?

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,404
That's not your problem.

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,900
Does Yunhe know about your intentions?

65
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,180
In Thousand Flower Valley, the more you know, the more fragile you'll be.

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,600
It will kill you sooner.

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,700
Try to keep your mouth shut...

68
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,220
if you really want to help her.

69
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,360
Just remember this.

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,939
You're helping her by aiding me.

71
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:25,920
Only when I become Master of Thousand Flower Valley, will Ji Yunhe's life be secured.

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,700
Young Master,

73
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,120
Master knew that Guardian Ji attacked you.

74
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,140
He sent Guardian Ji to Shrillwind House for punishment.

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,159
He wants you to be a witness.

76
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,720
Stop it!

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,635
Father.

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,020
What's that for?

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,200
You know the rules.

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,100
Harming colleagues will be sentenced to 30 lashes.

81
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,680
Ji Yunhe is the Guardian. The punishment is doubled.

82
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,240
60 lashes!

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,840
The Red Tail can hurt one to their bones.

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,720
She can't take it.

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,700
It was Young Master who had the merman's tail cut off.

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,600
Yet, she attacked Young Master out of jealousy.

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,740
She showed disregard for the rules.

88
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,250
Master is enforcing the law impartially.

89
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,700
Father, Guardian Ji just recovered from sickness. The sentence is too much.

90
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,740
Besides, it was our match.

91
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,120
She did it for a reason.

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,140
Since when does sentiment matter more than the rules?

93
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,240
Haoqing, now you're here,

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,920
you shall finish the punishment yourself.

95
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,331
Qing Shu.

96
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,260
Just get it done.

97
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,000
It's way better than the confinement.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,720
Are you crazy?

99
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,360
I can't escape it even if you don't do it.

100
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,160
It's all my fault.

101
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,180
I owe it to you.

102
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,840
Continue. I can take it.

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,214
Yunhe...

104
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,420
Father, even Red Tail is broken.

105
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,500
It's enough.

106
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,980
Master, 60 lashes are way too much.

107
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,840
It was merely an act on impulse.

108
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,220
Guardian Ji didn't mean to violate the law.

109
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,500
She voluntarily handed the Red Tail to Young Master to show her repentance.

110
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,560
She sets an example for the whole valley.

111
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,980
Master, please reduce the penalty.

112
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,540
Elder Muze,

113
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,520
that's very considerate of you to defend Guardian Ji.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,740
Haoqing, get your wound treated.

115
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,460
It's only a scratch.

116
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,440
I don't need any help. I can treat it myself.

117
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,806
Fine.

118
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:06,900
The punishment shall end now.

119
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,740
In the future, let this be a warning to those in the valley.

120
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,120
Nothing like this can happen again.

121
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,360
You're dismissed.

122
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,193
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

123
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,391
Master.

124
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,380
<i>Haoqing isn't resolute enough.</i>

125
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,000
It's time for the final lesson.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,040
<i>Elder Muze used to be fearful of you.</i>

127
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,440
<i>I didn't expect him to speak up and go against you.</i>

128
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm surprised.

129
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,920
Don't give him the next dose.

130
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,480
He'll learn it the hard way.

131
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,260
He must be conscious of his real master.

132
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,440
Young Master has left.

133
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
It seems he'll take action soon.

134
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,720
That would be ideal.

135
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,340
To be the future master, he must be decisive and resolute.

136
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,940
I'd like to see what he will accomplish.

137
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,660
Still, I'm confused.

138
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,440
Master, you used to be fair in meting out rewards and punishments.

139
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,340
Young Master succeeded in cutting off the tail.

140
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,960
He lived up to expectations.

141
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,920
Master, why did you spur him with Ji Yunhe this way?

142
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,760
Ji Yunhe's cultivation is almost ready.

143
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,560
Haoqing must keep up the pace

144
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,160
so as to manipulate her.

145
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,640
I know you're upset.

146
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,960
I brought you some wine.

147
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,320
It will ease the pain.

148
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,620
Luo Jinsang is treating Yunhe's wounds.

149
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,180
You've done your best.

150
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,000
You saved Yunhe.

151
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,360
Only this time.

152
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,100
What about the next one?

153
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,160
It's a whip this time.

154
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,260
What if Father gives me a sword

155
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,180
and forces me to kill her?

156
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,420
Even if Yunhe was gone,

157
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,800
there will always be another victim.

158
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,020
Send a message to Yunhe for me.

159
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,420
I want to meet her.

160
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,020
What do you want?

161
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,100
I must correct Father's wrongdoing.

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,540
He has a point.

163
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,100
Only a strong man

164
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,060
can protect what he cherishes.

165
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,360
<i>Don't be afraid, Yunhe.</i>

166
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

167
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,100
Can't you let me rest for two days if the whip is not enough?

168
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,860
Are you willing to take the punishment for real?

169
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,340
I deserve it for being naughty.

170
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,400
You know it, too.

171
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,440
Blindly enduring it leads to a dead end.

172
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,500
Father is running out of patience.

173
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,700
Yunhe, I used to be a coward but I'm not stupid.

174
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
I know Father had Qing Shu push me down.

175
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
It was not your fault.

176
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,300
After being rescued, I understood that it was what Father wanted.

177
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,520
I was only following his will.

178
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,340
I thought I was the one holding the secret.

179
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,980
Turns out, I've been fooled all this time.

180
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,780
Since you already know,

181
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,280
why are you bringing it up to me now?

182
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,840
I made the merman cut off his tail.

183
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,440
It makes you feel like what you did was wrong.

184
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,660
So, you yearn for a change. Right?

185
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,000
You've been thinking about stealing the antidote and getting away.

186
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,880
If you weren't thinking about the merman that day, you would be outside the valley by now. Am I right?

187
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,000
Why are you speaking of this?

188
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,240
I want to join hands

189
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,180
and free Thousand Flower Valley from my father's manipulation.

190
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,880
I will grant you the cure and promise you safety.

191
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,618
Senior, what is this all about?

192
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:31,560
Father will give Thousand Flower Valley to you anyway.

193
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,300
Going against him isn't beneficial for you.

194
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,720
You're not the only one with the Frost mark.

195
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,140
Father can manipulate others the same way he controls you.

196
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,020
The Frost mark isn't widely known in the valley.

197
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,060
I want to settle it before it gets worse.

198
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,640
That's a grand plan.

199
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,480
But how do I know I'm not a pawn of yours?

200
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,280
No matter how sincere we were back then,

201
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,780
we have been fighting for hundreds of years.

202
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,900
We're no longer who we used to be.

203
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,300
To my father, you're just a pawn.

204
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,600
If we don't take this chance, once you cross the river, there will be no turning back.

205
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,620
Xue Sanyue is not by your side. You're alone now.

206
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,720
The only option is to take my offer.

207
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,540
I have one more condition.

208
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,740
What is it?

209
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,140
Once it's done, you can be the master of the valley.

210
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,420
I get to leave with Chang Yi.

211
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,660
Let me think about it.

212
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,840
Thinking about it? It doesn't sound like a sincere reply.

213
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,278
Consideration is sincerity.

214
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,700
Now that the merman training deadline is approaching, Father will only push us harder.

215
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,763
What choice do you have other than joining forces with me?

216
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,740
Last question.

217
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,960
Master is astute enough. And he has Qing Shu's protection.

218
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,540
We cannot match him.

219
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,900
What are you planning to do?

220
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,880
Spirit Tying Formation.

221
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,060
Are you talking about the formation we made up ourselves?

222
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,720
It was just for fun.

223
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,680
It has no solid foundation at all.

224
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,540
A hidden formation will catch them off guard.

225
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,820
That's the only way to trap Qing Shu.

226
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,580
So you are planning a surprise attack.

227
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,740
Say we do defeat Qing Shu, what about Lin Canglan?

228
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,380
Father has an old illness, and his power was greatly consumed in the Ten Directions Formation Rebellion.

229
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,840
I will figure out his condition.

230
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,980
Once we take Qing Shu down, I will go after my father.

231
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,820
Easier said than done.

232
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
Don't agree with him.

233
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,540
What are you doing here?

234
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,900
I'm worried about you. I'm here to check on you.

235
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,260
Thankfully, I'm here.

236
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,580
Qing Shu is the heir of the Qingqiu Fox Clan. Her spiritual power is unfathomable!

237
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,440
Besides, it's been a long time since the last time you practiced the formation.

238
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,600
I can't believe you actually want to use it to fool Yunhe into taking risks for you.

239
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,500
This alliance isn't worth it at all. You can't promise him anyway.

240
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,400
Luo Luo, we're not doing this for him.

241
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,040
It's for us, too.

242
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,360
But she's got a point.

243
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,880
This formation is not powerful enough to go against Qing Shu.

244
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,060
But if we practice diligently, we may have a better chance of winning.

245
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,940
To practice, we need a secret place.

246
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,038
What a coincidence!

247
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,320
Both you and I know the most secret place in the Thousand Flower Valley.

248
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,880
This is Flower Sea where we used to visit.

249
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,620
It's a remote place with a wide view.

250
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,780
If it's a secret practice, this is the perfect place.

251
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,760
Hold on.

252
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,580
Can we trust him?

253
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,220
Besides, you told me that this place was a secret between us.

254
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,740
Why is he a part of it?

255
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,800
Since we want to form an alliance, we must show some sincerity.

256
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,520
Besides, both Senior and I lost ourselves because of Lin Canglan.

257
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,460
It's a great place for us to face our identities and find ourselves back.

258
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,988
Let's practice.

259
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,220
Senior, shall we go back and get some rest for now?

260
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,200
We can practice later.

261
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,760
We don't have time to rest.

262
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,780
Is it about that merman?

263
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,700
Chang Yi... He's moving to my place today.

264
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,920
He doesn't know the way around. I shall show my hospitality.

265
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,360
Can't you leave the trifles to your servant?

266
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,978
Luo Luo...

267
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,360
When Chang Yi was injured last time, it cost Luo Luo a lot of spirit stones.

268
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,860
She holds a grudge against him.

269
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,967
Okay.

270
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,780
Stop staring at me!

271
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,580
I'm telling you the rule here on the ground is

272
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,720
we sleep on the bed. The fish tank is yours.

273
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,060
I've found this bathtub for you.

274
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,200
Isn't that kind enough?

275
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,640
But a room on the ground has walls and a roof.

276
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,143
My place...

277
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,078
Is that enough?

278
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,160
Why can't I sleep with Ji Yunhe?

279
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,540
Stop dreaming about that!

280
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,440
If it wasn't for my misadvice to have her share a bed with you,

281
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,000
Yunhe wouldn't have fallen in love with you at all!

282
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,240
And my spirit tones would still be here.

283
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,120
Anyway, you cut off your tail for her.

284
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,720
That's the only reason I'm receiving you.

285
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,000
But stop dreaming about eating those rare fish!

286
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
You have to pay

287
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,620
for everything in this room with spirit stones!

288
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,634
I...

289
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,500
What did I say? Pay for it.

290
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Cut it off! Stop being a miser.

291
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,880
Chang Yi, the encyclopedia is my gift for you.

292
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,040
I'll take you to a nice place.

293
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,730
Stay where you are!

294
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,060
Careful.

295
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,840
Losing your head because of him!

296
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,120
Is this what you are talking about?

297
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,660
There is nothing special here.

298
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,600
This place is one of a kind in Thousand Flower Valley, no...

299
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,942
even in the entire immortal realm.

300
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,900
Luo Luo always dreams about living on an island.

301
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,640
I'm afraid life there will be lonely.

302
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,280
But I don't have the time for flowers.

303
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,820
So, whenever the apprentices in the valley visit the human world,

304
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,630
I have them bring some vegetable seeds for me.

305
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,740
Seeds from the human world?

306
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,160
How did they grow here?

307
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,040
On arrival, they were all homesick; they were as homesick as you were.

308
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,280
Even Luo Luo asked me to abandon them.

309
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,700
Still, I insisted on taking care of them every single day.

310
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,580
I even talked to them.

311
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,820
Soon enough, they came back to life.

312
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,740
Homesick vegetables?

313
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,220
That's not the point.

314
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,840
The point is, you can believe

315
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,398
even if you leave the sea and come ashore,

316
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,520
even when you're away from your homeland and your family,

317
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,200
I'll be here for you, to take care of you.

318
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,320
I want to make you feel secure.

319
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,080
Do you still miss the East Sea?

320
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,980
Yunhe.

321
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,280
I'm a little hungry.

322
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,580
Do they taste good?

323
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,260
Let's share it together.

324
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,460
Were you burned?

325
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,820
Let me touch the wound. It eases the pain.

326
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,060
Were you burned? Does it hurt?

327
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,940
I'll get you some medicine.

328
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,000
You can use the healing spell.

329
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,440
It cannot be used for wounds in that area.

330
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,180
Why can't you?

331
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,760
Why are your spells so weird?

332
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,580
That's right.

333
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,280
We people on land just do what we want.

334
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,580
How did you find us?

335
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,000
Who else in Thousand Flower Valley likes vegetable fields as much as you do?

336
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,040
You always hide here and roast sweet potatoes. You never bring me here.

337
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,040
Here you are.

338
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,140
I found some novels about the sea.

339
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,280
It's a gift.

340
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,220
Kind as you always are, Luo Luo.

341
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,332
I'm sure you can find your Prince Charming.

342
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,720
Prince Charming isn't worth a few spirit stones.

343
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,960
I don't care.

344
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,040
By the way, Yunhe, it's getting dark.

345
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,844
Should you...

346
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,420
Chang Yi, do you mind going back with Luo Luo?

347
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,880
Where are you going? Can I go with you?

348
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,980
I told the others that you were resting in my place because of the wound.

349
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,320
This isn't very far from my place.

350
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,720
But it would be suspicious if you get too far away.

351
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,740
All you need to know is that once I'm done, we can leave Thousand Flower Valley.

352
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,282
Behave.

353
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,702
All right.

354
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,920
Why don't you tell him that you're going against Lin Canglan?

355
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
He can be of help!

356
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm worried that he'd risk it for me again.

357
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,740
The more you care about someone, the more you wish him safe.

358
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,380
I know you don't get it now.

359
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,340
But since you bullied him before, it's up to you to take care of him now.

360
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,240
As for my practice, you must not disclose it to him.

361
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,920
Otherwise, I'll confiscate all your spirit stones.

362
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,220
Yunhe, it took me a long time to earn them.

363
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,960
To love someone, you've sacrificed enough!

364
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,320
What a torture! And it costs so much!

365
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,540
I'll never fall in love!

366
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,500
That's better.

367
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,660
Time is running out. It's not necessary to spare your time for the merman.

368
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,340
What's insignificant to one might be vital to others.

369
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,420
I know what I'm doing.

370
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,780
What about Lin Canglan's condition? Have you figured it out?

371
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,020
After we depart, I will send medicine to him and ask about it.

372
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,283
Let's practice.

373
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:09,760
Father.

374
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,020
Haoqing, it's late. What is it about?

375
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm here to apologize. I shouldn't have offended you for punishing Ji Yunhe.

376
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,920
Do you have any grievances about what I've done?

377
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,800
I dare not.

378
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,200
As Young Master, I should be tolerant.

379
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,160
Although I lost it to her this time, she's not a match for me.

380
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,085
I shouldn't hold a grudge against her.

381
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,500
I decocted the herb soup for you.

382
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,430
Here.

383
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,760
Heaven granted it to you to cure your leg.

384
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,880
A hand wound will affect how you hold a sword.

385
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,100
I don't want that to be your weakness.

386
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,160
Father, your condition isn't very good.

387
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,160
It's because of the coldness.

388
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,797
Just leave.

389
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,200
Take care of yourself. I'm leaving.

390
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,915
Haoqing.

391
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,280
Never mind. Off you go.

392
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,460
How is it?

393
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,020
I've checked his pulse. His power is weak.

394
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,340
Good enough. Qing Shu is the only one in our way.

395
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,820
What are you thinking about?

396
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,100
Nothing much.

397
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,720
The way Father looked at me was complicated.

398
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,000
Are you going to be soft-hearted?

399
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,707
There's no turning back now.

400
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,681
We must carry it out.

401
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,520
Although Young Master has been acting indifferent,

402
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,080
he still cares about you.

403
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,220
Are you sure that you don't want to tell him the truth?

404
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,200
I must sharpen his mind.

405
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,220
Even if he hates me and fears me.

406
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,980
Young Master bids defiance to you.

407
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,740
The time is ripe.

408
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,020
Keep it a secret and he might strike you down!

409
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,360
He must learn to rebel.

410
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,440
Right now, Ji Yunhe is his only concern.

411
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,740
Yet he's softhearted already.

412
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,240
How could he shoulder the responsibility of the entire valley?

413
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,280
How could he go against that guy?

414
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,980
You can teach him later.

415
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,460
With enough time, he will take responsibility.

416
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,120
The strike from Blue Feather Phoenix harmed you badly.

417
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,440
I'll heal you now.

418
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,540
Don't bother.

419
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,060
You know about my condition.

420
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,340
Over the past years, I've used up so much power on Ji Yunhe.

421
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,020
There is no going back.

422
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,860
Fine.

423
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,300
Now that my shabby body is incurable already.

424
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,200
I shall give Haoqing a boost for the last time.

425
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,360
So, the final lesson you talked about

426
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,380
is not Ji Yunhe.

427
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,580
It's you!

428
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,580
To take that guy down,

429
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,000
Haoqing must not be unencumbered,

430
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,020
neither by me, nor by Ji Yunhe.

431
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,300
He must learn to be strong

432
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,880
and never disclose his weakness.

433
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,440
As long as I'm here, I won't let you die.

434
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,780
Won't let me die?

435
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,000
Who are you to me?

436
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,440
Sorry, it was undue.

437
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,960
Enough. Bring Ji Yunhe here.

438
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,380
I must make the best use of the only power left.

439
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,937
Yes, Master.

440
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,980
<i>Yunhe, hang in there.</i>

441
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,360
<i>Once we succeed, you'll never be tortured again.</i>

442
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,900
Once she wakes up,

443
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,880
give her the cure and send her back.

444
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,140
The next time will be the last one.

445
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm prepared for it. Nothing will go wrong.

446
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,660
I hope that what we've done for the last 100 years

447
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,080
will not go in vain.

448
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,639
Yes, Master.

449
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,380
What happened to your hands? Did you get hurt?

450
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,500
Not a big deal. I'm a Spiritual Master. It happens frequently.

451
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,980
What are you doing on earth? Do you have to hurt yourself?

452
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,760
So many questions.

453
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,700
Come on, it's time to eat.

454
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,300
You can see me.

455
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,678
Go back.

456
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,075
I want to...

457
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,320
Chang Yi, stop following me.

458
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,620
I will be back soon.

459
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,940
In a short time, we'll be free.

460
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,683
Wait for me.

461
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,580
Three days later, Envoy Zhang will come here to fetch the tail and the pearl.

462
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,960
Father will receive him on his own.

463
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,480
That's the best chance to split up Qing Shu and Father.

464
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,520
By that time, we can lure her to a secret place

465
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,220
and strike her together.

466
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,280
The formation is ready. But Qing Shu is agile.

467
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,260
If she escapes our formation,

468
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,980
we'll be taken down for sure.

469
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,020
That's between life and death.

470
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,919
We're only 50 percent sure.

471
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,980
The perilous challenge is always a close call.

472
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,120
We must take the chance.

473
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,020
Don't you go out! Yunhe gave me the order.

474
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,880
Don't make it hard for me.

475
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,800
You can't stop me with your power.

476
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,400
The scale powder of the Phantom Butterfly is very powerful!

477
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,620
Even a tiny bit is enough to put a giant beast to sleep.

478
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,140
Don't make me...

479
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,984
go against you.

480
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,080
It nearly slipped my mind.

481
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,400
You're a merman. You don't need spirit stones.

482
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,860
You can produce pearls yourself!

483
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,940
Stop hiding it from me.

484
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,600
What is Ji Yunhe doing every day?

485
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,320
Tell me, and it's yours.

486
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,040
But Yunhe made it clear that I must not disclose it to you!

487
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,720
But she didn't say that I couldn't nod or shake my head if you ask me questions.

488
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,680
Lin Haoqing gave out the word to tame me,

489
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,360
but he never showed up again.

490
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,820
Did Yunhe hold him back?

491
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,560
Did Yunhe make a deal with Lin Haoqing?

492
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,240
Is she going out every night to meet Lin Haoqing?

493
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,400
She's tired every time she gets back

494
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,220
with wounds on her body.

495
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,160
Is Lin Haoqing taking advantage of her

496
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,320
in exchange for my safety?

497
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,840
Lin Haoqing used force to have Yunhe give herself to him?

498
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,960
No!

499
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,640
What are you talking about?

500
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
Where did you pick up that wording?

501
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,420
Where on earth is Yunhe?

502
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,560
I have no idea.

503
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,740
I'll go after her.

504
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,686
Don't you go to Flower Sea!

505
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,720
Come on.

506
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,040
You'd better go to sleep.

507
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,540
Flower Sea...

508
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,480
You used to be devoted, Senior.

509
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,680
What's bothering you today?

510
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,660
So much for today.

511
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,280
Is there something you want to say to me?

512
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,680
Qu Xiaoxing is hiding away from me.

513
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,040
I heard that he works for you now.

514
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,720
Are you mad at me for taking your apprentice?

515
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,300
Why would I?

516
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,220
It's his choice.

517
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,840
I can't tie him up.

518
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,140
But you may transfer my message that I will always take him as my friend.

519
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,960
Just like the way we are.

520
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,340
Your hands are hurt.

521
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,220
Was it during our practice?

522
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,080
It's just a scratch.

523
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,440
The battle is approaching. We must take everything seriously.

524
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,330
Let me patch it up.

525
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,600
Don't you touch him!

526
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,960
You don't have to give yourself to him.

527
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,420
He can't harm you.

528
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,700
Chang Yi, I can explain.

529
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,480
It's not like that.

530
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,440
We were discussing things.

531
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,980
It's between Yunhe and me.

532
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,100
It has nothing to do with you.

533
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,428
What could you do with him?

534
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:23,480
It's about Lin Canglan.

535
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,620
Are you going against Lin Canglan with him?

536
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,580
Why didn't you tell me about it?

537
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,680
I can lend you a hand.

538
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,362
You're not qualified.

539
00:38:31,362 --> 00:38:34,870
Senior, that's between Chang Yi and me.

540
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,340
Please don't mind us.

541
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,840
You should get some rest soon.

542
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,700
Chang Yi, let's go back first.

543
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,060
You'll find it out anyway.

544
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,900
We should talk about it.

545
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,624
Chang Yi.

546
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,260
Chang Yi! Are you hungry? Are you tired?

547
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,640
Would you like a roasted sweet potato?

548
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,900
I'm not hungry. I don't want to eat.

549
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,860
I want you to explain.

550
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,300
It's not a big deal.

551
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,520
I asked Luo Luo to keep it secret from you.

552
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,180
Lin Canglan is my nightmare.

553
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,900
I must face him myself.

554
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,860
If nothing goes wrong,I will tell you everything.

555
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,500
But the chance is only 50-50 by now.

556
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,640
I don't want to drag you in.

557
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,040
Why?

558
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,640
Don't you think that I can help you?

559
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,360
I do!

560
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,438
But I'm afraid at the same time.

561
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,460
I'm afraid that you'd sacrifice yourself for me.

562
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,860
You've done a lot for me.

563
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,560
I just want you to be safe.

564
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Even if I can't make it out,

565
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,260
I will not have you chained in Thousand Flower Valley.

566
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,780
Yunhe, that's not right.

567
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,880
As a merman, we never leave our partner behind,

568
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,780
not even when facing a powerful enemy.

569
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,320
But what you're doing now

570
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,980
is giving up your interest for my good.

571
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,662
Chang Yi,

572
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,080
if you're involved in this,

573
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,998
we might die together.

574
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,700
Aren't you afraid?

575
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,820
Not at all!

576
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,240
Share weal and woe,

577
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,700
for good or for worse,

578
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,680
that's what partners do.

579
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,960
Even if it's death, if we face it together,

580
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,140
there's nothing to be afraid of.

581
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,983
I see.

582
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:33,680
I was wrong.

583
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,520
We've gone through the obstacles.

584
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,720
We've had a great time.

585
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,965
As long as we're together, there's nothing to be afraid of.

586
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,840
Besides, it's 50-50 for you and for me.

587
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,080
Count me in, and it's a safe bet.

588
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,700
It seems that your smart little melon head has come up with something.

589
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,240
In the sea, I'm the best hunter in my tribe.

590
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,640
I'm more experienced in hunting than you guys.

591
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,120
I have a plan.

592
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,860
What's that?

593
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,838
However, I don't like Lin Haoqing.

594
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,140
I'm here to help you, not him.

595
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,800
Chang Yi, for a merman with a wide tail,

596
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,620
you're really narrow-minded!

597
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,760
By the way, I have a gift for you.

598
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,800
The original plan was to send it after we get out.

599
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,380
I will give it to you now

600
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,720
only if you calm down right away.

601
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,431
A gift?

602
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,200
Open your eyes.

603
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,200
How is it?

604
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
I asked Fairy Weaver to make you this suit.

605
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,460
Once we escape to Immortal Island, everyone will know that we're together.

606
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,260
Let me take a look.

607
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,720
Do you like it?

608
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,140
Very much!

609
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,780
Once we get out, we can pay for nicer clothes!

610
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,000
Don't bother. I'm good-looking enough.

611
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,369
All suits look good on me.

612
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:10,800
Big-tailed Fish, since when did you start bragging?

613
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,800
The first time we met, you said I was good-looking. Isn't that right?

614
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,432
It makes sense.

615
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,180
Yunhe.

616
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,000
Well, that petting healing spell,

617
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,880
I think I understand it.

618
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,460
Understand what?

619
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,620
When you practice the formation with Lin,

620
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,720
you should not cast it to him if he is hurt.

621
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,400
- Okay.
- Not to Qu Xiaoxing either.

622
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,920
Not to Luo Luo, either.

623
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,020
All right. That spell belongs to you alone.
