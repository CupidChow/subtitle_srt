Luo Luo, I found the antidote.

14
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,980
We got the antidote.

15
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,360
Antidote?

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,540
What antidote?

17
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,480
Xiaoxing, here.

18
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,060
Take these antidotes.

19
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,540
When the thing is settled, find an opportunity to escape out of the valley.

20
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,739
When we meet then, I'll tell you all about it.

21
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,580
Leave now.

22
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,220
Luo Luo, take this antidote and wait for me outside.

23
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,700
What about you?

24
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,920
Chang Yi is still in Reflect Cave.

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,140
I promised him to leave together. I can't go back on my word.

26
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,660
Again…

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,420
I'll stay with you. I can help you.

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,740
Luo Luo, the antidote and spirit stones have all been given to you.

29
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,300
You have to find a safe place to hide, so that I can rest assured.

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,960
- But…
- Luo Luo, be a good girl.

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,180
Then you must come back safely.

32
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,620
If you break your word, I'll kill my way back to take you away.

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,460
Master Qing.

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Xue Sanyue, what are you waiting for?

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,320
You have Li Shu's elixir, kill him.

36
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,940
You're dead.

37
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,020
Ning Ruochu, you dared to trick me into the formation.

38
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,680
Why didn't you have the guts to wait for me to come out alive?

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,200
How dare you imitate him?

40
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,320
It's impossible to break the Ten Directions Formation overnight.

41
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,530
How long did it take you

42
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,600
to find the ten array eyes in Thousand Flower Valley?

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,920
Sanyue.

44
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,000
You approached me for her, right?

45
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,400
You gave up your life to save her,

46
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,860
and also gave me up.

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,979
You made me look like a joke.

48
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,600
Go to your Master Qing.

49
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,340
Father.

50
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,300
Are you okay, Sanyue?

51
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,060
Hold on.

52
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,760
Ten Directions Formation is almost completed.

53
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,320
Sorry, Sanyue.

54
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,740
Master Qing, take her away.

55
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,920
There's no fun in this place anymore.

56
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,180
The Ten Directions Formation is almost completed.

57
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,360
You can't leave.

58
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,040
What can a broken formation do to me?

59
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,200
Chase!

60
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Yes.

61
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,380
<i>Oh no. Lin Canglan probably restarted the formation.</i>

62
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,960
<i>Doesn't this place happen to be one of the array eyes of the formation?</i>

63
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,320
<i>Could Big-tailed Fish be so stupid to wait for me inside?</i>

64
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,780
Chang Yi.

65
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,900
Danger.

66
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,420
Run!

67
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,600
Hurry up!

68
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,540
The barrier is broken, why didn't you run away?

69
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,900
You told me to wait for you here.

70
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,880
You stupid fish.

71
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,440
<i>Xue and Blue Feather Phoenix.</i>

72
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,400
<i>Where is Li Shu?</i>

73
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
<i>Is he…</i>

74
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,140
Let's go.

75
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,420
Chang Yi.

76
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,880
Ji Yunhe.

77
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,820
Chang Yi.

78
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,760
Chang Yi. Chang Yi.

79
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,300
Get up.

80
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,560
Chang Yi, why did you block that blow for me?

81
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,860
I didn't want you to get hurt.

82
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,300
Why can't I use spiritual power?

83
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,100
<i>He is so badly injured that it should be cured in time.</i>

84
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,700
<i>I need to find some water so that he can warm up and heal.</i>

85
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Does the wound hurt?

86
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Yes.

87
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,500
But it's good that you're fine.

88
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
What does this mean?

89
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
It's a special spell I learned from Earth...

90
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,700
that can make the injured person feel better.

91
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,400
A gentle touch can heal me?

92
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,500
Yes. A gentle touch can heal.

93
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,400
But I'm not healed now.

94
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
You will be healed.

95
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,500
What a long spell.

96
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Chang Yi, I can't use my spiritual power here.

97
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,000
And I don't have anything with me to help you heal.

98
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
I'll go to look around.

99
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,700
Even just finding some water

100
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,600
to give you some strength will be fine.

101
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
You stay here until I get back

102
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
and don't move. Okay?

103
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,400
Yunhe, it's so foggy here.

104
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
I'm afraid you won't be able to come back.

105
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Let me go with you.

106
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Here.

107
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
You hold on to this end.

108
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,800
When I find water,

109
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,100
I can follow this thread back.

110
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
You know what?

111
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,800
Connected by a red thread,

112
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,200
a thousand-mile marriage can be tied together,

113
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,400
and we can grow old together, hand in hand.

114
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,800
As long as we are tied together,

115
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,300
we will not get lost.

116
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,100
So whether I can come back,

117
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,800
whether I can live to be old,

118
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,600
it's up to you.

119
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,600
What a big pool.

120
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
Not to mention healing Chang Yi,

121
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
even bathing is enough.

122
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,900
Master, Spiritual Masters chased the phoenix with all their might,

123
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,000
but she still escaped.

124
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,400
Should we report it to Immortal Master Mansion?

125
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,600
If they know that the phoenix escaped,

126
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,000
they will certainly blame us for being incompetent.

127
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,400
At that time,

128
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,600
no one in the valley will be able to escape punishment.

129
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,200
Send more people to capture her.

130
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,900
No one is allowed to reveal the escape of the Blue Feather Phoenix.

131
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,400
We should stay calm,

132
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
our master must have a method to turn things around.

133
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,200
Now, Master is in seclusion

134
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,800
and Fairy is in charge.

135
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,600
If we can successfully tame the merman,

136
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Fairy will be happy,

137
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,800
then this matter can be subsided.

138
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,300
All right, go back.

139
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,400
<i>Yes.</i>

140
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Master, the merman in the cave is gone,

141
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,900
and so is Ji Yunhe.

142
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,100
Master, are you not feeling well?

143
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,400
Did you get hurt?

144
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Qing Shu, send more people to search for them.

145
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,900
We must find them.

146
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,200
- Hurry.
- Yes.

147
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's almost the last step.

148
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,400
Why did this happen at such a time?

149
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yunhe, after soaking in the water, my wound doesn't hurt anymore.

150
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
A little more medicine will heal it.

151
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,300
So fast.

152
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,100
It's true that good-looking people are suitable for any clothes.

153
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,400
The old clothes that I found casually

154
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
are so suitable for you.

155
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
That's not right.

156
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Didn't you just soak in water?

157
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
How come there's no water on you?

158
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
Why is there water?

159
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,200
We, mermen, love cleanliness and care about appearance.

160
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,600
After coming out of the water,

161
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,800
our clothes and hair are no longer wet.

162
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,400
Fastidious.

163
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
Do you want to soak in the water?

164
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,800
I can help you bathe.

165
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,200
No, no need.

166
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,400
I... I have to clean up the house.

167
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,200
Did you make all those?

168
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,400
I found them from that cabinet.

169
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
That's strange.

170
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,000
Blue Feather Phoenixwas imprisoned in the Ten Directions Formation,

171
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This place is not horrible, but a paradise.

172
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,200
Could it be that when she was imprisoned here,

173
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
she created a new world for herself?

174
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,600
Blue Feather Phoenix?

175
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,700
- She is...
- When I was in the sea,

176
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
I seem to have heard of her.

177
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,400
She is quite powerful, right?

178
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
She had been imprisoned here for 1,000 years.

179
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,000
Then, will we meet her here?

180
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,600
No. She's escaped.

181
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
So it was all because of her just now?

182
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Yes.

183
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,600
The whole Thousand Flower Valley is in chaos because of her.

184
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,400
She is quite powerful.

185
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
By the way, Yunhe, how are Li Shu and Xue Sanyue now?

186
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,800
Lin Haoqing said that their love was discovered,

187
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
so they would be punished.

188
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,200
<i>We made an appointment to escape together,</i>

189
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,600
<i>but now Li Shu and Xue Sanyue...</i>

190
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,800
<i>Forget it. This silly fish has nothing to do with these things.</i>

191
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
<i>There's no need to bother him more.</i>

192
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,000
They're fine now.

193
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,700
All has been settled.

194
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,000
You helped them out?

195
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Then you're great, too.

196
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,000
This is for you.

197
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,300
Where did you get the flower?

198
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,000
Li Shu gave me flower seeds.

199
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,400
He said women would look good with flowers.

200
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,400
<i>Li Shu and Xue Sanyue also fell in love with flowers,</i>

201
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,600
<i>but they ended like that.</i>

202
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,400
<i>This flower looks really ironic now.</i>

203
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
This flower can neither be used as a spirit stone

204
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,500
nor can it be eaten.

205
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,000
You might as well give me some ganoderma,

206
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,200
I might be happier.

207
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Okay, then I'll plant ganoderma lucidum for you.

208
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,500
Right now, the most important thing is to escape,

209
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,600
don't think about anything else.

210
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,000
You are here to recover from your injuries. I'll go out to explore the way.

211
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,700
Big-tailed Fish, if there is any attack in the future,

212
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,000
you don't have to block for me.

213
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,400
If you are in danger,

214
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,800
I may not risk my life to save you.

215
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,000
Is this the place where Xue Sanyue and Li Shu met privately?

216
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes.

217
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,500
I'm afraid that they were already in love.

218
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,800
Li Shu tried to find the eyes of the formation,

219
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,400
which led to the escape of Blue Feather Phoenix.

220
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,100
This is my fault, I ask for your punishment.

221
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,400
It's a serious crime in the valley for a Spiritual Master

222
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
to fall in love with an Earth Immortal.

223
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
Why didn't you cut down the tree?

224
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,900
Qing Shu, you've been in charge of the laws for many years,

225
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,400
and you have never shown mercy.

226
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,600
Since when did you have compassion for those who break the rules?

227
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,900
It's my fault.

228
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,800
I'll ask someone to cut down this tree.

229
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
Forget it.

230
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,200
Keep this tree.

231
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,400
It's good to make it a warning

232
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,300
to let everyone remember that

233
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,400
there are some things that can be thought about,

234
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,000
but never done.

235
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,700
Get up.

236
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
I understand.

237
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,400
I know my duty.

238
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,700
Your Master, Ji Yunhe and the merman escaped together.

239
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,600
I'm worried that there is also affections between them.

240
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,800
If so, that might not be a bad thing.

241
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,000
Where there is desire, there is weakness. Isn't that so?

242
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
I am just worried that

243
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,300
what if Young Master has the same weakness?

244
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,000
<i>Ji Yunhe, you and Chang Yi started with lies.</i>

245
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
<i>How is it any different from Li Shu?</i>

246
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,200
<i>If one day the lie is exposed,</i>

247
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,200
<i>Chang Yi will hate you as much as Xue Sanyue.</i>

248
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
<i>How should you face his affection?</i>

249
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,800
<i>Since there may not be results,</i>

250
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,200
<i>then there is no need to start.</i>

251
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
Forget it.

252
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,200
Anyway, after leaving Thousand Flower Valley,

253
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,400
we have to go our separate ways.

254
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,800
He will return to the sea,

255
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,600
and I'll go to the North.

256
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,400
Since our roads ahead are different,

257
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,000
it's better to break his dependence on me early.

258
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Making it clear can make a happy break.

259
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
I should no longer be gentle to him,

260
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,600
and no longer be soft-hearted to him.

261
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,500
<i>Yunhe! Yunhe!</i>

262
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,600
<i>Yunhe!</i>

263
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,400
What's wrong?

264
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,600
Why are you naked?

265
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,800
I was going to apply the medicine,

266
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,000
but it slipped from my hand and broke.

267
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Do you know what medicine it is? Just rubbing it on.

268
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,800
Come here.

269
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,900
Sit down.

270
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,000
I can't just ignore you.

271
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,500
It's my fault. I shouldn't have taken care of you so well before.

272
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,400
Do you know what medicine it is?

273
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Just rubbing it on.

274
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,000
Don't talk like me.

275
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
I have experienced many battles.

276
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,400
Of course, I know what a vulnerary herb smells like.

277
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,200
Yunhe, you're weird, too.

278
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,000
You say one thing, but you do another.

279
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,000
I mean I won't risk my life to save you.

280
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,400
There is no point in putting on some medicine.

281
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,600
Okay.

282
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
Put your clothes on.

283
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,000
It's getting late, so let's go to bed.

284
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,600
Wait!

285
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
We can't sleep together.

286
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,000
Why?

287
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,400
A man and a woman shouldn't be close to each other.

288
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,200
Since you are on land, you have to follow the rules of the land.

289
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,000
Didn't we sleep together before?

290
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,400
You have a smell now.

291
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
There is no smell.

292
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
Then you can sleep in the house,

293
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
I'll go out to sleep.

294
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,800
It's so cold outside.

295
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,000
I'll go out, and you sleep inside.

296
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
Forget it, let's both sleep here,

297
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
but only for one night.

298
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,400
Okay.

299
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,600
Come on.

300
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,000
Why do you sleep down there?

301
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,600
If you really don't like to sleep with me,

302
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,800
- I'd better go out.
- No, no.

303
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,000
Sleep. I'll sleep there. I'll sleep with you.

304
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,200
Just lie well to heal your wound.

305
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,800
Don't move.

306
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,500
Big-tailed Fish,

307
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,400
you'll get in trouble on land for being so stubborn.

308
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,000
<i>Tomorrow, when Chang Yi's body is better,</i>

309
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
<i>I'll tell him we should go our separate ways.</i>

310
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,300
Master, the valley has been searched.

311
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,700
There is still no whereabouts of Ji Yunhe and the merman.

312
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,000
When the Blue Feather Phoenix caused chaos,

313
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,200
didn't someone see Qu Xiaoxing and Ji Yunhe

314
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,400
leave the inner hall sequentially?

315
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,100
Has Qu Xiaoxing confessed the whereabouts of Ji Yunhe?

316
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,000
We've already interrogated him.

317
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,500
But Qu Xiaoxing has always been good friends with Ji Yunhe,

318
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,600
so he kept silent about her whereabouts.

319
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,800
There is no mouth that

320
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,200
can't be pried open in Reflect Cave.

321
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
Father!

322
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,400
Young Master.

323
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Father, can you leave Qu Xiaoxing to me?

324
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,800
I will definitely ask about the whereabouts of Ji Yunhe and the merman.

325
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,400
After the battle with Blue Feather Phoenix,

326
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
your injury has not yet healed,

327
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,400
so you don't have to do that.

328
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,800
As Young Master, it is my duty to do so.

329
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,000
Okay. Since you are sure, then show me.

330
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,400
Yes.

331
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,800
Xiaoxing, Ji Yunhe took the merman away without a word.

332
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,200
In order to find her, the brothers in the valley

333
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,800
didn't even drink a drop of water for a day.

334
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,600
She acted so unruly.

335
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,400
Why are you covering for her?

336
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Right. As long as you point a direction,

337
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,000
we wouldn't be going around like blind flies.

338
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,800
I have told you many times that

339
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,200
I don't know where she's gone,

340
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,600
no matter how many times you ask.

341
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,400
You are putting us in a difficult position.

342
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,200
Young Master.

343
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,000
- You can leave.
- Yes.

344
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you, Young Master.

345
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,200
Although I am friends with Yunhe,

346
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
I really don't know where she has gone.

347
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
Of course, you don't know.

348
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
She fell into the formation with the merman.

349
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,900
What?

350
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,000
According to her nature, she will try her best to come out.

351
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,300
At that time, I want you to help her before everyone else.

352
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,000
You mean that you want me to save Yunhe?

353
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,600
You don't want to?

354
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,200
But don't you hate Yunhe so much?

355
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Now she is the sinner of Thousand Flower Valley.

356
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,000
Once Master finds out what you have done,

357
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,700
even if you are his son, he will definitely punish you heavily.

358
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,000
I know.

359
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
Then why?

360
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,200
Lin Haoqing, what the hell are you thinking?

361
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,000
It's none of your business.

362
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Do what you have to do.

363
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,100
Big-tailed Fish,

364
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,000
don't be nice to me anymore.

365
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,500
I'm afraid I can't bear to part with you.

366
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,300
Yunhe, come out and have a look.

367
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,400
<i>Yunhe!</i>

368
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,000
<i>Come out, Yunhe!</i>

369
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
<i>Come on, look!</i>

370
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,600
You're not even healed, why do you catch fish?

371
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
We can't use our spiritual power here.

372
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
I think tonic food might help me recover.

373
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,400
This fish is very tasty.

374
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,600
They are all for you.

375
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,000
Chang Yi, you're nice to me.

376
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,300
But sometimes the better you treat people, the more burden you will make, do you know?

377
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,400
You're nice to me, too.

378
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,000
<i>The foolish fish even can't tell between the real and the fake.</i>

379
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,600
I don't feel any burden.

380
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,700
In fact, you can be nicer to me.

381
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,200
Can you stop talking?

382
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,300
Okay, I can shut up,

383
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,800
then tell me.

384
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,400
Is something bothering you?

385
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,800
Can you tell that?

386
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,000
When you talk, you dare not look into my eyes.

387
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,200
No hurry. I can wait.

388
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,200
I live longer than immortals on average.

389
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,000
If Shunde knows that you talk in this style,

390
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,100
she will certainly regret giving this order.

391
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,200
I don't know what you are hiding in your heart.

392
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,600
But if you don't say it,

393
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,400
it proves that it's not that time yet.

394
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,000
That's okay. Eat the fish.

395
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
If they are not enough, I'll get you more.

396
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
What happened?

397
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,200
Chang Yi, do you feel that after being in the water,

398
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,600
your wound heals faster?

399
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
The wound.

400
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,200
A gentleman uses his tongue, not his fists.

401
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,600
So just say it.

402
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,800
Yes.

403
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,600
Then, do you feel that spiritual power flowing into your body?

404
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
But we can't use spiritual power here.

405
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,800
Qing can build a house with spiritual power here

406
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,000
and there are fish in the water,

407
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,800
so there must be a place to circulate the spiritual power outside.

408
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,600
As long as we can find the source,

409
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,000
we can definitely get out of here.

410
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Besides, Li Shu has broken this formation,

411
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,200
so it shouldn't be difficult for us to escape the broken formation.

412
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
I caught the fish from the water.

413
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Could the source be in the water?

414
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,800
Hasn't the Blue Feather Phoenix broken through the formation?

415
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Is she sealed up again?

416
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,600
Spiritual Master, I'll swallow you!

417
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,540
She can't leave the water.

418
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,300
She isn't Blue Feather Phoenix.

419
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,620
She is her spirit.

420
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,560
Spirit?

421
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,040
Probably because she has some obsessions and she can't let go of them.

422
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,800
These emotions have been suppressed in the formation for thousands of years, and can't be eased,

423
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,540
which then formed the spirit of the phoenix.

424
00:33:52,540 --> 00:34:00,240
You Spiritual Masters are all heartless.

425
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,800
I'll swallow you one by one.

426
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,680
If you have the ability, then go for the Spiritual Master who sealed you.

427
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,040
Don't take it out on us.

428
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,639
I will, I'll avenge the Spiritual Master.

429
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:17,439
It's Ning Ruochu, who imprisoned me in the Ten Directions Formation.

430
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:20,220
Why imprison me here? Why imprison me here?

431
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,600
Why?

432
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,179
Let's go inside. Wait till she calms down a bit.

433
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,900
Master, Young Master gave medicine to Qu Xiaoxing and released him.

434
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,499
Haoqing is still too soft-hearted.

435
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:59,080
Compared with that person, he is still not ruthless enough.

436
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,480
Ground Haoqing.

437
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,520
Pass on the news that Young Master is seriously ill.

438
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,740
As for Qu Xiaoxing…

439
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,640
Should I clean him up?

440
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,100
No.

441
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,100
He is too close to Ji Yunhe.

442
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,980
If something happens to him, Haoqing will be criticized.

443
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,600
I know.

444
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,460
I'll find a reason for Young Master to release him.

445
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,620
Qu Xiaoxing is not clever,

446
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,820
he won't look into it himself.

447
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,680
Master. Master.

448
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,020
You…

449
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,380
Qing Shu, send more people.

450
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,160
No matter how, we must find Ji Yunhe and the merman, especially Ji Yunhe.

451
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,880
I spent a hundred years of effort on her.

452
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,680
This game has come to an end.

453
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,500
At this moment, no mistakes are allowed.

454
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,000
Yes.

455
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,740
Do you mean that the exit is under the pool?

456
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,240
Yes.

457
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,120
Although I just touched the water lightly,

458
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,120
I could feel the spiritual power flowing in it.

459
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,760
Although the spiritual power is very weak, it does exist.

460
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:17,420
If I'm right, this pool should be connected to one of the holes of the formation.

461
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,900
In the past, the Ten Directions Formation was very powerful.

462
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,840
But since the Blue Feather Phoenix broke out of the formation, even if it closes again, it is only a broken formation.

463
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,580
As long as we can break this eye of the formation, then we will be able to break out of the formation.

464
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:38,200
It's just that this spirit is too hostile to Spiritual Masters.

465
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,440
I just touched it lightly, and she came out to fight back.

466
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,820
We have to find a way to deal with her.

467
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,840
Do you have an idea?

468
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:53,340
Chang Yi, you really want to get out of here too, don't you?

469
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,760
Now neither of us can use our spiritual power.

470
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,740
- This spirit is so powerful. We definitely can't defeat her, right?
- Yes.

471
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,320
Well, in that case, we must not blindly force our way out but go out with wisdom.

472
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,880
Do you agree?

473
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,300
Yes.

474
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,060
I have an idea.

475
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,800
Do you want to try it?

476
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,080
What is it?

477
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,260
The spirit said that she was cheated by a man and suffered from love.

478
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,420
The easiest way to cure the love injury is to start a new love.

479
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,840
You are so beautiful, how about seducing her?

480
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,200
No.

481
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,300
How can you push me to her?

482
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm not pushing you to her.

483
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,720
I didn't ask you to do anything to her.

484
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,300
I just want you to say some good words to coax her,

485
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,620
to make her a little happier and open her heart knot.

486
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,200
Then we can get out of here.

487
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
No.

488
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,900
We mermen never lie and we never cheat.

489
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,400
But it's a good lie.

490
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,380
Not all people lie with cunning minds.

491
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,800
Some people can't tell the truth, while some people are forced to tell lies.

492
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,420
If one day you really meet such a person, can't you be flexible?

493
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,160
As my father said, there are no white lies at all.

494
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,080
It's all self-deception.

495
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,960
For us mermen, lies are unforgivable.

496
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,840
You mermen are really pure and kind.

497
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,140
It doesn't matter. Let me do it.

498
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,440
How will you do it?

499
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,180
You're not a man.

500
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,640
Since ancient times, no woman in the scripts can resist the temptation of scholars.

501
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,620
Help me tie my hair.

502
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,300
Who are you?

503
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,680
<i>Just after such a short while, she can't recognize me.</i>

504
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,320
<i>It seems that this spirit is just a spirit, whose mind is not complete.</i>

505
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,160
<i>But that's good. I don't have to explain myself.</i>

506
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,720
I'm just a scholar.

507
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,520
I saw you from a distance and was attracted by you.

508
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,640
What is a scholar?

509
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,560
Why are you here?

510
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,660
And why are you attracted to me?

511
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,600
A scholar is a person who studies.

512
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,880
I see you sitting here alone, looking as if you are sad.

513
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
Is there something that makes you sad?

514
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,720
I was cheated by a Spiritual Master.

515
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,240
His name is Ning Ruochu.

516
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,920
We used to love each other very much.

517
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,700
But he broke my heart.

518
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,000
Is the one you're talking about the Impermanence Sage Ning Ruochu?

519
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,160
Isn't he the one responsible for sealing you?

520
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,440
Did you really fall in love with each other?

521
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:48,700
I remember that when Li Shu was just born,

522
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:55,920
his father, Lynx King, accidentally went mad and injured many people.

523
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,000
So he was hunted down by Spiritual Masters.

524
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,220
<i>Li Shu is actually in the Lynx King's bloodline.</i>

525
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,960
<i>No wonder his power is so great.</i>

526
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,780
Because of this, the good reputation that Li Shu's grandfather had earned

527
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,080
by following the former emperor to fight against Zhu Yan was destroyed overnight.

528
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,300
I saved little Li Shu who was almost hurt by them.

529
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:22,120
But Spiritual Masters accused me of being a criminal and hunted me down.

530
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,760
They chased me to Le You Mountain.

531
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,400
<i>- Go there.
- Okay.</i>

532
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,760
<i>[Spiritual master of Thousand Flower Valley, Ning Ruochu]</i>

533
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,200
<i>[Le You Mountain]</i>

534
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,260
<i>Thanks to his timely help, little Li Shu was safe and sound.</i>

535
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,580
<i>Also, because of that, I knew that he had no malicious intentions.</i>

536
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,900
<i>He knew he had misunderstood me, and took the initiative to apologize to me.</i>

537
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,380
Master Ning!

538
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,640
Are you Ning Ruochu?

539
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,180
<i>But his juniors were far less enlightened than he was.</i>

540
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,580
<i>They believed in the rumors that I was a murderous deviant.</i>

541
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,860
<i>Ruochu tried to persuade them for me</i>

542
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,460
<i>and took me away.</i>

543
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,080
<i>He protected me and little Li Shu,</i>

544
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,280
<i>but I didn't want to owe his favor.</i>

545
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,480
Knowing that he loved wine,

546
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,520
I gave him the wine made of the essence of flowers and grains to make even with him.

547
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,220
But he seemed to be addicted to drinking,

548
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:52,240
and he insisted on being my drinking buddy despite the gossip.

549
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,920
Gossip is most hurtful.

550
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,240
Aren't you afraid?

551
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,420
If I can't do what I want to do with my heart,

552
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,720
then what's the point of living?

553
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,100
That's how we fell in love.
