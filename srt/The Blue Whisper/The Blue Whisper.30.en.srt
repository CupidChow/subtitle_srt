20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's too late.

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,538
Your Majesty, don't do that.

22
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,080
Why are you here? Are you asking for death?

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
Then it'll be my pleasure.

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,120
It's my fault. I'm responsible.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,758
You should punch me.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,320
What's the point of punching you?

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,720
That's the Spirit Token left by the former emperor; the hope of summoning millions of soldiers.

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,792
Your Majesty, how can you use it against thunder?

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,600
Since it's the magic weapon left by Father,

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,760
it could fend off the Infinite Gold Thunder.

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,820
No other magic weapon has this power.

32
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,480
This matter is because of Sanyue.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,960
If I didn't leave Li Shu a thunder ban,

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,220
it wouldn't trigger Infinite Gold Thunder.

35
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,080
Your Majesty, please punish me.

36
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
No, no, no. It's not her fault.

37
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
It was my reckless ignorance that led to the Spirit Token's destruction.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,400
It's not her fault. Your Majesty, please punish me.

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,700
It's my decision to use the Spirit Token to block against thunder.

40
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,540
Then I should also be punished for my poor care and improper use.

41
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,020
I won't blame you.

42
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,460
But it's because of us that the Spirit Token was destroyed.

43
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,340
I'm not worth it.

44
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,880
If you are not worth it, then who is?

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,440
There's always a choice in the world.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,000
If I could abandon you today,

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,720
then tomorrow I could abandon thousands of, or even millions of, people.

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,940
Then my desire to save the world is mere words.

49
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,480
Even if there's no Spirit Token, no millions of soldiers to help me,

50
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,620
I'll never waver in my commitment to protecting the world.

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,980
I'll never regret it.

52
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,480
And you don't have to feel bad about it.

53
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,800
It seems that Heavenly King's enlightenment has reached a new level.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,020
Your Majesty, we're happy about your enlightenment.

55
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,400
But the Spirit Token is a pity.

56
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,700
How... How is this getting messier?

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,780
- Don't touch it.
- That...

58
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,335
It doesn't matter.

59
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,618
Wait. Look.

60
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,491
I know.

61
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,960
If we observe the so-called mysteries from another perspective,

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,838
if we merely treat them as drawings or lines, then we can see them through.

63
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,680
It seems that sometimes it's a blessing to think simply.

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,000
Sanyue, you are not angry anymore?

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,080
I'm still angry.

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,240
If the Heavenly King hesitated for a moment and

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,380
sacrificed life for the sake of the Spirit Token,

68
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,420
then the Spirit Token wouldn't have been destroyed.

69
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,680
And Immortal Li Shu wouldn't have seen it.

70
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,000
The meaning of mysteries wouldn't be clear.

71
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,920
Well, then I take credit for that.

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
Close your mouth.

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,280
I'll punish you later.

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,500
Nectar Ganoderma is fully mature.

75
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,460
Ji Yunhe is waiting for you.

76
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,720
I hope we will see each other again.

77
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,640
Your Majesty, thanks for saving our lives.

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,340
Sanyue would like to join you to save the world.

79
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,420
Me, too.

80
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,120
You should go.

81
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,880
It turns out that this is what Master Hexu called chance.

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,220
The new drawing is here.

83
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,920
It seems that we are not far from success.

84
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,560
It's all ready. We're ready to go.

85
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,280
You're in charge of feint tonight.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,720
I'll try to enter the Lingshuang Pavilion to help Master.

87
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,180
Siyu, Master said he had his own way.

88
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,400
I advise you not to act rashly so as not to disturb Master's plan.

89
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,580
Master is in danger alone. I really can not rest assured.

90
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,800
Qu Xiaoxing, you must keep the troops in check.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,000
Be wary of Zhu Ling.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
Do not let the Thousand Flower Valley fight with North Abyss.

93
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,960
Otherwise, Master would have wasted all his pains and humiliation.

94
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,900
<i>Since Chang Yi relieved the ban that day</i>

95
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,880
<i>and asked Luo Luo to accompany me on Lake Island,</i>

96
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,380
<i>the barrier has been weakened.</i>

97
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,920
<i>It seems that as long as I seal the Merman Mark,</i>

98
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,440
<i>I can get away quietly.</i>

99
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,980
A'Ming, hasn't Chang Yi come back yet?

100
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,060
Master and Mr. Kong Ming are discussing issues in the hall.

101
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,338
They won't return until late at night.

102
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:48,260
Miss Ji, what's the matter?

103
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,700
Nothing.

104
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,860
That's pretty good.

105
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,500
I'd like to get some rest.

106
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,880
A'Ming, please leave me alone.

107
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,920
Chang Yi, I'll leave.

108
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,400
Why are you so upset tonight?

109
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,660
I don't know why.

110
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,960
Although the Mark doesn't warn me,

111
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,680
I am always worried.

112
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,920
I'll go back to Cloud Quarters.

113
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,360
Master!

114
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,960
Master, Spiritual Masters launched a night attack.

115
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,120
Why did it happen so suddenly?

116
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,920
Let's have a look.

117
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,100
Your skills have greatly improved.

118
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,960
The reverse effect is about to harm your heart.

119
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,680
Don't use spiritual power. I'll take you away.

120
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,440
I knew the Spiritual Masters were all bad guys.

121
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,760
It turns out the peace talk was fake, and the prison break was real.

122
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,320
What are you going to do next?

123
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,520
Colluding to take down North Abyss?

124
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,120
Ji Yunhe, you betrayed Chang Yi.

125
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,140
I won't give you any chance to hurt him.

126
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,280
No. Qing Yao is the daughter of the Fox King.

127
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,240
If this goes too far, there will be no chance for peace talks.

128
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,820
They seem unfriendly. Should we wait for our doom?

129
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,300
They just said mean words but won't take any action.

130
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,200
It would be strange that they would suddenly take action today.

131
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,160
I'm afraid there's someone behind guiding them.

132
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,760
Ji Yunhe, you're so smart.

133
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,840
Qing Xuan, it's you.

134
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,420
You finally woke up.

135
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,160
I heard that you were reasonable.

136
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,600
Master Lin and I mean no harm today.

137
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,220
We just want to leave quietly.

138
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,960
Later, Master Lin will have peace talks with North Abyss.

139
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,140
We won't put you in a difficult position.

140
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,260
But I remember that last time in Immortal Master Mansion,

141
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,020
Master Lin was sworn in to protect Fairy Shunde.

142
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,120
And now, under the command of Fairy Shunde,

143
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,880
they came to attack North Abyss.

144
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,200
How can I trust you when you act like this?

145
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,800
Sir, Master Lin and all those in Thousand Flower Valley are victims.

146
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,280
They have difficulties.

147
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,640
You are also from Thousand Flower Valley.

148
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,720
You're a bird of the same feather with that guy.

149
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,480
No need to talk with them, Uncle.

150
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,360
Just kill them.

151
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,200
Sir, I know you are not afraid of fighting.

152
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,720
But if it happens, there will be casualties on both sides.

153
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,480
Do you want to see the place that just came back to life get hurt again?

154
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,640
I know you are not an ordinary man.

155
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,560
Of course, you know what the best choice is for North Abyss.

156
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Ji Yunhe, you sure have a lot of nerve.

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,200
I kind of like you.

158
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,800
But since Chang Yi is the Master of North Abyss,

159
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,200
I won't let you disturb him.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Today, you broke out of prison first. Don't blame me.

161
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,800
Pass my order. Kill Ji Yunhe and Lin Haoqing.

162
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,200
<i>We are running out of time.</i>

163
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,100
<i>If Chang Yi finds out, we can't leave.</i>

164
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,800
<i>We must break out quickly.</i>

165
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,000
Tonight, the Spiritual Masters were acting strangely.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,800
They fought and retreated several times.

167
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
They seemed to be distracting us on purpose.

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
They were feinting.

169
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Then, what are they covering?

170
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,600
No.

171
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
The Merman Mark was blocked. That's why I can't sense her.

172
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,800
Yunhe must be in trouble.

173
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,200
Chang Yi, Yunhe tried to rescue Lin Haoqing but they were found out by Fox King.

174
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,000
They're going to kill Lin Haoqing and Yunhe.

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Fox King?

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,300
Yes, he's awake.

177
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,000
It's out of your league. Don't make things worse.

178
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,300
Go back to Cloud Quarters and wait.

179
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,600
Get out of the way.

180
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,400
I don't want to get in a fight with you.

181
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Yao'er, a spiritual master as she is,

182
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,000
how could she have the Hidden Soul Needle of Qing Shu?

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Uncle, it's she who killed Aunt Qing Shu.

184
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,600
No, Father.

185
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,700
Father! Father!

186
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
Yunhe!

187
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,800
- Uncle.
- Father.

188
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,300
The spiritual power protected her?

189
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,000
Only the power voluntarily transferred protects its owner.

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,300
Fox King, now you should know that Qing Shu was willing to transfer her power to her.

191
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,600
She was not killed by Ji Yunhe.

192
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,000
Fox King, I don't know that...

193
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Father.

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,200
Father, you can't have anything wrong.

195
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,300
- Uncle.
- You just woke up.

196
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,800
I can't afford to lose you again.

197
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,400
Father. Father.

198
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,000
- Uncle.
- Father!

199
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,600
Uncle still has a pulse, but it is weak.

200
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
Kill them.

201
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
- Master.
- Why are you here?

202
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,300
I was worried about you.

203
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,600
Here.

204
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
There is a spy working for them.

205
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
You really have a plan.

206
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Peace talks? You are liars.

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,900
Kill them.

208
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,800
Master, you're just in time.

209
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,400
Ji Yunhe harbors evil intentions.

210
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,000
She colluded with a spy to break into the prison.

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
And Fox King was seriously wounded by her.

212
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,300
Now, Fox King is dying.

213
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,700
Bring him back. Try to cure him.

214
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,400
Okay.

215
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,800
It turns out that this was your real purpose.

216
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,400
All you did, was to run away.

217
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Chang Yi.

218
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,000
Ji Yunhe, I should lock you up all your life.

219
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,600
Then you would have no chance to betray me.

220
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,800
Do you think this is still the Thousand Flower Valley?

221
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,100
Lin Haoqing, you should know that it is different now.

222
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,600
Shut Ji Yunhe back on Lake Island.

223
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,800
Take Lin Haoqing and his attendant back to Insanity Cave.

224
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

225
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,300
Yunhe. Yunhe.

226
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,700
Luo Luo, I hurt Fox King.

227
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,200
I didn't mean it.

228
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,800
Don't worry.

229
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,000
Yunhe. Yunhe.

230
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,800
Anyone here?

231
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,900
Yunhe. Yunhe.

232
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Fox King's elixir is broken. He's about to die.

233
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,700
Even if he can wake up this time, it's just a momentary recovery before death.

234
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
He can't hang on for long.

235
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
What?

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,800
It's not easy for Father to wake up.

237
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,600
Mr. Kong Ming, please save him.

238
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
I beg you.

239
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,600
Sir, please have another try.

240
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
It's all because of you.

241
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,800
If it had not been for her, my uncle wouldn't be like this.

242
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,100
Why did you withhold the news of Fox King's awakening?

243
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,900
You secretly monitored Lake Island

244
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,600
and let Ji Yunhe break into the cell.

245
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,400
You just wanted to kill her on the charge of prison break.

246
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Father.

247
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,100
It has nothing to do with Yao'er.

248
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Father, be careful.

249
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,800
It was my plan to kill Ji Yunhe.

250
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,600
While fixing the elixir for you,

251
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,400
you said you owed us a favor.

252
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Now I'm going to have the cheek

253
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,200
to ask you for the reward.

254
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,600
Fox King, what do you want me to do?

255
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,400
I want you to kill Ji Yunhe.

256
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,300
If Ji Yunhe is still alive,

257
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,400
North Abyss won't be settled.

258
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,200
How can I trust you with Yao'er?

259
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,500
Yao'er, it's time to tell him the truth.

260
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,000
Chang Yi, do you have any idea what Yao'er did for you?

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,100
Father.

262
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,600
Father, stop.

263
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,800
At that time, your spirit elixir was broken.

264
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Since I had been imprisoned in Insanity Cave for so many years,

265
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,600
I was too sick to help you fix your spirit elixir.

266
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,400
You were bound to die.

267
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,400
It's Yao'er who transferred half of her spiritual power to you.

268
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,200
She helped you fix your spirit elixir

269
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
so that you could recover.

270
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,500
Yao'er was still young so her spiritual power was unstable at that time.

271
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,600
Luckily, there was no accident.

272
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:11,100
Otherwise, I'm afraid she wouldn't have been able to even keep her human form.

273
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,500
Fox King, how come you never told me about it?

274
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,300
Yao'er didn't want to force you to be grateful,

275
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,200
and she didn't want to hold you back.

276
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,200
If I didn't say anything about it now,

277
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,100
I'm afraid I couldn't leave at ease.

278
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Chang Yi,

279
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,800
I beg you now, not in the name of Fox King,

280
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,800
but in the name of a father.

281
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Yao'e has done so much for you

282
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,000
before you even knew it.

283
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,700
No matter how you feel about her,

284
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,800
would you please take good care of her

285
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,000
and guard North Abyss?

286
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,200
Can you promise?

287
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,500
Father.

288
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,800
Uncle.

289
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,600
Father.

290
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Father, please wake up.

291
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
Father.

292
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,600
- Uncle.
- Father.

293
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,100
Father, please wake up.

294
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
Uncle.

295
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Father.

296
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
Father.

297
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,400
You planned to take Ji Yunhe away?

298
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,000
Do you know what the situation is now?

299
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,700
I can guess. So you need me more than ever.

300
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,900
Release Ji Yunhe and let me take her away.

301
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,800
Why should I give her to you?

302
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
It's her choice.

303
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,300
And it's the best result for everyone.

304
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,700
What are you planning with her?

305
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
She didn't want to tell you.

306
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,400
You're an outsider to her after all.

307
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,900
Master!

308
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,800
Master, Young Lord Qing Yao gathered people in the main hall

309
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,000
and said that she wanted you to explain the death of Fox King.

310
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,700
Mr. Kong Ming can't handle it.

311
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Chang Yi, you and Ji Yunhe have no chance to be together.

312
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,400
Let her go.

313
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
You can't protect her.

314
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,600
How do you know that I can't protect her?

315
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Listen. I can protect Ji Yunhe.

316
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,600
I didn't think it would lead to Fox King's death.

317
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,200
After Fox King's death, North Abyss and Thousand Flower Valley are like sworn enemies.

318
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,500
War is imminent.

319
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,700
Ask Qu Xiaoxing to retreat temporarily to avoid direct confrontation.

320
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
<i>For what reason?</i>

321
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Young Lord, please restrain your grief.

322
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,000
What matters now is to sacrifice Fox King

323
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,800
and let him rest in peace.

324
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
It should be the blood of the enemy,

325
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,100
not the tears of his relatives,

326
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,800
that is used to sacrifice father.

327
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,100
All of you,

328
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,600
Fox King died for Thousand Flower Valley.

329
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
With the enemy in North Abyss,

330
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,200
we ask Master to fight.

331
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,600
Ask Master to fight.

332
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,500
Kill Ji Yunhe to offer sacrifices to Fox King and flag for the war.

333
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,400
<i>Kill Ji Yunhe to offer sacrifices to Fox King</i>

334
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
<i>and flag for the war.</i>

335
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,100
<i>Ask Master to fight.</i>

336
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,200
<i>Kill Ji Yunhe to offer sacrifices to Fox King</i>

337
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,400
<i>and flag for the war.</i>

338
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
<i>Ask Master to fight.</i>

339
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
- Master is here!
<i>- Kill Ji Yunhe to</i>

340
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
<i>offer sacrifices to Fox King</i>

341
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
<i>and flag for the war.</i>

342
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,000
<i>Ask Master to fight.</i>

343
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,400
- Stop!
<i>- Kill Ji Yunhe.</i>

344
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Master, please give us an explanation.

345
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,000
I will lead the battle myself.

346
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,600
I won't bring shame on the Master of North Abyss.

347
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,800
That's also my promise to Fox King.

348
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,800
But I won't let anyone hurt Ji Yunhe.

349
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,400
What? If you can't do it, we can.

350
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,400
- Let's go.
<i>- Go. Let's go.</i>

351
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
<i>Let's go!</i>

352
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,100
I dare who?

353
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,500
Ji Yunhe colluded with the leader of the enemy.

354
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,200
She tried to break out of prison and killed Father.

355
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
She's the principal offender.

356
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Why do you help her?

357
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,200
My father told us before he died that

358
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,000
no harm should be left to the North Abyss.

359
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,500
Did you forget it?

360
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,000
Ji Yunhe did no harm to North Abyss. She meant to rescue the North Abyss.

361
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Do you still believe her after all this?

362
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,300
Fine.

363
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,200
Aside from the safety of North Abyss,

364
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,300
what about my father's life?

365
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,400
Ji Yunhe killed Father.

366
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
That's the truth.

367
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Have you forgotten my father's kindness and hope towards you?

368
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,600
I will never forget that you had saved my life.

369
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,200
But I won't let anyone hurt Ji Yunhe.

370
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,800
Master, what are you going to do?

371
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,800
You used half of your spiritual power to save me.

372
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Today, I will pay back with half of my spiritual power.

373
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
No.

374
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,200
I promised Fox King to protect Young Lord and the North Abyss.

375
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
With half of my spiritual power, I'm sure Young Lord

376
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,200
will have the strength to protect yourself.

377
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,600
And I'll try my best to protect the North Abyss.

378
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,200
I have kept my promise to Fox King.

379
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,600
Now, I won't let anyone take Ji Yunhe away.

380
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,400
Why?

381
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,200
She hurt you. She betrayed you.

382
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,400
Is... Is this really worth it?

383
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
The war is coming.

384
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,000
Young Lord, prepare for the war as soon as possible.

385
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Retreat? Why should we retreat?

386
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
That's Master's order.

387
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,000
Fox King is dead. Our enemy is agitated.

388
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,600
It's not good for us to go to war now.

389
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,100
Didn't you tell me that Lin Haoqing was deliberately arrested

390
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,900
just to go deep into the enemy's interior and kill their leaders?

391
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Didn't he expect the anger in the North Abyss then?

392
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,100
Or did he have another plan for this trip to the North Abyss?

393
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,400
And how come the sudden attack last night?

394
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,700
Why didn't anyone report to me?

395
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,800
You do have another plan.

396
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,600
Although having all the advantages, you've been reluctant to go after them.

397
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
And you've been caught on purpose.

398
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,200
I think even the assassination talk was a cover story.

399
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,000
Master has foresight.

400
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,500
I believe he has a reason.

401
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,200
You all have the Frost mark inside your body.

402
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,400
Either advance or retreat, it's still a dead end.

403
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,500
What Frost mark?

404
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,100
Why is advance or retreat a dead end?

405
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,600
Elders, what brings you here?

406
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
Hearing that Master was caught,

407
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,700
we were worried about him.

408
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,200
So we rushed here to see what we could do to help.

409
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,400
As soon as we arrived at the camp ground, we got the news that Fox King was dead.

410
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,800
Let's skip this part first.

411
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm asking you.

412
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,800
What's the Frost mark?

413
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,000
Do you mean that all the previous rumors are true?

414
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Since you know it, why bother to ask me?

415
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,900
You...

416
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm tired of talking to you.

417
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,900
Convey my order. Attack the North Abyss tomorrow.

418
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,200
You're not in charge.

419
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,400
We have to follow Master's order to retreat.

420
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm the supervisor Fairy Shunde appointed.

421
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,200
Master is not here. I do have the right to replace him.

422
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,700
We serve the Thousand Flower Valley and only obey Master's orders.

423
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,000
Besides, attacking North Abyss isn't proper.

424
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,500
Turning around in time is the right way.

425
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,400
Are you questioning the order of Fairy Shunde?

426
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,000
Can't we say what goes against Heaven?

427
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,600
Muze.

428
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,600
Muze.

429
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,100
Muze!

430
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,000
Zhu Ling!

431
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,100
Fairy Shunde has long known that you Spiritual Masters would be hard to control.

432
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,800
So before leaving, she allowed me

433
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,000
to use the Frost mark as punishment when necessary.

434
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
But I was generous and

435
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,000
tolerated your disobedience several times before.

436
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,800
I didn't expect you to go so far.

437
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,400
You want to escape in spite of the order of Fairy Shunde.

438
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Then I have no other choice but to punish you.

439
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,200
You stay here and watch

440
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,300
what will happen to those who disobey Fairy Shunde and me.

441
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,600
- Give me the antidote.
- Antidote?

442
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,400
I have the antidote.

443
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,000
But I don't want to give it to you.

444
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
You...

445
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,200
Be careful.

446
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
If you dare to fight against me,

447
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,200
I will make everyone here pay for your impulse.

448
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Xiaoxing, be a lamb.

449
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,600
I admire you.

450
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,400
Sir.

451
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,400
Get away from me.

452
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,000
An old guy as you are, you can't be better.

453
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,400
I don't want to turn into an ice sculpture with you.

454
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,800
So scary.

455
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,400
You old man quarreled with me all your life.

456
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,400
But now you start to care about me.

457
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,600
I don't want that.

458
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,100
Antidote.

459
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,600
I'll look for the antidote for you.

460
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,800
Please hold on.

461
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,700
I'm waiting for you to keep arguing with me.

462
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,200
We've been arguing all our life.

463
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,400
Now it's quiet.

464
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,000
Guard Thousand Flower Valley well.

465
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,200
I'll leave first.

466
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,400
Elder.

467
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,300
Muze!

468
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,700
Sir, how's he doing?

469
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,600
Young Lord doesn't have to worry.

470
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,800
Although Chang Yi's vitality is greatly damaged,

471
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,300
he has great spiritual power and is not in danger now.

472
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,800
Sir, I don't need Master to repay my kindness.

473
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,000
If I give his spiritual power back,

474
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,200
could he recover now?

475
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,600
Chang Yi has already closed his pulse.

476
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,500
He doesn't want to accept your spiritual power.

477
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,700
Master.

478
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,800
He really doesn't want to have anything to do with me.

479
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,600
Of course not.

480
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,400
Chang Yi will remember the kindness of Fox King and you.

481
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,200
But Young Lord pushes him too hard.

482
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,000
What do you want from him?

483
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,100
I... I didn't mean to push him that much.

484
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,000
My wish is simple.

485
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,900
I just hope to fight side by side with him and protect him.

486
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,200
I never thought it would be like that.

487
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Young Lord, you have to know that

488
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,400
the real enemy of the North Abyss is not Thousand Flower Valley, not Ji Yunhe,

489
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,200
but Immortal Master and Fairy Shunde.

490
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,200
If one doesn't know who the real enemy is,

491
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,000
the sharper the blade is,

492
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,100
the more he will hurt people around him.

493
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:26,000
So you also believe Ji Yunhe is not our enemy?

494
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But she did betray Master. She colluded with Lin Haoqing. I saw it with my eyes.

495
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,100
She had something to do with my father's death.

496
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,400
How could I...

497
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,800
There are many things we can't change.

498
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,900
People's hearts are even more complex.

499
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,800
Sometimes you can't just see with your eyes.

500
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,900
You have to justify with your heart.

501
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,800
Fox King is gone.

502
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,500
Young Lord has to think twice...

503
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,200
about which way to go in the future.

504
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,000
There's only one last inch between the reverse effect and your heart.

505
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,400
You don't have much time left.

506
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,800
How's it going with Fox King?

507
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
He has passed away.

508
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,400
But you don't have to blame yourself.

509
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,900
He was relying on Qing Yao's spiritual power to hold his last breath.

510
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,400
His wakeup was a momentary recovery.

511
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,700
His time had come.

512
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,200
Madam, I haven't finished the things I wanted to do.

513
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,600
Perhaps North Abyss and Thousand Flower Valley are destined to have this disaster.

514
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,800
Numerous efforts are still helpless.

515
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,920
Yunhe, finally you are awake.

516
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,880
Do you know how dangerous it is this time?

517
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,280
You fainted as soon as you got back.

518
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,800
You haven't woken up until now.

519
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,600
What's going on outside?

520
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,320
At a time like that, can you think about yourself?

521
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,080
Do you know that Qing Yao wanted to kill you?

522
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,800
Luo Luo.

523
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,120
Luo Luo, please tell me what's going on outside.

524
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,199
I hear that now in Thousand Flower Valley Zhu Ling is in charge.

525
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,120
They have lined up on the border.

526
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,280
Qing Yao also wants to get revenge for the Fox King.

527
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,840
So now a war is inevitable.

528
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,679
Didn't Chang Yi stop it?

529
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,000
No. He will lead the troops on his own.

530
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Qing Yao wanted you to pay for the death of Fox King.

531
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:55,500
To protect you, Chang Yi transferred half of his spiritual power to Qing Yao to repay her kindness.

532
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,879
Half of his spiritual power?

533
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:00,240
How can he be so silly?

534
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,360
Then, how's he doing now?

535
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,780
Don't worry. Since Mr. Kong Ming is with him, he's fine. Don't worry.

536
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,620
<i>Perhaps North Abyss and Thousand Flower Valley are destined to have this disaster.</i>

537
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,840
<i>Numerous efforts are still helpless.</i>

538
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,800
<i>What if I still want to try?</i>

539
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,780
<i>Why should I be at the mercy of fate all my life?</i>

540
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,920
<i>Immortal Master wants me to be the chess piece to stir up the storm.</i>

541
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,880
<i>Why should I obey?</i>

542
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,960
Luo Luo, I need you find Chang Yi for me.

543
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,400
Tell him that I want to meet him.

544
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,160
Why do you want to meet him?

545
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,400
The peace talks must not be abandoned until the last minute.

546
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,680
It's not the last minute. It's not the last minute.

547
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,940
I don't allow you to say it again.

548
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,720
Okay. I won't mention it anymore.

549
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,840
Please bring Chang Yi here.

550
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,500
I want to meet him.

551
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,520
What if he doesn't come?

552
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
If he doesn't come,

553
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,440
tell him that no matter how late it is,

554
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,880
I will always wait for him.

555
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,400
I won't go.

556
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,680
Why?

557
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,480
I need your reason.

558
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,240
Chang Yi, today you sacrificed half of

559
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,460
your spiritual power to protect Yunhe.

560
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,980
I don't believe that you don't want to meet her.

561
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,380
You've never been indecisive before.

562
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,420
Why are you being so hypocritical now?

563
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,900
Hypocritical?

564
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,040
Who's the most hypocritical one in the world?

565
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,040
Chang Yi!

566
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,920
Chang Yi, you are a coward.

567
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,620
<i>Come out!</i>

568
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Chang Yi!

569
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,860
<i>Ji Yunhe,</i>

570
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,620
<i>was I wrong from the beginning?</i>

571
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,080
<i>I wouldn't have come to you</i>

572
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,280
if Yunhe didn't want to see you.

573
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,220
Fine. That's great. You really think I want to meet you?

574
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,180
Be careful. Don't cut your hand.

575
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,200
What's going on?

576
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,260
Get up. Get up.

577
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,640
Yunhe wanted to meet Chang Yi.

578
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,940
So I came to find him.

579
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,120
He kicked me out.

580
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,420
Mr. Kong Ming, you're just in time.

581
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,480
Tell me why Chang Yi looks indifferent

582
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,960
when Yunhe is in trouble.

583
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,800
At least you care about whether I'm hurt or not.

584
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,960
But why doesn't Chang Yi want to see Yunhe?

585
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,840
I... I care about you?

586
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,360
Nonsense.

587
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,720
I... Maybe I should decoct the herbal soup again.

588
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,580
No, you can't leave.

589
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,560
You have to promise me one thing first.

590
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,040
What?

591
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,280
I want you to help me release Yunhe.

592
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,560
I'll take her away.

593
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,640
Qing Yao won't let her go.

594
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,440
And Chang Yi is acting like that.

595
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,800
Yunhe will only be in danger if she stays here.

596
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,240
Now, Ji Yunhe's life is at stake.

597
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,960
And she's involved in the dispute.

598
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,320
She can't leave.

599
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,160
If you insist on taking her away,

600
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,640
she'll become the target of both sides.

601
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,400
But I still want to have a try.

602
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,160
I don't care about the North Abyss.

603
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,640
I only care about Ji Yunhe.

604
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,360
Mr. Kong Ming, I beg you.

605
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,720
Please help me this time.

606
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,640
Only once, please.

607
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,560
I promise I won't bother you anymore.

608
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,840
Don't cry.

609
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
I promise you.

610
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,240
As long as you don't make trouble,

611
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,760
I will realize Ji Yunhe's wish.

612
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,840
Okay.

613
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,640
Then I'll go back to pack up now.

614
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,060
Mr. Kong Ming, you have promised me to protect her.

615
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,800
If you lie to me, I won't forgive you my whole life.

616
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,700
You know that?

617
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,680
Okay.

618
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,640
A'Ming, Chang Yi still refuses to come here. Right?

619
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,100
Maybe I should ask again?

620
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,000
It's not necessary.

621
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,880
He won't come.

622
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,320
<i>I always boast of being wise</i>

623
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,860
<i>and think that I can see through people's hearts.</i>

624
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,760
<i>In the end, I screwed everything up.</i>

625
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,180
Why should a master like you suffer so much?

626
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,520
You've made it impossible for me to drink wine.

627
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,560
I thought I wanted to keep her here so that

628
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,020
she could never leave me.

629
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,080
But now seeing her covered all over with cuts and bruises,

630
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,400
I'm not happy at all.

631
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,200
Was I wrong from the very beginning?

632
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,440
There is no right or wrong in feelings.

633
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,800
People only regret when they lose.

634
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,800
That kind of pain is really grinding.

635
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,920
While she's still with you,

636
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,420
have a drink with her and have a good chat.

637
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,560
- Madam Qing.
- No need to say more.

638
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,160
It's just my drunk words.

639
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,320
Maybe I just want to see

640
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,880
whether or not you'll have a different ending.

641
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,600
Spiritual Masters are idiots.

642
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,840
It's not a good time.

643
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,080
Sister Qing, I must leave.

644
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,860
This time if I can settle the disputes,

645
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,160
I won't lock Ji Yunhe when I get back.

646
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,840
Then I'll take Yunhe and have a drink with you.

647
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,480
A'Ming, when it's over, help me send this letter out.

648
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,120
That's my final request.

649
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,460
You have given me a lot of help these days.

650
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,080
I appreciate it.

651
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,320
A'Ming will do as you said.

652
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,380
But Miss Ji, where are you going?

653
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,080
I'm really tired of staying on Lake Island.

654
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,680
I'd like to go out to relax and

655
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,480
stop people from fighting against each other.

656
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,360
As weak as you are, you still want to persuade others?

657
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,560
Mr. Kong Ming, why are you here?

658
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,740
Luo Jinsang begged me to bring you out.

659
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,740
You still listen to Luo Luo.

660
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,140
How nice.

661
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,580
You should know that

662
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,880
I don't just want to go out.

663
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,440
If there's a battle between North Abyss and Thousand Flower Valley,

664
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,360
it's bound to hurt both sides.

665
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,660
The only winners are Immortal Master and Fairy Shunde.

666
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,120
We have the same goal.

667
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,040
We can't let them win.

668
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,400
So what's your plan? I can help you.

669
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,440
I'd like to participate in the war.

670
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,520
But considering my current situation,

671
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,720
I'm afraid I have to gasp for air without taking two steps.

672
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,980
I'm not sure if it can be done. Is there any way to restore my past strength?

673
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,920
It seems you know what to do.

674
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,200
I can use some medicine to forcibly activate the remaining spiritual power in your body.

675
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,720
But doing so is the same as drinking poison to quench thirst.

676
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,600
In the end, you'll die from the exhaustion of all your vitality

677
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,620
and aggravation of the pain.

678
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,760
You could have more time.

679
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,200
A brilliant moment is enough.

680
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,440
It's also good for the best Spiritual Master

681
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,560
of Thousand Flower Valley to leave in this way.
