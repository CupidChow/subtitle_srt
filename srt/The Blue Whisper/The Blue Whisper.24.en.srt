<i>[Episode 02]</i>

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,200
I suggest that you not go too far, in case,

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,200
you might have no chance to survive.

23

<i>What if I don't behave well?</i>

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,200
<i>You want to kill me?</i>

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
<i>We have signed a blood contract.</i>

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
<i>You've sold your life to me.</i>

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,700
<i>Ning Qing, if you break the contract, you will die.</i>

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,800
Of course I won't kill you,

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
but I can seal you

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,400
and keep you in the portrait forever.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,800
<i>Then just seal me.</i>

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>Why don't you do it?</i>

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,200
<i>Because you know that your power was given by me.</i>

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,400
<i>If you imprison me, you will imprison your own power.</i>

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,400
<i>Ning Qing, we have the same goal.</i>

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
<i>Anyway, now Lin Haoqing already knows the portrait.</i>

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
<i>Since we want to mess up,</i>

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,600
<i>let's mess up to the most.</i>

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
Put it there.

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,800
Don't close the window just because it's too cold.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Falling into the frozen lake will be colder.

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Hidden Soul Needle.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,600
Why do you have my aunt's unique weapon?

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Aunt?

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Qing Shu is Fox King's sister.

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,400
You're the daughter of Fox King.

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,400
I can explain Qing Shu's death to you.

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,000
The spiritual power in my body was given by Qing Shu voluntarily.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,300
No way.

51
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,400
My aunt was not related to you.

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
Why would she give you her spiritual power, which she had cultivated all her life with diligence?

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,800
Ji Yunhe, I don't know what forbidden spell you used.

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,200
But your Fox Fire just now was so strong.

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,800
You can only do that by draining my aunt's spiritual power.

56
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,700
It seems that my cousin was right.

57
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,600
You're the one who killed my aunt.

58
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,200
Today, I'm going to avenge my aunt.

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Prince, what are you doing?

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,300
Come with me.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,700
She's really a pretty girl.

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,000
The remaining days are getting less and less.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why didn't you let me kill Ji Yunhe just now?

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,200
Do you know what she did?

65
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Qing Shu's death has nothing to do with Ji Yunhe.

66
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,800
At that time, I was also in the Thousand Flower Valley.

67
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,500
As she said, Qing Shu took the initiative

68
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,400
to pass on the spiritual power to her.

69
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
I don't believe it.

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,800
Although through the years, we had not seen my aunt,

71
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,300
we still kept in touch.

72
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,800
I had never heard her mention Ji Yunhe.

73
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,200
How could she pass on her spiritual power to an outsider?

74
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
For Lin Canglan.

75
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,800
It's the whole thing.

76
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,200
Qing Shu really died voluntarily.

77
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,800
I thought they were just master and servant,

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,600
but now it sounds like

79
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,400
my aunt was just entranced.

80
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,800
Lin Canglan didn't care about and cherish her at all.

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,500
The Spiritual Masters are really the best at scheming

82
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,700
and playing with people's hearts.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is the end of this matter.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If there are still people who disagree, let them come to me directly.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,800
I don't want anyone else to bother Ji Yunhe about this matter.

86
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,900
Prince Chang Yi, what's going on between you and Ji Yunhe?

87
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,600
You said she tried to kill you, lied to you,

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,300
caused your father's death, and caused the East Sea to be sealed.

89
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,000
So you hate her to the bone and just want to kill her.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,400
But why were you so nervous protecting her?

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Are you entranced by the Spiritual Master just like my aunt?

92
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,000
I want her to suffer what I have suffered.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,600
So she must survive.

94
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
The token.

95
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,000
I insisted on asking Wei Yan for this, so don't blame her.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
From now on, no one is allowed to

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
enter the Cloud Quarters on Lake Island.

98
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,400
I will arrange everything about Ji Yunhe.

99
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,900
She is my prisoner alone.

100
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Qing Yao.

101
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,600
Young Lord, as long as you give the order,

102
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,100
we will go to Lake Island and kill Ji Yunhe.

103
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,600
<i>- Yes.
- Yes, right.</i>

104
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
<i>Kill Ji Yunhe!</i>

105
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,200
<i>Kill her.</i>

106
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,600
Cousin, did you tell them?

107
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,900
Yes. Aunt Qing Shu's revenge is our revenge. Why can't I say?

108
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,200
All dismissed.

109
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,100
She's not the murderer.

110
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,800
Qifeng, what's going on?

111
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
<i>Then who is it?</i>

112
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,100
If it wasn't her, who else could it be?

113
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,800
Ji Yunhe can take away Qing Shu's spiritual power,

114
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
then she can take away all of ours.

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,100
Keeping such a person in North Abyss, can everyone be at ease?

116
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,200
<i>Yes, can we be at ease?</i>

117
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
<i>We can't.</i>

118
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,100
I said that Ji Yunhe is not the murderer.

119
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,400
Why don't you even listen to me?

120
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,100
Cousin, now the Immortal Master is watching, North Abyss is in danger.

121
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,200
Why are you still so reckless?

122
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Am I reckless?

123
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,800
It's obvious that the merman wants to keep Ji Yunhe and makes everyone feel uneasy.

124
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,600
I don't think he deserves to be our commander.

125
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
<i>Yes, he's not worthy to be our commander.</i>

126
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,700
<i>He shouldn't be our commander.</i>

127
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,400
Sowing discord and disturbing the army, you can't be forgiven.

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,000
Come on, take Qifeng away, and confine him for 20 days.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,800
Qing Yao, are you going to do this to me?

130
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,900
Take him away.

131
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,800
Let me go!

132
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,000
While struggling to keep me locked up,

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,100
while being criticized at the same time,

134
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,800
are you not tired?

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,100
It's none of your business.

136
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,600
Then, aren't you afraid that

137
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,800
Qing Yao will be angry with you?

138
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
She seems…

139
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
If you have the time,

140
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
you'd better worry about yourself.

141
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Spiritual power is backfiring and destroying your body.

142
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,000
You're going to be worse than a mortal.

143
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,600
Take the medicine.

144
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,300
I'm too weak to take it.

145
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,800
I just seemed to see the Big-tailed Fish like before,

146
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
who was so good and obedient.

147
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,600
He wouldn't bully me like you're doing right now.

148
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,000
You said you killed me

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,600
in exchange for freedom and wealth from Shunde.

150
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,800
But why did you end up like this?

151
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,300
And why did Shunde torture you?

152
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,000
Ji Yunhe,

153
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,300
what happened on the cliff back then?

154
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,000
♫ <i>Hey, just follow the flow</i> ♫

155
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,000
♫ <i>I hope your wishes will come true and you go
to a bright place</i> ♫

156

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,900
♫ <i>From now on, there will be no lies, forget the mundane world</i> ♫

158
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,380
Didn't you see it all?

159
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,540
You know about what happened,

160
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,460
why do you ask again?

161
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,960
Chang Yi, let me go.

162
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,340
I've been locked up for too long in my life.

163
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,860
I don't have much time left.

164
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,400
I want to see the world I've never seen,

165
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,620
then it's not a waste of my life.

166
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,840
Just think of it as a release for me.

167
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,220
Is that all you have to say?

168
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,720
Yes.

169
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,180
Let me go.

170
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,740
Let me have a few days of freedom.

171
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
Ji Yunhe,

172
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,520
I won't give you anything you want.

173
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,140
If you really have the ability, kill me again.

174
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,580
Kill me, then you can leave.

175
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,200
♫ <i>With a pair of white wings, no more frost </i>♫

176
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:14,560
♫ <i>No more hiding yourself </i>♫

177
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,060
♫ <i>May you never fall into the net </i>♫

178
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,200
<i>Chang Yi, even if I tell you the truth now,</i>

179
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,180
<i>what can you do?</i>

180
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,460
<i>You've changed your mind because you hate me.</i>

181
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,420
<i>If I tell you that...</i>

182
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,640
<i>what I did was all for you,</i>

183
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,200
<i>and then I die,</i>

184
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,580
<i>how can you live with yourself?</i>

185
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,820
<i>I can't live for long anyway,</i>

186
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,840
<i>since I'm on stage,</i>

187
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,040
<i>I should act to the end. Shouldn't I?</i>

188
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,360
<i>Ji Yunhe, even if the love was true or not,</i>

189
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
<i>why won't you give me an explanation?</i>

190
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,140
Prince, there was a big mess over Qing Yao.

191
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,460
Even that Qifeng was whipped.

192
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,880
I heard it was for that Ji Yunhe again.

193
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,140
Prince, why do you look so horrible?

194
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,180
See, I told you that the North Abyss is not a good place.

195
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,040
Hand Yunhe over to me.

196
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,120
Why?

197
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,160
I heard about the rumors of Qing Shu's death.

198
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,080
It's not safe for Yunhe to stay here. I want to take her away.

199
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,300
No way.

200
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,200
The past is a misunderstanding.

201
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,860
Why won't you let it go?

202
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,560
Misunderstanding?

203
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,360
What a frivolous word.

204
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,520
Were you the one who was stabbed on the cliff,

205
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
whose father was killed, and whose homeland was sealed?

206
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,320
What right do you have to speak up for her?

207
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,580
I gave her the chance.

208
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,080
But every time she opens her mouth, she says nothing,

209
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,600
but just asks me for relief.

210
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,240
How could she ask me for relief?

211
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,620
I won't let anyone kill her,

212
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,380
but she can't leave either.

213
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,440
But it's more painful for her to be locked up than be killed.

214
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,540
Chang Yi, you're torturing her.

215
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,640
That's what I want.

216
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,640
I won't give her the freedom she wants until she dies.

217
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,820
It seems that I can't reason with you.

218
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,180
If you won't let her go, I'll take her away.

219
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,420
Sanyue, don't be impulsive.

220
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,220
If you fight here, you'll only get into trouble.

221
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,420
But Yunhe can't wait any longer.

222
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,220
If you get yourself into trouble,

223
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,260
how can you save Yunhe?

224
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,220
Chang Yi, we won't fight with you,

225
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,400
I still need to talk to you later about Ji Yunhe.

226
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,640
Looks like you also know what happened today.

227
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,560
I've told you that you shouldn't keep Ji Yunhe.

228
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,900
The so-called love is like a sword, which hurts both sides.

229
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,160
You have already tasted the bitter result.

230
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I thought you had learned to let it go.

231
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,800
I can let go of anyone and anything,

232
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,920
but not her.

233
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,040
In fact, what you really care about

234
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,200
is not the truth itself. Right?

235
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,680
I'm tired. You go back.

236
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,100
Evil fate.

237
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,310
So what if we fight?

238
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,780
He is no longer the Chang Yi who was injured in Thousand Flower Valley and at the mercy of others.

239
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,900
Even with a cut off tail and loss of spiritual power,

240
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,240
you may not be able to beat him.

241
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,179
Then we have to find a way to save Yunhe.

242
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,080
If we leave North Abyss, where can you take her?

243
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,800
Can Shunde and Immortal Master let her go?

244
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,080
Sanyue, where can you take her?

245
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,220
I'll find a chance to persuade him again.

246
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,420
North Abyss is cold, let's go back first.

247
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,920
Sorry. I'm just afraid you'll get cold.

248
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,740
It's late. I'll go back, and make some fish soup for you.

249
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,280
In fact,

250
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,500
you are no longer my servant,

251
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,860
so you don't have to do this for me anymore.

252
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,180
You are the Lynx prince with a heavy responsibility,

253
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,380
- I can't afford your care.
- How can't you afford it?

254
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,560
I can't.

255
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,140
You know what I'm thinking.

256
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,920
Sanyue, I know that you still have heart knots that haven't been unraveled.

257
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,860
I don't expect you to accept me again immediately.

258
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,640
It's just that some things can't be changed

259
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,440
once I've gotten used to them.

260
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,780
In fact, what I miss the most is the time

261
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,360
when I didn't have to think about anything

262
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,860
but just being your little lynx.

263
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Sanyue, believe me.

264
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
Just let it be, okay?

265
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
I want to get some air.

266
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,698
You are not yet healed, so don't accompany me. Just go back.

267
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:12,780
Yunhe has not yet been rescued, so don't toss yourself.

268
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,400
Then you should also take care of yourself for Yunhe, right?

269
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,720
I'll make you some hot soup to strengthen your body. It won't be bad, right?

270
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,880
- You really don't have to…
- Don't have to cook the same thing every time. I got it.

271
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll go back to make you a different soup.

272
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,780
Smells so good. Sanyue will love it for sure.

273
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,860
- Prince.
- Prince.

274
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,960
<i>[Li Shu's attendants Da Huan\Xiao Huan]</i>

275
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,780
- Surprised?
- You're surprised, right?

276
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,280
Didn't I tell you to stay in Leyou Mountain?

277
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,640
No, the North Abyss is so heavily guarded, how did you two get in?

278
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,640
Don't worry. We'll be wherever you and your vile spawn are.

279
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,840
Thank you.

280
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,260
You're welcome.

281
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,620
Prince, you've been in the North Abyss for a long time,

282
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,420
is your vile spawn gone?

283
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,300
Soon.

284
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,860
Put it down. I've been working hard on it.

285
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,740
Put it down.

286
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,440
How can you do this kind of work?

287
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
Xiao Huan, do it. Do it.

288
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
- Let me do it.
- He's clumsy.

289
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,840
Then let me do it.

290
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,910
Your hands are dirty. Go away.

291
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,900
Prince, you've changed.

292
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,060
In the past in Chongwu Mountain, you didn't even hold up the table when it fell,

293
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,640
but now how can you cut up the vegetables?

294
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,340
You…

295
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,120
I've changed.

296
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,420
You both go out.

297
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,380
Whoever takes work from me,

298
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,700
I'll be angry with him.

299
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,980
- Get out.
- No.

300
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,440
No.

301
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,140
Prince, you…

302
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,680
It's getting colder and colder.

303
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,660
It's not good to go outside in the frozen North Abyss.

304
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,780
Immortal friends who used to live alone

305
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,500
are now all huddled together

306
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,360
and quarreling every day, right?

307
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,780
What does this have to do with you?

308
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,960
I see that you read the official documents day and night.

309
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,440
Your eyes are tired.

310
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,360
Listen to me talk about the Spiritual Master experience.

311
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,700
I'm at least the first Spiritual Master in Thousand Flower Valley.

312
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,940
I have a general understanding

313
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,520
of the temperament of fellow Immortals.

314
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,020
You are no longer a member of Thousand Flower Valley.

315
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,720
Breaking into the Immortal Master Mansion alone,

316
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,800
just throwing Shunde into the fire,

317
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,180
the Immortal Master won't ignore it.

318
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,800
Has he ever troubled you?

319
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,000
With your understanding of him,

320
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,100
how would he trouble me?

321
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,760
Did he really do nothing?

322
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,080
These things have nothing to do with you.

323
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,600
What else in this world has to do with me?

324
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,620
Chang Yi, will you keep me like this...

325
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,080
even if I die?

326
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,760
You know what I like

327
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,660
and what I hate,

328
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,480
so you punish me in this way, torment me,

329
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,440
just to make me suffer with despair.

330
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,880
So what if it is?

331
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,180
Well, congratulations.

332
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,060
You made it.

333
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
<i>[Encyclopedia]</i>

334
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,180
Encyclopedia?

335
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,180
You still keep it.

336
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,760
There is a book to read,

337
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,200
which is better than nothing.

338
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,440
Big-tailed Fish, do you think...

339
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,280
you can tie me up with a book?

340
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,420
Is Xue Sanyue a tough one to deal with?

341
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,160
I don't think so.

342
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,960
Xiao Huan, you're still too young.

343
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,140
You can't just look at the surface of things.

344
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,420
Who was our prince once on Chongwu Mountain?

345
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,580
He was a playboy;

346
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,860
breaking the hearts of many people.

347
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,980
But look at him now,

348
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,460
he is ruled by this woman in such a submissive manner.

349
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,560
How terrible must she must be.

350
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,100
If she never forgives him,

351
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,740
then he will have to serve her for the rest of his life.

352
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,760
Who will inherit the family business?

353
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,440
So, Xiao Huan, it's up to us.

354
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,100
I don't believe that I can't find a way to eliminate her for him.

355
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,000
You think about it too; mainly you think about it.

356
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,960
I forgot what I just said.

357
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,700
It's not right.

358
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,000
Who are you? Who are you?

359
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,780
You are…

360
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,200
Luo Jinsang, right?

361
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,460
We met at Leyou Mountain before.

362
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,840
Yes.

363
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,140
I haven't seen you before.

364
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,840
Why are you sneaking around?

365
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,920
Are you spies sent by Fairy Shunde?

366
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,100
No.

367
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,880
- We're so cute and skinny, how could we be?
- Yes.

368
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,100
We are not.

369
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,440
Then, who you are?

370
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,300
We're our own people.

371
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,960
Who is their own?

372
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,140
<i>They are Li Shu's people.</i>

373
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,900
- Let's go.
- When does Li Shu have attendants?

374
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,760
And do you know that they're both…

375
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,220
Ghostly.

376
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,600
They're from Li Shu's home. Let them go.

377
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Senior, Chang Yi still refuses to let Yunhe come out.

378
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,140
Are you really not going to help them?

379
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,940
No.

380
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,680
But the heart knot in this world

381
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,000
needs to be solved by oneself after all.

382
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,560
No matter how others help, it's just temporary external help,

383
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,000
which is not a cure for the symptoms.

384
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,500
Besides, do you think the crux between them

385
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,680
is the question of letting go or not?

386
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,300
Then, what else could it be?

387
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,760
You'd better not understand.

388
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,560
I…

389
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,460
I don't care if it's a knot or not.

390
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,080
I really do not understand, and I don't want to understand.

391
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,920
Anyway, Chang Yi shouldn't keep Yunhe locked up.

392
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,940
I don't believe that there is no one in North Abyss who can conquer him.

393
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,000
Miss Ji, are you okay?

394
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,860
A'Ming.

395
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,980
Right, you've come to North Abyss, too.

396
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,080
But why are you here today?

397
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,420
Young Lord Qing ao's people are making a fuss,

398
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,760
so Prince Chang Yi won't let them come here anymore.

399
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,540
And he chose someone else to take care of you.

400
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,340
My husband said this job is free,

401
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,340
so I can accompany you

402
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,320
and take care of our children at the same time.

403
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,020
Mr. Kong Ming.

404
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,140
Do you know how to treat guests?

405
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,920
I treat guests, not you.

406
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,140
What do you want to do, Luo Jinsang?

407
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,040
Luo Jinsang.

408
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,400
You… Stop!

409
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,400
Luo Jinsang, just say it.

410
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,740
Don't smile so creepily.

411
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,300
I won't keep it a secret.

412
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,160
I'm here to ask you to help me beg Chang Yi to release Yunhe.

413
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,500
This bowl of sweet soup is my thank you gift.

414
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,200
If you succeed, I can make you sweet soup for a whole year.

415
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,680
Try it. It's not bad.

416
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,220
No need.

417
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,400
Then three years.

418
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,460
No. Ten years.

419
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,880
Okay?

420
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,500
It's useless.

421
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,720
I can't help you with this.

422
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,480
You can't get into Lake Island,

423
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,840
and Ji Yunhe can't get out.

424
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,880
Yunhe is my best sister and my best friend.

425
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I can't just watch her being locked up while I don't do anything about it.

426
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,640
Mr. Kong Ming, if you don't like this bowl of sweet soup,

427
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,420
I can give you whatever you like. Okay?

428
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,560
<i>Luo Jinsang is usually as fierce as a tiger,</i>

429
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,860
<i>she does have feelings after all.</i>

430
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,740
<i>Maybe before, I was too prejudiced against her.</i>

431
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
<i>She may not be that bad.</i>

432
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,360
<i>She is a woman after all.</i>

433
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,140
<i>I should be responsible for what happened to her that night.</i>

434
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,360
Luo Jinsang, I can be responsible…

435
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,520
That's true.

436
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,040
It's said in the script that you men like this.

437
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,880
Show a little weakness to you, then you'll be defenseless. Right?

438
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,400
- You…
- What?

439
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,640
Where's the token for Lake Island?

440
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,560
Chang Yi trusts you so much. You must have it.

441
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,660
I don't.

442
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,720
I don't believe that

443
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,540
I can't find the token for the island.

444
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,720
Then you can give up now.

445
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,620
Chang Yi, I…

446
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,800
Can I beg you?

447
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,720
Forget it. I won't beg you.

448
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,460
You are stubborn and go your own way. It's useless to beg you.

449
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,480
I will find a way by myself.

450
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,520
I have never seen you in such a mess.

451
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,980
You and Luo Jinsang...?

452
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,340
I have no intention to interfere in your affairs with Ji Yunhe.

453
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,620
Then I and Luo Jinsang…

454
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,100
It was just a fling between us.

455
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,060
I was thinking of taking responsibility for her.

456
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,560
But I didn't expect her to be so crazy and completely unknown to love.

457
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,800
Don't mention it. Don't mention it.

458
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,520
Now you have the time to care about such affairs.

459
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,180
Why are you here?

460
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,080
About the defense of the border.

461
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,160
Let's talk about it first and then discuss other things.

462
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,820
Don't ask, don't think, don't guess.

463
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,200
Miss Ji, have you really decided?

464
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,220
Do you really want to escape?

465
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,560
What a wonderful North Abyss.

466
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,080
It's not necessary to make a fuss here because of me, a dying woman.

467
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,200
A'Ming, thank you.

468
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,060
I haven't helped you much,

469
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,220
but you've given me too much in return.

470
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,920
And now you're willing to take the risk to help me hide.

471
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,560
Can you do me one more favor?

472
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,600
You can make me faint,

473
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,640
I'm fine with that.

474
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,580
Don't worry. I won't leave any trace.

475
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,960
<i>As long as I get into the snowy mountains, a large and vast place,</i>

476
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,640
<i>even Chang Yi won't be able to find me.</i>

477
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,080
<i>My body can't stand this kind of exertion after all.</i>

478
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,940
<i>But it is not worth holding back now.</i>

479
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,120
I think we should put more people here.

480
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,260
After all, this mountain road leads to all the fortresses of North Abyss. We can't ignore it.

481
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,380
What's wrong?

482
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,620
The barrier of Lake Island is broken.

483
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,440
Do you really think I've gone?

484
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,380
Let me tell you. I'm smart now.

485
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,600
I knew to wait for a chance now.

486
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,160
I've been out there all day, and I've finally gotten my chance.

487
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,680
You! Don't go!

488
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,500
Get out of the way.

489
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,900
No!

490
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,700
- Keep an eye on your lover.
- No.

491
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,280
She's not my…

492
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,620
Yunhe wants to leave, why do you have to stop her?

493
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,360
I'm free.

494
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,760
I'm finally free.

495
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,560
I'm finally free.

496
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,380
I knew the idea of running away was too naive,

497
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,420
but it was worth it.

498
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,080
Chang Yi, this is a romantic escape.

499
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,880
I feel like a warrior, fighting against the devil in my heart.

500
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,400
Get up. The ground is cold.

501
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,780
What a beautiful moon.

502
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
Lie down with me for a while.

503
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,100
Get up.

504
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
No.

505
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,540
I broke the barrier to come out in style,

506
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,380
so it's not decent for me to go back in this way.

507
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,500
If you want to be decent, why did you break the barrier?

508
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,960
I'm in good mood today and wanted to move around.

509
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,720
After all, I didn't demolish your house and run away.

510
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,180
Untie me and let me walk on my own.

511
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,940
Isn't it a bad idea to lead me back like this?

512
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,120
If I let you go, can you walk properly?

513
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,160
If you let me go,

514
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,620
I will definitely walk back well.

515
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,160
<i>Big-tailed Fish, sorry.</i>

516
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,060
<i>I must go.</i>

517
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:15,100
Ji Yunhe, did you think I'd still believe your words like before?

518
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,620
Does this work?

519
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,720
Chang Yi, let me go.

520
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,820
Also, release yourself.

521
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,580
You're in my control now.

522
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,980
I can tell you very clearly that

523
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,900
I will not give you the freedom you want,

524
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,160
as well as the relief you want.

525
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,040
You can only be in my control and not go anywhere.

526
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,960
What are you going to do?

527
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,340
I want you to remember that

528
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,140
except for beingby my side,

529
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,180
no matter where,

530
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,000
I won't give you any place to stay.

531
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,720
Did you really see it clearly?

532
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,260
Yes. Our four big eyes saw it.

533
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,600
- Right.
- Very clearly.

534
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,960
That merman took Ji Yunhe away

535
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,920
and branded her on the ear.

536
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,040
It was horrible, viciously.

537
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,180
- Yes.
- Branding?

538
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,640
Why did he take Ji Yunhe for?

539
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,340
He really went too far.

540
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,220
Too far!

541
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,420
He really wasted all my teachings in Thousand Flower Valley.

542
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,520
No. I have to teach him another lesson.

543
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,360
Don't let Sanyue know about this.

544
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,780
She's too close to Yunhe,

545
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,060
and I'm afraid that she'll be anxious and start a conflict with Chang Yi.

546
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,140
Remember.

547
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,220
We must not let her know. Don't worry.

548
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,280
What is it that I can't know?

549
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,920
Meteors. Meteors are coming.

550
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,600
- Where are the meteors?
- Here, can't you see?

551
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,280
- Meteors.
- Yeah, right here.

552
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Let's go.

553
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,000
Chang Yi, I'm not your property.

554
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,680
You can't trap me.

555
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,180
Can't I?

556
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,560
Prince, I don't think it's right to quarrel.

557
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,020
My husband said that we should be gentle with our partners.

558
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,840
Were you the one who let her go?

559
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,540
I won't run away again.

560
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,900
Don't touch her...

561
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,460
or I won't forgive you.

562
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,700
Miss Ji.

563
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,520
He's horrible. Why do you like a man like that?

564
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,000
He is very gentle.

565
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,700
Maybe he's irritated with me.

566
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,580
A'Ming, do you know how happy I was when I was running just now?

567
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,560
I felt the cold wind was sweet,

568
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,100
the night sky was bright,

569
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,860
even the air I breathed seemed to be free.

570
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,020
I felt no regrets at that moment.

571
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,800
Even I were to die right now,

572
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,540
I'd be okay with it.

573
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,260
Miss Ji, do you have something

574
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,880
stamped on your ear by the prince?

575
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,240
What does this mean?

576
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,240
He's trying to tell me that

577
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,700
I'm all his.

578
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,040
But I won't admit it.

579
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,620
I only belong to myself.

580
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,540
Whether in Thousand Flower Valley,

581
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,920
or Immortal Master Mansion,

582
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,520
or on this Lake Island,

583
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,760
no one can manipulate me and control me.

584
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,480
Not even Chang Yi.

585
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,740
Miss Ji, stop rubbing it.

586
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,900
You'll hurt yourself.

587
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,100
You… It will be painful.

588
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,860
Don't do that.

589
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,160
You'll hurt yourself. It's painful.

590
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,900
Miss Ji, stop rubbing it.

591
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,560
Prince.

592
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,780
Prince.

593
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,060
You had not returned for a long time,

594
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,140
so I went to Mr. Kong Ming to look for you

595
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,980
and he said you came here.

596
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,260
What happened?

597
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,180
Prince, who did you plant the merman mark on?

598
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,660
It's not Ji Yunhe, was it?

599
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,607
What? Is it really her?

600
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,560
Prince, even if you don't feel pain, I feel pain for you.

601
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,980
You know that the meaning of the merman mark,

602
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,120
it can connect the five senses of two people.

603
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,220
Ji Yunhe has been tormented by the backlash every day,

604
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,220
so why do you suffer with her?

605
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,420
Of course, it's because he can't get Yunhe off his mind.

606
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,080
- Are you here to persuade me, too?
- It's not a persuasion.

607
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,560
As your good friend, I can't bear to see you suffer, so I'm here to comfort you.

608
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,920
No need.

609
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,740
There is a saying that people shouldn't hang on one tree.

610
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,680
I won't force you to hug more trees.

611
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,600
After all, it will be lucky for us

612
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,900
to meet a tree that is worth spending a lifetime to protect.

613
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,240
But don't tie that tree to you and strangle it to death.

614
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,260
What about you?

615
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,860
Aren't you also tied firmly to your tree?

616
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,000
If you compare me with you, we are really different.

617
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,340
I run after Sanyue.

618
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,640
But if she really gets tired of me and wants to live alone and leave me,

619
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,580
I'll accept the ending.

620
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,480
What about you and Yunhe?

621
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,260
You do not want to kill her,

622
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,580
but stubbornly trapped her here

623
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,080
without giving her any choice.

624
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,400
So what?

625
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,720
She loves freedom, more than her life.

626
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,940
You trapped her like this, can she be happy?

627
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,660
Well. You don't want her to leave North Abyss, that is okay.

628
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,960
But you don't have to lock her up on Lake Island.

629
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,480
How oppressive.

630
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,740
Can't you each take a step back?

631
