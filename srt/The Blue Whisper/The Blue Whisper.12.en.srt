13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,500
The biggest pity is a sudden departure.

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,400
I wonder what Lin Canglan said to Haoqing before he died.

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,000
He'd better tell him where the antidote is.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
Yunhe!

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,800
You're here to deliver the antidote, right?

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,200
Xiaoxing, how is Haoqing now?

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Not good.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,600
He turns a blind eye to everything and locks himself in the hall.

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,000
Master passed away suddenly.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,600
There are rumors all over the valley now.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,700
Lin Canglan was so bad.

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,300
His coming to such a situation, he only has himself to blame.

25
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,200
This is called what goes around, comes around.

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Put aside Master's affairs for now.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Yunhe, you'd better visit Young Master.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Now, he only listens to you.

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,600
Okay.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Chang Yi, I know you are unhappy with Lin Haoqing.

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,400
But things occurred suddenly this time.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Lin Canglan's death has been hard on him.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,800
And rumors in the valley are heavily against him.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,600
I can't leave him alone.

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,900
So I...

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,600
Do it.

37
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,600
So generous?

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
If you don't go, you will always feel restless.

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,800
Just do it.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
Whatever you do,

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll always stay here waiting for you.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,100
Haoqing, you barricade yourself indoors.

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,300
<i>Are you trying to suffocate yourself?</i>

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,200
If you don't care about yourself,

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,000
at least care about Qu Xiaoxing.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm afraid before you suffocate yourself to death,

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,800
he has already died from anxiety.

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,600
Haoqing, I know you're there.

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
<i>When your mother passed away,</i>

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,200
<i>you locked yourself in the house for a long time.</i>

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,600
You're still the same as when you were a kid.

52
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,000
The sadder you feel,

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
the less you express.

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,790
<i>Yunhe is outside the room,</i>

55
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,000
just like before.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
As long as you need me,

57
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,000
<i>I'll accompany you through your toughest days.</i>

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,700
When Yunhe first came to the valley,

59
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,000
all my happiness was given to me by you.

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,400
I will never forget your favor

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,300
and betray your kindness.

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Thanks a lot, Yunhe.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
It's the best you can cheer up.

64
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,700
I've helped you pacify the elders.

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,660
- But the coronation ceremony...
- When everything is settled,

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
what's your plan?

67
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Will you still leave?

68
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,000
By then, please give me the antidote.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,800
I will leave secretly.

70
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,200
Of course, if you are willing to give me some rare magic weapons as a farewell gift,

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
that would be great.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,700
I have a question.

73
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,300
To protect the person you love,

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,800
how much price would you pay?

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
At any price.

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,400
What if she thinks you're treacherous and hates you to the core?

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,600
If it will keep him safe,

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm willing to do that.

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,100
Why are you asking?

80
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,000
Nothing.

81
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,400
I'll find the antidote hidden by my father as soon as possible.

82
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,800
Before you leave, attend my coronation ceremony.

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,700
Sure.

84
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,000
I congratulate you on getting what you wanted.

85
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Wonderful!

86
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Lin Haoqing is fairly bright.

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
Yunhe, we can finally leave.

88
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,600
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,400
I just feel that everything seems to be going too smoothly.

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,000
It makes me a little bit flustered.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
That's because you're used to bad luck.

92
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
When things go well, of course you'd be flustered.

93
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
No.

94
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,200
The expression in his eyes is unusual.

95
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,200
It feels like he's hiding some kind of secret.

96
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,500
Don't think too much.

97
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,400
Lin Haoqing was originally a bad guy.

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,800
He's never been sincere.

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
If you're that worried, we can depart soon.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
Tomorrow is the ceremony.

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,300
I promised to attend.

102
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,000
Everyone in this valley is still suspicious of Lin Canglan's death.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Those seniors supporting me

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,100
have concerns about his ascension.

105
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,400
In others' eyes, we're enemies.

106
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,300
They think I won't show up and bear witness.

107
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm the only one who can put him in that position myself

108
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
for there to be no criticism.

109
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Consider it as repaying all the debt I owe to him.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,400
Disputes for centuries have to be to an end.

111
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,000
You always think more about Lin Haoqing. I'm annoyed.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,300
What?

113
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Think about it. Chang Yi was sent here by Fairy Shunde.

114
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,300
If we want to take him away,

115
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,600
we need help from Lin Haoqing.

116
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,400
Besides, he is helping us to search for the antidote.

117
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,100
After tomorrow's ceremony, I'll ask him for the antidote.

118
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,700
If he can't find it, even at the cost of pulling down the hall, I'll find it.

119
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,400
Then we can leave together at once.

120
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,240
Really, at once?

121
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,600
Master.

122
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Greetings, Master.

123
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
<i>Master.</i>

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,400
<i>Greetings, Master.</i>

125
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,800
Save the courtesy, everyone.

126
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,400
After Father's death,

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,600
I took charge of Thousand Flower Valley without preparation.

128
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,900
In days to come, I will need everybody's help

129
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,000
to make Thousand Flower Valley prosper.

130
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,400
Nerd fish.

131
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,600
I've packed up. What about you?

132
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
Why do you have no luggage?

133
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,000
When I came here, I didn't bring anything.

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,700
I only need to take Yunhe with me.

135
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Nerd.

136
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Haoqing, now everything has been settled.

137
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
You can give me the antidote.

138
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Luo Luo and Chang Yi are waiting for me.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
You're so impatient.

140
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,700
Is there nothing for you to miss?

141
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,800
I've been locked up here for centuries.

142
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
What is there for me to miss?

143
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
But it seems that Guardian Ji

144
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
has no choice but to stay here.

145
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Lin Haoqing, what do you mean?

146
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,200
I've thought about your requirements.

147
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Ji Yunhe, you shouldn't leave and you can't leave.

148
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Yunhe is coming!

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,900
A crowd of people.

150
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
But none are Yunhe.

151
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,000
Qu Xiaoxing, what do you mean? What are you doing?

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,800
Sorry, you can't leave.

153
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Where is Yunhe?

154
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,300
Where is Yunhe?

155
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,900
Chang Yi,

156
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,800
for Yunhe's sake, you'd better behave yourself!

157
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,400
Qu Xiaoxing, what exactly do you mean?

158
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,900
Where on earth is Yunhe?

159
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,600
And where is Lin Haoqing?

160
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,900
Why are these guys surrounding us? Do you want to fight?

161
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,700
Listen. Although I am not a big figure,

162
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,200
I've always known what loyalty is.

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,400
I have always treated Ji Yunhe as my friend sincerely.

164
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Trust me.

165
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,400
If you don't want to bring her trouble,

166
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,500
do not resist.

167
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,700
You're making a joke, right?

168
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,600
As Master, you should know a word that carries weight.

169
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,000
Everyone has an innate duty.

170
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Lin Haoqing can let you go.

171
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
But Master of Thousand Flower Valley can't.

172
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,200
You and the merman are vital to the future and reputation of the valley.

173
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,300
He can't leave. Neither can you.

174
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,600
So since you became Master,

175
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,800
you'd already decided that by asking me to attend the ceremony

176
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,100
wasn't a farewell but a delay tactic.

177
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes.

178
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,700
Lin Haoqing! You're forcing me to turn against you again.

179
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't care.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,400
Thousand Flower Valley is the best place for you.

181
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,000
Fairy Shunde's manor is where the merman should go.

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,300
Live or not, it should be decided by me!

183
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,000
Everyone has the right to choose.

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
This right isn't given by others.

185
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
How can you decide for me?

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Take Guardian Ji away!

187
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Without my order, she can't step out of the valley.

188
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,900
Lin Haoqing!

189
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,800
Scale powder.

190
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
Luo Luo's scale powder.

191
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,200
I see...

192
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,000
When dealing with Qing Shu, you'd left a loop-hole.

193
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It was so early that you predicted today's situation.

194
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,200
You played with others' hearts.

195
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,000
What's the difference between you and Lin Canglan?

196
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Take her away.

197
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Yunhe.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,800
You've been trying for a long time.

199
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
Lin Haoqing's power is stronger than yours.

200
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,000
You can't break his barrier.

201
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,600
It's broken.

202
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,900
You can!

203
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,200
When did you practice behind my back?

204
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,000
Since Chang Yi broke his tail,

205
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,700
I often feel that my power has been in disarray.

206
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,200
But sometimes it is stable.

207
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,400
Let it be.

208
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,600
Try harder and rush out.

209
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,900
Chang Yi.

210
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Chang Yi.

211
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Lin Haoqing.

212
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,600
Yunhe, what's wrong?

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,200
Qu Xiaoxing, by following Lin Haoqing, you've become the leader of the Combat Force.

214
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,400
You learned how to stab me in the back.

215
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,800
Tell me! Where did you hide Chang Yi?

216
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Yunhe, I didn't intend to hurt you.

217
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Master has his own reasons.

218
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
He hid Chang Yi for your sake.

219
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
He's afraid you'll play the fool.

220
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
I only know is that I trusted him.

221
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
But he betrayed me.

222
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,000
So he's my enemy.

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,100
Qu Xiaoxing, I understand you did this for the valley.

224
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,600
I won't blame you for what happened today.

225
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,300
Are you willing to help me or turn against me?

226
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,200
Who let you in here?

227
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,400
Nobody can stop me from going where I want.

228
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Lin Canglan can't. Neither can you.

229
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,300
Where did you hide Chang Yi?

230
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,800
Are you all right?

231
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,600
Let Chang Yi go and give me the antidote.

232
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,200
I'll leave with him and Luo Luo.

233
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,300
From that moment on, we'll never meet or interfere with each other.

234
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,600
Or you'll never feel settled as the valley master.

235
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Ji Yunhe,

236
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,200
you really believe I'm that willing to be Master?

237
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Lin Haoqing,

238
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,200
My biggest regret was helping you.

239
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,000
Give me the antidote, or die.

240
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,800
Okay.

241
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Maybe that's the best ending.

242
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,200
Why won't you let me go?

243
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,000
Some answers are more than you can take.

244
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's not up to you whether I can take it or not.

245
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,700
You know my temper.

246
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,200
If you want to trap me,

247
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,200
I'll fight against you even to the very end.

248
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,400
Okay, come with me.

249
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The answer you want is inside.

250
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,500
It never occurred to me that Thousand Flower Valley had such a secret place.

251
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,100
The antidote must be here.

252
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Yunhe, aren't you curious about why my father, as the master,

253
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
was so respectful to Envoy Zhang?

254
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
Even on the day he died,

255
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
he welcomed Zhang in person.

256
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
It seemed that it was more crucial than his life.

257
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,600
What does this have to do with Frost?

258
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,000
Frost wasn't planted by father.

259
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,600
Same with us, he was enslaved to someone.

260
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,300
I used the Master Token to open this secret chamber.

261
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,500
And I found a letter and a box left by my father.

262
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
<i>Take it.</i>

263
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,300
A sign of Immortal Master Mansion?

264
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,500
Right.

265
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Immortal Master once practiced in Thousand Flower Valley.

266
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
After hundreds of years, he rose to fame.

267
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,000
Those in charge of the Lin family died unexpectedly one after another.

268
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Father found out that he had old grudges with the valley.

269
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,400
In order to protect himself, he chose to surrender.

270
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,800
Immortal Master used Frost to control the whole valley.

271
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,600
First, it was for revenge. Second, it was to exploit.

272
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,200
Yunhe, the one who traps you is not me, not my father,

273
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
but Fairy.

274
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,800
<i>Your Immortal Fairy.</i>

275
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Where's the merman?

276
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,400
Impossible. You're lying.

277
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
I saw it all with my own eyes.

278
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,700
My father also had the Frost mark on him.

279
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,200
Every Spiritual Master here

280
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,600
was planted with a Frost mark when being branded.

281
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,400
If they follow orders,

282
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
the antidotes would be sent here regularly.

283
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,600
But the number of my Frost attacks

284
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
are more frequent than the envoy's visits from Immortal Master Mansion.

285
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,000
What on earth did Lin Canglan do

286
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,300
when he passed power to me?

287
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
You are indeed different than the others.

288
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,300
Father had been trying to find out a way to solve the Frost mark seal using your body.

289
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,600
What did you say?

290
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,000
Father didn't want to be controlled by Frost

291
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
and had been looking for a way to solve it.

292
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
Later, he accidentally discovered

293
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,100
the power fusion of Heaven and Earth Immortals could suppress the Frost.

294
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,000
So Qing Shu and he infused power into the bodies of Spiritual Masters.

295
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
But if the two powers lose control when infused,

296
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,000
they will be incompatible and make Frost worse.

297
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,600
Most Spiritual Masters in the trial died.

298
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,800
Only you survived.

299
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,400
Lin Canglan planned step by step,

300
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,200
killing so many lives cruelly.

301
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,800
What did he ask you to do?

302
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,300
Use you as a refiner. Break the Frost.

303
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,000
Replace Immortal Master. Revive the Lins.

304
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,300
Revive the Lins?

305
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,000
Lin Canglan used the innocent as trials

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,800
but thought himself bearing the burden of humiliation

307
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,200
to revive the Lins.

308
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,000
Are you planning to carry on his unfulfilled wish?

309
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,800
I never agreed with what Father had done.

310
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,600
But you really can't leave.

311
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,800
The lines on your neck are already...

312
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
Don't threaten me!

313
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,600
Yunhe.

314
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
It's the drug to relieve the incompatible power.

315
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Take it.

316
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,100
Quickly.

317
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,100
You won't let me go

318
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,200
because the trial is still unsuccessful, right?

319
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,000
There are two powers inside your body.

320
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,600
Either break the Frost's control,

321
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,300
or all your meridians will be destroyed with no chance to recover.

322
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,200
How much time is left for me?

323
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Less than a month.

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So this is how it ends.

325
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Isn't it funny?

326
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Forget the merman.

327
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,200
What's more important than your life?

328
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
Trust me.

329
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
I can find a solution to save you.

330
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,800
<i>Master, Fairy Shunde is coming!</i>

331
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,200
Why is she in such a hurry?

332
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,900
It is said that she was traveling around the mountains, then passing by here to check on the situation with the merman.

333
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:41,700
Where's Chang Yi?

334
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,200
Spiritual Masters must obey Fairy Shunde's words.

335
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,040
They've gone to get him. I failed to stop them.

336
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,140
What should we do?

337
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,620
Invite her to Shrillwind Hall.

338
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,520
We'll be there later.

339
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,111
Calm down.

340
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,480
Greetings, Fairy Shunde.

341
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,160
Fairy Shunde is here.

342
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
Why didn't Master greet her arrival?

343
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,200
I beg your forgiveness.

344
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
Father passed away days before.

345
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,520
I've now succeeded as Master.

346
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,600
How dare you!

347
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,360
Master's death is a big issue.

348
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,340
Why did Thousand Flower Valley conceal it?

349
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,560
Things happened so quickly that we had no time to report.

350
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,180
Let it pass.

351
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Fairy Shunde is very satisfied with the merman's tail pearl tribute.

352
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,240
After Immortal Master comes out,

353
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,960
she intends to take the merman to greet Immortal Master.

354
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,040
Now she is here to examine the training result of the merman.

355
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,480
Bring the merman here.

356
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,659
What's he doing?

357
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,360
Calm down.

358
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,520
Unfortunately, there's no way to have both.

359
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,780
If I want the scale dress, then I'll never see that pretty tail again.

360
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,680
But you still deserve a reward.

361
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,080
I prefer the scale dress much more than the tail.

362
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,180
I'll have fun around Thousand Flower Valley for several days.

363
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:29,440
These days you need to stay around and serve me.

364
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,560
You rude merman!

365
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,420
Fairy Shunde's order is a blessing to you.

366
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,260
Your Fairy Shunde.

367
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,100
He just lost his tail.

368
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,180
He treads on land as if on a blade.

369
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,180
He can't make a long journey.

370
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,220
I beg your mercy.

371
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,320
I know you, the conceited Spiritual Master.

372
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,240
I've heard it's you who made the merman talk.

373
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,440
Yes.

374
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,080
You should understand that the mermaid you train must please the palace.

375
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,480
So now, can you let him go with me?

376
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,480
I'll never force him.

377
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,680
Guardian Ji, apologize quickly!

378
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,440
I've made a demand to Thousand Flower Valley.

379
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,900
Does Young Master, no, Master, still remember the demand?

380
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,040
Yes.

381
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,180
Then please repeat every word to Guardian Ji...

382
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,840
to help her recall it.

383
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,580
Fairy Shunde had three wishes.

384
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,060
First, the merman talks and surrenders to her.

385
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,760
Second?

386
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,140
I remember it clearly.

387
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,400
The second wish is for the merman to cut off his tail and never return to the sea.

388
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,760
Third, the merman sacrifices his pearl and never rebels.

389
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,860
So now, can you force him?

390
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,800
No.

391
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,738
Stop!

392
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,240
Let her go.

393
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,340
I will do whatever you want.

394
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,180
I am Fairy Shunde.

395
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,080
Every treasure in the world is within my reach.

396
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,560
You serving me is already settled.

397
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,200
How can you bargain with me?

398
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,420
I beg your forgiveness.

399
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,100
The failure of taming the merman is Haoqing's fault.

400
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,660
Please give me another two days.

401
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,580
I'll definitely give you a satisfactory answer.

402
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,600
Please, I beg your mercy.

403
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,760
<i>Please, we beg your mercy.</i>

404
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,640
I beg your forgiveness.

405
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,760
I'm aware of my fault.

406
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,780
Fairy Shunde.

407
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,880
<i>[Ji Chengyu, Disciple of Immortal Master Mansion]</i>

408
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,280
Master will come out soon. It is not suitable to see blood.

409
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,140
The merman was born to be wild and intractable.

410
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,040
Since this Spiritual Master knows his temper,

411
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,220
why not show mercy and give them more time?

412
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,280
You're always the one who knows Master best.

413
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,700
I'll take your advice this time.

414
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,800
Remove this rope.

415
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,700
I don't like it.

416
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,720
With this confining spell, he can't escape.

417
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,020
This merman can't escape the mistake he made, and it is not an exaggeration that he deserves to have his bones broken.

418
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,380
Now asking you to serve me is letting you go easily.

419
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,040
If he escapes, I'll blame his Spiritual Master for neglecting her duty

420
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,620
and punish her together by thunder strikes.

421
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,140
Guardian Ji, take care of him well.

422
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,860
Remember, to me, you're nothing but a vase or a teacup in the palace.

423
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,220
If I'm happy, I'll cast a glance at you.

424
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,900
If I'm unhappy, I can throw you away.

425
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,420
The only thing you should do is please me.

426
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,540
Maybe if you make me happy, I'll fulfill some of your wishes.

427
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,980
My enthusiasm for traveling has been a let down.

428
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,340
I'll give you another ten days.

429
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,100
I don't want to see today's situation again.

430
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,120
Lead the merman away.

431
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,820
Senior, I was frightened by you.
<i>[Ji Ning, Disciple of Immortal Master Mansion]</i>

432
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,040
You're the one Master trusts most.

433
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,260
Even Fairy Shunde calls you "Senior."

434
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,340
But she is Fairy Shunde, we can't offend her.

435
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,400
I know how far to go and when to stop.

436
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,760
You're always running here and there.

437
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,620
If you are seen by Master, you'll be criticized.

438
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,600
Get someone to accompany Fairy Shunde. I'll be with you later.

439
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay.

440
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,246
Senior?

441
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,420
Why are you going back?

442
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm Ji Chengyu, a disciple of Immortal Master Mansion.

443
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,400
Fairy Shunde was too willful.

444
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,220
I apologize for her to Guardian.

445
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,340
As the disciple of Immortal Master Mansion,

446
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,240
why are you apologizing to me?

447
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,480
Although Immortal Master Mansion takes charge of Spiritual Masters,

448
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,100
it can't live without support from Spiritual Masters.

449
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,800
I just hope that Fairy Shunde's overbearing nature

450
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,600
won't damage our relationship.

451
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,780
Actually, I used to have an attendant, too.

452
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,320
I rescued him from the forest.

453
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,260
He grew up by traveling with me.

454
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,000
Sometimes I was unclear

455
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,200
whether we were servant and master, or brothers.

456
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,620
Just now, your trying to save the merman reminded me of my past.

457
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,660
Thank you for interceding for me.

458
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,520
It's just a lift of the finger. I'm a Spiritual Master, too.

459
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,520
I just hope Guardian Ji doesn't get in trouble for this.

460
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,300
How is the attendant you mentioned now?

461
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,340
Fairy Shunde was interested in him.

462
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,240
After being taken away, he was never heard from again.

463
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,878
I know that Guardian and the merman might have endured hardships together,

464
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:16,380
and have friendship and concern.

465
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,500
But please remember.

466
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,340
Taming the merman is only a mission. Just complete it.

467
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,800
Don't devote too much feeling.

468
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,600
Or it'll hurt you and others.

469
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,460
Maybe, in the end, even I can't help you.

470
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,740
That's all I want to say.

471
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,020
Conduct yourself well.

472
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,860
<i>What a pity.</i>

473
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,620
<i>His advice comes too late.</i>

474
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,160
<i>I don't want Chang Yi to have such an ending.</i>

475
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,240
How is the injury on your back?

476
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,940
I was whipped every two or three days. I'm used to it.

477
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,200
Don't worry.

478
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Chang Yi, we'll leave ten days from now.

479
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,640
In these days, I'll try my best to remove the confining spell.

480
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,598
Then I'll draw the guards away.

481
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,998
That is when you will escape.

482
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,820
Now you need to have a good rest, so you can run faster when escaping.

483
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,664
What about you?

484
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,340
I have my way to escape.

485
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,420
I don't believe you. I won't leave.

486
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,960
Chang Yi, if you don't leave now,

487
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,480
every day in the future you'll experience today's humiliation.

488
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,360
Every day, you'll have to bend your knees and say those words against your will.

489
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,100
Did you forget the feeling of freedom?

490
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,489
I don't forget.

491
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:05,714
But you are more important.

492
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,520
You promised that no matter what happened,

493
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,220
you would always be with me.

494
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,739
I'll always keep my words.

495
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,400
Don't look down on me.

496
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,600
At least I am Guardian of the Thousand Flower Valley.

497
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,719
I can get out of here.

498
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,159
By the way, when you escape,

499
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,500
Fairy Shunde will ask guards to catch you.

500
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,120
You'll need the merman pearl to save your life.

501
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,360
Take it out now.

502
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,736
When we meet again, you can return it to me then.

503
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,540
Ji Yunhe, your acting is becoming worse and worse.

504
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
What happened to the pearl?

505
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,080
Why can't I take it out?

506
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,800
The merman pearl is a keepsake.

507
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,320
The promise is still there,

508
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,560
so the keepsake has no reason to be taken out.

509
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,240
Immortal Fairy Shunde has already spoken.

510
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,000
Once I'm gone, all the blame will be directed at you.

511
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,600
You'll have no chance to escape.

512
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,160
I know that the thunder penalty is to be subject to nine strikes of thunder.

513
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,260
Hardly anyone can survive and step off the penalty platform.

514
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,800
Yunhe, I won't leave you alone.

515
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,080
And I can't watch you die.

516
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,820
<i>Your body can't stand such strong power.</i>

517
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,940
<i>You will die.</i>

518
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,798
I'm not negotiating with you.

519
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,677
You must leave.

520

00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,220

528

You don't want me to be trapped again.

529
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,600
I also don't want to see you floating aimlessly around in this world.

530
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,295
So... you must leave.

00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,540
Yunhe!

535
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,620
Ji Yunhe, how long were you going to hide it from me?

536
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,200
Ji Yunhe, Master has already told us about your situation.

537
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,440
Stop here. Look at your faces.

538
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,180
Why are you so upset?

539
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,400
I can't believe that Lin Haoqing has such a loose tongue.

540
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,920
Ji Yunhe, you're a liar!

541
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,720
Big liar! All you do is lie to me!

542
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,520
You are always lying to me!

543
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,320
Luo Luo, I... I can't breathe.

544
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,260
I can't breathe.

545
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,700
You lied to me. You deserve it.

546
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,620
Okay, I deserve it.

547
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm on the verge of death, anyway.

548
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,180
Can I ask you for a favor?

549
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,320
Sure.

550
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,440
With me here, Chang Yi won't leave.

551
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,460
But if I tell him I'll die soon, he won't leave either.

552
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,760
The days given by Fairy Shunde are running out.

553
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,060
Please help me find a way to drive Chang Yi away.

554
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,620
Why are you promising her?

555
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,880
Ji Yunhe, you're such a fool!

556
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,840
You often think for others.

557
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,080
Can't you think for yourself this time?

558
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,920
If I only think for myself, can I still be regarded as your friend?

559
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,438
Luo Luo. Xiaoxing.

560
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,140
Meeting you guys was the greatest blessing of my life.

561
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,640
Please do me this last favor.

562
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,700
Don't look at me like that! I won't help you.

563
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,972
Luo Luo.

564
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,797
That's okay.

565
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,380
Luo Luo.

566
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:05,000
<i>Ji Yunhe, I'll never give up your life.</i>

567
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,240
Nerd fish. Listen to me.

568
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,480
Even if you don't drink or eat, Yunhe won't come to see you.

569
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,386
Are you clear?

570
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,680
You'd better listen to her and escape first.

571
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,740
I'll put everything here.

572
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,180
Listen. Do not waste food.

573
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,380
Do not waste my magic stones.

574
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,720
If she doesn't come, I won't eat.

575
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,000
There's something I need to tell her in person.

576
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,900
You're stubborn.

577
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,600
I won't go.

578
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,340
And I don't want to know it.

579
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,860
Then, I don't care if he boils down like this and ruins his body.

580
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,800
That's okay, because you're still going to bring him food.

581
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,520
He needs some power to recover.

582
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,020
You two are weird.

583
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,100
As stubborn as donkeys.

If it isn't hard for me, I can help you.

I want to meet Fairy Shunde.

Chang Yi still denies your help.

He refuses to leave.

604
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,300
Yunhe, can we leave him alone?

605
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,120
Let's think about how to save you. Can we?

606
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,720
What if you dissect me and return the merman pearl to Chang Yi?

607
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,260
Everything is okay now. Don't say things like that.

608
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,280
If Shunde finds that there's no pearl inside Chang Yi,

609
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,340
Chang Yi will suffer.

610
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,280
But if Chang Yi has a pearl,

611
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,640
he will have a chance to survive.

612
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,221
Stop.

613
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,860
I won't listen to you.

614
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:26,240
Yunhe, for an unknown reason, Chang Yi went to visit Fairy Shunde suddenly.
