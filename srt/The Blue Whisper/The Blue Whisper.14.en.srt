00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,640
<i>Really amazing.</i>

15
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,380
It's a wishing tree.

16
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,240
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm happy to have met you here.

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,430
Why not write your wish on a silk ribbon and tie it to the wishing tree.

19
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,370
The Immortals of Heaven will help you fulfill that.

20
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,520
Yunhe, what strange magic spell is this?

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,700
Is it kind of like the magic spell that you'll recover from a pat on the head?

22
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,380
Not really.

23
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,800
Well. Then shall we do it?

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,480
No matter if it can be realized or not, it's like a hope for you.

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,580
A wish will come true when you believe in it.

26
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,400
Why don't you have a try?

27
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,260
Please, Miss.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,108
Come on.

29
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,380
"I hope that my loved one can enjoy a safe and happy life."

30
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,600
Miss, if you speak your wish aloud, it won't come true.

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,480
Please write one more.

32
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,060
It's enough.

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,380
He just wanted us to write one more, so he can make more money.

34
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,360
Just think about it. These ribbons are for people to make wishes to the Immortals of Heaven,

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
like the Immortal of Marriage and Judge of Life.

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,160
If you don't speak your wish aloud, how can they hear your wish?

37
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,680
Then we speak our wishes aloud.

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,120
Hope that my loved one can enjoy

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,760
a safe and happy life.

40
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,600
Well, can they hear it now?

41
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,680
Yunhe, what's wrong?

42
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,160
It's okay.

43
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,640
I just feel that the merman pearl is burning in my chest.

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,920
Then try to hear what it says.

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,020
It says, says...

46
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,420
It's okay. Take it easy.

47
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,900
Take your time.

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,340
It says you speak not aloud enough.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,440
I hope that my loved one can enjoy a safe and happy life.

50
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,380
<i>Chang Yi,</i>

51
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,341
<i>I hope everything will be good in your future.</i>

52
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,300
<i>Look! It's fireworks!</i>

53
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,880
<i>It's really beautiful!</i>

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,420
Sir, would you write down your wish to protect your loved one?

55
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,600
No, thanks.

56
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,600
<i>I will protect her on my own.</i>

57
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,700
Master, everything is ready.

58
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,340
Tell Yunhe the position.

59
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,220
She will make the next move herself.

60
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,732
Yes.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,280

Yeah, they are.

74
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,340

77
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,340
Is this festival show almost at its end?

78
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,560
Is our journey also coming to an end?

79
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,180
Not at all.

80
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,280
There is another surprise for you.

81
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,980
Okay. Open your eyes.

82
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,460
Where are we?

83
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,260
When we were at the market, I bought it and asked someone to arrange it.

84
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,180
Look. Both of us like the human world.

85
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,740
If we can't live here, how can we know the happiness of this world?

86
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,219
Come on.

87
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,420
It's remote here.

88
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,700
No one can find us.

89
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,900
Ji Chengyu said that we can stay here till midnight and go back.

90
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,280
I care about details.

91
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,348
I won't go back one second earlier.

92
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,920
Luo Luo said one should know how to pay back when he receives a gift.

93
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,000
You've sent me a lot of gifts.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,139
But I only have pearls and scales to return.

95
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:39,320
Won't you mind this or get angry with me?

96
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,740
No.

97
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,540
Why would I mind that?

98
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,740
Big-tailed Fish, you've given me everything you have.

99
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,840
What do you have?

100
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,280
I have this.

101
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,880
It's not worth anything.

102
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Why do you still keep it?

103
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,180
This is the first gift you sent me.

104
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,100
For me, it's very precious.

105
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,480
Of course, I'll keep it.

106
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,480
Chang Yi, if you had the ability to control your life,

107
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,020
what kind of life would you want to live?

108
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,300
If I can be with you, any life is fine.

109
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,380
What do you want to do with me

110
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,820
when you're with me?

111
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,780
Eat candied garlic?

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,020
No.

113
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,020
Okay. Then you don't eat the candied garlic, I'll eat the candied garlic.

114
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,140
I'll eat a lot of it and smoke you with it with my breath.

115
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,180
It's smoke you with it,

116
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,220
not kiss you.

117
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,140
Let's not talk about that, let's talk about something else.

118
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,380
We can build a house by the sea.

119
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,800
I can save a room for Luo Luo.

120
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,640
Well. You can do the gardening and go fishing every day.

121
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,000
And I'll weave at home.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,420
You don't need to work.

123
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,000
Then what should I do?

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
Enjoy the food and sunshine?

125
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,260
Just like tonight, think about nothing and be happy.

126
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,560
Let me imagine that.

127
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,960
We can live that life in the future.

128
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,320
You said we wouldn't be separated only if we were linked by the red line.

129
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,751
Here.

130
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,580
Wear it.

131
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,860
No matter where you are, I can find you.

132
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,460
Yunhe, whether it is now or in the afterlife,

133
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,520
I will find you.

134
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,340
And we will be together, right?

135
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,871
I'll wait for you.

136
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:58,760
But this time, we must separate.

137
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Chang Yi, love has a start and an end.

138
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,620
Say goodbye to me one last time.

139
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,560
How do I say goodbye?

140
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,266
I'll teach you.

141
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,760
<i>I hope in the next life,</i>

142
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,740
<i>I can meet you earlier amongst the crowd.</i>

143
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,760
Big-tailed Fish, it's midnight.

144
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,620
It comes to an end finally.

145
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,780
Yunhe, stay here.

146
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,660
Don't go back to the camp with me.

147
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,940
Why?

148
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,460
Father said, "As long as you don't see it with your own eyes,

149
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,680
it won't be so hard to leave."

150
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,360
I had a very happy and free night.

151
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,220
Because you are not in Thousand Flower Valley?

152
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,320
Kind of.

153
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,820
Only now do I understand that

154
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,740
the freedom I want is not traveling a long distance,

155
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,040
but it's a brave heart.

156
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,640
From now on, I won't be afraid of anything.

157
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,660
I hope that you can be happy

158
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,000
the rest of your life, like tonight.

159
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,920
Also, I hope you can be brave and free.

160
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,460
I'm not hurt.

161
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,040
You'll be more healthy by patting.

162
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,578
Chang Yi, do you know what you are like?

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,040
You're like a story.

00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
What story?

165
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,320
You have all kinds of good qualities I hope for.

166
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,980
Honesty and toughness.

167
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,980
Tender but strong.

168
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,420
I hope you can keep what you have.

169
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,540
Don't stop here.

194
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,900
From the beginning, taking the world is not just for fun.

195
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,040
Think about it more before taking action. You haven't changed at all.

196
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,600
I did have impulsive thoughts.

197
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,880
But I'm clear.

198
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,360
Even if I run away with him, it would only be for a few days.

199
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,980
If I'm not here, Thousand Flower Valley will be implicated.

200
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,060
It's not a good deal.

201
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,820
Please take care of Chang Yi.

202
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,980
When he wakes up, just do as we planned.

203
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,740
Even I tell him, it's all a bunch of lies.

204
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,660
Will he leave quietly?

205
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,500
He hates lies.

206
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,180
If he knows that I was using him and was trying to get something from him,

207
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,060
he won't come back to find me.

208
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,740
Ji Chengyu's guards have gotten used to Chang Yi and I coming and going freely.

209
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,540
They won't realize that Cheng Yi has disappeared for a while.

210
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,140
This is a remote place, and I have also set barriers.

211
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,540
No one knows he is here.

212
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,640
When Fairy Shunde punishes me and it comes to an end,

213
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,380
I hope you can help Chang Yi escape quietly.

214
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,660
Since you've made up your mind to lie to him, why do you go to great lengths to take him around like this?

215
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:31,900
The more beautiful a dream is created, the more hopeless it will be when it is destroyed.

216
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,520
From the start, I wanted him to give up.

217
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,540
Moreover, I'm not selfish.

218
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm just an ordinary Immortal.

219
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,880
I'm scared of death.

220
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,480
But if I can have some good memories before I die,

221
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,240
I'm not wasting my life.

222
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,780
Brother, this is the last and perfect spirit training in my life.

223
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,080
I hope you can keep your promise.

224
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,580
I have no other wishes.

225
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,520
No. No.

226
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
You said you could find a solution.

227
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,820
How could it be this solution? Sacrificing yourself?

228
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,740
Why are you here, Luo Luo? I told you to stay in the camp.

229
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,020
Well, I was worried about you so I followed you.

230
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,680
Or I wouldn't have heard what you said just now.

231
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,380
We had a deal that we were going to purchase an island together.

232
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,200
I don't think I can keep my promise.

233
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,240
Luo Luo, you don't need to follow me anymore.

234
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,020
You can travel freely around the world.

235
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,460
I travel on my own? What do you mean?

236
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,120
An Immortal Island can be called a fairyland, it's because we're together.

237
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,300
Are you going to abandon me, just because of Chang Yi?

238
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,660
If I'm given one more chance,

239
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,020
even breaking your legs, I'd stop you from seeing him.

240
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,700
Luo Luo, I've seen the best of the world.

241
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,220
It's the freedom I expect.

242
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,740
I'm satisfied, but you are not.

243
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,960
There are so many things you haven't experienced.

244
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,158
From now on, live for yourself.

245
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,280
Ji Yunhe.

246
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,360
You liar. You are the biggest liar in the world.

247
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,980
<i>Big-tailed Fish, you're really beautiful.</i>

248
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,480
<i>Welcome to Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

249
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,780
<i>Hello.</i>

250
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,560
<i>Ji Yunhe.</i>

251
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,080
♫ <i>A gentle smile on lips...</i> ♫

252
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,960
<i>It's said that a merman only loves one person in his life.</i>

253
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,280
<i>Since we can't do it, we don't ask for a lifetime.</i>

254
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,780
<i>Just fight for the day.</i>

255
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,100
<i>Let's spend our last time happily. Okay?</i>

256
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,600
♫ <i>In the corridor at the end of the world</i> ♫

257
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,700
♫ <i>I seem to see us there out of the corner of my eyes</i> ♫

258
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,030
Maybe... this will be a good ending.

259
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,880
The merman is lost. The merman is lost. Come to help!

260
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,040
- Come on.
- Quickly. Now.

261
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,281
Come on.

262
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,940
Guardian Ji, the merman has run away. Is it you?

263
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,100
The merman's power is so strong.

264
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,600
If he escapes, I'm afraid normal people can't catch him.

265
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,100
Where did you hide him?

266
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,800
If Fairy finds out, do you know the results will be?

267
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,100
I'm afraid I'll be sentenced to death.

268
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,280
I'm so sorry to have gotten you involved and have you punished with me.

269
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,260
But for Immortal Master, you're his favorite disciple.

270
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,140
With your noble status, even Fairy Shunde can't kill you as she wants.

271
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,280
I'm so sorry, but you were also in my plan.

272
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,400
I need one team to stay here and watch over Guardian Ji.

273
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,240
<i>The rest, split up to hunt the merman</i>

274
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,550
If you find anything, send a signal immediately.

275
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,460
- Got it!
- Got it!

276
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,220
Ji Ning, let's search separately.

277
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,002
Yes, Senior.

278
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,560
Big-tailed Fish.

279
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,460
After tonight,

280
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,920
everything will come to an end.

281
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,780
Master, Chang Yi is awake.

282
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,860
It's time to tell him what Yunhe has told us.

283
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,710
Where's Luo Jinsang?

284
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,380
She cried so sadly that she almost lost consciousness.

285
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,300
So I gave her a calming nerve tonic to get some rest.

286
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,320
Of course, we don't know what she will be like when she wakes up later.

287
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,924
That's fine.

288
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,720
What are you going to do?

289
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,460
Where's Yunhe?

290
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,100
She has gone back and pleaded guilty.

291
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,340
What?

292
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,080
Ji Yunhe is too kindhearted to hand you over to Fairy Shunde.

293
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,560
So she locked you up here.

294
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,480
Now she's gone back to be punished for it.

295
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,260
Let me go. I'll find her.

296
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,360
For Ji Yunhe, you'll risk anything you have. Right?

297
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,780
Well, now, you can deal with it by yourself.

298
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,260
What are you doing?

299
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,580
Lin Haoqing, you promised Yunhe that you'd set him free when everything was over.

300
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,020
Are you out of your mind? Don't you remember what she said?

301
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,540
If that merman escapes in the end, you know, Fairy Shunde will kill her.

302
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,900
But you'd given your words to her.

303
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,540
She's so stubborn.

304
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,000
Once she knows you lied to her, she will hate you forever.

305
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,940
She can't hate me if she dies.

306
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,780
I'll try everything to save her.

307
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,180
The most important thing is that she can't risk her life for that merman

308
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,420
nor get killed by Fairy Shunde.

309
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,160
So why did you lie to her if you don't want her to die?

310
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,640
Wait a second. Since all this has happened,

311
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,140
you've been planning to save her

312
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,420
by keeping Chang Yi here around her?

313
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,780
You've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

314
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,286
That's right.

315
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,420
I wanted him to stay at first.

316
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,100
Because we know what kind of person Ji Yunhe is.

317
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,780
If I had rejected what she asked for, she'd have tried another way.

318
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,580
In case she puts herself in danger for it,

319
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,712
the best way is to accept her plan.

320
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:04,060
Do you love Ji Yunhe?

321
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,660
Do you really like her?

322
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,020
The jealousy and hatred for Chang Yi

323
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,180
has driven you to let him go back now.

324
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,620
So in this way, Ji Yunhe won't be able to stop him falling into the trap.

325
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,260
It's not for my feelings.

326
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,380
What I did was just tell him the truth.

327
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,500
All I want is that he can go back and get caught by Fairy Shunde.

328
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
I don't care if he loses his life,

329
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,900
but I care if Yunhe still has a chance to live,

330
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,640
even it's a slim chance.

331
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:46,920
<i>- Yunhe.
- The merman is here.</i>

332
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,652
<i>Yunhe!</i>

333
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,700
<i>Yunhe, don't sacrifice yourself to save me.</i>

334
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,380
<i>I'm leaving with you together.</i>

335
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,940
<i>Big-tailed Fish, I'm sorry.</i>

336
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,340
<i>I didn't expect I would still have to be so cruel to you in the end.</i>

337
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,561
Yunhe!

338
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,720
Yunhe.

339
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,711
Idiot.

340
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:23,140
I left you a way to survive, but you came back to ask for death.

341
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,218
Yunhe, what are you talking about?

342
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:30,480
I got the merman pearl, so I can finally stop my acting now.

343
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,580
I used to be nice to you because you still had some value.

344
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,820
I had to tame you step by step, making you talk,

345
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,980
cutting off your tail, and giving me your pearl.

346
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,000
Now you've got nothing and you're just a waste.

347
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,440
For me, you have no value at all.

348
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,260
Yunhe, what's wrong with you?

349
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,180
You've been nice to me and suffered a lot for me.

350
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,620
And even got whipped by Fairy Shunde.

351
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,620
I won't forget it.

352
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,380
If I hadn't taken the bitterness, how could you have treated me so sincerely?

353
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,900
What made us close was a lie.

354
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,600
Did you really believe that I loved you that deeply?

355
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,080
The word "love."

356
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,760
I don't know how many times I've been saying it to others for hundreds of years.

357
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,220
The so-called control of the heart is actually a tug of war.

358
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,500
But it was easy to do with some so-called skills.

359
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,620
Since I played with you,

360
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,318
I could only do my best.

361
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,040
Go away. Don't bother me anymore.

362
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,238
Yunhe, this is not who you are.

363
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:40,120
You're different from them.

364
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,453
What has happened to you?

365
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,298
Of course, I'm different.

366
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:46,458
I am Ji Yunhe.

367
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,960
They can't tame you, but only I can.

368
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,120
I'm thirsty for power and fortune.

369
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,260
How could I give up my promising future for you?

370
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Big-tailed Fish.

371
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,020
The title should be changed.

372
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,820
You're just a merman,

373
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,640
which means you're nothing but a fish.

374
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,360
For all this time,

375
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Just thinking about your big tail makes me sick

376
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,240
I won't believe anything you say.

377
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,860
<i>- The merman is here.</i>
- I'm taking you away.

378
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,460
<i>Arrest him!</i>

379
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,680
There are so many guards.

380
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,720
He may have been caught already.

381
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,440
This time, even Yunhe can't save him anymore.

382
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,480
<i>Get them!</i>

383
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,911
<i>Go!</i>

384
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,080
Chang Yi actually escaped and brought Yun He with him.

385
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,780
What did they both do?

386
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,140
<i>Ji Yunhe, you still can't let go of that merman?</i>

387
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,400
What should we do?

388
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,300
It is a felony to run away with a merman.

389
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,740
- If she gets caught by Fairy Shunde, she will die.
- What are you doing?

390
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,000
Believe it or not, I told you all I wanted was to ensure that she could survive.

391
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,020
Fine, I believe you.

392
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,820
No one can see us here. Our valley is out of this.

393
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,286
Senior Brother!

394
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,620
Senior Brother, a team of disciples from Immortal Master Mansion hasn't arrived.

395
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,980
Someone else stopped them.

396
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,180
Where's the merman and Guardian Ji?

397
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,500
They're heading that way.

398
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,120
Senior Brother, they won't escape out of here. Right?

399
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,720
Their road will soon come to an end. Follow me.

400
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,180
Yes.

401
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,620
There is no way out.

402
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,607
Let me go.

403
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:35,258
I won't.

404
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,400
You said that as long as we are together, there is nothing to be afraid of.

405
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,540
You'll be free after you get out of here.

406
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,975
You must have misunderstood something.

407
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,380
The freedom I asked for

408
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,640
is to live in an unrestrained way

409
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,600
and to travel to wherever I like.

410
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,558
It's not a life-long exile.

411
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:01,200
Not to run away with a man who only brings troubles for me.

412
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,000
Can't you understand it, idiot?

413
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,460
This is for the last time.

414
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,271
Let me go.

415
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,760
Ji Yunhe, what you have said maybe lies.

416
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,098
What you think in your heart is the truth.

417
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:35,700
I understand your heart.

418
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Is there anything you can't say?

419
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,360
Why won't you tell me about it?

420
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,960
I can't believe my tricks worked so well

421
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,080
and have made you love me so much.

422
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,538
Of course, what I told you wasn't always a lie.

423
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:02,360
If I didn't say or do anything real,

424
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,100
you wouldn't have trusted me with your heart.

425
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,025
I can give you my love,

426
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:12,040
but I can take it back from you.

427
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,960
This game of taming you should have ended earlier.

428
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,920
I'm tired now

429
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,960
of cheating you over and over again.

430
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,063
Don't you feel the same?

431
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,604
Hard to believe it?

432
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:38,120
Well, listen carefully.

433
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,180
Every word and every line I've told you

434
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,540
was never sincere.

435
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,338
If you want to stay here, you will die here.

436
00:32:49,338 --> 00:32:54,260
But for me, your life means nothing.

437
00:32:54,962 --> 00:32:59,668
...means nothing.

Big-tailed Fish, this was the only way.

454
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,560
Do you know what will happen to you in the end?

455
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,280
I know it, of course.

456
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,400
But how dare you come to arrest my merman?

457
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,220
<i>How dare you!</i>

458
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,920
It's really fun tonight.

459
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,180
Even Fairy Shunde has come here by herself.

460
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,640
How dare you disobey my orders!

461
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,520
Are you asking for death?

462
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,370
Obey your orders?

463
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,120
It depends on who gives me the orders.

464
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,780
You have Immortal Master behind you to do whatever you want.

465
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,600
But I'm here to prove to you that not everything in this world can be yours.

466
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,020
You ignored Chang Yi's good intentions, requited kindness with enmity, and passed a sentence on him.

467
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,360
I'm glad you came today,

468
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,480
so I will take revenge

469
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,040
for what you've done to him.

470
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,320
Nonsense.

471
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,020
Ji Chengyu, kill her for me.

472
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,800
Everyone else, go down the mountain to find the merman.

473
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,334
<i>Yes!</i>

474
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,900
No one can leave here.

475
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,300
The one who crosses me to go down this cliff will be punished!

476
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,980
Kill her.

477
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,400
Kill this traitor.

478
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,020
You're losers. Go get her.

479
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:27,000
Guardian Ji, please stop.

480
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,200
I know you're trying to buy time for that merman.

481
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,220
But you can't hold on any longer.

482
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,380
I can't retreat tonight,

483
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,540
and I will not do it.

484
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,560
I dare who can challenge me!

485
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,080
Arrows. Shoot the arrows.

486
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,440
Shoot.

487
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,880
Shoot again.

488
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,660
Why?

489
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,500
This palace hates her standing, why doesn't she fall down?

490
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Is she dead?

491
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,260
Finally, she's dead.

492
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,580
Ji Chengyu, continue to send people to search for the merman.

493
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,700
I will take him back, even with his dead body.

494
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,340
And Ji Yunhe, she's useless now.

495
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,550
Though she's dead, I'll chop her body into pieces,

496
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,700
and grind her bones into ashes.

497
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,980
A nine-tailed fox?

498
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,460
How could a spiritual master have the power of a nine-tailed fox?

499
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,240
It's just a fox.

500
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,080
Anyone who has betrayed me must die.

501
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,200
Listen. Kill Ji Yunhe.

502
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,960
Kill the merman.

503
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,780
Break their fairy bones, destroy their spiritual core.

504
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,700
Ji Chengyu, kill her.

505
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:40,260
If-If you dare lay a finger on me, you'll lose your body and spirit.

506
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
As a fairy, you're not a pure fairy.

507
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,100
As a fox, you're not a real fox.

508
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,240
<i>[Immortal Master: Ning Qing]</i>

509
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,980
Interesting.

510
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,180
What are you actually?

511
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,900
I'm so sorry for disturbing your cultivation, Master. I'm guilty.

512
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,300
Don't tell others about what happened tonight, including Ru Ling.

513
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,125
This spiritual master...

514
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,620
She is interesting. We need to keep her.

515
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,600
Take her to Congji Jail.

516
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,040
I want her to be a secret.

517
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,688
Yes.

518
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,584
Ru Ling!
