00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,960
Guardian of Thousand Flower Valley Ji Yunhe,

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,320
I'd also like to participate in training mermen.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,440
Hope Your Fairy will agree.

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,240
How dare you!

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,600
Get her out of here!

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,640
How do you know that Fairy won't let me get involved?

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,880
You're so confident.

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,540
Tell me your reasons.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm a woman like you,

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,480
so I know what you want.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,700
Do you want a puppet who is submissive

25
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,580
or a loyal servant who is sincere?

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,880
Go on.

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,080
The body is the table and the heart is the inside,

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,240
whether fear or forbearance,

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,720
these external surrenders are not reliable.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,960
Only the willingness from the heart is the most valuable.

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,640
Among all the spiritual masters,

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,960
in terms of training the heart, no one can compare to me.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,920
Besides, you like to do things quickly,

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,900
why not let me join in, then we can try some new ways.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,840
We are all working for Fairy,

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,820
I think Young Master would not mind. Am I right?

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,280
I haven't seen such an arrogant person in a long time.

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,340
What did you say your name was?

39
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,940
I'm Ji Yunhe.

40
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,730
I remember.

41
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,340
- You are the one who put the talisman of forbidden words on Zhang.
- Yes.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,038
Then the role of spiritual masters is to train the spirits to clean up the evil,

43
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,680
but not to please the servants around the fairy.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,000
Is that what you said?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,506
Yes.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,320
It's your initiative choice,

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,120
if there is any mistake,

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,840
can you afford the consequences?

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,080
I'm willing to bear all the consequences.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,680
But I'd like to ask one more question.

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,460
I wonder if the reward that you just said you were going to give to Young Master

52
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,480
will apply to me as well?

53
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,140
I think everything has to be fair.

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,260
You're interesting.

55
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,520
You have my permission.

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,800
One of you trains the body and the other trains the heart.

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,640
Whoever finishes my task first will get my reward.

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,680
Anyway, Master is still in seclusion,

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,180
I'll treat it as watching a good show.

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,120
Since Your Fairy likes it,

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,840
the matter is settled.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,000
Haoqing. Yunhe.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,360
You two can take this opportunity to compete.

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,800
I believe you both know

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
what to do to not disappoint me.

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,109
Yes.

67
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,780
The mermen are the masters of the deep sea; powerful and mysterious.

68
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,959
They have never been disciplined by a spiritual master.

69
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,960
For the opening of the box today, he injured so many spiritual masters at once.

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,840
To train him, are you courting death?

71
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,000
Ji Yunhe, are you being fooled by Shunde's reward?

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,000
But, Luo Luo, think about it.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,360
If the blade becomes sharp, what is the use of the whetstone?

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,600
If Lin Haoqing can take this merman,

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,560
he will get Fairy's favor.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,520
Then it will be the best chance for him to take over as the master of the valley.

77
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
If he becomes the master of the valley, what will happen to me?

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
You can't convince me. It's too risky.

79
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,760
So that big-tailed fish is our last chance.

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,120
Without living on the island, I'm not willing to die.

81
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
You, Ji Yunhe, have trained countless spirits.

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,320
I, Luo Jinsang, have read millions of books.

83
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,340
I don't believe that we can't successfully train a merman together.

84
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,720
Read books. You read.

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,978
Father, training mermen is a big deal.

86
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,400
Why did you let Ji Yunhe use provocation in public?

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,720
You and Ji Yunhe are my capable assistants.

88
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,440
No matter who wins,

89
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,080
it will be the glory of Thousand Flower Valley.

90
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,880
Are you afraid?

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,320
I will do my best to win this battle, to wipe out the shame of the past.

92
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,680
Great.

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,500
Then win for me.

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,200
Yes.

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Haoqing, what reward do you want to ask Fairy for today?

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,780
Is there anything that Thousand Flower Valley can't give you?

97
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,160
No. I just think that things are changing.

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,640
It's better to ask for grace first.

99
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,860
Maybe it will be useful for Thousand Flower Valley one day.

100
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,500
Okay. Then go get ready.

101
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,629
I'm leaving.

102
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,680
Young Master wants something.

103
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,520
He is growing older,

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,000
it's good for him to have a plan.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,320
Then, how should we deal with Ji Yunhe?

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,800
She wants to take advantage of Fairy;

107
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
she is a little clever.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,100
What a pity.

109
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,000
<i>[Reflect Cave]</i>

110
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,600
Merman of the East China Sea, the ancient spirit beast,

111
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,280
you can be regarded as the best among earth immortals.

112
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,520
But don't expect anyone to save you.

113
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,800
Fairy has already placed a ban on you.

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,320
So your clansmen can't detect your breath,

115
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,040
let alone your position.

116
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,600
All you can do is surrender and repent,

117
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,880
so that you can suffer less.

118
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,280
Siyu.

119
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,480
This merman is still wild.

120
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Since he has been punished by thunder,

121
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,100
it's better to frustrate his spirit first.

122
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Don't let him die.

123
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
Yes.

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,980
Ji Yunhe, Ji Yunhe! It's time to train the merman today. How can you sleep?

125
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,480
Come on. Get up and read for inspiration.

126
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,120
I've been reading all night. There are only a few useful sentences.

127
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
The mermen live in the East China Sea, like cleanliness,

128
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,880
loyal and affectionate, and good at controlling water.

129
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,460
The rest are all about how to use fish scales and fish paste as medicine.

130
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,940
If these are useful, what am I supposed to do as a spiritual master?

131
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
- But…
- No but.

132
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,120
I guess Lin Haoqing is already in Reflect Cave.

133
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,320
When he's done, I'll use my own way to train the merman.

134
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,440
Then what if Lin Haoqing really beats the merman up and makes him talk?

135
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,560
If he can really make him talk like that,

136
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,000
Fairy can't send him here.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,660
The penalty of the Immortal Master Mansion is heavier than Thousand Flower Valley.

138
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,310
Guardian. Ji Yunhe.

139
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,820
My goodness. You still have time to gossip here.

140
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,780
Young Master has already tortured the merman.

141
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,220
Ji Yunhe, you're amazing.

142
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
This merman is really hard-boned,

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,920
who has no intention to beg for mercy.

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,880
Defiant or stubborn,

145
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,020
he can't change the result.

146
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,000
He just has to suffer more.

147
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,020
Young Master, I'm a little worried.

148
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,280
Yunhe hasn't appeared yet,

149
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,880
we don't know what she's planning.

150
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,340
- Should I…
- What do you want to do with her?

151
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,760
Just like when the box was opened,

152
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,480
you broke the golden talisman on the locked box?

153
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,100
My apologies.

154
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,020
But I did it all for you.

155
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,420
This thing is sacred, you can't handle it as you're impatient.

156
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,958
Young Master, it's the first weapon you gave me.

157
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,138
Siyu, from today on,

158
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:15,960
you are not allowed to take any action on Ji Yunhe,

159
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,780
which will be good for both you and me.

160
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,798
Yes.

161
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Let's go.

162
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,960
But the merman has not yet spoken.

163
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,360
I didn't expect him to speak out so easily.

164
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,100
But if we don't leave,

165
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,180
I'm afraid someone will be impatient.

166
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,578
Guardian Ji.

167
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,080
You two have worked hard.

168
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,440
I asked Luo Luo to prepare some flower and fruit fairy brew for you.

169
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
Don't worry. It's still the same as before, which tastes good but doesn't get you drunk.

170
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,580
Thank you.

171
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,260
You two rest for a while. I'll go inside to train the merman.

172
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,120
Your Guardian, you'd better not go in.

173
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,398
Why?

174
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,660
- Is it the Young Master's order?
- Of course not.

175
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,140
It's just that the merman is too fierce, who went crazy again today

176
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,640
and almost broke the barrier.

177
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,480
Such a fierce thing has really never been seen before.

178
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,400
If you want to control him, you'd better bring more people.

179
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,920
You're right.

180
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,520
Since that, why don't you two come in with me?

181
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,400
Didn't you beg to learn from me before?

182
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,240
No need.

183
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,580
Please. Please.

184
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,580
Yunhe, the merman is so powerful.

185
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,880
Let's call Qu Xiaoxing and the others to come back.

186
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,200
To make friends with him, how can we call a bunch of fighters?

187
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,440
Don't worry. I have fought with him, so I know it in my heart.

188
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,560
I'd rather not go inside.

189
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,980
Don't move.

190
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,500
I won't hurt you.

191
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,760
You're hurt badly.

192
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,060
If you don't get treatment in time, you will die.

193
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,200
You want to leave, don't you?

194
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,840
You have your hometown,

195
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,980
the things you haven't done,

196
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,180
and the people you want to see.

197
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,880
Then live well first.

198
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,700
Only if you live can you leave.

199
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,400
Although I have been ordered to train you,

200
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,940
I also have my reasons.

201
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,960
I won't treat you too badly.

202
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,240
Believe me, then we can have a turnaround.

203
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,220
But if you don't trust me, you will suffer more than death

204
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,580
and I won't end well either.

205
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,500
This is our place.

206
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,520
Where I can get in,

207
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,320
but you can't get out.

208
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,780
Take it easy.

209
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,320
I don't have any more defenses. Okay?

210
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,420
That's right.

211
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,019
Good boy.

212
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,680
Big-tailed fish.

213
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,260
All right. I will stop calling you that.

214
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,300
Be a good boy. Don't move.

215
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,400
I told you that I wouldn't hurt you.

216
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,546
Hold on.

217
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,215
You can't you figure out why I'm helping you?

218
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,378
Then don't think about it.

219
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:29,920
Just remember that I won't hurt you.

220
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,983
What's wrong?

221
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,720
You mermen are hard-bones,

222
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,180
but your faces are soft and thin.

223
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,319
I have to apply the medicine for you.

224
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,960
Hold on.

225
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,820
Look! As long as you cooperate, it's fast applying the medicine.

226
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,350
Okay.

227
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,700
I never thought fish could be so shy.

228
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,330
I brought you a set of clothes...

229
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,020
as a gift for us to become friends after you landed.

230
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,634
What do you think?

231
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,960
As your friend, let me help you pull out the golden arrow. Okay?

232
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I can't pull out this arrow.

233
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,480
No!

234
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,820
Yunhe!

235
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,920
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

236
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,500
Lin Haoqing, what the hell are you doing?

237
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,000
I told you not to pull it out,

238
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,138
but you didn't listen to me.

239
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:11,280
This golden arrow has been cast on with a hidden spell by Lin Haoqing.

240
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,720
Once someone else touches it, it will attack you.

241
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,040
If not for my immortal seal of protection,

242
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,440
your beautiful tail would have been ruined.

243
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,980
Time is running out.

244
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,660
Lin Haoqing will come here soon. I can only help you so far.

245
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,880
If you don't want to keep being nailed to the wall,

246
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,460
the only person who can help you is yourself.

247
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,800
Remember that resistance is never reckless and blind,

248
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,160
you can also use their strength to fight.

249
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,280
It seems that you have wasted your efforts tonight.

250
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,700
Yunhe, are you okay?

251
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,860
Congratulations on thinking ahead and digging a hole for me to jump in.

252
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,000
It is indeed a lot more refined than what you did before.

253
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,320
I'm afraid you have misunderstood.

254
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,620
The golden arrow spell is not against you, but against those who come to rob the prison.

255
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,890
I didn't expect you to move it.

256
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,560
You want to show mercy to him.

257
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,620
But he's a savage.

258
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,300
The only thing he needs to remember is who his master is.

259
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,600
<i>Remember that resistance is never reckless and blind,</i>

260
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,780
<i>you can also use their strength to fight.</i>

261
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,700
Did you teach him to get rid of the arrow by the power of lightning?

262
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,200
The merman is like the essence of the sea soul, who couldn't be defeated.

263
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
The golden arrow spell is powerful.

264
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,500
You'd better heal as soon as possible before it gets worse.

265
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,320
It's only up to here that I can worry for you.

266
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,420
Young Master, it's important to heal your wound.

267
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,398
This arrow has magical power on it.

268
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,940
Well. We have plenty of time.

269
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,200
Sister, be careful.

270
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,520
Take care, Senior.

271
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,956
Luo Luo, watch out for Lin Haoqing.

272
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:37,638
Okay?

273
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,303
Got it.

274
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,960
Yunhe, are you all right?

275
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,620
Why do you look so pale?

276
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm fine.

277
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,560
I used my immortal seal to block the golden arrow for the merman,

278
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,840
so I got a little hurt.

279
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,520
Just got a little hurt.

280
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,826
You…

281
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,238
Sorry.

282
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,255
Don't you know that it's difficult to repair the immortal seal?

283
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:57,973
It's used to save life at a critical time.

284
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,200
Now is a critical time.

285
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,980
We can't let Lin Haoqing win this time.

286
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,860
The merman is very arrogant.

287
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,340
I just want to let him feel that he owes me a favor,

288
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,720
so that we can discuss it well in the future.

289
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,520
But the cost of this bitter trick is too much.

290
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,840
And this merman looks stupid,

291
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
does he know what a favor is?

292
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,758
If he doesn't know that,

293
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:22,720
I will teach him until he understands.

294
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,520
How to teach?

295
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,853
Where is the merman?

296
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,940
Wow!

297
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,560
Turn back. Aren't you shy?

298
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,380
Hurry and turn around; don't face us like that.

299
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,680
Why are you so shy?

300
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,240
Isn't he a merman?

301
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,500
Why did his tail disappear and grow two legs?

302
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,180
You didn't read the book that I ask you to read.

303
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,340
They originally went to sea from land, so they were born with legs.

304
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,500
Look! Just like that.

305
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,960
Like that, see?

306
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,520
Why don't you let me see?

307
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,680
I just want to see why he's got legs.

308
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,040
I see, he must have been hurt too much to control it.

309
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,120
- Let me see.
- Don't look.

310
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,880
Stop it.

311
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,300
Okay. I helped you stop the bleeding,

312
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,420
and the lightning torture to you.

313
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,380
As long as you are within my jurisdiction, I helped you stop the bleeding,

314
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,300
How's that? I'm kind, right?

315
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,320
You should thank me.

316
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,880
Big-tailed fish, as long as you are obedient,

317
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,460
I'll make sure you eat and sleep well.

318
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,640
Young Master, this is the best medicine; your wound will be healed soon.

319
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,560
Ji Yunhe instigated the merman to turn against you, which is so despicable.

320
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,720
I didn't expect that the merman would really listen to her.

321
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,740
It's just the art of tenderness, which is her usual trick.

322
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,860
Young Master, you'd better let me keep an eye on her.

323
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,260
Just let her go.

324
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,020
The merman is delicate, so she can't afford to feed him.

325
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,160
So many valuable and unique fish need a lot of spirit stones.

326
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,340
And we both can't eat them ourselves, but you gave him all of them.

327
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,040
Ji Yunhe, the immortals do not need to eat grains,

328
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,360
so he won't die of hunger.

329
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,600
He is so powerful, so don't buy anything for him.

330
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,760
Although he can't die of hunger, he will still have cravings.

331
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,160
Besides, the food supplementation can assist in cultivation.

332
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,060
Don't we all eat every day?

333
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,900
The merman is injured, and the food can help him recover quickly.

334
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,960
- But…
- But as the master of the deep sea,

335
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,060
his taste will certainly be a little picky.

336
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,920
Spiritual stones can be earned again,

337
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,480
but if the chance is gone, we will never meet it again.

338
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,240
Ji Yunhe, you really are…

339
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,100
I tell you that the delicious food he eats is at the cost of our fairy island.

340
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,780
The more time he eats, the smaller our island will be.

341
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,500
In this way, not to mention buying the island, we will both become poor.

342
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:11,396
Look.

343
00:26:11,396 --> 00:26:13,680
Besides, couldn't he understand what you say?

344
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,500
Why don't you just mention to him about the tail?

345
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,900
He hasn't even opened his mouth, how can I talk about the tail?

346
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,760
Besides, everything takes time.

347
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,460
Exposing ourselves too early will only make him be wary of us.

348
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,160
Therefore, everything must be done gradually.

349
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,560
Gradually.

350
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,778
Three days. The merman has already seen me differently.

351
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:43,258
Give me three days, I will make him talk.

352
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,000
This, and this.

353
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,720
These must be your favorite foods, right?

354
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,880
Okay. I'm not looking at you, You can eat it yourself.

355
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,100
Big-tailed fish, you can eat it yourself.

356
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,900
Don't you know what a friend is?

357
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,660
It's okay, I can teach you.

358
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,120
In fact, before I picked up Luo Luo, I didn't have any friends.

359
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,500
No. I used to have a friend.

360
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,178
But then something happened, so we are no longer friends.

361
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,600
Therefore, friendship is not easy to come by,

362
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,240
you should cherish me more as a friend.

363
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,380
Big-tailed fish, they all say that

364
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,740
you committed crimes against Fairy Shunde,

365
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,980
and even injured the disciples of the Immortal Master Mansion.

366
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,340
But I think you are pure in nature and don't look like a tyrant.

367
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,320
Can you tell me what really happened?

368
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,260
Forget it. If you don't want to talk about it, then don't say it

369
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,840
and I won't force you.

370
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,000
I heard that the guards are afraid that you'll become stronger with water,

371
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,040
so they dare not bring you water to drink.

372
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,480
Are you thirsty? I'll get some water for you.

373
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,460
Water control magic.

374
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,320
You have been seriously injured, so the spiritual power will inevitably be very weak.

375
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,140
Don't mind it. When you get well, you are still the most powerful merman.

376
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,940
I know that you want to leave,

377
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,280
but this is Thousand Flower Valley, which is heavily guarded.

378
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,600
Now this place is sealed by the master's gold talisman

379
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,480
and your body is so weak, how can you escape?

380
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,880
So be good and listen to my words, heal your wound,

381
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,660
do not waste your spiritual power, and do not blindly escape.

382
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,240
Otherwise, if you are caught again,

383
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,100
the guards will be more strict, and the punishment will be more severe.

384
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,340
I can't help you much.

385
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,820
But for the sake of being your friend,

386
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,980
I can bring you some other things.

387
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,160
Ji Yunhe, I think you're not training the merman, but being trained by him. Right?

388
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,360
It's Snow Pill. You spent so many years to save this one bottle.

389
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,280
When you were frosted and hurt by the golden arrow, you could not even use it.

390
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,480
Now you're going to give it to a merman.

391
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,820
Luo Luo, we can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.

392
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,560
Besides, Lin Haoqing's wound will be healed soon. So I don't have much time left.

393
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,840
Is there no other reason?

394
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
Master Qing Shu.

395
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,900
<i>Guardian Ji, Master wants to see you.</i>

396
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,480
The rumor is true.

397
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,880
The merman's legs and tails coexist.

398
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,520
I let you suffer some pain, so I'm bad.

399
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,140
Ji Yunhe gives you some food, then she is good.

400
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,300
You've been living too long in the deep sea, which makes you short-sighted.

401
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,020
Let me show you one thing.

402
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,820
This is the token of the highest rank in Thousand Flower Valley.

403
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,520
And Ji Yunhe also has one.

404
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,900
How did she get it?

405
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,840
And why did Fairy Shunde give you to her?

406
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,600
This is Thousand Flower Valley, spiritual masters here won't be kind to you offenders for no reason.

407
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,060
I grew up with her, and I've seen this kind of tactic a lot.

408
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,460
Think about what I said.

409
00:33:05,338 --> 00:33:06,400
Master.

410
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,080
Guardian Ji, I heard that you have trained the merman well.

411
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,220
Even Haoqing was injured by you and rested for some days.

412
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,500
He was too proud to let anyone mention it to me.

413
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,960
As the master, I've realized it too late.

414
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,700
Master, I impulsively hurt Young Master. I hope you can forgive me.

415
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,040
If you are still not satisfied, then Yunhe…

416
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,420
You did a good job.

417
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,200
He needs to suffer before he can mature.

418
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,580
But I have to remind you, Guardian Ji.

419
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,140
Since it is the thing that you took over by yourself,

420
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,340
you'd better think about the gains and losses.

421
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,980
It's okay to forget who you are for a while.

422
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,880
But don't have other thoughts that you shouldn't have.

423
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,780
If you miss the antidote to the Frost, there will be no more.

424
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,943
Yes.

425
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,157
Big-tailed fish.

426
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,860
<i>This is Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

427
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,880
<i>Spiritual masters here won't be kind to you offenders for no reason.</i>

428
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,460
Look! I've brought you something good.

429
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,259
This is a good healing medicine.

430
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:42,880
After using it, your wound will recover soon.

431
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,220
But then again, we like reciprocity.

432
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,900
Do you know what that means?

433
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,020
I can give you medicine to heal your wounds.

434
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,980
You have to tell me your name.

435
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,318
Look! My name is...

436
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:59,140
Yun...

437
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,393
He.

438
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,360
How about you?

439
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,540
You're so beautiful. You also have a pretty name, don't you?

440
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,700
Such a beautiful fish, you're not a mute, are you?

441
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,960
<i>This is the token of the highest rank in Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

442
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,680
<i>Ji Yunhe also has one.</i>

443
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,880
<i>How did she get it?</i>

444
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,040
<i>And why did Fairy Shunde give you to her?</i>

445
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,860
What are you doing?

446
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,620
Do you think that because I spoil you, I won't beat you?

447
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Do you think I'm holding this token to enjoy glory and wealth?

448
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,360
Do you think that I want to be a spiritual master?

449
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,180
Look at my wounds.

450
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,080
If I don't yield to Thousand Flower Valley,

451
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,900
how can I leave this hellish place?

452
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,980
I used the seal to block the golden arrow for you,

453
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,860
applied medicine to you, and delivered meals to you,

454
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,640
which almost cost the island of Luo Luo and me.

455
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,660
And those Snow Pills...

456
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,360
Do you know how hard it was for me to save those up?

457
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,820
I can't bear to use them myself, but I was giving them to you.

458
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:48,280
Think about it. Have I ever done anything to hurt you?

459
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,440
I just want to be friends with you.

460
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,920
But you've never trusted me.

461
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,570
It's okay if you don't believe me.

462
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,978
If you think I'm annoying, then I won't come.

463
00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:06,000
You're on your own.

464
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,180
As expected of you Ji Yunhe,

465
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,220
who can make up such a moving speech in such a short time.

466
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,720
In terms of acting, I'm afraid no one is better than you.

467
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,860
If I didn't know how ruthless you are, I'm afraid that even I would believe

468
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,460
your sincere words.

469
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,820
I should have thought that you wouldn't let it go.

470
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,900
Training the heart not only uses tenderness, but it can also use separation.

471
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,180
You were careless.

472
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,880
How do you know that what I did and said was only about tenderness and not sincerity?

473
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,460
Maybe I was sincere with every word.

474
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,320
I have heard your heartfelt words as early as in the Spiritual Snake Cave,

475
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,900
every word of which is heartbreaking and unforgettable.

476
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,960
<i>Why are you destined to get the position of Master of Thousand Flower Valley,</i>

477
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,740
<i>but I can only be your follower.</i>

478
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,020
<i>Lin Haoqing, just stay here.</i>

479
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,620
Must Senior and I have to be so tit-for-tat?

480
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,300
Tit for tat?

481
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,680
I think we are going to be like this until we die.

482
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,500
You're right. Now that we have reached this point,

483
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,260
there's no way to get out of it.

484
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,440
The competition isn't over yet. Senior, let's wait and see.

485
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:39,540
Ji Yunhe, I hate it when you laugh like that.

486
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,698
Hypocritical. Arrogant.

487
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,100
Are you still worried about Ji Yunhe?

488
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,180
She has lost the merman's trust, so it will be hard for her to turn back.

489
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,860
She won't give up easily. As long as she's around, things can change.

490
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,539
We have to find a way to get her out completely.

491
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,990
Yunhe!

492
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:46,619
Yunhe, you're back.

493
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,580
Wait a minute.

494
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,470
After sending a whole bottle of Snow Pills, why do you look like this?

495
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,160
Is that merman still so stubborn?

496
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,400
It's over. It's all for nothing.

497
00:39:58,872 --> 00:40:01,460
Ji Yunhe, did you hear me?

498
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,060
I'm listening.

499
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,960
Something's wrong with you.

500
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,360
What are you thinking about?

501
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,844
Luo Luo, which do you think is more upsetting?

502
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:14,160
Regret or repentance?

503
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,380
What do you regret? And what are you sorry for?

504
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,340
Did someone bully you?

505
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,620
Did the merman bully her?

506
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,660
Impossible, the merman is not as smart as me.

507
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,100
It's Lin Haoqing, right?

508
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,440
Bad Lin Haoqing.

509
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,680
<i>Look at my wounds.</i>

510
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,620
<i>If I don't yield to Thousand Flower Valley,</i>

511
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,540
<i>how can I leave this hellish place?</i>

512
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,980
<i>I used the seal to block the golden arrow for you,</i>

513
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,540
<i>applied medicine to you,</i>

514
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,220
<i>and delivered meals to you,</i>

515
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,680
<i>which almost cost the island of Luo Luo and me.</i>

516
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,620
<i>And those Snow Pills,</i>

517
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,220
<i>do you know how hard it was for me to save those up?</i>

518
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,795
<i>I can't bear to use them myself,</i>

519
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,000
<i>but I sent them to you.</i>

520
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,138
<i>Think about it. Have I ever done anything to upset you?</i>

521
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:25,920
<i>Have I ever done anything to hurt you?</i>

522
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,950
<i>I just want to be friends with you.</i>

523
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,240
<i>But you've never trusted me.</i>

524
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,260
