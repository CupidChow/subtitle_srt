From now on, I won't force you to do anything.

21
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,680
As long as you're happy, you can do anything.

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,460
I can't get paid for what I didn't do.

23
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,400
I didn't help much.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,340
Is there any reason for you to be so nice to me all of a sudden?

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,960
The snow here is really beautiful.

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,020
<i>What kind of reason is it?</i>

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,600
<i>This merman is unpredictable.</i>

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,340
<i>I can't stay with him for too long.</i>

29
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,780
Are you sure that I can do anything?

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,420
Yes. No more restrictions, it's all up to you.

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,280
Then let me play a round in the North Abyss.

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,560
After I'm done, I'll let my master take me back.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,040
Didn't you just say I could do anything, are you backtracking so quickly?

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,220
Are you so reluctant to stay here?

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,740
Then I'll say it straight.

36
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm afraid you'll lock me up again.

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,300
It's a nice place and you're handsome,

38
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,200
but I haven't seen enough of this world,

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,160
so I don't want to be stuck here

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,480
looking at your face for the rest of my life.

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,800
Let's go back today.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,720
Let's discuss this later.

43
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,440
Then I'll go back to Ape Wing Camp.

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,120
Anyway, my leg is better.

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,160
There is no need to stay in your place.

46
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,700
Okay.

47
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,200
Let's go.

48
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,560
The antidote has finally been made.

49
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,600
I have finally made it.

50
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,460
Master, the medicine is unpredictable.

51
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,620
Do you really want to test it yourself?

52
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,940
Whether it is medicine or poison,

53
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,240
I'm going to try it all out.

54
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,820
Master. Master!

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,260
Master, you've done it.

56
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,960
You've done it.

57
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,200
Has the Frost been detoxified?

58
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,200
Father, I finally detoxified the Frost.

59
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,220
I've finally…

60
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,440
Master, what's wrong?

61
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,140
How are you?

62
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,720
Master.

63
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,200
No need to wear yourself out.

64
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,780
The Frost has been detoxified,

65
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,060
why is it growing back?

66
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,460
<i>Master, a fox named A'Ji appeared in the North Abyss,</i>

67
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,700
<i>and behaves like Yunhe.</i>

68
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,460
<i>Now she is staying with Chang Yi.</i>

69
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,980
<i>I don't know if she is related to Yunhe.</i>

70
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,940
This is God's will.

71
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,160
General, we caught a dying fox.

72
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,460
General Qifeng?

73
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,100
What a surprise.

74
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,420
How did you end up like this?

75
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,840
Well, before I destroy the North Abyss,

76
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,440
let me take your life to sharpen my sword.

77
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,800
Don't kill me.

78
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,880
Report!

79
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,240
General, it's hard to find the Thunderfire Vein.

80
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
There's been no message from anyone sent.

81
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,860
What are you telling me if you haven't found it?

82
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,360
Do you want me to praise you?

83
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,660
Go and find it!

84
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,060
Yes, Sir!

85
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,820
I'm very unhappy now. You're unlucky.

86
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,805
Don't kill me. Stop!

87
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm useful to you.

88
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,620
You're the trash that North Abyss has given up on, what use are you to me?

89
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,800
Aren't you looking for the Thunderfire Vein?

90
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,720
No one is more familiar with the terrain of the North Abyss than I am.

91
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,860
I can definitely help you find it.

92
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,220
You are really ruthless, even abandoning your kin.

93
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,960
I will destroy that merman.

94
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,020
I'll let Qing Yao know that I'm the right one.

95
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,260
Great.

96
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,460
<i>It's a nice place</i>

97
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,100
<i>and you're handsome,</i>

98
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,500
<i>but I haven't seen enough of this world,</i>

99
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,380
<i>so I don't want to be stuck here</i>

100
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,800
<i>looking at your face for the rest of my life.</i>

101
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,580
I heard that since you got back from Ice Lake,

102
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,820
you've been held up.

103
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,180
Your old friend has returned,

104
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,080
why are you still here drinking?

105
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,140
Sir, she wants to get out of here.

106
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,960
If you want to keep her,

107
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,460
it's certainly not a difficult task for you.

108
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,580
I don't want to trap her anymore.

109
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,200
I want to let her follow her heart.

110
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,200
So this time, she chose to be free

111
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,700
and let go of you.

112
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,900
We are no longer the former Spiritual Master and merman.

113
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Now I bear not only my own love and hatred,

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,060
but also the lives of more people.

115
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,740
I don't want to trap her with this responsibility.

116
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,380
But I really can't accept that...

117
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,740
she is leaving here.

118
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,320
Everything in this world is not perfect.

119
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,860
If you don't know how to choose,

120
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,340
you just have to think about the war coming

121
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,900
and what kind of future you most want her to have in your heart.

122
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,640
War?

123
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,400
There is a letter from Xue Sanyue.

124
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,140
The truth behind Immortal Master

125
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,420
has been found by Heavenly King.

126
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,820
So A'Ji really is…

127
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,580
She is Yunhe. It's complicated. No need to say more.

128
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,460
Where is she now?

129
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,020
<i>Why did the merman look so lonely</i>

130
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,120
<i>when he heard that I was leaving?</i>

131
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,260
<i>It's not all determined.</i>

132
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,520
<i>Didn't I make up my mind to leave?</i>

133
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,660
<i>Why do I feel so sad when I see his eyes?</i>

134
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,780
Master?

135
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,840
I'm a little tired today.

136
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,480
If you don't want me to leave,

137
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,140
then I can leave a few days later.

138
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,660
Master.

139
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,500
Master! Master!

140
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,720
- Who let you come to the North Abyss?
- Hurt. It hurts.

141
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,020
Why didn't you listen to me?

142
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,380
Actually, I just saved someone on the way.

143
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,640
Unexpectedly, I was taken as an accomplice of Immortal Master Mansion's disciples

144
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
and was captured together to the North Abyss.

145
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,580
Did I do something wrong?

146
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,860
You're right.

147
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,100
You're the kindest kid.

148
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,840
Leave it to me to save people.

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,380
I'll take you away now.

150
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,480
Leaving so soon?

151
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,380
Actually, I'm staying quite well in the North Abyss.

152
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,160
Why don't we stay a little longer?

153
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,620
A'Ji, after a few days in the North Abyss, you are willing to disobey our master?

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,380
Master, I saw the merman in my dream.

155
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,560
What did he say to you?

156
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,120
He didn't say anything,

157
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,520
but sometimes he was cold.

158
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,080
Sometimes he was very strange and was very nice to me.

159
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,280
How did you feel about it?

160
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,820
I can't tell you how I feel.

161
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,800
When I see him, I will feel strange;

162
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,460
and sometimes, my heart will beat fast.

163
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,400
Master, is he really my enemy?

164
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,940
What did I tell you?

165
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,600
You told me not to look back.

166
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,100
And if you forget the past,

167
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,560
then don't think about it again.

168
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,400
Leave with me.

169
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Master, when we came to the North Abyss this time,

170
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,920
the guards were already alerted.

171
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm afraid Chang Yi won't let us go easily.

172
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,660
I won't let him stop us.

173
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
The power behind the Immortal Master

174
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,100
turns out to be the ancient fierce beast Zhu Yan.

175
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,400
Yes.

176
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,200
Now, Heavenly King is trapped in Infinite Mountain.

177
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
I'm afraid that Immortal Master will take action soon.

178
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,800
This war is inevitable.

179
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Chang Yi, this time,

180
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
what will you do with A'Ji?

181
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,900
Your Master, someone at the border found Lin Haoqing's whereabouts.

182
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,000
He has sneaked into the North Abyss again.

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,800
- I think he's here for A'Ji.
- Where is he?

184
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
He knocked out the guards and took someone from Ape Wing Camp

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,300
to the back of the mountain.

186
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,400
When did the North Abyss start to vibrate underground?

187
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,000
The Thunderfire Vein has been revived.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Then the power of the mountains and rivers will drive the operation of the formation

189
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,200
until the last drop of lava is forced out.

190
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,600
This place will be surrounded by fire soon.

191
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,000
Merman, I'd like to see

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,200
how you're going to save North Abyss this time.

193
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,000
He will only die, and so will you.

194
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,400
With the merman and the entire North Abyss buried with you,

195
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,000
I think you can die with no regrets.

196
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,700
Let's go.

197
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,000
Except for the Spiritual Master that Immortal Fairy wants,

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,500
kill all the creatures of North Abyss by fire.

199
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,100
A trick to lure me away.

200
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,600
Chang Yi, we are at least old friends.

201
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,100
Please don't fight.

202
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,800
Immortal Master will tackle the North Abyss one day.

203
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
A'Ji, no...

204
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,000
If Ji Yunhe stays here, you can't guarantee her safety.

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,800
Besides, according to her nature, if something really happens to North Abyss,

206
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,200
do you think she would stay out of it?

207
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Don't you feel that

208
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,200
the bottom seems to be getting hotter and hotter,

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,500
and there is a strange smell.

210
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,600
There is a change underground.

211
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,600
Chang Yi, it's the Thunderfire Vein.

212
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
After you left, Lingshuang Pavilion shook.

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
The earth quakes and the birds are scared.

214
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,300
It's the sign of the rekindling of the Thunderfire Vein.

215
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,400
Thunderfire Vein.

216
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,000
Hasn't it been dormant for millions of years?

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,500
How could it suddenly rekindle?

218
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
It's the Immortal Master.

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
He took action first.

220
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
What will happen next?

221
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
The earth will crack, avalanches will happen, and the rivers will boil.

222
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Until lava erupts, the earth will burn, and everything will turn into ash.

223
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,000
Kong Ming, go back now.

224
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,200
Together with Qing Yao and Luo Jingsang, take the time to evacuate everyone.

225
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Are you going to suppress the fire alone?

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,800
Chang Yi, are you crazy?

227
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,400
How can you fight against the power of the mountains and rivers?

228
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
The lava is coming from the ground.

229
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,800
I have to suppress the veins from the root.

230
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,900
Suppress the veins from the root.

231
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,600
Are you going to the cave of the veins?

232
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,300
No. The lava is on fire,

233
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,800
so the ground is worse than hell.

234
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,400
You'll turn into ash.

235
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,800
I have the Water Scepter of East Sea. I may be able to fight.

236
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,000
Kong Ming, you know what is important.

237
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,100
- Chang Yi.
- Go!

238
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
Just go!

239
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,300
The Spiritual Masters in the city need to be transferred now,

240
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,400
should we call Master and A'Ji back to help?

241
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,000
No need. Tell Lin Haoqing to take her out of here,

242
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
as far away as possible.

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Soon, there may be a big war in North Abyss.

244
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,600
Let her never come back.

245
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
A'Ji, leaving this forest,

246
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,300
we'll be out of the North Abyss.

247
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
What's wrong, A'Ji?

248
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,300
Master, I don't know what's wrong with me.

249
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,000
I should listen to you.

250
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
But when I think of leaving here,

251
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,800
my heart hurts like it's being cut.

252
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,600
What happened between me and North Abyss, and the merman?

253
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,800
Master, is something wrong?

254
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,400
Master, Immortal Master ignited Thunderfire Vein.

255
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,300
- The lava is about to erupt.
- Lava is about to erupt?

256
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,600
Isn't North Abyss City just down the hill?

257
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,200
Ji Ning, Lu Jinyan, Fu Chao,

258
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
and there are so many other people.

259
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,800
So, will they all be burned into ash?

260
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,600
Your Master, Chang Yi said he will go into the cave to suppress the fire, and asked you to take A'Ji away.

261
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
What does the merman want to do?

262
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,900
He is trying to use his own power to fight against the catastrophe.

263
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,600
Even though he is good at controlling water, there is a limit.

264
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,200
He is ready to die.

265
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
A'Ji, what are you doing?

266
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,200
Master, are you going to do nothing to save him?

267
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
A'Ji, if you go back now,

268
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
the past will be in vain.

269
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,100
You asked me what your relationship with the merman was.

270
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,600
I'm telling you now.

271
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,140
You had a painful past.

272
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,560
You went through the worst time of your life.

273
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,120
It took a long time for you to regain your freedom.

274
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,800
A'Ji, leave the North Abyss with me,

275
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,000
then you can roam all over the world without any restraint.

276
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,200
Master, you said that

277
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,700
one day, I would find where I want to go,

278
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,400
and what I want to do.

279
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Now I found it.

280
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,500
I don't want to see the North Abyss burned.

281
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,200
I don't want to see those fresh lives in the city disappear.

282
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,800
I… I also don't want to see the merman in trouble.

283
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,300
No matter what happened between us,

284
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,200
it doesn't matter at this moment.

285
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,400
I just want to go back to save people.

286
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
Master Lin.

287
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,000
I didn't expect that you would retreat to Thousand Flower Valley

288
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
for the sake of the beauty…

289
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
Old friend.

290
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,000
Why did he come to the North Abyss?

291
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
You are so cunning

292
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,600
that you hid her from the Immortal Fairy for so long.

293
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,800
Master, who is he?

294
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,900
Stop pretending. When I take you back to Immortal Master Mansion,

295
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,000
the whip of Immortal Fairy will remind you of everything.

296
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,800
Catch them!

297
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
A'Ji, go do what you want to do.

298
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,200
- Master.
- Go!

299
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,800
The Frost mark in your body has taken effect, and you are seeking death.

300
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,000
That's enough to fight with you.

301
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Now that you know who A'Ji is,

302
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,700
you won't leave alive.

303
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
- Chang Yi!
- Young Lord!

304
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
Young Lord!

305
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,700
Lava is about to erupt. It's too dangerous here.

306
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,500
Since Master asked you to leave with the people, then don't go in there.

307
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,700
But Chang Yi is in there. I have to get him out.

308
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,800
The cave is like hell.

309
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,800
If you go in now, you won't be able to get out.

310
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Do you want me to watch him die?

311
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Young Lord, if you go in now, you'll only die with Master.

312
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't you care about your kin and North Abyss?

313
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,200
That was Ji Yunhe.

314
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,400
She's back.

315
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,000
Are you stupid?

316
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,900
How can you do this alone?

317
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,600
Why are you back? Don't you know how dangerous it is here?

318
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Leave!

319
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,200
No. This is not your North Abyss alone.

320
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,300
I have friends here, too.

321
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,500
And… And you can't die.

322
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,600
To sacrifice my life for the peace of the North Abyss,

323
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600

That merman put out the fire.

395
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,000
Master, you've used up too much of your spiritual energy to resist the Frost.

396
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,640
Your body is important.

397

Where's Chang Yi? Where's Chang Yi?

400
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,720
He went inside and didn't come out.

401
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,160
Master!

402
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,820
Master, come out! Don't scare me, Master!

403
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,060
Impossible.

404
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,880
Chang Yi is so powerful, he couldn't die so easily.

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,980
Master, they are safe.

411
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,600
<i>I used to think that since it was a new life,</i>

412
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
<i>she should cut off the past and never look back.</i>

413
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,980
<i>But it turns out that some things are destined to be together.</i>

414
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,160
<i>She still went back.</i>

415
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,080
What? The fire was subsided.

416
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,280
Where is Zhu Ling? Didn't he catch any Spiritual Masters?

417
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,500
We only know that the fire in North Abyss has been subsided.

418
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,840
But we can no longer contact General Zhu Ling.

419
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,120
I'm afraid…

420
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm afraid he's already dead.

421
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Rubbish.

422
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
You're all rubbish.

423
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,520
What can you do for me?

424
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,380
Ru Ling, time to take your medicine.

425
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,240
I heard that the fire in North Abyss was put out by that merman.

426
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,460
I know.

427
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,440
You promised to make me stronger.

428
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,820
Not a single Spiritual Master has been caught yet.

429
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,920
What should I do?

430
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,940
As long as you want, I'll help you catch them.

431
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,620
Put on your shoes and socks.

432
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,540
Don't let the cold hurt your body,

433
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,980
or it'll affect the medicine's effects.

434
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:45,100
Just a few last steps, then your face will be the same as before.

435
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,300
The same as before.

436
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,720
Then get some preserves for me.

437
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,660
The medicine is bitter.

438
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,730
Your spiritual power is pure.

439
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,680
If you can help me, can my power grow faster?

440
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,920
Master, what I want is not only the past.

441
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,140
Please help me.

442
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,360
You want so much.

443
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,480
But don't forget that you don't have that ability.

444
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,760
You should drink the medicine.

445
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,660
Until now, you still want to cure my face.

446
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,780
I dared to fight against you

447
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,720
and take away your spiritual power,

448
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
why don't you kill me?

449
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,480
You know it.

450
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,080
Because of this face, right?

451
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,800
You raised me, taught me,

452
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,080
and brought me all the way to this point.

453
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,360
I've betrayed you. Why don't you kill me?

454
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
Do you love this face so much?

455
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,840
What am I but this face?

456
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,800
Ru Ling.

457
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,560
I'd rather you kill me than spare me because of this face.

458
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,140
Why don't you kill me?

459
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,580
Don't do anything stupid.

460
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:43,040
Master, you can't give me what I want.

461
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,280
And you can't get what you want.

462
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,290
<i>[Immortal Fairy Hall]</i>

463
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,080
Don't make trouble for yourself.

464
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,840
Stop.

465
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,139
Even just for yourself.

466
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,640
Are you taking pity on me?

467
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,600
When is it your turn to pity me?

468
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,700
Who are you to persuade me now?

469
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,780
You know all the things that our master has done.

470
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,580
Senior, you were a part of it too.

471
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,060
Don't you think it's too late to regret now?

472
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,660
Yes.

473
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,580
We're both guilty and can't even pay for it with death.

474
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:34,020
I will bear the consequences of the evils I have done.

475
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,640
I just want to beg you,

476
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,800
don't push everyone and yourself into the abyss of doom.

477
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:54,500
The fairy I once knew was a good person.

478
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,480
Unfortunately, we both went further down the road of sin.

479
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,600
Now I hope that...

480
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,960
we still have the chance to atone for our sins.

481
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,080
Sin?

482
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,120
What is my sin?

483
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,620
I'm the noblest fairy.

484
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,200
Everything is with my blessings.

485
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,560
All of you should respect and thank me.

486
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,620
You wait.

487
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,800
When I am powerful enough,

488
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,080
whatever I do, Master will follow my wishes.

489
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,540
No, not only Master,

490
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,080
but everyone!

491
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,800
You've just used so much spiritual power, how dare you cast spells without a good rest?

492
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,980
Sir, Yunhe is…

493
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,580
Wait outside. I'll heal her.

494
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,560
One more word, I'll drug you and kick you out of here.

495
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,360
Sir, how is Yunhe?

496
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,800
Her heart veins were burned by the earth fire.

497
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,880
Although I stabilized her injury just now, it's difficult for her to wake up soon.

498
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,790
If I seclude and heal her with my water control spell,

499
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,160
maybe I can relieve her of heat poison.

500
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,200
Chang Yi, you've just over-exerted yourself in the cave,

501
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,520
now you're going to take great pains to heal her.

502
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,120
Do you want to seek death?

503
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,320
In the cave, I was ready to perish.

504
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,520
But she risked her life to come back to me,

505
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,540
which means that we are not over.

506
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,440
Since we're not over, why don't I try my best?

507
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,960
But during my seclusion,

508
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,820
the North Abyss needs you to take charge.

509
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,880
If you want, just go ahead.

510
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,180
I can take care of the North Abyss.

511
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,960
But remember, if you need help, you must tell me.

512
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,840
Don't fight alone.

513
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,760
I thought you would stop me again.

514
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,720
Can I stop you?

515
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,600
Besides, I and the North Abyss owe Ji Yunhe.

516
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,220
Don't worry. While you're in seclusion,

517
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,360
I'll do my best to help him.

518
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,220
Besides, here are some tonic medicines that may help A'Ji's recovery.

519
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,640
Thank you, Young Lord.

520
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,820
Young Lord, your attitude towards Ji Yunhe

521
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,000
seems to have changed greatly, too.

522
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,680
In the past, I did have various prejudices against her.

523
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,700
But this time Master was in trouble, at the moment of dying,

524
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,680
she didn't hesitate to save him at all.

525
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,960
I can't help but admire the chivalry.

526
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,720
Besides, Master loves her.

527
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,140
Such a couple should be blessed by all.

528
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,120
But I stopped at the door of the cave at the last moment,

529
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,000
unable to enter and fight the fire with Master.

530
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,020
Young Lord, you don't have to feel guilty.

531
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,820
You just prioritized the future of the North Abyss first

532
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,140
and did what you had to do.

533
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,320
Sometimes, it takes more courage to make such decisions.

534
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,880
If the Fox King were still alive, he would be very happy that you had finally grown up.

535
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,040
Thank you.

536
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,320
Your Master.

537
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,160
Someone wants to see you.

538
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,180
Just say it.

539
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,360
You're usually so talkative, why are you stammering today?

540
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,320
Who makes you like this?

541
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,620
I…

542
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,780
I know it.

543
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,080
Take him to the main hall.

544
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,680
Yes.

545
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,780
How is A'Ji?

546
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,340
Now she is Yunhe.

547
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,000
Her memories came back.

548
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,580
Kong Ming has stabilized her injury.

549
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,460
Next, I will heal her.

550
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,780
I didn't expect you'd agree to see me.

551
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,540
I thought after I took A'Ji— Yunhe away,

552
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,860
you would hate me to the bone.

553
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,400
After all, it was you who saved Yunhe.

554
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,620
And I also heard that Zhu Ling was going to invade the North Abyss to slaughter during the chaos,

555
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,720
but it was you who stopped him.

556
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,980
Not to help you, just being forced by the situation.

557
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,800
Grace is grace.

558
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,550
We in the North Abyss have always been clear about grudges and grievances,

559
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,720
so I will definitely repay you for this.

560
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,040
But you still won't let me take her away, right?

561
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,180
Don't worry. I'm just asking.

562
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,280
From the moment she chose to turn back and fight with you against the fire, I understood.

563
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,400
Even if she loses her memory, she is still Ji Yunhe deep in her heart.

564
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,260
I still can't keep her.

565
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,860
I received a message from Xue Sanyue.

566
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,960
One of the things is related to the Frost mark.

567
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,040
Do you want to know the truth?

568
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,920
<i>The body of Zhu Yan is eternal black ice.</i>

569
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,580
<i>Every Frost mark comes from him.</i>

570
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,080
<i>If Zhu Yan does not die, the frost will not disappear.</i>

571
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,540
So the Frost is born from the body of Zhu Yan,

572
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,180
no wonder it can't be cured by medicine.
