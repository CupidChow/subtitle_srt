Your subordinate greets Young Master.

14
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,200
Well, I should call you Master now.

15
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,980
How's your wound?

16
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,740
Thanks to Master, I wasn't seriously injured that day.

17
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,080
You hid me here and gave me much cultivation.

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
I have recovered now.

19
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,520
<i>Thank you for not killing me, Young Master.</i>

20

<i>I had to punish you that day.</i>

21
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,220
If I didn't pretend to kill you like this, your soul might have vanished.

22
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,400
In order to cheat Yunhe and Xue Sanyue, I had to do that.

23
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,040
I'm sorry that I had to ruin half of your life's cultivation.

24
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,020
Don't say that.

25
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,020
I thought a lot while I was resting here, and I understood a lot.

26
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,900
I knew the mistakes I made,

27
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,880
and how difficult it was for you to protect Guardian Ji.

28
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,140
You've suffered from so much criticism,

29
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,980
have you gotten what you wanted?

30
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,920
Don't say that again.

31
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,280
But you were willing to die for me.

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,320
I can only trust you in this world.

33
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,700
There is one thing I need you to do.

34
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,202
Follow me.

35
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,680
The former Master has been using Ji Yunhe to suppress the Frost mark?

36
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,760
My father told me before he died, if this method works, to continue to do it.

37
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,280
So, you also have the Frost mark?

38
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm willing to sacrifice all my cultivation for you, Master.

39
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,700
My father traded a person's life with another person's life.

40
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,760
No innocent person should be sacrificed in Thousand Flower Valley.

41
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,300
But now we have finally found a way to suppress the Frost mark.

42
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,880
You want to abandon this method now?

43
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,300
Father let me be in charge of Thousand Flower Valley.

44
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,680
I won't just let it be, but not in this way.

45
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,020
I'll use spirit stones to replace the power of the universe,

46
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,120
so that I can open up my vessels.

47
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,580
But this method is difficult.

48
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,260
I need a friend that I can wholly trust and will never betray me.

49
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,040
I'll learn from Master Qing Shu, to company and help you, Master.

50
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,240
Learn from Qing Shu?

51
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,620
Are you sure?

<i>[Memorial Tablet of Master Qing Shu]</i>

53
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,820
Siyu, I won't lie to you,

54
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,600
but I won't promise you anything.

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,060
Master Qing Shu sacrificed all she had for Father.

56
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,760
In the end, she lost all her spiritual power and disappeared.

57
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,520
Besides this, nothing else.

58
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,460
You don't need to say that, Master.

59
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,840
I never expected anything, nor need any promises.

60
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,860
I don't want you to end like Qing Shu.

61
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,880
We'll fight against Immortal Master this time.

62
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,220
If you don't want to follow me, you can leave Thousand Flower Valley and make a living yourself.

63
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,560
I won't stop you.

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,300
You are the one that I want to follow.

65
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,020
All I want now is to help you achieve what you want during my whole life.

66
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,680
If you want to help me, from tomorrow,

67
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,020
you need to come back to life.

68
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,680
Master.

69
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,160
Siyu?

70
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,500
You didn't die?

71
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,880
Give them my order.

72
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,040
Siyu was framed at that time.

73
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,280
Now she has survived and come back to Thousand Flower Valley.

74
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,340
She will be here to work as my attendant.

75
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,860
You should all treat her like Master Qing Shu.

76
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,040
And she'll suppress the Frost mark with me.

77
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,680
Don't tell Immortal Master Mansion the thing about Elder Liuying.

78
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,400
When they send the antidotes next time,

79
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,880
take his part and analyze its property.

80
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,380
Okay.

81
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,320
If Master wants to stay with the Frost mark, what about Yunhe?

82
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,080
Just let her stay in the Immortal Master Mansion?

83
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,540
People have many things to be afraid of, life is as fragile as dew.

84
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,740
Now, Thousand Flower Valley is in danger.

85
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,960
Although Immortal Master won't hurt Yunhe for now, he has many secrets.

86
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
We can't act rashly.

87
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,220
Only when we get rid of his control,

88
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,280
can we fight against him and save Yunhe without hesitation.

89
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,580
Well, tell everyone that Siyu didn't die.

90
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, Sir.

91
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,140
Master, you're willing to let Guardian Ji suffer?

92
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,640
I always blamed my father,

93
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,400
why he often pushed me to make a choice,

94
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,180
why he couldn't let me chase the one I love.

95
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,940
Now, I understand.

96
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,320
How can everything be perfect in the world?

97
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,180
In our life,

98
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,520
we need to face many choices.

99
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,320
And I'll always be the Master of Thousand Flower Valley.

100
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,659
Check the front!

101
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,120
Let's hide first.

102
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520

I think the tattoo you put on me yesterday is beautiful.

a pair would be perfect.

It's Immortal Chengyu. Sorry.

I thought Fairy Shunde was just angry.

I didn't imagine that she hated you so much.

135
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,960
Well, I must admit she is persistent.

136
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,980
However, her subordinates are exhausted and can't think of new tricks.

137
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,920
Repeating the same old tricks every day is boring and monotonous.

138
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,760
It's really boring.

139

It's so dull.

140
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm just here to remind Guardian Ji.

141
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,860
The people that Fairy Shunde sent to catch the merman failed again.

142
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,800
According to Fairy Shunde's temper, I guess you will suffer.

143
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,740
If she wants to come here, she is more than welcome.

144

I miss her so much.

145
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,940
Guardian Ji is to miss the merman, right?

146
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,780
We've said goodbye to each other.

147
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,760
Even if we meet again, we'll only be enemies.

148
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,320
I only hope that he can be safe.

149
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,140
I don't expect anything else.

150

161
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,080
On the one hand, it's a good chance to find an ally.

162
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,480
On the other hand, we may take the risk of being caught.

163
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,720
It's uncertain whether it's fortune or misfortune.

164
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,180
Are you afraid?

165
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,260
You can still choose to leave now if you are afraid.

166
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,900
If I were afraid, how could I survive till today?

167
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,160
Your Majesty. Sir.

168
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,600
We've traveled to many places in half a year.

169
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,700
Although we were chased by Spiritual Masters, we could deal with them.

170
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,900
But this place is different. This is where Lingshuang Pavilion is located.

171
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,800
We might fight here. Do you need to reconsider?

172
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,320
Although we had many allies on the way here and are no longer helpless,

173
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,820
our power is still not enough to fight against Immortal Master Mansion.

174
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,300
In the North Abyss, Qing Xuan's clan is the most powerful descendants in Qing Qiu.

175
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,200
And the Fox King Qing Xuan is famous here.

176
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,220
If we can persuade him to be our ally, we'll have a higher chance to win.

177
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,000
Lingshuang Pavilion is under the support of Shunde who acts tyrannically.

178
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,240
Qing Xuan's clan is the nearest to Lingshuang Pavilion.

179
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,040
They must have suffered a lot.

180
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,880
We share the same hatred and pain.

181
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,920
They will be our ally.

182
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,220
Since you have made up your mind, I won't say anything.

183
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,200
I'm just worried about Your Majesty's spirit core.

184
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,800
We've traveled so many places and visited so many capable men,

185
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,240
but we didn't find a way to repair the spiritual core.

186
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,360
Now, the king's spiritual power is getting weaker and his spiritual core is unstable.

187
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,120
Your Majesty, you can't use spiritual power randomly.

188
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,820
If there is something dangerous, Mr. Kong Ming and I can do it.

189
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,620
Okay. Let's go.

190
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,143
<i>[Lingshuang Pavilion]</i>

191
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:19,400
<i>[Master of Lingshuang Pavilion, Zhu Ling]</i>

192
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:57,140
<i>- Well done!
- Well done!</i>

193
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,980
Master, you shot so well. Only Immortal Master can compare with you.

194
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,920
You are better than that Lin Canglan. No, even much better.

195
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,960
He is nothing to me.

196
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,660
How could he compare with me?

197
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,780
He can't even train the merman that Fairy Shunde gave him, and he died.

198
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,600
If I had that merman,

199
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,280
I would torture him and he would be docile now.

200
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,240
Master, don't be mad. Lin Canglan died, right?

201
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,140
Even if he didn't die, he can't compare with you, Master.

202
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,420
You are young and powerful, and have a promising future.

203
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,360
Among all Spiritual Masters,

204
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,500
I'll be the only famous one.

205
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,580
You're right.

206
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,820
Report!

207
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,800
Master, We found another group of Qing Qiu descendants.

208
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,820
Good. I've exercised enough.

209
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,240
It's time to teach those foxes a lesson,

210
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,720
so that they won't try to resist.

211
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,080
It's him.

212
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,740
Who is he?

213
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,140
Master of Lingshuang Pavilion, Zhu Ling.

214
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,780
Give me your spiritual cores and serve Fairy Shunde,

215
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,960
then you can survive.

216
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,160
In order to flatter Shunde, you framed us and forced us to submit.

217
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,820
I would rather die than give in.

218
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,780
Since you said so, I'll turn you into a coat for Fairy Shunde.

219
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,600
Did you see that? That's the consequence of not being obedient.

220
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,212
Give me your spiritual core, I'll let you live.

221
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:06,900
<i>[Young Master of Fox Clan, Qing Yao]</i>

222
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,180
I'll attract his attention. Break out now!

223
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,700
- Okay.
- What?

224
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,860
Deal with these Spiritual Masters. We'll save that girl from the Fox Clan.

225
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,400
Your Majesty, don't waste too much spiritual power.

226
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,260
Don't worry, I'll protect him.

227
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,640
Let's go.

228
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,440
Are you okay?

229
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,500
Take her away from here.

230
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,440
I'll deal with him.

231
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,280
Kong Ming? It's you.

232
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,040
You betrayed Immortal Master Mansion, so you should hide somewhere and live.

233
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,900
But you collude with a merman and fight against me now.

234
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,980
I'll teach you a lesson today.

235
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,620
You?

236
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,780
Thank you for your help.

237
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,560
But my clan is still in danger. I can't abandon them.

238
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,500
My companion went to help them.

239
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,500
To be honest, even if you go back now, you can't help them.

240
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,880
You...

241
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,780
You're right.

242
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,880
I didn't cultivate enough, so I can't protect them.

243
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,760
Are you a descendant of Qing Qiu?

244
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,480
Thank you for saving me today.

245
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,680
You're welcome.

246
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,840
Can you tell me where the Fox King, Qing Xuan is?

247
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,740
You're looking for the Fox King?

248
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,080
Why are you looking for him?

249
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,860
I suggest you not to ask too much.

250
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,280
As long as you tell me about him, I'll thank you a lot.

251
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,060
Qing Qiu's descendants will repay the kindness they received.

252
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,340
I can take you to find the Fox King.

253
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,760
But you should tell me,

254
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,520
what is your name,

255
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,340
where are you from,

256
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,880
why are you looking for him?

257
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,480
- This is what you call "repaying kindness"?
- You...

258
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,680
<i>Young Lord! Young Lord!</i>

259
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,420
- Don't touch our Young Lord!
- Young Lord.
- Young Lord.

260
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,100
- Young Lord, are you okay?
- Brother.

261
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,400
<i>[Qing Yao's cousin, Qi Feng]</i>

262
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
You're Qing Xuan's daughter?

263
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,060
Your Majesty. Your Majesty, these people don't appreciate our kindness.

264
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,180
We went to help them, but they caught me.

265
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,760
You're together?

266
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,680
You just showed up suddenly.

267
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,700
Who knows if you are kind or have other evil purposes?

268
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,460
Let our Young Lord go, or I'll kill him.

269
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,000
Qing Xuan's soldiers deal with things like this?

270
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,700
Although you saved me, Zhu Ling is evil and cunning.

271
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,580
We have to deal with you carefully.

272
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,780
There is no relation between Zhu Ling and us.

273
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,540
If you must say we are related, we would only be enemies.

274
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,880
We're here to meet the Fox King.

275
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,100
It's you.

276
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,180
You're the merman prince Chang Yi that Fairy Shunde asked to catch.

277
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,400
- Brother, what did you say?
- Fairy Shunde has been searching for him for a long time.

278
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,080
She has given his portrait to Spiritual Masters in North Abyss.

279
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,440
I saw the portrait accidentally. It's him.

280
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,380
Come on! Catch him!

281
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,040
I will give him to Fairy Shunde!

282
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,780
- Okay!
- Stop.

283
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,480
Cousin, what are you doing?

284
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,060
I heard Fairy Shunde was angry with him because he offended her.

285
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,260
Then she ordered the closing of the East Sea and killed the Merman King.

286
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,840
Now, Qing Qiu's power is weak.

287
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,560
If we have any relation with him, we will find troubles for ourselves.

288
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,540
Unless, we give him to Fairy Shunde,

289
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,920
maybe Fairy Shunde will be happy and let us go.

290
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,120
Cousin, it's Zhu Ling and Shunde that made us become like this.

291
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,960
He saved me.

292
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,760
How can you flatter your enemy with the life of your benefactor?

293
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,180
Even if we may trade for a peaceful life because of this, how could our conscience rest?

294
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,780
Trade for a peaceful life?

295
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,840
I think this is a ray of hope.

296
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,340
Your Majesty!

297
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,000
Cousin!

298
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,220
Cousin, Prince Chang Yi saved my life.

299
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,560
I can't repay his kindness like this.

300
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,820
Are you okay?

301
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,360
I'm fine.

302
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,980
Prince Chang Yi, Zhu Ling has been angered.

303
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,200
He'll surely come back again.

304
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,760
You can follow me to hide in the Fox Hole for now.

305
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,920
As the Young Lord of the Fox Clan,

306
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,200
I promise we won't hurt you.

307
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,680
<i>The one who roams about alone and helplessly</i>

308
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,560
<i>must miss home a lot.</i>

309
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,000
<i>When you are helpless and lonely,</i>

310
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,540
<i>I hope it can make you happy.</i>

311
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,200
Chang Yi, the East Sea is gone.

312
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,320
Where are you now?

313
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,360
Are you living a good life?

314
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,240
Get in.

315
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,680
Yunhe! Yunhe!

316
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Who is Chang Yi?

317
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,280
Don't you love me the most?

318
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,720
Did you find another person you love?

319
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,040
You are?

320
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,180
I'm A'Sheng whom you love the most.

321
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,000
A'Sheng?

322
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,800
<i>I've been searching for you for so long.</i>

323
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,280
<i>The girl I love is just standing in front of me.</i>

324
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,560
I know you love me and can't forget me.

325
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,600
But don't offend Fairy Shunde because of me.

326
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,900
I'll be in pain.

327
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,000
Why are you here?

328
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,160
Envoy Zhang, did you find all people that I asked you to find?

329
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,560
Yes.

330
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,200
They were all trained by Ji Yunhe,

331
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,440
and were sent to receive punishment in Immortal Master Mansion.

332
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,920
They all hate her so much.

333
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,960
We've sent them to accompany Ji Yunhe.

334
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,160
This time, I'm sure she'll suffer.

335
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,440
Great.

336
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,920
I'll wait for the day when she comes to beg for mercy with nine tails.

337
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,920
How could Guardian Ji in Thousand Flower Valley become like this?

338
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,140
You were proud back then.

339
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,720
You're here, too?

340
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,860
I heard Fairy Shunde was looking for people that hate you,

341
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,380
so I'm here.

342
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,920
So you're here to kill me?

343
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,640
I only want to know the situation of that kid.

344
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,020
I'm not interested in anything else.

345
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,240
He was sent back to his hometown.

346
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,280
He is growing up healthily under the care of his mother.

347
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,500
Okay.

348
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,840
I have nothing else to do.

349
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,280
Look at you.

350
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,560
You should pretend to be pathetic.

351
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,080
You need to know you're being punished now.

352
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,040
So you are all here to get revenge on me?

353
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,160
No, Yunhe.

354
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,120
I know you're trapped here because you treat me well.

355
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,440
Don't worry.

356
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
I'll protect you.

357
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,460
Yunhe, ou took care of my brother for me.

358
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,080
Then you're a brother to me.

359
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,960
Even if Fairy Shunde gives me a sword now,

360
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,680
I'll only stab myself.

361
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,640
I'm just here to see...

362
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,600
who wants to harm you.

363
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,440
I'll teach her a lesson for you.

364
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,680
I'll protect Yunhe.

365
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,660
It's not your turn.

366
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,480
The cell we're living in is gloomy.

367
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,040
People may get weak and fall sometimes.

368
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,800
It's strange.

369
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,280
I have been feeling uncomfortable recently.

370
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,680
We came here because they told us we can change cells.

371
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,640
Yes.

372
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,120
We were all caught by Envoy Zhang and brought here,

373
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,280
but we don't want to hurt you.

374
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,760
Then suit yourselves here.

375
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,160
I can't take care of you now.

376
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,460
We are friends. You don't need to say so.

377
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,880
Well, Yunhe, let me accompany you.

378
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>Chang Yi, when I can control the spiritual power inside and escape here,</i>

379
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,240
<i>I'll find you. Okay?</i>

380
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,880
Well, Mr. Kong Ming, how is he?

381
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,680
Fortunately, his spiritual core just vibrated a little.

382
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,560
Sir, you said you would protect Your Majesty.

383
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,100
Why did you come there after Your Majesty fought with him?

384
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,260
Sir, you fought with that Spiritual Master alone. Are you injured?

385
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,820
They can't hurt me.

386
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,300
But look at you.

387
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,040
You should take care of yourself.

388
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,880
Protect your spiritual core.

389
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,120
Don't break it before you fight against the Immortal Master.

390
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,440
Young Lord.

391
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,840
My cousin is impetuous.

392
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,040
Please forgive him, Prince Chang Yi.

393
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,680
You saved our lives.

394
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,860
You can get some rest here. This place is covert.

395
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,160
Spiritual Masters of Lingshuang Pavilion can't find this place.

396
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,400
I think Prince Chang Yi looks pale.

397
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,500
This is the spiritual pill of my clan.

398
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,280
You can have a try.

399
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
If you don't like it,

400
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,960
I'll find another spiritual pill for you.

401
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,400
Thank you.

402
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,280
Young Lord.

403
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,980
We want to discuss something important with the Fox King.

404
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,680
I wonder if you can let us meet him.

405
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,740
Young Lord, is there any difficulty you can't say?

406
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,240
Or is the Fox King not willing to meet us?

407
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,100
It's not that he doesn't want to meet you.

408
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,260
It's that he can't meet you.

409
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,860
What do you mean, Young Lord?

410
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,000
Lingshuang Pavilion and we lived in peace before.

411
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,800
But since Zhu Ling became Master,

412
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,400
in order to build his reputation and flatter Shunde,

413
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,600
he started to catch many Immortals randomly.

414
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,080
One day a few years ago,

415
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,380
he led many people to attack us sneakily.

416
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,040
To protect us, my father...

417
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,220
<i>[Fox King, Qingxuan] <
Yao'er, take them out of here.</i>

418
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,780
<i>- I'll fight against them.
- Check that way!</i>

419
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,880
<i>Father, we must leave together. We can't leave without you.</i>

420
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,280
<i>As the Young Lord,</i>

421
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,120
<i>you need to grow up and protect our clan.</i>

422
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,680
<i>Father, I can't do this myself.</i>

423
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,000
<i>We all need you.</i>

424
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,220
<i>Don't be such a coward.</i>

425
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,200
<i>Yao'er, remember, no matter what happens to me,</i>

426
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
<i>you can't give in to Zhu Ling.</i>

427
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,840
<i>Don't let anyone insult the honor and dignity of Qing Qiu.</i>

428
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,000
<i>Father.</i>

429
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,280
<i>Take her out of here!</i>

430
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,200
<i>Father!</i>

431
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,580
<i>Father!</i>

432
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,440
<i>Young Lord, let's go.</i>

433
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,360
<i>Leave here!</i>

434
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,600
In order to protect us,

435
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,480
my father was caught by Zhu Ling

436
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,360
and was imprisoned in Lingshuang Pavilion.

437
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,700
I can understand your feelings, Young Lord.

438
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,420
I also heard of the thing about the Merman King.

439
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,860
I'm so sorry to hear that.

440
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,480
But why did you come all the way here to find my father?

441
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,320
Although my father is not here,

442
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,760
if I can help you, I'll try my best.

443
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:51,600
- Young Lord, we want you to be our ally.
- Ally?

444
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,560
Yes. We can occupy Lingshuang Pavilion,

445
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,920
and fight against Immortal Master Mansion together.

446
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,120
This is not a small matter.

447
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,620
I need to think about it.

448
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,780
Okay.

449
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,040
Well, I won't disturb you here.

450
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,320
Your Highness.

451
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,880
Well, although Young Lord Qing Yao is nice,

452
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,520
General Qi Feng is ungrateful.

453
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,440
He even wanted to kill us.

454
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,640
I think we can't stay here for long.

455
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,000
The Fox King was caught.

456
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,200
Immortals in the North Abyss are treated unfairly.

457
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,720
How could we just ignore it?

458
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,120
It's good.

459
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Don't waste it.

460
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,020
I've helped you to almost recover.

461
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,600
After some time, your body will also form.

462
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,460
<i>Why do I look just the same?</i>

463
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,400
What? You didn't die and you're not satisfied?

464
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,200
<i>Master Qing, I finally have a chance to form my body again.</i>

465
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,320
<i>I should try to improve it.</i>

466
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,900
<i>Look at my eyes. Can you make them bigger?</i>

467
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,740
<i>And my lips and body.</i>

468
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,960
<i>I think Chang Yi's big eyes and small face are great.</i>

469
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,100
<i>Can you adjust them for me?</i>

470
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,560
Okay.

471
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,280
But I drank a lot of wine.

472
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,840
I may make a mistake.

473
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,240
If I make a little mistake,

474
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,800
and turn you into a cute kitten, don't regret it.

475
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,040
After all,

476
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,040
I've been waiting for a man in Ten Directions Formation for thousands of years,

477
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,500
I feel annoyed when I see men.

478
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,560
It's good if I can have a beautiful girl with me.

479
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,280
<i>Please don't. Just forget about it.</i>

480
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,200
<i>If my face changes, Sanyue won't recognize me.</i>

481
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,679
<i>Well, Master Qing, Sanyue has been gone for so long.</i>

482
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,980
<i>Do you have any news from her?</i>

483
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,000
Even if she doesn't take those spiritual pills back,

484
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,800
you can still form your body,

485
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,040
but the process will be slower.

486
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,120
<i>You're right.</i>

487
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,000
<i>She hates me so much.</i>

488
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,600
<i>Why would she come back and see me?</i>

489
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:46,359
Li Shu,

490
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,380
you won't be disappointed if you don't have much hope.

491
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,400
After all, how many so-called affectionate people

492
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,800
in this world can stand the test?

493
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,240
You've been gone for so long.

494
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,220
I thought you didn't want to come back for him.

495
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,400
It's hard to find the three spiritual pills you asked for.

496
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,260
It took me some time,

497
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,080
and the pills have turned to medicated water.

498
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,220
Some of the pills are in inaccessible places in Daiyu Mountain,

499
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,600
some of them are guarded by fierce beasts.

500
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,900
I didn't imagine you would spend so much effort for Li Shu.

501
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,160
He saved me, I need to repay him.

502
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,400
I don't like to owe other people.

503
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,220
Take this and let him take it.

504
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,540
Since you're here, don't you want to know if he can survive safely?

505
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,940
I'll go to the cave... and wait for your news.

506
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,420
Master Qing, you said it would take some time before I have a body.

507
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,700
Why do I have my body so soon?

508
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,760
This was...

509
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
This was sent by Sanyue?

510
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,240
So she is back?

511
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,980
She seemed tired and went to rest in the cave.

512
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,480
Just go and see her.

513
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,360
Thank you, Master Qing.

514
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,240
Good.

515
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,840
Li Shu.

516
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,840
We don't owe each other now.

517
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,720
Sanyue.

518
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,740
Sanyue.

519
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,220
<i>It seems I can only try to absorb the cold aura into my body.</i>

520
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:22,940

I was not frozen?

<i>Sanyue.</i>

536
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,530
Li Shu?
