<i>First, the merman talks.</i>

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,740
<i>Second, the merman cuts off his tail.</i>

22

<i>Third, the merman gives her his merman pearl, and never betrays her.</i>

<i>Guardian Ji of the Thousand Flower Valley is willing to train the merman.</i>

<i>This is the only chance for me to gain freedom. I can't miss it.</i>

<i>I like you, admire you,</i>

<i>and want to be your lover.</i>

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,040
<i>I've thought about it.</i>

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,600
<i>I'm willing to stay with you and not go back to the sea.</i>

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,040
<i>You gave me the merman pearl.</i>

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,860
<i>It's a keepsake, and also a promise to you.</i>

<i>If there is no antidote, she can't survive three days.</i>

<i>Save her!</i>

<i>Cut off your tail and I'll save her!</i>

40

<i>If the merman cuts his tail, it means he has betrayed the Merman Clan. He can't go back to the sea.</i>

41
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,500
<i>Don't you want to go home?</i>

42

<i>I want to go home,</i>

<i>I will take him to leave here.</i>

46
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,940
<i>Ji Yunhe, the two spiritual powers in your body are incompatible.</i>

47
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,080
<i>I'm afraid you can't live long.</i>

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,100
<i>The merman you trained must make me happy.</i>

49
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,780
<i>So can you force him now?</i>

50
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,020
<i>No.</i>

<i>Stop!</i>

52
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,860
<i>Let her go.</i>

<i>I'll do whatever you say.</i>

<i>Chang Yi, I'll set you free with my life.</i>

<i>I don't want you to save me with your life. I'll take you to leave here!</i>

56
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,480
<i>Idiot.</i>

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,640
<i>I set you free, but you came back and asked for it.</i>

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,360
<i>Do you have any difficulties that you can't say?</i>

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,220
<i>What I told you, every sentence, is never sincere.</i>

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,160
<i>Kill her.</i>

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,000
<i>Others and search for the merman under the mountain.</i>

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,700
<i>Anyone who dares to pass this cliff,</i>

63
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,360
<i>I'll kill him!</i>

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,080
<i>She is not an Immortal, nor a fox.</i>

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,440
<i>She is so rare. Take her back to Congji Jail.</i>

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,700
<i>I'm willing to make experiments on her together with you, Master.</i>

67
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,500
<i>The Merman King organized an uprising.</i>

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,320
<i>Under the order of Fairy Shunde, he has been executed.</i>

69
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,300
<i>I want to take revenge, on Shunde, on Immortal Master.</i>

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,920
<i>I want them to pay what they owed us all these years.</i>

<i>I'll kill you!</i>

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,100
<i>Big-tailed Fish, are you here to save me?</i>

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,400
<i>I'm here to take revenge.</i>

<i>From now on, your life belongs to me.</i>

<i>[Cloud Quarters, Lake Island]</i>

77
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,100
<i>[Guardian of Thousand Flower Valley, Ji Yunhe]</i>

78
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,400
<i>[Merman of East Sea, Chang Yi]</i>

79
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,660
How's her body now?

80
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,380
She is seriously injured.
<i> [Humble Immortal, Kong Ming]</i>

81
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,940
If she didn't have a slight pulse,

82
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,920
I thought you wanted me to cure a dead person.

83
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,200
What happened?

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Why would she become like this?

85
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,940
According to her pulse condition, it seems someone injected the power of the universe into her body,

86
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,120
because he wanted to break the Frost mark seal on her.

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,560
Then she has two spiritual veins and formed a spirit elixir.

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,620
But this betrayed the rule of nature.

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,300
Although he helped her to break the Frost mark seal, it seriously influenced and injured her body.

90
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,180
She told me about it.

91
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,600
Lin Canglan and Immortal Master did experiments on her.

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,200
So it's true.

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,140
Actually, she was not seriously influenced before.

94
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,420
But just as Shunde said, she was tortured during those days,

95
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,680
which made her even weaker.

96
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,100
And she fought with Shunde in Congji Jail.

97
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,420
Her body became extremely weak, so she was seriously influenced.

98
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,560
<i>[Chang Yi's Servant, Luo Suo]</i>
Although she betrayed Your Majesty, she is so pitiful now.

99
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
Prince Chang Yi.

100
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,160
Young Lord Qing Yao wants Mr. Kong Ming and you to go there and check the Fox King.

101
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,400
I'll be there soon.

102
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,007
<i>Okay.</i>

103
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,780
This place is quiet. Just leave her here.

104
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,340
Give them my order, no one shall come close to Lake Island.

105
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,220
I'll set a barrier and guard this place.

106
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,120
Let her stay here? Don't we need to imprison her in the No Desire Cave?

107
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,580
What are you thinking? You knew it wouldn't work.

108
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,520
I have my own arrangement.

109
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,820
Luo Suo, you stay here.

110
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,280
If she wakes up, inform me immediately.

111
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,800
You said you would torture and take revenge on her.

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Why are you letting her live here?

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,020
It's better than my room.

114
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,000
<i>[Fox King, Qing Xuan]</i>

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,580
His spiritual power dissipated.

116
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,100
Although your Elixir Fixing Occult Magic protected his spiritual vein,

117
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,160
if we want him to wake up,

118
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm afraid...

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,120
<i>[Young Lord of Fox Clan, Qing Yao]</i>
As long as he is still breathing, I'll save him.

120
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,940
No matter how hard it is and how long it will take, I won't give up.

121
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,620
Mr. Kong Ming and I will surely help you, Young Lord.

122
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,840
Now, the Fox King is still unconscious.

123
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,900
In order to protect his body, we might as well freeze his body first and find a method, so that he can wake up one day.

124
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,447
Father, have a good rest.

125
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:16,560
I'll take care of the rest.

126
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,600
I'll protect the people in our clan.

127
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,427
Your Majesty.

128
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:43,239
How do you want to deal with Ji Yunhe?

129
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:47,240
I imprisoned her onLake Island and will deal with her myself.

130
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,760
You don't need to worry, Young Lord.

131
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,220
I shall leave now.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,706
Goodbye.

133
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,820
Sanyue, the fish soup is almost ready.

134
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,840
You had a huge fight. You need to eat more nutritious food.

135
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,160
Eat some fruit first. The fish soup will be ready soon.

136
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,140
<i>[Former Commander of Combat Force in Thousand Flower Valley, Xue Sanyue]</i>

137
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,240
I know where Yunhe is.

138
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,280
Chang Yi has imprisoned Yunhe in the Cloud Quarters on Lake Island.

139
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,540
And he set a barrier there.

140
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,720
Without a token, even if I become a butterfly, I can't get in there.
<i>[Ji Yunhe's Attendant, Luo Jinsang]</i>

141
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,340
It's just a barrier. I can just break it.

142
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,780
I want to see what Chang Yi is doing.

143
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,960
You don't need to fight with him.

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,940
You can just ask him.

145
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Master Qing, thank you for helping me.

146
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,660
<i>[Blue Feather Phoenix, Qing Ji]</i>
When we were fighting,

147
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,220
Ning Qing felt there was something wrong with Immortal Master Mansion, so he left.

148
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:10,200
Although I fought with him, I didn't stop him and was injured by him.

149
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
It's so disgraceful.

150
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,920
You don't need to thank me.

151
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,360
You've helped North Abyss a lot by hindering the pace of Immortal Master.

152
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,600
Since you've decided to ally with North Abyss,

153
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,280
Immortal Master will surely find trouble for you in Leyou Mountain.

154
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,200
I hope you can have a good rest in the North Abyss.

155
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,240
I've been trapped in Ten Directions Formation for a thousand years.

156
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,140
Ning Qing's cultivation improved a lot.

157
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,600
According to his diligent personality,

158
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,340
it's not surprising,

159
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,280
but I feel there is something wrong.

160
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,940
You need to keep this in mind.

161
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,680
If you fight with him, be careful.

162

Your Majesty.

Your Majesty, Ji Yunhe woke up.

165
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,840
Master, I have something to do. I shall leave now.

166
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,480
Wait!

167
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,780
Chang Yi, I have something to ask you.

168
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,400
Why did you imprison Yunhe on Lake Island once you arrived in North Abyss?

169
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I appreciate you for saving Yunhe's life.

170
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,820
But you can't imprison her for no reason.

171
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,260
You have to give me an explanation.

172
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,360
She is just a prisoner.

173
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,160
I don't need to explain to anyone.

174
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,780
Prisoner? What do you mean?

175
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,120
If Yunhe didn't set you free, she wouldn't have been imprisoned by Fairy Shunde.

176
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,900
Look at you. You saved her from one prison and locked her in another prison.

177
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,500
You...

178
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,320
You're so ungrateful. Yunhe suffered a lot for you.

179
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,460
The things between her and me, whether it's grace or hatred, we'll deal with it.

180
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,660
It's none of your business.

<i>[Prince of Lynx Clan, Li Shu]</i>
Let's talk during eating.

183
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,360
I just made fish soup. It's nutritious.

184
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,420
How about drinking one bowl inside?

185
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,180
How could you take it away?

186
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,700
Sanyue, I can make another pot of fish soup for you.

187
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,040
He is the Prince of the Merman Clan.

188
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,800
How could he take away my fish soup?

189
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,520
Does he know how laborious it is to make fish soup?

190
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,740
I'm still worried about Yunhe.

191
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,120
What if Chang Yi doesn't know what Yunhe has suffered and tortures her as Shunde did?

192
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,900
Master.

193
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,720
Beautiful Master Qing Ji, eat some fruit.

194
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,740
You said you would help us.

195
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,520
I promised to help you to deal with Immortal Master.

196
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,920
I didn't say I would intervene in this mess.

197
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
It's too troublesome.

198
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,620
Besides, whether it's love or hatred,

199
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,380
it's just because people can't figure it out, let it go, or forget it.

200
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,120
How could I help them?

201
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll find him.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
No matter what it takes, I'll force him to let Yunhe go.

203
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,080
Sanyue.

204
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,460
We just arrived in North Abyss, we're not familiar with this place.

205
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,560
If you act rashly now, it may bring trouble to Yunhe.

206
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,060
Let's stay here and observe first.

207
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,100
Besides, how could Chang Yi hurt Yunhe?

208
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Think about it.

209
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,680
Why did he take away that fish soup?

210
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,780
We need to eat nutritious food and increase spiritual power.

211
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,620
But one person needs that more than us.

218
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,460
You want to leave here?

219
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,440
You think you're here to enjoy life?

220

This is Cloud Quarters on Lake Island.

223
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,000
Prince Chang Yi asked us to imprison you here.

224
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,740
So it's a prison.

225
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,480
God never shows any mercy to me.

226
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,280
Miss, I know you're nice. Can you tell me where Chang Yi is?

227
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,880
I want to see him.

228
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,500
Don't try to cotton up with me.

229
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,420
Prince Chang Yi is busy. How could he have time to meet a prisoner?

230
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,100
We treat you well enough by sending you some medicine.

231
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,280
Let me tell you. Don't find trouble for me.

232
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,540
Didn't Chang Yi tell you,

233
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,060
even the Immortal Master can't imprison me?

234
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,587
Chang Yi.

235
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,380
Where do you want to go?

236
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,980
If I say, I want to drink some soup, would you believe me?

237
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,680
Soup?

238
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,280
Now you have soup. Go and drink it.

239
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,480
Chang Yi, I've slept for a long time.

240
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,440
My body has recovered.

241
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,360
I apologize for what I've done to you before.

242
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,720
Can you let me out?

243
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,740
Drink the soup.

244
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,440
You can choose not to forgive me and not let me out,

245
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,380
can you let Luo Luo come here to accompany me?

246
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,088
Eat.

247
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,660
Except for this, can you say something else?

248
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,700
I won't drink this herb soup. It tastes bad.

249
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,020
I don't need it to increase spiritual power. Take it back.

250
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,260
You can choose to drink it yourself or I'll use a spell to make you drink it.

251
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,279
Make your decision.

252
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,219
You are forcing me because I'm weak?

253
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,080
So what?

254
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,287
Eat.

255
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,820
I've finished eating. Are you satisfied?

256
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,100
You made my wound ache.

257
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,000

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,540
would you put this chess piece here?

316
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,160
Your Majesty, that's a bad move.

317
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,640
You can put it there.

318
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,580
I would still put it here.

319
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,000
Your Majesty, who taught you to be so staid?

320
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,220
How could you call this staid?

321
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,920
That's the virtue of a man.

322
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,420
The reason why I put it here is not following the rules of never changing the move you made.

323
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,200
I don't regret the decision I made that day.

324
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,580
Your Majesty, then why are you sighing all the time?

325
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,780
My sister is my only family.

326
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,740
I know she is sad, but I can do nothing about it.

327
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,280
I feel sorry for her,

328
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,260
but I don't think I did the wrong thing.

329
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,740
I'm her brother,

330
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,940
as well as the Heavenly King of the world.

331
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,660
Since I knew about the things that happened in Congji Jail,

332
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,500
I can't just ignore them.

333
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,080
Now you know what to insist on, right?

334
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,560
In the past, I always conceded because I couldn't defeat Immortal Master.

335
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,360
To call it forbearance, when actually, I was just escaping from the reality.

336
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,200
But after this, I won't concede or yield anymore.

337
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,040
I'll try my best.

338
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,940
And I have my father's Spirit Token.

339
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,280
I won't disappoint my father.

340
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,880
<i>He has the Spirit Token.</i>

341
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,860
<i>What are you waiting for? Kill him.</i>

342
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,580
<i>[Immortal Master, Ning Qing]</i>
He is still young.

343
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,960
You don't need to be afraid.

344
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,240
<i>If he can summon millions of divine soldiers,</i>

345
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,840
<i>he won't be the boy you can easily control.</i>

346
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,600
Will you give almighty power to a kid?

347
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,200
If millions of divine soldiers can be easily summoned,

348
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,660
he wouldn't be biding his time now.

349
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,880
According to his cultivation now,

350
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,840
if he wants to pass the test

351
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,920
and summon millions of divine soldiers,

352
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,800
it's way too far.

353
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,460
<i>Then, why did you bow to him that day?</i>

354
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,640
I was just showing some respect to the former emperor.

355
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,560
After all, when he was alive,

356
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,580
he had a high reputation and was respected by Immortals.

357
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,180
I didn't need to irritate everyone just because of a Fox Clan.

358
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Just as I expected,

359
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,620
the divine soldiers didn't come.

360
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,040
Your Majesty, it's divine soldiers, so they must be hard to be summoned.

361
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,260
You're ambitious and kind.

362
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,060
The divine soldiers will surely come.

363
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,860
Don't worry.

364
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,536
Look! The Spirit Token is showing you the hint.

365
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,980
Master Fei Lian, you're knowledgable.

366
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,540
Do you know what it means?

367
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,720
My father left me this,

368
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,240
what is it indicating?

369
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,340
Here is Xun Grass. It can help Fairy Shunde restore her face.

370
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,280
I'm here to give it to Fairy Shunde.

371
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,320
In order to cure Fairy Shunde's face, Master wasted much effort.

372
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,920
He spent several nights making the medicine.

373
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,900
<i>[Apprentice in Immortal Master's Mansion, Ji Chengyu]</i>
Now you have sent Xun Grass here,

374
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,400
<i>[Master of Thousand Flower Valley, Lin Haoqing]</i>
I'm sure Master will know Thousand Flower Valley's loyalty.

375
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,240
But treatment takes time. Please wait here.

376
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,475
Ru Ling.

377
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,820
Master.

378
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,180
Master, you're finally here to see me.

379
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,160
- Get out.
- Okay.

380
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,360
Don't worry, Ru Ling.

381
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,500
I can cure your face.

382
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,920
I only trust you.

383
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,520
It's so painful!

384
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,360
This medicine will purge the rotten meat on your face.

385
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,000
You'll surely feel pain.

386
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,620
Master, you're almighty.

387
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,360
You must have other ways that won't let me feel so much pain.

388
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,500
It hurts!

389
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,580
Ru Ling, don't cry.

390
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,840
If you cry, the medicine won't work.

391
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,720
Then I have to repeat this process.

392
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,040
No...

393
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,640
Master...

394
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,900
Behave well, Ru Ling.

395
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,200
I'll come to cure your face tomorrow.

396
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,620
Tomorrow...

397
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,620
Such pain will continue tomorrow.

398
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,300
Ji Yunhe... the merman...

399
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,060
I will make you pay a bitter price.

400
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,840
It's so terrifying.

401
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,340
Use spring water to make tea,

402
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,460
and winter snow to make wine.

403
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,100
It may snow today.

404
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,220
I should warm some wine to drink.

405
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,780
Look how weak you are.

406
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,520
You may die if you drink wine.

407
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,380
It's so cold. Others can rest in their room, but I have to take care of you.

408
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,320
Close the window. It's okay if you die.

409
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,960
But if you are ill, I have to take care of you.

410
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,680
Didn't you hear what I said?

411
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,620
I did.

412
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,480
I just want to breathe some fresh air.

413
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,400
I suggest you not push me too hard.

414
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,520
Who cares?

415
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,140
You're just a prisoner. Do you think you're the owner here?

416
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,630
Move!

417
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,160
How dare you hurt me? Do you know who I am?

418
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
I used to take care of Young Lord Qing Yao.

419
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,620
I dare to hurt many people.

420
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,420
How dare you!

421
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,780
What are you doing? Let me go!

422
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,820
Don't! Don't let me go!

423
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,600
I am not as strong as before.

424
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,700
I only used such little power. I feel weak and my hands tremble.

425
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,740
Don't! Don't tremble!

426
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,180
Who cares?

427
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,200
How's the feeling of being bullied?

428
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,480
If you do such things again, I'll let you drop.

429
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,640
How dare you make fun of me!

430
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,860
Who are you?

431
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,440
Your Majesty.

432
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,700
Who are you?

433
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,040
Chang Yi, your temper has become a lot more grumpy.

434
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,464
Come here and drink your medicine.

435
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:33,980
I just saw how you dealt with her.

436
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,920
I can't drink it.

437
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,420
Don't bargain with me.

438
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,675
Chang Yi, I've taken this medicine.

439
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,460
Can I discuss something with you?

440
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,400
How about you let me out for one day and I stay here for one day,

441
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,800
you let me out for two days and I stay here for two days?

442
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,880
When I come back, I'll stay here.

443
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,420
I'll eat what you ask me to eat.

444
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,133
Impossible.

445
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:27,420
Take the medicine, then eat the herbs.

446
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,300
When I was in the Congji Jail,

447
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,620
Immortal Master never cared what I ate.

448
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,220
But you care about everything in my daily life now.

449
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,360
Will you supervise whether I'm breathing or not one day?

450
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,100
Instead of being like this, how about just killing me?

451
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,620
It's better than being annoyed by you every day.

452
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,823
Ji Yunhe, you won't die.

453
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:56,020
When I want to torture you,

454
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,300
you must stay alive.

455
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,127
<i>Silly fish.</i>

456
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:15,140
<i>It's not torture to watch your face and take medicine.</i>

457
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:20,640
<i>It's the greatest kindness in the rest of my life.</i>

458
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,980
Master Lin saved Fairy Shunde with your life and made a great contribution.

459
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,600
I've told Master. I'm sure Master will reward you.

460
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,520
It's my duty. I don't dare to ask for any reward.

461
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,120
Immortal Chengyu, bad news.

462
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,980
There are some evil spirits in the yard.

463
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,040
We can't catch them.

464
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,900
Please go there and have a look, Immortal.

465
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,960
Why are there evil spirits in Immortal Master Mansion?

466
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Well... I don't know, either.

467
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,960
I shall leave now. Please get some rest, Master Lin.

468
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,560
<i>[Lin Haoqing's Attendant, Siyu]
Are you sure you'll stay in Lutai Mountain?</i>

469
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,420
<i>Xue Sanyue has stolen the antidotes we collected. We can't continue to do experiments.</i>

470
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,199
<i>I made great a contribution by saving Shunde.</i>

471
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,580
<i>I should take this chance and find the antidote.</i>

472
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,480
<i>You mean, you'll steal the antidote in Immortal Master Mansion?</i>

473
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,560
<i>No, it's too dangerous.</i>

474
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,700
<i>We're always in danger.</i>

475
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,239
<i>We have no choice.</i>

476
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,840
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

477
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,280
<i>Find some evil spirits for me.</i>

478
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,600
<i>Where would Immortal Master hide the antidote?</i>

479
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,360
<i>Am I being too nervous and hallucinating?</i>

480
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,120
Check the mansion in case there is an evil spirit left. Be sure there are no more evil spirits.

481
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,620
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

482
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,560
Chengyu.

483
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,760
What happened?

484
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,240
Master, there were some evil spirits and I've eliminated them.

485
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,280
Master Lin sent Xun Grass for Fairy Shunde.

486
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,540
He is waiting for you in Quiet Chamber.

487
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,175
Master Lin?

488
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,460
Immortal Master.

489
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,880
I like playing the game of go. When I saw the end-game, I couldn't help but analyze it for a while.

490
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,620
Please, Immortal Master, forgive me for disorganizing the chess pieces.

491
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,860
Since you're interested in it,

492
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,140
let's play a round.

493
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,580
Okay.

494
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,500
Young Lord, you need to uphold justice for me.

495
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,580
Okay. Stand up.

496
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,960
Thank you, Young Lord.

497
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,860
I'll tell Prince Chang Yi.

498
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,680
You can continue to be my attendant.

499
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,040
Thank you, Young Lord.

500
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,280
Young Lord, I think there is something wrong with Ji Yunhe.

501
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,880
She is just a prisoner, but Prince always goes there and sees her.

502
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,080
I don't think he'll torture her.

503
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,000
Prince Chang Yi said he has his arrangements.

504
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,120
But I think there is something wrong.

505
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,100
And today, I saw her use Fox Fire.

506
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
- Fox Fire?
- Yes.

507
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,320
Are you sure?

508
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
How could Spiritual Masters use Fox Fire?

509
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,960
I saw it clearly.

510
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,180
And she used red Fox Fire.

511
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,520
I've never seen it before.

512
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,560
Tell me what you saw clearly.

513
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,180
Father, I have one thing that I can't understand,

514
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,740
but I have no one to talk with,

515
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,100
so I'm here to tell you.

516
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,640
When Aunt Qing Shu met Lin Canglan,

517
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,240
she followed him to go to Thousand Flower Valley,

518
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,900
and had been working for him for hundreds of years.

519
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,420
She had no regret.

520
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,600
So when I knew Lin Canglan died,

521
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,440
and Aunt broke her spirit elixir that day, I didn't doubt anything.

522
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,640
But today, Wei Yan told me,

523
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,940
she saw that Ji Yunhe has red Fox Fire like aunt's.

524
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,640
- What...
- What did you say?

525
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,560
Ji Yunhe has Aunt Qing Shu's Fox Fire?

526
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,320
It may not be Aunt's Fox Fire.

527
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,420
I'm not sure yet.

528
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:08,020
For thousands of years, except Aunt Qing Shu, no one could cultivate red Fox Fire.

529
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,640
Besides, she is a spiritual master.

530
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,840
She can't cultivate Fox Fire.

531
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,980
She must have used some evil spell,

532
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,840
took away Aunt Qing Shu's spiritual power and used it herself.

533
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,080
Cousin, we're not sure yet. Don't say that.

534
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,020
Why are we not sure about it?

535
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,440
Aunt Qing Shu died in Thousand Flower Valley.

536
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,560
Ji Yunhe comes from Thousand Flower Valley.

537
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,020
As spiritual masters, is Ji Yunhe better than Zhu Ling?

538
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,060
Qing Yao, there are not so many coincidences in this world.

539
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,500
It must be Ji Yunhe who killed Aunt Qing Shu.

540
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,900
Let's go. Let's give her some punishment.

541
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,820
Cousin. Prince Chang Yi said that we are not allowed to intervene in Ji Yunhe's issue.

542
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,240
It's Chang Yi again!

543
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,860
You're our Young Lord.

544
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,180
Why are you always listening to Chang Yi?

545
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,480
A life for a life, right?

546
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,960
Don't you want to know what your father would do?

547
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,220
Your father liked Aunt Qing Shu the most.

548
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,040
Would he let you let go of the one who killed Aunt Qing Shu?

549
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,880
Cousin, let me investigate it.

550
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,420
If Ji Yunhe killed Aunt Qing Shu, I won't let her go.

551
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,580
Don't worry, Master.

552
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,540
Although you didn't get the antidote this time,

553
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,860
Immortal Master didn't doubt you.

554
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,300
Whether he doubts me or not, he still doesn't trust the Thousand Flower Valley.

555
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,720
I was not thinking about this.

556
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,480
What are you thinking?

557
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,580
In Quiet Chamber in Immortal Master Mansion, I found a secret room.

558
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,440
There is a portrait.

559
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,820
The woman in it looks like Shunde, but she's not.

560
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,500
The woman's face reveals a heroic spirit, which Shunde doesn't have.

561
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,600
You mean, the woman in the portrait looks like Shunde?

562
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,220
I am not sure.

563
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:10,500
But I heard Immortal Master used a scavenger worm to cure Shunde's face.

564
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,340
Scavenger worm?

565
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,460
Although this worm can cure rotten wounds,

566
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,080
it is too powerful and will hurt the bones of the patient.

567
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,340
I'm afraid Shunde suffered more than the burning in the fire that day.

568
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,460
So it's strange. There is mild treatment.

569
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:34,480
Immortal Master likes Shunde the most, but he chose the most extreme and eager way.

570
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:41,460
I guess Immortal Master cares about Shunde's face, instead of her.

571
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:47,260
So the biggest harvest today is that portrait.

572
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,120
You opened the door for him?

573
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,800
<i>So what?</i>

574
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,360
<i>I've waited for so long. Where is the catastrophe you promised me?</i>

575
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,560
<i>People say you will be anxious when the truth is revealed.</i>

576
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,120
<i>Then I'll help you to reveal the truth.</i>

577
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:20,200
<i>Otherwise, if you continue to delay it, when can I form my body again?</i>

578
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,440
If you want to wait till that day, you need to behave well and stay here.

579
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,320
<i>I've been staying here for too long.</i>

580
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,700
<i>I don't want to stay here anymore.</i>

581
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,080
I suggest that you not go too far, in case,

582
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,000
you might have no chance to survive.

583
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,980
<i>What if I don't behave well?</i>

584
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,860
<i>You want to kill me?</i>

585
