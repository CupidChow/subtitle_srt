<i>[Episode 08]</i>

13
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,320
That's how we fell in love.

14
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,220
But the prejudice against me was still there.

15
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,660
Our relationship was not acceptable to the world.

16
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,840
To avoid disturbance,

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,560
Ruochu gave up his reputation, status,

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,960
and everything in the Thousand Flower Valley.

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,680
He went to live in the mountains with me.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,440
Like a normal married couple,

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,470
we cooked meals and brewed tea.

22
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,280
Life was uneventful but full of happiness.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,240
<i>If you like,</i>

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,278
<i>I'm willing to tie your hair for the rest of your life.</i>

25
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:31,620
But the good times did not last,

26
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,080
Spiritual Masters finally found where we lived.

27
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,480
- Ruochu and I... wounded a lot of spiritual masters.
- Let's go.

28
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,100
It all got out of hand.

29
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,220
<i>Why did you stop me?</i>

30
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,240
<i>If you kill them, you'd really become what they call the devil.</i>

31
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,080
<i>Then shall I just sit back and wait for them to kill me?</i>

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,180
<i>Ruochu, in this world, you and I are on different paths.</i>

33
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,480
<i>We walked together up to now. It was a good time.</i>

34
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,041
<i>I don't want to put you in trouble.</i>

35
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,120
Later, we heard that when the Ruochu's master traveled around,

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
he passed away.

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
Ruochu was filled with grief.

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,130
He secretly went back to Thousand Flower Valley to worship.

39
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,140
I waited for him outside Thousand Flower Valley.

40
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,220
I thought he would be reluctant to come because he was reluctant to part with Thousand Flower Valley.

41
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,560
In my heart, I prepared for the worst.

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,140
But he eventually came back.

43
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,380
He told me.

44
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,838
<i>Qing'er, since the rules of the fairy world shackle you and me,</i>

45
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:08,320
<i>let's just forget them.</i>

46
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,740
<i>I know a place. It is empty and lifeless.</i>

47
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,080
<i>But we can be together forever.</i>

48
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,260
<i>Would you like to come with me?</i>

49
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,260
<i>Listen carefully, Ning Ruochu.</i>

50
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,799
<i>In Heaven or Earth, throughout the world,</i>

51
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,420
<i>I'll be wherever you are.</i>

52
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,860
<i>I have found an ancient formation called Ten Directions Formation.</i>

53
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,620
<i>In the name of sealing you, I'll ask for help.</i>

54
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,240
<i>I'll invite nine Spiritual Masters to make Ten Directions Formation together.</i>

55
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,320
<i>After sealing you, I'll make an excuse of traveling around to hide my tracks.</i>

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,060
<i>And I'll sneak in to find you.</i>

57
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,000
<i>Then, we'll live together in the formation.</i>

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,340
<i>No more worldly disturbance.</i>

59
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,700
In the formation, I built a cabin.

60
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,420
The decorations were the same as before.

61
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,480
Then there went a day,

62
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,640
a month, a season.

63
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,300
I passed spring, summer,

64
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,800
autumn, and winter.

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,500
A thousand years had passed.

66
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,320
He never came.

67
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,760
A thousand years of captivity.

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,640
A thousand years of waiting.

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,240
He promised me.

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,980
Why didn't he come?

71
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,380
Why hadn't he come yet?

72
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,810
Let's go.

73
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,365
Come on.

74
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,632
Are you okay?

75
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,100
What are you thinking?

76
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,220
Things are a little different than I thought.

77
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,700
It turns out that the man Qing called a heartbreaker was Master Ning.

78
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,100
I just heard it.

79
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,660
But you know what?

80
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,300
The reason why Master Ning is called Impermanent Sage of Thousand Flower Valley, admired by the younger generation,

81
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,540
was because he sacrificed his life to put down the Blue Feather Rebellion and sealed her.

82
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,620
That's why in everyone's mind, he's the greatest hero in the Blue Feather Rebellion.

83
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,320
Qing's years of waiting were just a scam by Master Ning.

84
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,800
You mean Ning Ruochu betrayed Qing.

85
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:12,680
But books in Thousand Flower Valley

86
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,600
have never recorded Master Ning's relationship with Qing.

87
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,580
Probably from the beginning, Master Ning cheated Qing.

88
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,340
But now, Master Ning died long ago.

89
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,240
Who would know the thoughts in his mind?

90
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,680
If you were Qing, would you believe Master Ning again?

91
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,220
Sure enough.

92
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,760
When there's deception in a relationship,

93
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,820
trust can no longer exist.

94
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,480
I mean I think Ning Ruochu, he should...
<i>- Ning Ruochu!</i>

95
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,260
Your debt, just let your apprentices pay for you.

96
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,778
This is terrible. Even if she's an attached spirit,

97
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:56,480
Qing is still the Phoenix King.

98
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,680
Even if the attached spirit only has a tenth of her power,

99
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,780
we can't get around her to escape from here.

100
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,880
You can stay here. I'll go distract her.

101
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,800
Then you try to escape.

102
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,565
What are you going to do?

103
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:09,860
I'll go tell her the end of Ning Ruochu.

104
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,440
This is the truth she deserves to know.

105
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,460
Are you crazy? She's out of control now.

106
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,940
If you tell her Master Ning deserted her,

107
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,820
she will tear you apart.

108
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,640
I don't think Ning Ruochu betrayed Blue Feather Phoenix.

109
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,060
He failed to keep his promise. There must be some reason.

110
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,460
Lovers don't lie to each other.

111
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,280
Just like you and me.

112
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,259
Chang Yi, there are some things

113
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,120
that happen even if you think they won't.

114
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,060
We have too much desire and concern on shore.

115
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,900
There can be lies between lovers.

116
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,360
I know.

117
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,940
On the shore, what you say may be different from what you think.

118
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,660
Words don't count.

119
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,600
But thoughts cannot be hidden.

120
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,280
<i>Right.</i>

121
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,400
<i>If Qing were not in Master Ning's heart,</i>

122
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,340
<i>he wouldn't keep that hairband in his hands.</i>

123
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,180
In the mirage just now,

124
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,440
Master Ning was attacked by both Qing and Spiritual Masters.

125
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,900
He should be injured.

126
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,240
Maybe there was an accident when activating the Ten Directions Formation.

127
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,880
He knew his days were numbered.

128
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,060
And he was afraid that Qing would be sad and die with him.

129
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,540
That's why he chose to die out of the formation.

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,756
Chang Yi, you're not stupid.

131
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:35,380
You see it better than anyone.

132
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,500
I know now what she wants in her heart.

133
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,120
Just let me tell her.

134
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,100
Let me do it. It's too dangerous to approach her.

135
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,980
After all, I am the apprentice of Master Ning.

136
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,660
His debt should be paid by me.

137
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,420
However, I don't think I can use this identity to get close to her.

138
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,820
I have to change my identity.

139
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,120
Who are you going to be this time?

140
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,180
Who are you?

141
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,620
It's me, Ning Ruochu.

142
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,990
Qing'er...

143
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,900
May I come?

144
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,460
What took you so long to get here?

145
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,560
You said you'd be with me.

146
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,180
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

147
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,300
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,100
But I know you'd come.

149
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,340
It's been so long.

150
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,860
Where have you been?

151
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,380
I went to a place far away.

152
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,700
So I didn't keep my promise to accompany you.

153
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,560
But I went all the way thinking about you.

154
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,945
- Qing'er.
- Are you lying to me again?

155
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,140
You still wear it.

156
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,400
I went to a very cold place.

157
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,180
I was afraid I'd forget you.

158
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,240
So I tied it around my wrist.

159
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,500
I've never taken it off.

160
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,020
I wanted to find you more than anyone, Qing'er.

161
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,240
The attached spirit, or rather, Qing herself,

162
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,940
had always believed that

163
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,360
no matter how long it went, Ning Ruochu would surely come to her.

164
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,500
So in this Ten Directions Formation, whoever came in here, male or female,

165
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,140
as long as I called myself Ning Ruochu, she would recognize it.

166
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,460
She doesn't believe in whoever may come.

167
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,000
She believes in Ning Ruochu.

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,340
Loneliness for a thousand years. Hatred grows from it.

169
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,680
But these emotions can be solved by one sentence, actually.

170
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,040
However, I couldn't help her meet the real Master Ning.

171

♫ <i>My shadow is like a smile curve</i>♫

179
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,760
Ruochu, you finally came to me.

180
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,800
<i>I'm sorry. I'm late.</i>

181
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,360
<i>But in fact, I've always been here with you.</i>

182
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,230
I know.

183
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,330
Now, I should probably go find you, too.

184
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,180
<i>From then on, everything around Le You Mountain...</i>

185
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,440
<i>will only belong to you and me.</i>

186
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,260
Big-tailed Fish, according to the five elements, water represents life.

187
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,120
Now the water is receding rapidly.

188
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,960
I think the life path is cut off.

189
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,200
Ten Directions Formation will soon turn into a death formation.

190
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,800
If we want to get out, we have to jump in.

191
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,076
After we leave, where are we going?

192
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,660
I thought I could carefully think about it.

193
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,520
But I didn't expect that there would be no time to consider.

194
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,380
Are you afraid that after we leave, we'll be separated like them?

195
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,540
The road ahead is uncertain. I don't know.

196
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,620
- Why don't we just use a magic spell to decide?
- Magic spell?

197
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,460
It's the easiest spell we learned from the mortal world.

198
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,540
By bending and extending our fingers, we compete with each other.

199
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,063
Let me teach you.

200
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,540
On the count of one, two, three. Pick any one from those gestures.

201
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,800
One.

202
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,166
Two.

203
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,633
Three.

204
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,655
I win.

205
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,640
What do you mean?

206
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,360
You win, I'll go with you.

207
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,420
I win, you come with me.

208
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,600
Anyway, we just don't separate.

209
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,725
♫ <i>Heaven is silent, all is quiet</i> ♫

♫ <i>Yourself in the mirror</i> ♫

211
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,960
I've always wished to escape Thousand Flower Valley.

212
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,420
For that, I can put up with a lot and give up a lot.

213
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,699
Because I thought I was pursuing freedom.

214
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,780
But now I understand.

215
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,699
That's not the meaning of freedom.

216
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,939
It's not the point of being alive, either.

217
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,220
I don't want to be like this attached spirit, indulging in the past.

218
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,340
No matter what the road ahead will lead to, let's go and see it together.

219
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,192
Okay?

220
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:40,040
Are you saying that no matter what happens,

221
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,480
we will always be together.

222
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,800
From now on, there's no lie at all.

223
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,740
Forever. Always. Together.

You gave me your pearl.

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,480
It's a token and a promise to you.

234
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,420
Is that how you mermen give the pearl?

235
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,920
Or did you read some strange books?

236
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,680
Even if there are strange books, they were given by you.

237
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,920
I really misguided you.

238
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,658
Are you afraid?

239
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:07,380
As long as I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.

240
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,820
The song you sang when you were controlling water.

241
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,360
What's that?

242
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,320
Song of Mermen. Praise of freedom.

243
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,320
It's time to sing this song.

244
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,560
We are going to be free.

245
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,770
Qing'er.

246
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,580
You drink too much.

247
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,280
You are dead.

248
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,180
You're long gone.

249
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,900
Ning Ruochu, when I was under the Ten Directions Formation,

250
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,240
I'd been thinking of millions of endings with you and millions of paybacks.

251
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,920
That's how I managed to get through all this.

252
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,000
I didn't expect that...

253
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,800
you were dead.

254
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,360
You're malicious enough.

255
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,860
You simply died,

256
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,100
so that I could never kill you however I wished.

257
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,660
For a thousand years, what did I exist for?

258
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,680
For what?

259
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,440
What do I live for?

260
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,520
Tell me. What was the relationship between Li Shu and you?

261
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,000
Since I brought you back, you refused to eat, drink, or talk.

262
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,060
I thought you wanted to die.

263
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,520
Now it seems that you're not so lame.

264
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,320
What's your relationship with him?

265
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,840
Why was he willing to die for you?

266
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,300
He owed me his life before.

267
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,880
And now it's fair to return it.

268
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,700
It's none of your business.

269
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,000
It's fair for you two.

270
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,680
Then what was I to him?

271
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,960
Things between you two, why did you get me involved?

272
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,660
So you are trying to kill me.

273
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,100
Are you trying to get revenge for Li Shu

274
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,860
or trying to take my head back to Thousand Flower Valley to show loyalty?

275
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:00,280
Until now, do you think you can go back and be a Spiritual Master as usual?

276
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,080
Get revenge for Li Shu?

277
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,260
Who am I to him?

278
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,160
From the very beginning, everything was fake.

279
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,680
The meeting at Mountain Qiongling was fake.

280
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,580
Daily togetherness was fake.

281
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,220
The sweet talk was fake.

282
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,440
Even his identity was fake.

283
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,240
All of these were because of you.

284
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,300
You overestimated yourself.

285
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,920
Then kill me.

286
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,000
I know I can't kill you.

287
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
You're not the one lying to me.

288
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,540
If Li Shu were still here,

289
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,860
I would cut him to pieces.

290
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,580
However, he's dead...

291
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,640
without leaving an explanation.

292
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,760
He just died.

293
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,140
I didn't know him well.

294
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,900
I'll accept and take all the results.

295
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,040
But why did he take the last attack for me?

296
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,860
He was plotting against me until he died.

297
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,840
He used his life to block my retreat.

298
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,720
I can neither love him nor hate him.

299
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,770
But I don't need it.

300
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,900
I don't appreciate it.

301
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,300
And I'll never forgive him.

302
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,780
You're so noisy.

303
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,780
We've finally escaped. Big-tailed Fish.

304
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,320
Guardian Ji, have you had a good sleep?

305
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,160
Why am I here again?

306
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,080
Guardian Ji, when you got out of the formation, you picked a good spot.

307
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,380
You came out with the merman right from Master's backyard pond.

308
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,900
Since you were in a coma, Master asked me to bring you here first.

309
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,440
You didn't know that the pond was one of the ten key points of the Ten Directions Formation.

310
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,760
Why do you laugh, Guardian?

311
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,640
It's ridiculous and pathetic... I thought I saw a light.

312
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,280
But I didn't expect that it turns out to be just a flash of fire in the stone.

313
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,928
Chang...

314
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,220
Where's the merman?

315
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:33,040
The merman, after trying his best to protect you, was also captured.

316
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,610
He's currently being held in Reflect Cave.

317
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,900
What will you do to him?

318
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,400
Just worry about yourself.

319
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,560
In this Ten Directions Formation Rebellion, Xue Sanyue defected.

320
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,300
Li Shu was executed. None of them can be blamed.

321
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,240
Now, everyone is focusing on your escape and collusion with the merman.

322
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,960
Think how to defend yourself.

323
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,200
Master, as a Guardian, Ji Yunhe

324
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,980
was supposed to protect Thousand Flower Valley.

325
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,020
And she took advantage of Blue Feather Phoenix's rebellion,

326
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,280
trying to escape with the merman.

327
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,300
It's a terrible sin.

328
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,020
Master, please severely punish and discipline her.

329
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,340
<i>Master, please severely punish and discipline her.</i>

330
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,000
Yunhe, how will you explain this?

331
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,560
<i>Lin Canglan is foxy.</i>

332
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,480
<i>If I admit it, I'll lose my training qualification and never see Chang Yi again.</i>

333
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,560
<i>If I deny it, it means that Chang Yi committed the crime of escape</i>

334
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,640
<i>and would be subjected to capital punishment.</i>

335
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,560
Master, I'm not guilty.

336
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,340
That day, I didn't join in the battle with Blue Feather Phoenix

337
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,300
because after Li Shu broke Ten Directions Formation,

338
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,160
I watched the golden light and headed for Reflect Cave.

339
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,960
I was afraid the merman might get away with it, so I went to check.

340
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,700
Accidentally, I fell into the formation.

341
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,800
That's just sophistry.

342
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,450
Of course, the battle with Blue Feather Phoenix concerns the reputation of Thousand Flower Valley. It was indeed important.

343
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,790
But if we let the merman escape and offend Fairy Shunde,

344
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,580
Thousand Flower Valley's reputation would also be at stake.

345
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,440
It seemed that even if I joined, it's impossible to capture the Blue Feather Phoenix.

346
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,060
But if we want to keep the merman, I'm enough to do that.

347
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Guardian Ji is right.

348
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,640
I didn't expect that though Guardian Ji is young,

349
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,220
she would see the big picture clearer than we Elders.

350
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,360
She's the hope of the Thousand Flower Valley.

351
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,340
I think you're talking nonsense.

352
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,340
Let me ask you. If Guardian Ji didn't collude with the merman,

353
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,760
when we captured them, why did the merman try so hard to keep her safe?

354
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,780
Why shouldn't he protect me?

355
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,280
Mastering spirit is to master its mind and make its heart obedient.

356
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,220
Don't you know the temper of the merman?

357
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,400
I just changed it into a different way to make him obey me.

358
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,280
Is that a sin?

359
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,380
That makes sense.

360
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,980
As you say, the merman should be fully obedient to you.

361
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,600
Why can't he speak yet? It has been delayed for a long time.

362
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,000
If we fail to achieve Fairy Shunde's order, what shall we do?

363
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,780
That's my dereliction of duty. I accept the punishment.

364
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,440
Great.

365
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,380
You deserve twenty floggings with the Red Tail as a warning to others.

366
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,400
Vile person. I'm a vile person?

367
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,260
Nothing can be accomplished without rules.

368
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,520
I accept the punishment.

369
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,270
Don't flog her!

370
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,920
<i>I didn't expect that the merman would start talking.</i>

371
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,160
<i>Guardian Ji was right.</i>

372
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,828
<i>Yes.</i>

373
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,540
Chang Yi, how are you?

374
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,800
I'm okay.

375
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,240
Qu Xiaoxing, at this moment, why do you bring the merman here?

376
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,920
Master, the merman opened his mouth in Reflect Cave.

377
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,640
I dare not make arbitrary decisions, so I brought him here.

378
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,940
The truth on that day, it's more convenient to ask him in public.

379
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,260
If you want to avoid suffering, you have to tell the truth.

380
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,980
On that day in the Reflect Cave, what happened exactly?

381
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,660
How did you escape?

382
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,200
And why did you protect Ji Yunhe?

383
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,720
Ten Directions Formation was broken. I accidentally fall down.

384
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,480
She was the one who saved me. I appreciated her.

385
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,380
So, you have no reason to flog her.

386
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,550
Now that the merman has spoken,

387
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,340
do I still need to be punished with 20 Red Tailfloggings?

388
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,540
Congratulations to Master. Fairy Shunde's first wish has been achieved.

389
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,580
Guardian Ji is a hero.

390
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,260
The punishment is exempted.

391
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,920
Thanks, Master.

392
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,120
<i>Congratulations to Master.</i>

393
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,980
Xiaoxing, take the merman back. Take good care of him.

394
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,140
Let's go.

395
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,280
I didn't expect that he really listens to you.

396
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,120
Master, the merman has a stubborn temperament.

397
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,300
We need to treat him softly to get what we want.

398
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,500
Master, please allow that when I'm with the merman,

399
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,280
I can order others to leave or stop the punishment of the merman.

400
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,200
If you can achieve Fairy Shunde's wishes, I'll support you.

401
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,050
Thank you, Master.

402
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:52,540
Yunhe, come here.

403
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,100
Well done for your training. I'll reward you.

404
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,520
Bad Yunhe, you stood me up.

405
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,320
Luo Luo, why did you come back?

406
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,360
If I don't come back, who can take care of you?

407
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,880
I know what happened to Li Shu and Xue Sanyue. We really can't stay here any longer.

408
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,760
Even if I have to carry you, I'll take you out of the Thousand Flower Valley.

409
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,560
Luo Luo, I can't leave yet.

410
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,920
Chang Yi is still in Reflect Cave.

411
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,740
What about our Immortal Island?

412
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,600
Did you really decide to go to the East Sea with Chang Yi?

413
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,000
Did Lin Canglan torture you again?

414
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,238
Come on.

415
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,166
Take the antidote.

416
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,020
Why are you getting worse?

417
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,940
Master sent me to tell you.

418
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,420
Those are cooling pills.

419
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,840
Guardian, you should take them with care.

420
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,960
Doesn't it make the Frost mark worse?

421
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,325
You...

422
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:28,660
It seems Master knew I would go steal the pills.

423
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,739
And he secretly put fake drugs in the inner room.

424
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,900
If he knew all this,

425
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,259
why was he pretending patiently in front of me?

426
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:37,420
Why didn't he give me a quick end?

427
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,060
The blade is not finished yet.

428
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,020
So the whetstone can not be discarded.

429
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,999
Master knows clearly what you're doing.

430
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:49,280
He spared your life and maintained your position.

431
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,639
You should be grateful for Master's kindness.

432
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,239
What are you going to do?

433
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,220
Master asked me to remind you.

434
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,340
Though the merman is obedient to you,

435
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,820
don't forget, Guardian, who you should obey.

436
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,340
These days, just reflect on yourself here.

437
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,143
Yunhe.

438
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:53,560
Master, Ji Yunhe is stubborn.

439
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,020
She won't give up easily.

440
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,960
What should we do in the second round?

441
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,600
Please give the order.

442
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,180
How is Haoqing?

443
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,100
Young Master is wounded.

444
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,740
He has been grounded for days.

445
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,020
There's no movement.

446
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,420
All right, let's go and see him.

447
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,907
Okay.

448
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,940
Ji Yunhe and the merman have been captured.

449
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,780
Young Master, the merman has spoken.

450
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,800
The first round, you lost.

451
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,420
Father, I know I was wrong.

452
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,960
I'll try harder.

453
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,780
Father, please don't...

454
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,760
Don't what?

455
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,720
Don't punish her for taking your credit?

456
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,280
Haoqing, Ji Yunhe can use the soft way

457
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,800
to win the heart with love and make the merman obey.

458
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,440
You can also take advantage of it, right?

459
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,700
Young Master.

460
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,200
Master has planned carefully.

461
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,360
The second round of taming the merman

462
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,480
is for you to achieve.

463
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,100
I understand.

464
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,660
Father, this time I won't let you down.

465
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,740
Take the medicine.

466
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,780
Recover well and get the job done.

467
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,274
Yes.

468
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,200
I've set up a barrier on Le You Mountain.

469
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,600
Thousand Flower Valley forces cannot reach here.

470
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,960
This is where I used to practice.

471
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,360
From now on, you stay right here.

472
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,180
Don't come out to bother me.

473
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,160
I would rather die than accept your protection.

474
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,780
I only promised Li Shu to take you out of Thousand Flower Valley.

475
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,180
I don't care whether you're alive or dead.

476
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,320
I won't take care of you.

477
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,080
But don't forget that

478
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,400
your life was saved with his life.

479
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,200
Whether you want it or not,

480
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,480
think about it carefully.

481
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,420
One day, I'll kill you.

482
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,660
When you can get out, you can try.

483
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,480
<i>He's dead...</i>

484
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,100
<i>without leaving an explanation.</i>

485
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,760
<i>He just died.</i>

486
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,280
<i>He blocked my retreat with his life.</i>

487
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,360
<i>I can neither love him nor hate him.</i>

488
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,206
Right.

489
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,700
Why leave me alone?

490
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,360
Love or hate.

491
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,640
Either way is good.

492
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,680
Little Li Shu,

493
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,740
you sacrificed your life to save me from the Ten Directions Formation.

494
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,920
What's the point of it?

495
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,240
A thousand years have passed by.

496
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,920
Ning Ruochu has turned into ashes.

497
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,240
I was left alone.

498
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,300
Useless.

499
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,180
And you're also dead.

500
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,020
You are all liars.

501
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,920
Yunhe will be fine. Right?

502
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,500
How dare you ask about her?

503
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,920
Yunhe has always been loyal.

504
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,320
Master liked her so much.

505
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,080
If she wasn't obsessed with you,

506
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,360
how would she have the idea of escaping from the valley.

507
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,240
It would have been nice if she could escape,

508
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,968
but she was dragged down due to a thing like you.

509
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:46,322
I'm not a thing.

510
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:48,788
You are even worse than a thing.

511
00:40:48,788 --> 00:40:50,240
I want to see her.

512
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,560
Yunhe's position in the valley is at stake now.

513
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,080
You need to stay here. Don't go anywhere else.

514
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
It's my fault, too.

515
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
I couldn't reach you in time.

516
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,760
But who would imagine that

517
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,620
the small pond in Master's backyard is the array eye.

518
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,588
Young Master.

519
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,380
From today, I'll take over the training of the merman.

520
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,060
But Master had promised Yunhe...

521
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,200
In the Thousand Flower Valley, I only listen to one spiritual master,

522
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,240
that is Ji Yunhe.

523
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,260
She is really capable.

524
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,980
Finally, you are willing to speak.

525
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,500
Young Master, what are you doing?

526
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,540
The second round of training a merman.

527
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,380
Cutting off the tali.

528
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,080
Unless I'm willing to,

529
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,520
even if I'm dead,

530
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,240
you can never cut off my tail.
