The pursuers should be here soon. I just stopped the bleeding.

44
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,380
Take him to the inn down the hill to get some rest. That's where mortals live.

Disciples of Immortal Master Mansion can't wantonly search it.

You don't have to know much.

50
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,140
You only have to know is that I'll save the ones that Immortal Master Mansion wants to kill

<i>Yes!</i>

- Hurry up.
- No. Who's Ji Yunhe?

57
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,620
- Ji Yunhe hurt my prince.
- Shut up!

58
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,060
If you don't want your prince to be killed, you must go now.

59
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,920
No. Can... Can you handle them alone?

60
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,700
Take care of your prince.

70
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,780
Don't call me like that. I'm no longer a member of Immortal Master Mansion.

71
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,280
Senior, did you see the merman that we were chasing?

72
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,840
Yes. I let him go.

73
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,320
So what?

74
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,460
Don't bother. I won't let you get him.

75
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,780
I'm done. I should go.

76
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,180
It's been so many years.

77
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,260
Do you still want to turn against our master?

78
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,320
Senior, come back.

79
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,520
You were good at both medicine and formations.

80
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,000
No one in Immortal Master Mansion is better than you so far. Why did you defect?

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,339
As long as you admit your mistake, our master is tolerant; he'll treat you as before.

82
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:41,419
Chengyu, I always thought you saw people and things clearly.

83
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,740
But I can't believe you haven't seen through his nature yet.

84
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,000
I was adopted by him since I was a kid.

85
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
He treats me as his son. I owe him a great debt of gratitude.

86
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,680
This is what I've seen in him.

87
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,160
If someone tries to harm our master, I won't be easy on him.

88
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,900
You're loyal to a fault.

89
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,440
Kong Ming.

90
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Immortal Chengyu, are you going to take me back?

91
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,040
You know I'll never hurt you.

92
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,660
Then hope there will be no chance for us to meet again.

93
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,228
<i>[Immortal Master Mansion]</i>

94
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,620
I failed my job. The merman is still on the loose.

95
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,760
Please punish me.

96
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,080
Is this the only thing that you want to tell me?

97
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,880
I did let Senior Kong Ming go. I'll accept punishment.

98
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,900
I believe he was just confused.

99
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,560
One day he'll see the error of his ways, and become your right hand again.

100
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,240
It's human nature to protect their brothers.

101
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,840
I adopted you and Kong Ming at the same time.

102
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,400
He treated you as his brother.

103
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,480
It's understandable you're soft on him.

104
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,220
However, there's doom and a way ahead.

105
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,340
Since he chose his path, you should stick to your way.

106
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,940
If you go the opposite way someday, we'll be enemies eventually.

107
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,420
Master, I swear to follow you. I'm loyal to you.

108
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,960
Well, forget that merman.

109
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,900
But that novelty is interesting.

110
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,340
Come on. Go check with me.

111
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,660
<i>The breath of the merman pearl is steady.</i>

112

<i>Chang Yi, are you safe?</i>

113
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,320
I didn't expect the world-famous Immortal Master to come and see me on his own.

114
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,380
But I prefer to see a familiar face.

115
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,000
Immortal Chengyu, have you caught Chang Yi?

116
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,360
Not yet.

117
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,500
I know... he's lucky.

118
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,240
He'll be no one's fish in a barrel or beast in a cage.

119
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,600
How can Heaven be regarded as the enemy and still surpass others?

120
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,440
You knew there was a stream down the cliff.

121
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
The merman fell into the water from the cliff.

122
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
Although it's a bit painful, there's always a way out.

123
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,500
Painful planning, forbearance, and decisiveness. You are very interesting.

124
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,840
Now that you've seen my plot,

125
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,400
I'm sure you're a schemer, too.

126
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,800
You might as well guess what I'm thinking now.

127
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,760
Chengyu, prepare some food for her tomorrow.

128
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,720
I want meat.

129
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,014
Your Immortal Master Mansion is known as the Royal Spiritual Master who rules the four seas and eight lands.

130
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,560
So, I should get better treatment in this Congji Jail.

131
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,885
Or how humiliating it would be for you if I let it out.

132
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,800
Guardian Ji, Spiritual Masters are immortals. They don't have to eat or drink.

133
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,320
Even if they need some nutrition, they eat lightly.

134
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,760
Why do you like meat so much?

135
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,360
Lately, my mouth has been sullen for some reason.

136
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,520
I just want to eat meat.

137
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,640
Whatever.

138
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,800
Yes.

139
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,260
Immortal Master. Logically, I have committed a crime of disrespect.

140
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,640
You caught me but you neither kill me nor torture me.

141
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,780
What are you trying to do?

142
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,800
I'm just curious.

143
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,280
I want to know what new tricks someone is playing again in Thousand Flower Valley.

144
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,620
Thousand Flower Valley has been boring under your rule for hundreds of years.

145
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,400
What new tricks can it have?

146
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,080
You.

147
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,560
Celestial Immortal and Earth Immortal.

148
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,200
The power of Heaven and Earth can repel and coexist.

149
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,240
Interesting.

150
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,280
<i>He saw through Lin Canglan's plan.</i>

151
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,400
Master.

152
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,080
Keep her with good food.

153
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,800
About other things, we'll see someday.

154
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
Yes.

155
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,340
Immortal Chengyu, thank you for telling me about Chang Yi.

156
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,400
You're a good friend.

157
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,780
I shouldn't have set you up.

158
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,480
Did Fairy Shunde blame you?

159
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,120
I hurt her too hard.

160
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,980
Don't worry. Fairy Shunde is protected by my master.

161
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,920
She's very mad at the merman's escape.

162
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,820
Did she blame Thousand Flower Valley?

163
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,200
No.

164
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,440
My master told her that you ran away with the merman.

165
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,780
She only sent men to find you and the merman at present.

166
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,900
She didn't turn against Thousand Flower Valley.

167
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,120
Look... Your master concealed the fact that he locked me up.

168
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,520
Is he just curious about me?

169
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,720
Guardian Ji, I warn you not to make trouble.

170
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
Immortal Master is dignified.

171
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,640
Ordinary men dare not provoke him.

172
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,360
They're afraid of him, that's normal.

173
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,400
Then, why are you unusual?

174
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,900
Common men fear he'd kill them if they pissed him off.

175
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,640
But I'm not afraid.

176
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,820
You're not bad. Neither is my master.

177
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,360
Listen to me. My master won't kill you as long as you play nice.

178
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,000
You don't know but it has nothing to do with who kills me or not,

179
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,930
it's just that my life is running out of time.

180
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,700
I want to eat meat and drink good wine.

181
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,940
Times here are tough.

182
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,120
So I should have a decent meal.

183
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,040
Wait here.

184
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,160
<i>[Fairy Shunde's Mansion]</i>

185
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,080
You losers!

186
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,320
You can't even catch that almost-dead merman.

187
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,880
Don't embarrass yourself before Fairy Shunde.

188
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,360
Get out of here.

189
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,980
Yes!

190
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,960
Same goes for you!

191
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,160
Come on. Go.

192
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,820
Damn! Who the hell is—!

193
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,200
Greetings, Heavenly King.

194
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm sorry about the offense.

195
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,320
Please forgive me.

196
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,680
Go.
<i>[Ru Jun, Heavenly King]</i>

197
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,620
I want to talk to my sister.

198
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,800
Ru Jun, why don't you stay in Heavenly Palace?

199
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,440
What have you brought for me?

200
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,440
This is the decoction made from fruits of the Dixiu Tree.

201
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,820
You'll calm down after you drink it.

202
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,080
Do you mean I have quite a temper?

203
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,320
You're hurt.

204
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm afraid it's bad for your injuries if you're always angry.

205
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,080
Sister, there are so many interesting things in the world.

206
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,240
Why must you get that merman of the East Sea?

207
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,400
I'll go to pick peaches for you in Peach Forest in a few days. Okay?

208
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,000
I can get anything in the world.

209
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,700
But someone went against me like that.

210
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,960
Ru Jun, you're the Heavenly King.

211
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,120
But you're so irresolute and hesitant.

212
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,180
How will you assert your authority in the future?

213
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,120
I think that all things are born and have their own laws.

214
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,720
You shouldn't force it.

215
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,380
Enough!

216
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,560
Ji Yunhe and that merman hurt me first.

217
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,680
You don't speak for me but ask me to endure it.

218
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,400
Your original spirit was nurtured in the Bodhi Tree.

219
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
I kept watching and defending you.

220
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,920
Did you forget my kindness?

221
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,960
Sister.

222
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,260
Who's making Ru Ling angry?

223
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,400
Master.

224
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,340
Greetings, Heavenly King.

225
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,640
Save the courtesy, Immortal Master.

226
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,940
- My sister...
- Master, where have you been for the last few days?

227
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,160
My wound is badly injured. I missed you so much.

228
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,957
Your face is intact. That's great.

229
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:31,140
I've given an order to arrest the merman with more men.

230
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,340
You don't have to worry.

231
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,240
See? Although you're my brother,

232
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,420
you don't know me as well as my master.

233
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:44,780
I'm here to play the zither for you, which is good for your recovery.

234
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,860
Heavenly King, if you're interested,

235
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,240
you can stay here as well and enjoy it.

236
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,940
<i>Fairy Shunde is my disciple.</i>

237
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,340
Of course, I'll help heal her.

238
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,160
Heavenly King, is there anything else?

239
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,828
Immortal Master, my sister was injured because she was a bully.

240
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:44,114
It's her fault.

241
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:46,800
I think I often indulge her.

242
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,920
But you're her master.

243
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,860
You're responsible for teaching her virtues.

244
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,760
You should persuade and discipline her.

245
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,280
How could you spoil her?

246
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,820
Heavenly Majesty is sacred and inviolable.

247
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,700
I don't think it's bad for Fairy Shunde to do that.

248
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,260
The Heavenly Majesty, should first correct itself

249
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,000
and set an example. Am I right?

250
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,600
Immortal Master, you're busy.

251
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,880
I don't think it's right for my sister to stay here for too long.

252
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,680
I'm going to take her back to Heavenly Palace...

253
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,842
and find another teacher for her.

254
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,120
Heavenly King, do you think... my morality is questionable.

255
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,371
I'm not qualified to be her master?

256
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,380
<i>[Master Lei Ze]</i>
What do you want to do?

257
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,620
How dare you be insubordinate and despise Heavenly Majesty?
<i> [Master Fei Lian]</i>

258
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,120
Immortal Master, it's almost time for Heavenly King to study.

259
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,800
We're here to take him back to Heavenly Palace.

260
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,960
Oh, here are Master Lei Ze and Master Fei Lian.

261
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,680
I was just talking about Taoism with Heavenly King.

262
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,120
Well, I won't bother Heavenly King.

263
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,320
But my sister...

264
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,100
Fairy Shunde's wound is still healing. She shouldn't be moved casually.

265
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,360
She should stay here for a few more days to recover.

266
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,960
The job of Immortal Master is complicated and busy.

267
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,140
I think it should be me to share Heavenly King's burden.

268
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,220
It's said morality does not match the position.

269
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,160
But if someone is not capable, even if he's in a high station, he may not keep it long.

270
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,360
Heavenly King, do you think I'm right?

271
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,680
Heavenly King, let me give him a lesson.

272
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,640
I'll vent your anger even at the price of my life.

273
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,442
- Heavenly King.
- Let's go. Heavenly King will need you for something important.

274
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,680
Heavenly King.

275
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,200
<i>[Langfeng Peak]</i>

276
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,160
Heavenly King, I still can't tolerate it.

277
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,400
We don't have to fear Immortal Master, though his spiritual power is stronger.

278
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,900
I have a way. You can learn Thunder Magic from me.

279
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,560
Once you get it,

280
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,180
you can summon Big Golden Thunder when you pat your belly.

281
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,660
Then you can cut him in two. What do you think?

282
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,180
You're rough.

283
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,520
To get it, your body should be tempered through golden thunder.

284
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,160
It's okay for you to practice it.

285
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,540
How dignified Heavenly King is.

286
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,300
He's respected and unique. Nothing of him is dispensable.

287
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,000
How could he be set on fire like you and pat his belly to summon thunder?

288
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,140
It'd ruin his immortal bearing.

289
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:26,220
Heavenly King, I think you should learn etiquette from me and convince people by reasoning.

290
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,120
Yes. You have quite a mouth.

291
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,957
But can you kill Immortal Master with your mouth?

292
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,400
You.

293
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,280
It's said my father left his magic weapon before he died in this Bodhi Tree.

294
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,320
With it, I can summon millions of divine troops to compete with Immortal Master.

295
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,280
But why... doesn't it come out of the Bodhi Tree and acknowledge me?

296
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,180
Is it because... my father thinks I'm not good enough?

297
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,780
Heavenly King, I know you're anxious.

298
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,600
But you're still young.

299
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,960
Maybe it's not your time to control the magic weapon yet.

300
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,100
Your father left you to Lei Ze and me.

301
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,860
We have to devote ourselves to training you.

302
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,620
- Given time, you...
- Given time...

303
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,960
When will it be?

304
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,500
Don't look at me. I don't pat my belly.

305
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,800
I see. This is the day.

306
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,680
You might get the magic weapon. Go check.

307
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,800
Come on.

308
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,000
Master He Xu.

309
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
<i>[Master He Xu]</i>

310
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
It's the third meteor shower this month.

311
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,100
Master He Xu, you're the master of astronomy.

312
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,800
You should comply with God's will.

313
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Every time you fall asleep, you scatter the chess pieces,

314
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,700
and there's a meteor shower in the human world.

315
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,600
Lots of people wish upon it.

316
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,200
Their wishes reach up to Heavenly Palace.

317
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,800
Do you know how much work the officials like me should do?

318
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
As the so-called Heaven and Earth have a way

319
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,200
this meteor shower is a coincidence.

320
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Anything happens within nature.

321
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,000
Master He Xu, let me play one game with you.

322
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,300
Heavenly King, you also want to look for your chance.

323
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
How... How is he?

324
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
He's the prince of the mermen.

325
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,000
His spiritual power should be preeminent.

326
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But why is he hurt so badly now?

327
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,300
Is the man that I've been looking for just handsome but useless?

328
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,200
No. You're useless.

329
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,400
My prince's water control magic is the best within the East Sea.

330
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,200
He must have been set up by you people onshore.

331
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,900
Otherwise, he wouldn't have ended up like this.

332
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,000
<i>Anyway, I don't care whether you live or die.</i>

333
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,450
<i>I don't care.</i>

334
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,600
Your Highness, you... you're finally awake.

335
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,800
Sorry. It's my fault.

336
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm late.

337
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,800
His Majesty would be very sad if he knew you were hurt like this.

338
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,900
Luo Suo. Why are you here?

339
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm here to find you.

340
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,600
I spent a long time learning the language on shore for it.

341
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
You know what, since you disappeared,

342
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
His Majesty was worried and angry.

343
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
He dispatched a lot of men to find you on land.

344
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,300
It's been so long. Where did you go?

345
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,500
Where's this place?

346
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,800
Who's he?

347
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,200
This is the human world.

348
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,100
As... As for him,

349
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,000
he said he's named Kong Ming.

350
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,700
He was a Spiritual Master.

351
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,200
But now, he'll help us deal with Spiritual Masters.

352
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,400
I don't think he looks like a good man.

353
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, yeah! He said you were, what's it, his chance.

354
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't know what he meant.

355
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm curious.

356
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I've traveled the world for many years.

357
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,800
You're the noble prince of the mermen.

358
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,600
I don't know why you were willing to

359
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,600
cut off your tail for a Spiritual Master and give her your merman pearl.

360
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
I remember it.

361
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,200
When those Spiritual Masters were chasing us,

362
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,400
they said someone called Ji Yunhe stabbed you.

363
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,000
Did she hurt you?

364
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,100
She's really cruel to you.

365
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,600
Look. This seashell was also broken.

366
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
<i>Although this seashell is not as precious as other magic weapons,</i>

367
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,000
<i>I heard you could hear the voice of the sea through it.</i>

368
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,600
<i>Hope it can make you happy when you're lonely.</i>

369
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,900
Your Highness, you keep this on your chest the whole time.

370
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,800
Are you homesick?

371
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Don't worry. When we go back to the East Sea,

372
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
His Majesty will avenge you.

373
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,400
He'll handle those Spiritual Masters who caught and harmed you.

374
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,000
Especially the one called Ji Yunhe.

375
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,800
Your Highness, you... you... you must be hungry.

376
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,100
I'm going to make something for you.

377
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,200
♫ <i>Hey, where are you going?</i> ♫

378
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,300
♫ <i>Any fool looking up can't keep the light</i> ♫

379
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,300
You were just saved.

380
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,700
And now you're going to ask for death.

381
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,600
♫ <i>I hope your wishes will come true and you go
to a bright place</i> ♫

382
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,700
♫ <i>Away from me, away from sadness</i> ♫

383
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:23,600
♫ <i>From now on, there will be no lies, forget the mundane world,
let regret no grow</i> ♫

384
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,100
♫ <i>From now on, you don't have to be scared of anything</i> ♫

385
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,400
<i>May my loved one live a happy and safe life.</i>

386
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,900
♫ <i>Like fireflies chasing the waves</i> ♫

387
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,100
♫ <i>The uncatchable light</i> ♫

388
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:44,000
♫ <i>is left for one person to recall</i> ♫

389
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,700
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

390
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,400
You get hurt by love,

391
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,700
that's why you're in such despair.

392
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,600
Immortal Master Mansion harmed you like that.

393
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,800
It's malicious.

394
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,200
You saved me. I appreciate that.

395
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,700
But you always mentioned my soft spots.

396
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,000
What do you want?

397
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Because you and I should have a common goal.

398
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,600
I don't know what you're saying.

399
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,700
Your Highness, don't be nervous. I'm not a Spiritual Master anymore.

400
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,500
Now, I'm a humble pharmacist.

401
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,600
Immortal Master Mansion is searching for me, too.

402
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,400
So, Your Highness, are you willing to fight against Immortal Master Mansion with me?

403
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,600
No.

404
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
You were hurt and used by spiritual masters like that.

405
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,400
You don't hate them?

406
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,800
There's a chance for us to win if we fight Immortal Master together.

407
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,100
You saved me for the power of the East Sea.

408
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,300
You used me, too.

409
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,800
I'll repay you for saving me someday.

410
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,100
However, I don't want to get involved again.

411
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,400
I don't want my hometown to get involved in the chaos.

412
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,800
Your Highness,

413
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,600
since the Golden Lotus has shown you to me,

414
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,200
you're destined to be my chance to fight against Immortal Master.

415
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,400
You should know the righteous cause. You shouldn't be narrow-minded.

416
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,100
Immortal Master's evil thoughts will lead to big trouble all over the world.

417
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,100
Do you think you can live in peace and stay out of the conflict

418
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,400
when you go back to the East Sea?

419
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
I don't know the Golden Lotus.

420
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,300
And I don't know about any chance either.

421
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,400
I only know people following different ways won't work together.

422
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,800
I'm not the one that you want.

423
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,400
Luo Suo, let's go.

424
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
The one that I want to team up with

425
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,500
can't be a weak man who got hurt by love.

426
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
Forget it.

427
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,600
In that case, I won't force you.

428
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,100
Your Highness, I hope you can stay away from all the troubles.

429
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,500
Your Highness. Don't... Don't listen to Kong Ming. He's bluffing.

430
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,600
When we return to the East Sea, His Majesty will find a way to repair your tail.

431
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,400
And we'll stay under the sea forever.

432
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,200
We'll never come ashore.

433
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,200
Come on. Go.

434
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,880
It seems I can't escape the fate of being imprisoned eventually.

435
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,600
Big-tailed Fish...

436
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,600
You must have been as bored as me now when you were locked up.

437
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,700
Big-tailed Fish, go back to the East Sea soon.

438
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,600
When you get there, you'll return to your place.

439
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,100
Neither Immortal Master nor Fairy Shunde can do anything to you.

440
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,100
<i>Chang Yi.</i>

441
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,800
<i>Your tail has grown back.</i>

442
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,200
<i>I knew the East Sea would have a way to help you.</i>

443
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,300
<i>Chang Yi.</i>

444
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,300
<i>Ji Yunhe, stop your pretentious acting.</i>

445
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,100
<i>Even if the world overturns, the East Sea is dry,</i>

446
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,600
<i>I'll never forgive you.</i>

447
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,200
<i>I wish to never see you again.</i>

448
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,400
<i>This is... for the best.</i>

449
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,600
Master He Xu, you were my father's old friend.

450
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Compared to him, am I useless?

451
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,500
Heavenly King, why are you saying that?

452
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,200
In the old days, my father went to battles to protect the world.

453
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Finally, to suppress Zhuyan's rebellion, he did not hesitate to return to a formless mass.

454
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,800
My spiritual power is weak.

455
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,300
I know Immortal Master's ambition, but I'm not able to stop him.

456
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,000
My sister would rather stay in Immortal Master Mansion

457
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,800
than return to Heavenly Palace.

458
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
I feel so sad.

459
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,600
My father's magic weapon refuses to accept me as its master.

460
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Is it because... I let him down?

461
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,000
Those who rely on virtue will prosper, and those who rely on power will perish.

462
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,600
No one knows the loss and the gain.

463
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,400
When you're afraid of Immortal Master,

464
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,500
how do you know he's not pretending to be powerful?

465
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,400
Maybe he's afraid of you.

466
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,000
Me?

467
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,300
My spiritual power and etiquette haven't become great yet.

468
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,200
What does Immortal Master fear about me?

469
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Heavenly King, do you remember

470
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,400
you enlightened a frustrated man

471
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,800
when I traveled the human world with you?

472
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,000
It was my first time to see my sister act arrogantly,

473
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
which made me want to turn against Immortal Master.

474
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,200
I saw that guy frustrated and I knew how he felt,

475
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
so I said a few words to him.

476
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,600
Some chances were made at that time.

477
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,900
Everything has a rule.

478
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,200
When there's a chance,

479
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,700
cause and effect will show.

480
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,800
When will it be?

481
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Master, why do you fall asleep again?

482
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,000
When will there be a chance?

483
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,600
The day when there's a chance...

484
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,900
<i>Senior, come back.</i>

485
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,300
<i>You were good at both medicine and formations.</i>

486
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,200
<i>No one in Immortal Master Mansion is better than you so far.</i>

487
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,100
<i>Why did you defect?</i>

488
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,460
<i>[Immortal Master Mansion]</i>

489
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,600
<i>I'm guilty. I'm useless to the world.</i>

490
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,600
<i>I hope to die quickly.</i>

491
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,300
<i>Don't bother.</i>

492
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,600
<i>Humble as ants,</i>

493
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,000
<i>they drink dew in fall when they become cicadas.</i>

494
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
<i>And from the rotting weeds come the fireflies.</i>

495
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
<i>Nothing is useless in the world.</i>

496
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,000
<i>If you really commit a sin,</i>

497
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,400
<i>when you can make something right,</i>

498
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,500
<i>wouldn't you feel better?</i>

499
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,000
<i>You must be unusual.</i>

500
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
<i>May I ask who you are?</i>

501
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,700
<i>If you want to make amends, it will be hard.</i>

502
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
<i>But if you stay patient,</i>

503
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,400
<i>you'll find the chance.</i>

504
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
<i>Can you accept it?</i>

505
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,000
<i>I won't regret it even if I need to sacrifice my life.</i>

506
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,800
The east.

507
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,000
The East Sea.

508
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Forget it.

509
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,400
I'll try my best to do it again.

510
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,800
It'd be nice if that merman were my chance.

511
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Luo Luo.

512
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,900
I'm sorry. I almost forgot you.

513
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,600
Damn you, Qu Xiaoxing.

514
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,400
How dare you catch me?

515
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,800
I was doing it for your own good.

516
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,200
Where are you going?

517
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,000
Let go of me. I'm going to save Yunhe.

518
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,400
No way.

519
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
If you don't let me go, I'll tear you in eight.

520
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,400
It won't work even if you tear me in sixteen.

521
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
You know Immortal Master.

522
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,600
His spiritual power is unpredictable.

523
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,200
He can crush us with only two fingers.

524
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,800
I don't care.

525
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,000
Anyway, I can't watch you leave Yunhe alone.

526
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,800
Master is not like that.

527
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,900
Master? You accept him so soon.

528
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,800
If not for Lin Haoqing, it wouldn't have been so bad.

529
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,400
Even Immortal Master got involved.

530
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
I know you're angry.

531
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
But you must admit, even without him,

532
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,600
something wouldn't have changed.

533
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,800
Master wants to save Yunhe more than anyone does.

534
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,800
He's waiting outside the Immortal Master Mansion now.

535
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,200
He's waiting for an opportunity.

536
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Don't make trouble.

537
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,700
Why are you here?

538
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,800
- Go with me.
- What are you doing?

539
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
- Let's go.
- Stop pretending.

540
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,500
You intended to use me at first. Why do you pretend to be good now?

541
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,600
What are you talking about?

542
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,400
I believed you, so I left Chang Yi with you.

543
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,000
But you were driven to send him to the jaws of death. Right?

544
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
Answer me.

545
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,600
Yes.

546
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,200
I asked him to come back because I wanted to save you.

547
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm not only your brother but also your only family.

548
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,700
I want to take you home. Take you back to Thousand Flower Valley.

549
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,400
From the moment Lin Canglan used me,

550
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,800
Thousand Flower Valley was no longer my home.

551
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,600
You're just taking me from one cage to another.

552
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,200
Yunhe, to you, keeping you close to me

553
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,400
is putting you in chains?

554
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm running out of time.

555
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Why won't you leave me alone?

556
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,800
Lin Canglan said something right.

557
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
You're going to take up the cause.

558
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,800
The whole Thousand Flower Valley depends on you.

559
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,000
So don't take me away.

560
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't want to be a burden anymore.

561
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,800
I don't want anyone to suffer for me and scold me after I die.

562
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Stay alive first. Go.

563
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,400
Don't be silly. This is Immortal Master Mansion. I can't get out of here.

564
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
Let's put Chang Yi behind.

565
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
If you really want to make it right, help me take care of Luo Luo.

566
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,000
Lin Canglan's son.

567
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,000
My brother just came to visit me.

568
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,700
He doesn't have second thoughts.

569
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,800
Guardian Ji, you're a very good liar.

570
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,300
Immortal Master, I was worried about Yunhe.

571
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,600
So I broke into Immortal Master Mansion rashly.

572
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,300
It's my fault. I'll take the punishment.

573
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,000
You younger generation are ignorant and fearless.

574
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,200
Don't think I don't know Lin Canglan's mind.

575
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,900
I don't like things that go contrary to me.

576
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,600
Immortal Master, you're right.

577
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Lin Canglan deserves what he got.

578
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,200
He's your father.

579
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,600
Yes.

580
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,800
I'm upset with him because he tested Yunhe.

581
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,600
And I'm more dissatisfied with his violation of your trust.

582
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,200
Now I've taken his place as the master of Thousand Flower Valley.

583
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,600
I'll be loyal to you. Honestly and truly.

584
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,500
The people of Thousand Flower Valley are all interesting.

585
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,800
A stumble may prevent a fall.

586
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,300
Go back.

587
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,100
I keep her because I'm curious.

588
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,200
If Thousand Flower Valley is loyal to me, I won't kill her.

589
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Thank you, Immortal Master.

590
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,300
You were right to not go with him.

591
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,400
If you left here with him just now,

592
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,800
the formations outside would have activated.

593
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,000
You'd have turned into powder instantly.

594
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,500
Luckily, you can see clearly.

595
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,600
Since it's well guarded, how did he get in?

596
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,800
And why is it so easy to break the barrier?

597
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,400
You let him in?

598
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,000
He's been outside Immortal Master Mansion for days.

599
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,800
After all, he's the new master of Thousand Flower Valley.

600
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,200
He's been sneaking and spying around.

601
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
I don't like it.

602
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,500
Since he knew you were here,

603
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,200
I should finish it with him in case he may have evil thoughts.

604
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,200
Turns out you've already seen it through.

605
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,400
Although my brother is always annoying,

606
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,400
it hasn't been an easy journey for him.

607
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,800
He's so concerned about me that he made a mistake.

608
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,200
Thank you for letting him go.
