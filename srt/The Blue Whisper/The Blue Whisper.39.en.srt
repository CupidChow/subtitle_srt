20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,600
Where did you hear that name?

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,860
Qing Ji told you?

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,280
In a dream, Ning Xiyu told me herself.

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,240
Ji Yunhe, don't play games with me.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,820
Ning Xiyu likes wearing white clothes.

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,800
She's free, easy, and tender.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,620
She told me a lot of things.

27
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,080
But there's one thing even Immortal Master doesn't know.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,860
You want the whole world to be buried with her.

29
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,080
But all she wanted was you.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,240
That's impossible! You can't have met her.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,480
For a thousand years, I never forgot her at all.

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,000
But she never showed up in my dreams.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,820
Why did she go to see you?

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,280
"Standing between Heaven and Earth, he's like fragrant snowflakes coming with a breeze."

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,840
Therefore, you are called Ning Qing, which means a breeze.

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,560
How did you know this poem?

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,180
<i>You want to storm Immortal Master Mansion.</i>

38
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,140
<i>But all of you aren't a match for Ning Qing.</i>

39
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,900
<i>I know. Besides, now Zhu Yan's hiding in that ring.</i>

40
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,540
<i>We can't even get close to Immortal Master, let alone force him to take off that ring.</i>

41
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,040
<i>The only way is to attack his Achilles' heel and let him take it off of his own accord.</i>

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,200
<i>Achilles' heel? You mean...</i>

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,100
<i>Ms. Ning, the Achilles' heel of Immortal Master is you.</i>

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,740
I'll find a way to bring Immortal Master's spirit into my dreams and trap it for about half an hour.

45
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,820
<i>The rest is up to you.</i>

46
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,620
<i>Okay.</i>

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,880
<i>Qing,</i>

48
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,680
<i>it's me.</i>

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,180
<i>I want to see you.</i>

50
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,040
Master?

51
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,680
Ji Yunhe, what do you want to do?

52
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,900
Master!

53
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,400
Qing, how are you doing?

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,440
Is it really you?

55
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,039
I'll soon be able to help you get revenge.

56
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,499
As to those people who hurt you, I've killed them one by one.

57
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:25,460
This world that led to your death is about to end.

58
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,960
You're going to see it for yourself.

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,420
Qing, stop it.

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,360
What are you talking about, Master?

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,560
You've done so many evil things. It's time to stop that.

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,200
Wrong? You said I was wrong?

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,160
You killed Ruochu, repressed Qing Ji,

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,700
colluded with Zhu Yan, and started wars.

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,680
Everything you did was wrong.

66
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,320
I didn't leave you here to turn this world into purgatory.

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,940
So you showed up today to stop me.

68
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,700
I don't want you to repeat your mistakes.

69
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,260
Repeat my mistakes?

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,540
Then, what about Ruochu?

71
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,400
Why didn't you stop him from repeating his mistake?

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,380
But you interceded for him and lost your life because of him.

73
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,200
Qing and Ruochu fell in love, but they didn't hurt anyone else.

74
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,080
Their love was not allowed because the world misunderstood them.

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,660
You're wrong.

76
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,200
He ruined our lives for his love.

77
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,300
Why?

78
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Why did you protect them when everyone treated you badly?

79
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,740
I'm the only one standing by you, but now you're trying to stop me.

80
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,840
Why is everything in this world more important than me?

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,820
Qing, be good.

82
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,320
No!

83
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,900
I'm not the little beggar I used to be.

84
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,580
Don't expect me to give it up

85
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,120
just because Ji Yunhe brought you back to me.

86
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,620
You guys are so naive.

87
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,140
Just a dream can't hold me.

88
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,740
When I ruin the whole world, you'll see that I'm the only one

89
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,300
who's ever been true to you.

90
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,720
And then I'll find a way to bring you back.

91
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Are you still lying to yourself today?

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,620
Everything happened because the affair between Ruochu and Qing were exposed.

93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,640
But their seclusion in Leyou Mountain was extremely secret.

94
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,820
How did Thousand Flower Valley find out about it?

95
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,900
That's because they were thoughtless and were discovered by the Lin family.

96
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,100
Qing, it's time to remember everything.

97
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,640
<i>Elder Lin, there is a matter concerning the safety of Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

98
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,540
<i>Ning Qing must personally report to you.</i>

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,780
No!

100
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,120
How can I be the one to snitch?

101
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,060
No, it's not me.

102
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,300
It wasn't me.

103
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,540
Ruochu only told me and you,

104
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,520
his most trusted junior about his love with Qing Ji.

105
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,260
But you were afraid that if their affair was revealed, our peaceful life would come to an end.

106
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,020
You persuaded them for so long but to no avail,

107
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,300
so you gave away their hiding place.

108
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,380
You tried to force him to break up with Qing Ji,

109
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,120
but it just got out of hand.

110
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,261
And you didn't expect that I would give up my position as Master of the Valley to save them.

111
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,500
No! I couldn't have done something like that.

112
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,920
You used to be gentle and non-violent.

113
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,060
But after we got kicked out of the valley, you were filled with remorse.

114
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,660
You returned to Thousand Flower Valley to help me win back my honor.

115
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,240
Your way of taming became more and more radical.

116
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,060
You tried to make up for your mistake, but then you made more mistakes,

117
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,380
killing all the beasts, and eventually getting their revenge.

118
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,740
No. They were still aggressive. That's why they attacked you.

119
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,660
But those beasts were not vicious.

120
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,580
If you hadn't gone too far by killing their leader and leaving them nowhere to go,

121
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,060
how could they have attacked you and me so desperately?

122
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,820
No.

123
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,460
Impossible!

124
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,780
Everything I'd done...

125
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,620
Everything I'd done was for you!

126
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,060
How could I possibly have done this to you?

127
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,900
But that's the truth.

128
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,560
You hate yourself too much to bear it.

129
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,900
Therefore, you chose to escape and to forget.

130
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,780
You threw all your hatred at someone else.

131
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,620
It's the only way to keep the guilt from driving you crazy.

132
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,000
That's not possible. No. That's not true.

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,800
You killed so many people. Is it because you wanted to avenge me,

134
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,600
or to erase all the past so that you would never remember it.

135
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,980
You were just scared.

136
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,060
You were afraid they would remind you of what you had done.

137
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,340
But none of that made you feel better.

138
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,560
Therefore, you hated more and more and made more and more mistakes, until you fell into the abyss.

139
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,700
It's so hard to bring you back.

140
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,580
In fact, from beginning to end, the one you can't forgive is yourself,

141
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,680
not the world.

142
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,680
No wonder...

143
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,120
No wonder you never wanted to see me for a millennia.

144
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,200
It's so ridiculous.

145
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,060
Ridiculously, I was always saying it was about revenge.

146
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,560
In the end,

147
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,300
I was the one causing all the problems.

148
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,560
<i>Come on.</i>

149
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,840
<i>Come up to me.</i>

150
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,020
It's you?

151
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,720
<i>Are all the spiritual powers enough for you?</i>

152
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,680
<i>Come with me.</i>

153
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,400
What are you up to?

154
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,880
<i>Ji Yunhe and the merman are here.</i>

155
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,960
<i>They're trying to hurt your master.</i>

156
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,600
<i>Don't you want to take revenge?</i>

157
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,220
<i>The opportunity is in your hand.</i>

158
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,420
Ji Yunhe is not dead yet?

159
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,300
I've killed her so many times.

160
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,320
Why is she still alive?

161
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,620
Is God also against me?

162
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,580
Fine.

163
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,940
I'll do it myself this time.

164
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,820
And I'll settle all the hatred and disgrace today.

165
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,280
Ji Yunhe, you're still alive.

166
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,820
What are you going to do to my master?

167
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,900
Merman, you put out the ground fire,

168
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,160
then trapped my master with some formation.

169
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,480
How much power do you have to fight me now?

170
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,940
Now you can't even protect yourself.

171
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,000
How can you protect her?

172
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,660
I can!

173
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,440
<i>So what if you knew the truth?</i>

174
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,400
<i>All the emotions, including love and hatred, are elusive.</i>

175
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,620
<i>Chaos is the essence of everything.</i>

176
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,140
<i>If no one understands you, just destroy them all!</i>

177
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,060
Sorry,

178
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,520
I can't turn back.

179
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,620
If I do give up,

180
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,320
all I've done for thousands of years was a joke.

181
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,660
It means nothing.

182
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,080
No one cares about me anymore, right?

183
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,140
Don't you understand?

184
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,940
I want to save the world,

185
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,560
but the person I want to save the most is you.

186
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,440
I'm as guilty as the world.

187
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,620
Don't you hate me?

188
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,520
The world has no mercy.

189
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,060
But all beings have no faults.

190
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,780
Without the mountains and rivers of this world,

191
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,620
there would be no hate and no love.

192
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,940
There would be no parting of you and me,

193
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,840
nor would there be our first encounter.

194
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,680
Its existence is the meaning of you and me, isn't it?

195
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,440
Qing, I wasn't there for you

196
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,260
when you were in your worst moment.

197
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,500
You've been alone for such a long time.

198
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,180
I understand that what you want is nothing

199
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,420
more than the home we had in the beginning.

200
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,620
How about I take you home?

201
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,600
Master!

202
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,960
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

203
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,540
I wonder how their conversation turned out.

204
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,220
Master, kill them for me.

205
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,060
I know what you are here for.

206
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,400
I'll give it to you.

207
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,380
<i>Ning Qing! I can't believe you're trying to break the contract!</i>

208
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,760
<i>Do you want to die?</i>

209
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,480
<i>I've been wrong for so long.</i>

210
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,080
<i>I need to pay the price.</i>

211
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,520
No. Master, don't go.

212
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,620
I won't let you go.

213
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,560
Isn't this the face you want?

214
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,840
Look! It's almost healed.

215
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,640
Master, I can act as if nothing had happened.

216
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,580
I want to be with you forever.

217
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,800
Please, don't go.

218
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,720
Master.

219
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,380
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,690
Why?

221
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:24,400
Why?

222
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,260
No, Master!

223
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,260
Ji Yunhe, do what you need to do.

224
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,900
<i>Ning Qing, I can't believe you would betray me!</i>

225
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,760
<i>At this point, what worries do I have?</i>

226
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,700
<i>I'm tired of hiding.</i>

227
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,160
<i>You all have to die today.</i>

228
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,760
Be careful.

229
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,020
Zhu Yan was hurt badly by Qing, but he has accumulated power for millennia.

230
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,900
We can't underestimate him.

231
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,240
Wait for me here.

232
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,020
What are you going to do?

233
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,420
<i>You're just a merman.</i>

234
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,840
<i>What can you do to me?</i>

235
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,720
Making a sword by the blood of your heart? Chang Yi, are you crazy?

236
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,720
<i>How much blood do you have left for you to manipulate?</i>

237
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,620
<i>If you kill me, you'll die, too.</i>

238
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,560
<i>Let me off, then I will let you live</i>

239
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,260
<i>and be with your lover forever.</i>

240
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,780
<i>As to the others, you can just leave them to die.</i>

241
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,220
<i>Is it worth sacrificing your life for the world?</i>

242
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,860
<i>You'll never know why the world exists.</i>

243
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,900
No!

244
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,740
Chang Yi. Chang Yi!

245
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,500
Chang Yi, are you okay?

246
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,900
Thank you.

247
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,320
It's time for me to leave.

248
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,960
She absorbed the last of Zhu Yan's power.

249
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,680
None of you are leaving today, especially you.

250
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,120
Go!

251
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,820
Ru Ling, please stop.

252
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,380
Isn't that ironic, Master?

253
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,540
You used to be so condescending,

254
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,360
but now you're prostrating yourself before me.

255
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,200
But maybe you're wrong about one thing.

256
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,280
You don't get to tell me what to do now.

257
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,700
Ji Yunhe and the merman were here to kill you.

258
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,880
Why did you help them against me?

259
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,020
Because they let you meet the person you wanted to see?

260
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,080
What about me?

261
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,000
What about the hundreds of years I've been with you?

262
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,780
Master...

263
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,860
I remember the good old days.

264
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,860
I'll never forget the affection between you and me.

265
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,780
I won't kill you as long as you do what I say.

266
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,600
Okay?

267
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,920
Sorry, Ru Ling.

268
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,120
I failed to teach you to be a good person.

269
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,060
I forgot how to love my master.

270
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,400
And I also forgot to teach you how to love someone.

271
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,100
I turned you and myself into monsters.

272
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,160
If you hate me, just kill me now.

273
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,540
But don't hurt anyone else.

274
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,400
Okay?

275
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,780
You want to die?

276
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,320
You want to die just because she told you to.

277
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,440
How dare you!

278
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,600
I forbid it.

279
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,600
In my whole life, I did all the things you asked me to do.

280
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,740
Now it's your turn to do the same.

281
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,300
Master.

282
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,740
Why?

283
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,880
Why are you always looking at her?

284
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,280
When can you have me in your eyes?

285
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,140
Just one glance.

286
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,600
Why?

287
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,460
<i>Qing, remember the first spell you learned as a child?</i>

288
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,500
"Standing between Heaven and Earth,

289
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,420
he's like fragrant snowflakes coming with a breeze."

290
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,300
Master,

291
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,900
Qing is back.

292
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,760
Master.

293
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,340
From birth to death, from the beginning to the end,

294
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,760
I've never been as good as her in your eyes. Right?

295
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,120
Fine.

296
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,300
Since she wants to protect the world,

297
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,980
I'll destroy all her dreams and expectations.

298
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,100
I'm going to make the world a chaotic place forever.

299
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,660
Li Shu.

300
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,940
Who are you?

301
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,320
What place is this?

302
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,500
The bell knows who I am, and you still can't recognize me?

303
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,280
This is your dream.

304
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,140
After I defeated Zhu Yan with the former emperor,

305
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,660
my body was destroyed,

306
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,200
and only a trace of my soul remained in the lantern.

307
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,680
I summoned you in while the gate of Infinite Mountain opened,

308
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,900
so we could meet with each other.

309
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,200
<i>Li Shu.</i>

310
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,480
<i>Wait a second. It seems that someone is calling me.</i>

311
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,120
It was your voice? The bell also belongs to you?

312
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Are you my grandfather who died in the war?

313
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,060
The Lu Wu clan is so lucky. I'm surprised you've lasted this long.

314
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,720
You're here because you're worried about me, your grandson. Right?

315
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,620
Li Shu, the god seems to have made everything disorderly.

316
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,300
But it has reasons.

317
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,320
Do you know why we descendants of Lu Wu

318
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,020
are different from others and have nine lives?

319
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,880
You're here for the lantern.

320
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,400
Do you know that the fire of the lantern

321
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,600
is actually the Infinite Heavenly Fire

322
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,340
from Ninefold Thunder Sea?

323
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,360
Only the strongest of Lu Wu's descendants can cross the Thunder Sea

324
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,340
and get the Heavenly Fire with nine lives that no one else has.

325
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,260
But there is a limit even with a few more lives.

326
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,540
Did you die because you lighted the lantern?

327
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,660
Yes.

328
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,780
It's your mission, too.

329
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,600
The descendants of Lu Wu were born for the Heavenly Fire.

330
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,900
You must carry on the duty of our clan,

331
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,740
to retrieve the Heavenly Fire

332
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,200
and rekindle the lantern.

333
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,660
W-W-Wait for a sec.

334
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,120
What do you mean?

335
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,140
Duty? Mission?

336
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,700
How can you send your grandson to his death when we just met again?

337
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,580
You're an honorable man and willing to sacrifice for the world.

338
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,260
But I'm different.

339
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,460
It took me a long time to get Sanyue back.

340
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,440
Why are you telling me at this time

341
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,220
that I have to leave her to save the world?

342
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,560
Grandfather. Grandpa.

343
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,500
There's got to be another way. Right?

344
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I haven't married Sanyue yet.

345
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,480
Li Shu, the so-called mission is that after innumerable twists and turns

346
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,760
you'll eventually return to the road you must take.

347
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,420
Some day, you'll know it.

348
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,600
Li Shu.

349
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,420
No. I don't understand.

350
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,220
I don't understand!

351
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,560
Sanyue, are you all right?

352
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,780
The back of my neck hurts.

353
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,660
Sanyue, your Frost mark disappeared.

354
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,800
The Frost mark is really gone.

355
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,180
What's going on?

356
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,080
The Frost mark came about because of Zhu Yan.

357
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,680
It suddenly disappeared at this time,

358
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,820
is it because Zhu Yan has been killed?

359
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,460
It isn't good.

360
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,820
Immortal Master is dead;

361
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,300
Zhu Yan has been killed.

362
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,640
But a new devil suddenly appeared, devouring evil in the world.

363
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,100
Its power is growing.

364
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,560
If it goes on like this, I'm afraid this devil will be as powerful as Zhu Yan.

365
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,200
Was it Chang Yi who killed Immortal Master and Zhu Yan?

366
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,280
But who's the new devil?

367
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
I got it.

368
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,640
Now that the Immortal Master is dead,the barrier he set probably doesn't exist anymore.

369
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,880
We should get out of here, to kill the new devil while he was just born.

370
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,600
No.

371
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,100
This devil is so weird.

372
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,460
The only thing in the world that can compete with this new devil is the lantern.

373
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,040
But now some pieces of the lantern are still missing.

374
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,480
Your Majesty, I suggest we act separately.

375
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,900
Good idea. Commander Xue has just recovered from the Frost mark and she's still weak.

376
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,180
Li Shu, I want you to take her out to rest

377
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,020
and find out what's going on out there.

378
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,660
The two masters and I will join you in North Abyss

379
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,360
after repairing the lantern.

380
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,960
Okay. We'll go right now.

381
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,840
<i>Li Shu, the so-called mission is that after innumerable twists and turns</i>

382
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,780
<i>you'll eventually return to the road you must take.</i>

383
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,300
<i>Some day, you'll know it.</i>

384
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,300
Li Shu? Li Shu?

385
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,620
Let's go.

386
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,240
Senior!

387
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,960
Senior, where are you?

388
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,560
Senior!

389
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,960
You don't have to meet me anymore.

390
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,000
The little bit of spirit I left behind is now all gone.

391
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,900
Shunde absorbed the power of Ning Qing and Zhu Yan before they died.

392
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,640
There's going to be a big fight.

393
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,600
Sorry, I can't help you anymore.

394
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,679
You are on your own in the future.

395
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,080
Yunhe!

396
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,520
Yunhe, you're finally awake! You're finally back.

397
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,220
You have no idea how much I missed you.

398
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,960
How are you feeling? Are you all right?

399
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,720
No.

400
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,820
Luo Luo, I haven't seen you in a while.

401
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,080
You mustn't leave me anymore.

402
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,140
You know... You didn't even tell us about your attack on Immortal Master and Zhu Yan.

403
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,440
We were on our way to help when we saw you and Chang Yi lying at Lingshuang Pavilion.

404
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,600
It was so worried!

405
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,140
Now you're back.

406
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,720
I haven't said a word to you.

407
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,660
What would I do if you died?

408
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,440
It was an emergency.

409
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,310
We weren't a hundred percent sure that we could win.

410
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,660
That's why we didn't want you involved.

411
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
I'll tell you next time.

412
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,740
You can't run away.

413
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,940
Let me turn into a puppy if I were to run away.

414
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,420
Where is Chang Yi?

415
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,260
He's in Kong Ming's room.

416
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,640
Kong Ming locked him up after we returned to Lingshuang Pavilion.

417
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,740
I don't know what they're doing.

418
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,200
You don't have to try again.

419
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,020
You're wasting your power.

420
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,180
It's my business to treat your injury. Not yours.

421
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,260
There is no hope for me.

422
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,140
Zhu Yan is the eternal black ice.

423
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,880
I made a sword by the blood of my heart

424
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,360
to destroy his residual body.

425
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,080
It, in turn, would definitely hurt me.

426
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,720
It can't be cured.

427
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,540
Nobody can save me.

428
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,220
So you knew it would kill you.

429
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,920
Then, why did you do that?

430
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,600
Why didn't you talk to me first?

431
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,020
Just give me the slightest hint,

432
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,700
and I'll do everything I can to find another way to kill him.

433
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,560
It could have been different.

434
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,000
If you were there, would you hesitate?

435
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:40,840
It's better than me watching you do it alone.

436
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,340
Chang Yi, you and I have known each other for so long,

437
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,700
am I not worthy of your trust,

438
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,420
not worthy of fighting side by side with you?

439
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:59,560
<i>Kong Ming, if we all take this risk, North Abyss will be in danger.</i>

440
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,140
Someone has to be in front and someone has to guard the rear.

441
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,060
Besides, I'm your chance to fight against Immortal Master.

442
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,380
People who pursue the Tao are supposed to give up something. Right?

443
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,560
What the hell is that "chance"?

444
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,400
Don't mention that to me again.

445
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,060
Haven't you and I been friends and confidants...

446
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,820
for a long time?

447
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,460
I'd rather die than get my friend in trouble.

448
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,380
But now I can't even save my best friend.

449
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,100
Yunhe, you're awake.

450
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,460
Sir,

451
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,940
how is Chang Yi's health now?

452
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,900
Yunhe.

453
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,440
Don't worry. I've been through a lot of hardships,

454
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,400
and I can handle it no matter what happens.

455
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,000
I just want to know the truth.

456
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,080
He was devoured by Zhu Yan's cold aura.

457
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,300
All of his bones and blood...

458
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,180
will be frozen.

459
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,080
He'll die?

460
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,020
He'll be frozen...

461
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,500
in the ice lifelessly and forever.

462
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,640
Sir, is there any way to save him?

463
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,900
I'm willing to try no matter how little hope there is.

464
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,980
Yunhe, he has tried everything he can think of.

465
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,220
This is about the safety of North Abyss.

466
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,120
Don't let anyone know about it for now.

467
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,480
Chang Yi, let's go back. I need to talk to you.

468
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,500
Don't follow us.

469
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,140
What happened to them?

470
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,680
What happened to you?

471
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Yunhe.

472
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,140
Chang Yi, please marry me.

473
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,760
No.

474
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,180
You gave me the Merman Mark.

475
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,940
You already married me according to the rule of the Merman Clan.

476
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,100
A merman can love only one person in their life.

477
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,480
Are you going to kick me away?

478
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,440
I can't hold you up.

479
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,740
Don't you think it's a little late for that?

480
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,280
The whole world knows we're a couple.

481
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,300
No one else will dare to marry me.

482
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,900
I don't think that's okay.

483
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,840
Fine. Then I'll keep asking you until you say yes.

484
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,540
Yunhe, don't be mischievous.

485
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,540
I'll promise you anything but this.

486
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,700
I'm not mischievous.

487
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,620
If I was going to die, would you marry me?

488
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,940
Would you feel like you were holding me up?

489
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,440
You have a thousand, even ten thousand reasons to refuse me.

490
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,040
But can you listen to my reasons?

491
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,280
I know what it's like to be at the end of life.

492
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,480
I know what I will regret at the last moment.

493
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,700
I don't want to waste my time anymore. I want to be your wife;

494
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,340
I want proof that you have existed in my life.

495
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,800
Even if one day you leave,

496
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,920
it will tell me that we were together.

497
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,340
Chang Yi, you're not holding me up,

498
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,220
but making my dream come true.
