<i>Sanyue.</i>

Li Shu.

16
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,287
Right.

17
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,960
All he cares about is Qing Ji.

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,380
Now he has gotten what he wanted and is following his old master.

19
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,880
How could he think of me?

20
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,620
<i>I was lucky to get through this time. It won't happen again.</i>

21
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,600
<i>It seems that no matter what happens, I have to go back to Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

22
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,220
How could you be so careless?

23
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,060
You finally recovered a little, and you almost ruined yourself again.

24
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,980
As the son of the Lynx King and the descendant of Lu Wu,

25
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm not that weak.

26
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,060
Besides, you are here.

27
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,380
You wouldn't just watch me die, would you?

28
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,680
All right. You're almost recovered.

29
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,800
Go back to Xue Sanyue.

30
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,520
What? You stormed out of the house last night,

31
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,560
and you hesitate now.

32
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,800
Last night, I was impulsive to step out.

33
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,560
Now, when I have calmed down and thought about it, I'm afraid.

34
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,960
Sanyue brought the medicine but she didn't come to see me.

35
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,360
She must still be upset about what happened before.

36
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
Useless.

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,320
You don't even dare to face a woman.

38
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,700
I hurt her a lot, after all.

39
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,220
If she doesn't forgive me, I don't even have a way out.

40
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,700
Besides, being rejected by a woman is so embarrassing. Okay?

41
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,560
I might as well just stay around her

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,300
and watch over her as long as I can.

43
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,160
She went back to the Thousand Flower Valley.

44
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,940
What?

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,380
How could she be so reckless?

46
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,020
Why didn't she come to ask for your help?

47
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,160
Now, she is wanted by the Thousand Flower Valley. It's too dangerous to go back now.

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,660
If you worry about her, why are you wavering here?

49
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,180
My attendant shouldn't be so naggy.

50
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,300
Master Qing,

51
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,560
but if I leave you alone on Leyou Mountain, would you be lonely?

52
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,300
Li Shu, what I hate the most are those who speak one way and think another.

53
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,940
Now you're acting like that. I can't even drink anymore.

54
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,520
All right, just go.

55
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
She got you the medicine this time.

56
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,140
She must not be so angry now.

57
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,880
When she sees you, she should not kill you immediately.

58
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,100
Whether you make up or break up, there has to be an end.

59
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,420
It's all up to you.

60
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,500
Thank you, Master Qing.

61
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,080
<i>- Beat her.
- Help. Don't hit me.</i>

62
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,960
As the Guardian of Thousand Flower Valley, she is reduced to being hit by those guilty immortals.

63
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,280
It's really sad.

64
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,040
That's her payback for offending Fairy Shunde.

65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,140
<i>- It's all your fault.
- Help.</i>

66
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,920
<i>Hit her.</i>

67
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,720
<i>Stop it!</i>

68
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,880
At least I'm a Guardian. Show some respect.

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,080
Let me go. Don't hit me!

70
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,280
My arms! My legs!

71
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,360
Hit her hard!

72
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,000
<i>- Where will you go?
- Stop hitting.</i>

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,440
<i>- Come here.
- Help!</i>

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,040
<i>I practice every day.</i>

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,400
<i>Why is there no way to control the inner power?</i>

76
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,080
<i>Stop hitting me!</i>

77
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,760
You really know how to control minds.

78
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,800
Why do you say so?

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,220
Look at them.

80
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,120
You were the one who sent them into prison.

81
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,020
And they all came back to help you.

82
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,920
And they did everything they could. Willingly.

83
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,820
Ji Yunhe, that's the same thing you used on me. Right?

84
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,320
Yin was burned by Bi Fang and turned into ashes.

85
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,160
He had no chance to survive.

86
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,640
The reincarnation was just a lie.

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,140
Not long after I entered Immortal Master Mansion, I figured it out.

88
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,939
Thank you.

89
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,420
I'm supposed to hate you.

90
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,060
But if you hadn't settled my grudge with the story of Yin's reincarnation,

91
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,820
I'm afraid I'd have drowned in it,

92
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,500
refusing to wake up and continuing to commit crimes.

93
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,600
So, even if it's a lie,

94
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,120
I appreciate your kindness.

95
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,600
It's not really a white lie.It's just my duty.

96
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,020
I lied to you. I'm really sorry.

97
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
You have a good heart.

98
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,060
I've decided that if you are proud of yourself

99
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,320
and think you're right,

100
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,960
then this time, I'll follow the instructions of Envoy Zhang

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,500
and teach you a lesson.

102
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,860
But now... I'll let you go.

103
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,700
Thank you for not killing me.

104
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,720
Just now, I saw you practicing secretly.

105
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,040
The power in your hand was wild,

106
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,240
but it can't be concentrated. It's not ready yet.

107
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,560
I wonder if you can teach me, Senior?

108
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
What do you want to do?

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,740
Get out of here.

110
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,360
Outside Congji Jail, there are people I care about.

111
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,720
Even though he hates me, I still want to keep him safe.

112
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,760
If he hates you, is it worth it for you to protect him?

113
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,280
Because it's him, everything's worth it.

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,320
All right. I'd like to help you.

115
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,679
What about Ji Yunhe?

116
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,480
I heard that in Congji Jail, there's always crying and begging.

117
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,260
I'm guessing Ji Yunhe is being tortured.

118
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,480
That's nice to hear.

119
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,240
A few days later, find something new to visit her.

120
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,080
What about the merman?

121
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,880
We haven't caught him yet.

122
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,200
Didn't the news come that the merman and Kong Ming went to the North Abyss?

123
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,360
Is everyone in Lingshuang Pavilion decoration?

124
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,480
On my order.

125
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,160
In three days, Lingshuang Pavilion must catch the merman.

126
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,000
Otherwise,

127
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,360
all the people will be guilty of delaying.

128
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,020
Yes.

129
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,640
Wait a minute.

130
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,320
Ask the Thousand Flower Valley to get some men over there, too.

131
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,440
I don't believe that I can't catch the merman.

132
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,600
Fairy Shunde knows that our Thousand Flower Valley has conflicts with Lingshuang Pavilion.

133
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,480
And she asked us to help them in the North Abyss.

134
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,840
It seems that to get Chang Yi,

135
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,200
she doesn't care anything else.

136
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,440
I don't get it.

137
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,560
Why is she so obsessed with Chang Yi? Does she really have to get him?

138
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,140
She's not obsessed with getting him.

139
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,080
She just won't allow anyone to be against her will.

140
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,440
Do as she says.

141
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,999
Yes.

142
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,720
When you lead the team to North Abyss,

143
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,120
remember, do not get in conflict with Lingshuang Pavilion.

144
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,880
Zhu Ling is a henchman of Fairy Shunde.

145
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,060
He's really good at calling white black.

146
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,720
It doesn't matter if we can catch the merman. But don't make him falsely charge us.

147
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,040
Go.

148
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,680
<i>Yes.</i>

149
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,320
You.

150
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
What did you say?

151
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,860
Lin Haoqing sent men to catch Chang Yi?

152
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,000
How dare you

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,600
to help Shunde bully Yunhe's man while she's not here.

154
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,260
That was an order from Fairy Shunde. Who dares to defy?

155
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,480
Coward. You're just afraid.

156
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,320
It's been so long since we come back from Lutai Mountain,

157
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,280
why doesn't Lin Haoqing go and save Yunhe?

158
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,840
He won't go and he won't let me go.

159
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,080
Why did he do that?

160
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,280
You have tried to get out of Thousand Flower Valley over and over again.

161
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,600
Master doesn't care about your little offense.

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,960
Just calm down.

163
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,360
Master,

164
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,720
he's trying to save Yunhe.

165
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,440
It's just the way he has chosen may take more time.

166
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,120
Well, tell me about it. What is it?

167
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,020
I'm not the worm in his stomach. How am I supposed to know everything?

168
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,040
Just stop messing around.

169
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,200
It's not the case that the more you know, the better it is.

170
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,280
About Ji Yunhe, I need to figure it out.

171
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,120
And Lin Haoqing is so good at keeping secrets.

172
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,760
Even Siyu's death was a lie.

173
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,520
Why should I trust him?

174
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,740
Believe it or not. I don't have time for arguing.

175
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,320
I have to go on patrol. Bye.

176
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,983
Coward.

177
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
All useless.

178
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,760
There are so many of you. And you still can't catch a medicine maker.

179
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,820
Report!

180
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,900
Master, Fairy Shunde's order. Lingshuang Pavilion must catch the merman in three days,

181
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,380
or you're guilty of delaying.

182
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
Heard that?

183
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,180
In three days. My order.

184
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,180
Even if digging into the earth, you need to find the merman.

185
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,987
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

186
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,780
If you hear it, go find him.

187
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Do you think the merman is hiding here?

188
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,540
Are we going to dig this place up?

189
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,220
Leave!

190
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,460
Master, the people from Thousand Flower Valley are here, too.

191
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,200
They said, under the order of Fairy Shunde, they come to help us catch the merman.

192
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Lock them all up.

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,080
What? Had they not failed in their duty,

194
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,220
do we need to help them clean up the mess?

195
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,020
Give them a hard time.

196
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,020
But, Master, they are here on Fairy Shunde's order.

197
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,740
I'm not deaf.

198
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,200
You needn't remind me.

199
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,840
It's just catching the merman.

200
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,100
Lingshuang Pavilion is enough.

201
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,020
Why let Thousand Flower Valley get in the way and share the credit?

202
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,520
Lock them up first.

203
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,890
When I catch the merman, I'll report Fairy Shunde that

204
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,820
that those from Thousand Flower Valley were arrogant and provocative.

205
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,420
I was afraid they'd mess things up.

206
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,540
So I had to lock him up first.

207
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,020
This...

208
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,840
Go.

209
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,549
Yes.

210
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,220
<i>The medicine I made this time was a failure again.</i>

211
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,140
<i>Although there's no progress, fortunately, there are some antidotes to research.</i>

212
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,840
<i>Antidotes?</i>

213
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,400
What's the lack in the formula this time?

214
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,280
Late Master had researched for so many years.

215
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,020
- Maybe his methods...
- I've said that we need to use our own method.

216
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,920
<i>Siyu?</i>

217
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,700
<i>Wasn't she killed by Lin Haoqing?</i>

218
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,540
Master, the elders are waiting for you in the Shrillwind Hall.

219
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,040
<i>There's a secret chamber in Master's inner hall.</i>

220
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,340
Lin Haoqing.

221
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,260
He's sneaking around all day.

222
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,520
I wonder what they're doing.

223
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Since no one will tell me, I'll figure it out myself.

224
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,660
I'd like to see what can be more important than Yunhe.

225
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,300
Bully me, a grumpy little butterfly. No way.

226
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,000
Master, someone broke into the secret chamber.

227
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,500
<i>Is this the antidote to the Frost mark?</i>

228
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,340
Siyu.

229
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,280
Lin Haoqing. You acted really well that day.

230
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,219
Give me the antidote.

231
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,820
Handing over the antidote means death.

232
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,419
You don't know what this antidote stands for.

233
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,340
For Thousand Flower Valley, it's more important than life.

234
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,640
What does it stand for?

235
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,900
The plot and ambition of you and your father?

236
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,800
The things that Lin Canglan made are all in your hands now.

237
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,300
Lin Haoqing, do you think other people are stupid.

238
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
I'll say it once again.

239
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
Give me the antidote.

240
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,200
What if I have to take it with me?

241
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,980
<i>Let me help you, Commander Xue.</i>

242
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,200
You. Weren't you already...

243
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,340
- It's been a long time.
- Out of the way!

244
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,820
Master Qing, here you are.

245
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,080
Fool.

246
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,680
You steal the antidote and don't take it immediately, what were you going to eat after running this far?

247
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,500
When it comes to love, who's stupider?

248
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,700
<i>Lin Haoqing, let me out of here.</i>

249
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,220
Don't rely on Ji Yunhe's instructions to push too far.

250
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,840
Since you really like getting involved, stay right here to see what I'm doing.

251
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,380
It took a lot to save a few antidotes.

252
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,260
They are all gone now.

253
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,980
<i>Let me go!</i>

254
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,380
Remember. If there are Spiritual Masters in Thousand Flower Valley suffering from the Frost mark,

255
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,700
half of the blame is on you and Xue Sanyue.

256
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,800
<i>What did you say? Come back.</i>

257
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,760
<i>What do you mean? Come back.</i>

258
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,380
Your Highness, now the Fox King has been arrested.

259
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,900
The Qing Qiu clan is being chased by Zhu Ling all over the hill.

260
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,820
The Young Lord, Qing Yao.

261
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,880
Although she's kind, she's still young.

262
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,060
She can't bear the pursuit of you and me.

263
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,760
Shall we still ally with her?

264
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,160
We made allies along the way

265
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,680
without judging their strengths.

266
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,920
Since we're all desperate people, we're supposed to help each other.

267
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,220
Now the priority is to save the Fox King as soon as possible.

268
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,680
Right. Besides, the Qing Qiu clan has moved to the North Abyss for years.

269
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,040
They should be familiar with the environment of the place.

270
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,460
Well, I'll go and talk to them.

271
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,900
Maybe we can take it by storm.

272
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,200
Mr. Kong Ming, I have a plan.

273
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,480
What? You want to use yourself as bait to catch Zhu Ling?

274
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,520
Yes.

275
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,500
No. Even if we make an ambush, it's still too dangerous.

276
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,360
I don't think so.

277
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,740
Fairy Shunde has high aspirations of getting him.

278
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,180
Zhu Ling tried so hard to play up to her.

279
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,940
If we trade him for Uncle, Zhu Ling would not refuse it.

280
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,080
But if something goes wrong, we're pushing Prince Chang Yi into the fire.

281
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,760
He volunteered. Why do you hesitate?

282
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,180
Qing Yao, you are our Young Lord.

283
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Shouldering the responsibility, you should make the decision.

284
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,340
I have discussed with Mr. Kong Ming about this.

285
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,000
As long as we stick to the plan, there must be a chance.

286
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,620
Your Majesty, you really aren't afraid?

287
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,980
If I were, at the beginning, we wouldn't have come to North Abyss.

288
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,700
We really want to save the Fox King.

289
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,140
It's not just an empty promise.

290
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,180
All right.

291
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,920
This time. Let's work together.

292
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,960
Kill Zhu Ling. Save my father.

293
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,280
Senior, did I succeed?

294
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,760
You can only control the Hidden Soul Needle for the time of burning an incense.

295
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,560
And you can't fully control it.

296
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,280
You can barely fight against me.

297
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,000
Immortal Chengyu, it's been a long time.

298
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,020
Why do you come to visit me today?

299
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,220
I heard that Guardian Ji has suffered recently.

300
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,300
There's not much I can do for you.

301
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,720
I can only bring you some clothes to change into.

302
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,820
At least you can get clean and also feel better.

303
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,407
Thank you, Immortal.

304
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,860
I can make a friend like you here, Immortal.

305
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,080
It's worth it.

306
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,800
Guhuo Bird has scolded me and vented her anger.

307
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,000
She's asleep now.

308
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,340
Immortal Chengyu, please hold your voice. Don't wake them up.

309
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,140
Guardian Ji, please wait.

310
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,140
This place will become peaceful soon.

311
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,520
What do you mean?

312
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,740
Fairy Shunde did the wrong thing.

313
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,120
I have reported to Master.

314
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,700
Tomorrow these guilty immortals will be sent back.

315
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,680
No. I'm bored here.

316
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,420
Fairy Shunde sent them over to entertain me. It's quite great.

317
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,020
You don't have to pretend.

318
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,720
Take these days to recover yourself.

319
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,140
You don't look very happy.

320
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
Thank you, Immortal Chengyu.

321
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,060
What did you do?

322
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,380
The disciple of Immortal Master Mansion didn't help you before,

323
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,560
but he came to hinder you now.

324
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,340
I didn't expect that, either.

325
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,840
I carefully planned but forgot Ji Chengyu.

326
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,960
All right. I'm leaving.

327
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,240
But with your speed of practicing alone,

328
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,680
I'm afraid your lover can't wait for you that long.

329
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,240
This is the second day.

330
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,940
Not to mention the merman,

331
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,260
I don't even see a tail.

332
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,660
Why do I have a bunch of losers like you?

333
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,600
Report!

334
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,060
Master. Qing Xuan's daughter just sent you a message.

335
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,480
She wants to have peace negotiations with you.

336
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,000
Peace negotiations?

337
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,020
- She's coming for death.
- Just kill her.

338
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,000
They said they have the merman you want.

339
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,860
They want to exchange Qing Xuan.

340
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,420
My merman was captured by them?

341
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,390
Shall we arrest the messenger?

342
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,300
The merman and the rest of Qing Qiu,

343
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,700
I'll catch them all and present them to Fairy Shunde.

344
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,900
They will not escape this time.

345
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,920
Zhu Ling agreed?

346
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,140
Yes. The time is tomorrow.

347
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,520
Great. It all depends on tomorrow.

348
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:59,100
Zhu Ling reports that he'll exchange Fox King for the merman tomorrow.

349
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,060
Great. Zhu Ling finally did something good.

350
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,180
Exchange the merman tomorrow. Wonderful.

351
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,040
I'll bring him back myself.

352
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,880
Fairy. You'll go to Lingshuang Pavilion yourself?

353
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,620
Right. I'll make the merman kneel before me

354
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,680
kowtow in public for mercy, and be punished by me.

355
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,320
I want the entire North Abyss to see that

356
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,520
no one can disobey me.

357
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,600
No one can escape from me.

358
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,840
<i>It was Master Qing who brought me back.</i>

359
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,600
I asked you to have an end with her.

360
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,960
I didn't ask you to end yourself.

361
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,960
You just regained human form, and you fight with others recklessly.

362
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,140
The Frost your absorbed for her hasn't been eliminated.

363
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,520
And now you have spent so much power.

364
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,860
If you're so reckless, why don't I just give you an end

365
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,340
and save myself from saving you over and over?

366
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,800
Master Qing, where's Sanyue?

367
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,140
Ungrateful.

368
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,700
All you talk about is Sanyue.

369
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,100
Master Qing, Sanyue almost died.

370
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,860
You almost died, too.

371
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,660
Compared to her, you could have died more completely.

372
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,740
I used to be a Blue Feather Phoenix that shocked the world.

373
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,220
Now all I do is heal others.

374
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,760
I'm well practiced.

375
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,220
I think I might as well hang a sign down the hill

376
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,760
and open a clinic.

377
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,720
So she's all right.

378
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,960
How could you...

379
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,640
Are the juniors all so rude today?

380
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,600
Why did you keep me?

381
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,460
I'd like to ask you.

382
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,260
You can escape throughout the whole world.

383
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,220
When you're dying, why did you run back to my Leyou Mountain?

384
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,620
It's my own business.

385
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,540
At the bottom of your heart, are there things you can't let go of?

386
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,580
Or people.

387
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,080
I'll stay here a few days. As soon as I recover,

388
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,040
I'll leave right away.

389
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,760
Do you consider my place as a free hotel?

390
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,820
<i>Scent of Wisteria Flowers.</i>

391
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,940
<i>What are you doing?</i>

392
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,940
<i>Beauty, today is the 200th day since I met you.</i>

393
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,420
<i>The flower is for you.</i>

394
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,340
<i>This is a poisonous flower in Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

395
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,523
<i>Poisonous flowers?</i>

396
00:30:50,523 --> 00:30:52,820
<i>I won't die from this, will I?</i>

397
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,280
<i>You won't.</i>

398
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,900
<i>That's okay.</i>

399
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,980
<i>But maybe you'll be stupid.</i>

400
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,140
<i>What? No. Well, I...</i>

401
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,460
<i>Master Sanyue now knows how to make fun of me.</i>

402
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,640
<i>Scent of Wisteria Flowers.</i>

403
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,200
<i>I used the water infused with wisteria flowers. Like it?</i>

404
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,180
<i>What does that mean?</i>

405
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,720
<i>Like it, or not?</i>

406
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,340
<i>I like it.</i>

407
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,500
<i>Then keep liking it.</i>

408
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,955
Li Shu.

409
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,880
Have you brought Li Shu back to life?

410
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,160
What? You just can't wait to kill him?

411
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,000
Why did you hide? Coward.

412
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,780
I didn't mean to hide.

413
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,880
But somehow, I couldn't control myself.

414
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,900
When I'm ready, next time... I'll meet her next time.

415
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,060
I really miss your father, Lynx King.

416
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,540
He was so straightforward.

417
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,580
In three days, he married your mother.

418
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,420
Each generation is worse than the last.

419
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,160
I didn't expect that.

420
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,000
You're the fox girl who escaped my arrow.

421
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,660
Qing Xuan's daughter. You're kind of bold.

422
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,860
Where's my father?

423
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,100
First, hand over the merman.

424
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,380
If I can't see my father in person today,

425
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,760
I'd rather kill him than give him to you.

426
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,623
All right.

427
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,920
The Fox King is in this tower.

428
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,240
You hand over the merman, I'll let him go.

429
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,740
How can I know if he's inside?

430
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,220
Believe it or not.

431
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,120
You asked to exchange with me. Not me.

432
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,360
I can't leave without the merman. No big deal.

433
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,220
We just say goodbye.

434
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,800
Master, we can't. Fairy Shunde...

435
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,520
Shut up.

436
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,540
Have you decided?

437
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,040
Okay. I'll give him to you.

438
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,180
You hideous merman. How dare you sabotage my plan?

439
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Never underestimate your opponent.

440
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,140
You are indeed a bunch of mean and crafty guys.

441
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,240
So are you.

442
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,859
Zhu Ling, at the beginning, you had no intention of exchanging with us.

443
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:38,880
You did not bring my father king, did you?

444
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,800
So what?

445
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,060
A bargaining chip like the Fox King won't be brought out so easily.

446
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,540
Besides, you're a bunch of losers.

447
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,879
Who are you to make a deal with me?

448
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,299
If you understand the situation, surrender.

449
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:53,800
I can allow you to suffer less.

450
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,660
Stop nagging. Just kill him.

451
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,080
You?

452
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,680
I'll kill you all here today.

453
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,640
I knew you'd make an ambush.

454
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,260
The tower has no other benefits

455
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,620
but enough space to hold people.

456
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,900
These are all elites of Lingshuang Pavilion.

457
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,920
You won't get away this time.

458
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,200
Good job.

459
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,300
Shunde.

460
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,167
Fairy.

461
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,960
It's been a long time, Merman.

462
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,360
Welcome, Fairy Shunde.

463
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,600
Fairy, you came to the North Abyss.

464
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,000
It's an honor for Lingshuang Pavilion.

465
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,680
Today, I will beat them at their own game and arrest all the offenders.

466
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,220
I was wondering why the operation went so smoothly.

467
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,980
It turns out that your spirit shocks them.

468
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,460
All right, good job. I have my own reward.

469
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,980
Yes, Madam.

470
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,180
Merman, where's that Kong Ming?

471
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,080
Didn't you go together all the way and never give up each other?

472
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,380
Could it be that he thinks you are in trouble and escaped halfway?

473
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,100
If you had known today, why did you act like that?

474
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,540
Isn't it good to be my attendant?

475
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,860
You insisted to disobey me.

476
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,300
In this case, I might as well ruin you.

477
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,860
Zhu Ling, drag him over here.

478
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,504
Yes.

479
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,280
Do you want to resist?

480
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,107
Who are you?

481
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,720
You juniors studied the formations I developed day and night.

482
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,220
And you ask who I am.

483
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,560
There is a kind of turtle in the sea.

484
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,000
While hunting, it takes a long time to store power.

485
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,280
But the chance to attack is only once.

486
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,000
If it fails, it will starve to death.

487
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,860
What are you talking about?

488
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,440
Everyone else hunts in the dark.

489
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,980
But they prefer to be in the light.

490
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,320
When there's light, the prey thinks it has a clear view and is sure to win.

491
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,080
But they don't know that where there is light, there is shadow.

492
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,840
The turtle's tail is hidden in the shadows, waiting for a chance.

493
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,380
What do you mean?

494
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,180
For today's fight, the elite force of Lingshuang Pavilion all came out.

495
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,720
So, right now, the internal defense of Lingshuang Pavilion must be empty.

496
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,440
War allows deceit.

497
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,920
This time, you're the prey.

498
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,540
Fairy. Master. Lingshuang Pavilion sent warnings.

499
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,120
Shut up, I can hear that.

500
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,920
This is the Immortal Capturing Formation

501
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,800
that Kong Ming especially drew for today.

502
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,760
It's not for ordinary people.

503
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,060
Lingshuang Pavilion is the last point required for the completion of this formation.

504
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,700
Zhu Ling, thank you for taking all the elite forces out.

505
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,580
So that Kong Ming can enter the unguarded area.

506
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,700
Fairy, I...

507
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,720
Rubbish. You're all rubbish.

508
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,620
So, today, you're not here to exchange for the Fox King.

509
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,840
What you want is the whole Lingshuang Pavilion, the whole North Abyss.

510
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,360
I'll kill you!

511
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,887
Fairy.

512
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:16,480
Prince Chang Yi, our plan really worked.

513
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,120
Come on, take them down.

514
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,127
Yes. Let's go!

515
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,540
I want one more thing today.

516
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,660
I want you dead.

517
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,215
Where's my father?

518
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,103
Tell me. Or I'll kill you.

519
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:50,040
When you killed my father and blocked the East Sea,

520
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,080
you never thought this would happen. Right?

521
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,800
You can't kill me.

522
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,200
I still have Ji Yunhe.

523
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,860
If you kill me, Master will never let her go.

524
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,420
Ji Yunhe tried to kill me and lied to me.

525
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,300
I can't wait to kill her.

526
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,080
Don't even try to threaten me with her.

527
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,380
You hate her?

528
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,900
You hate her!

529
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,960
That's the funniest joke I've ever heard.

530
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,520
What do you mean?

531
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,160
Guess it. I won't tell you.

532
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,280
I love to see you suffering without getting an answer.

533
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,180
But she's really annoying.

534
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,880
No matter how I tortured her, she laughed all the time.

535
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,320
I'd love to see, if I skin her,

536
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,860
whether she can laugh or not.

537
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,800
Ji Yunhe's life is mine.

538
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm the only one who can torture and kill her.

539
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You have no right to do that.

540
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,040
Even if you're capable of anything,

541
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,820
don't forget that I have the spirit elixirs of your prisoners.

542
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,840
If you make a move, I will destroy them immediately.

543
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,340
I'll make them all die with me.

544
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,220
When danger comes suddenly,

545
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,840
you always unconsciously protect the things you care about most right now.

546
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,920
You are no exception.

547
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,500
Young Lord, it's time.

548
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,380
Follow my order.

549
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,640
Assemble, Fox Clan. Kill Zhu Ling. Eliminate Shunde.

550
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,380
Save the Fox King. Protect the North Abyss.

551
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,520
Kill Zhu Ling. Eliminate Shunde.

552
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,840
Save the Fox King. Protect the North Abyss.

553

557
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,780
Retreat. Retreat quickly!
