Fairy Shunde keeps picking quarrels outside.

14
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,600
I can't believe you're here discussing this book with me leisurely.

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,300
Besides, this isn't the study room.

16
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,020
No one can harm Ru Ling.

17
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,000
Have you finished the book?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,480
Now you're available, shall we exchange our views?

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,860
Bring it on.

20
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,380
The first line on page one.

21
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,060
The author wants to leave for a mysterious place.

22
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,500
Where is this place?

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,460
It's right here.

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,920
In "Commentary on Tiannan,"

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,180
the author wrote down a dream about traveling in Tiannan.

26
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,759
Inside this book are the natural beauty and ordinary life around.

27
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,240
What the author really indicated was love and peace in general, which the author yearned for.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,580
But the annotations got it all wrong.

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,420
The annotations say this is a pure record

30
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,860
of the author's travel experience with a man by her side in her dream.

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,860
Even to the end of the heroin's life, she's reluctant to wake up.

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,600
Because in real life, a peaceful and harmonious life together is impossible.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,660
I don't think that's correct.

34
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,940
How's that so?

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,100
After reading this book, I'm touched by her great love and care for the world.

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,080
I can feel that she lived a free and easy life.

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,260
Whoever wrote the annotation, only focused on the personal intimacy between the author and the anonymous man.

38
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,920
So what?

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,200
Do we have to praise the great love for Heaven and Earth?

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,620
What's wrong with intimacy?

41
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,240
It's not like that.

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,420
I'm talking about the fact that the annotator utterly misinterprets the author.

43
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,000
He's imposing his intention on the content.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,200
We shall annotate following the author's intention.

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I can't help but ask...

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,340
Although these books comment on many subjects,

47
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,200
they are nothing more than travel notes and stories.

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,300
You study these books every day. As Immortal Master, wouldn't that be too superficial?

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,260
Or is it that the person who wrote this book is the person who Immortal Master is obsessed with?

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,540
It is by her.

51
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,180
I transcribed the book and annotated it.

52
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,280
<i>He even transcribed it for fear that the original copy would be damaged.</i>

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,320
So, the annotations are your feeling toward her.

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,280
Since you care so much about her, why did you let her go?

55
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,000
Otherwise, why do you think I want to give this world a funeral?

56
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,320
This lady had a passion for life and great love for the common people.

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,463
But you...

58
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:23,112
Ru Ling!

59
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,160
Blue Feather Phoenix?

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,040
Well done, Luo Luo!

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Encyclopedia?

62
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,200
Is Immortal Master's secret lover related to Thousand Flower Valley?

63
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,960
Master. Master! Help me!

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,800
Blue Feather Phoenix? Even the Ten Directions Formation can't hold you now.

65
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,180
I was wondering about this Immortal Master

66
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,280
who kept disturbing the order with monstrous power.

67
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Turns out, it's you, Ning Qing, junior fellow apprentice.

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,180
Isn't the lesson 1,000 years ago enough to make you reflect on yourself?

69
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,800
You should have concealed your identity and stopped making trouble.

70
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
Since you are an old acquaintance,

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,440
you should be aware of my character.

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,500
I'll do whatever I want. So what?

73
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,300
I don't care about others.

74
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,140
But you shouldn't have gone for her.

75
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,400
Master, she hurt me badly. Kill her for me!

76
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,260
Enough talking.

77
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,400
I should have guessed you were behind this upon seeing her face.

78
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,540
You made it up in memory of her?

79
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,220
What you're doing now is pathetic.

80
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,060
If she were still alive, she'd have stopped you.

81
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,120
But she's gone!

82
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,880
I'm the one left behind.

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm carrying on for her.

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,580
I will have the entire world to join this memorial ceremony.

85
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,260
She was one of a kind.

86
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,920
A lady with great love for the world.

87
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,640
However, you're such a cruel bigot.

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,160
She loved the world, so what?

89
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,100
It is what she loved that took her life!

90
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,080
All in all, what you're doing now is to vent your resentment.

91
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,760
Disturbing the order like this, you're running counter to her long-cherished wish.

92
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,880
Today, I must teach you a lesson for her!

93
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,800
Qing Ji showed up? And she's fighting with Immortal Master?

94
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,100
Right. According to our intelligence, Shunde is in a battle with North Abyss.

95
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,180
It has lasted for days. They are evenly matched.

96
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,700
But then, Qing Ji showed up and wounded Shunde.

97
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,380
That's what brings Immortal Master there.

98
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,920
Qing Ji is holding Immortal Master up.

99
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,040
He's outside his mansion now.

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,320
Where's the merman?

101
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,800
He keeps heading south. Now, he's approaching Lutai Mountain.

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,780
The chaos on Lutai Mountain is an opportunity for our great cause.

103
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,020
Do you really want to get into this mess now?

104
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,580
Yunhe is still there. I promised to rescue her.

105
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,460
Notify Qu Xiaoxing to barricade Thousand Flower Valley.

106
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,500
Where are you going?

107
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,140
- Lutai Mountain.
- I'll go with you.

108
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,300
<i>[Immortal Fairy's Hall]</i>

109
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,380
At your service, Immortal Fairy.

110
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,860
Any news on Master?

111
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,080
We only know that he's still in North Abyss.

112
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,280
We don't know the details for now.

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,080
You're still suffering from injury. Please be careful.

114
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,660
Master is strong and mighty.

115
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,460
He always defeats his enemies with one strike. He's never been away for such a long time.

116
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,760
Don't worry, Immortal Fairy. Immortal Master will surely defeat Blue Feather Phoenix.

117
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm not worried at all!

118
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,240
Master is much more powerful than that pitiful bird.

119
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,440
She's asking for death.

120
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,180
Sorry, it's my mistake.

121
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,980
In a few days, it will be Master's birthday.

122
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,600
Give out my order.

123
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
They must pay extra careful attention with the preparation.

124
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,140
I must make sure that he gets the best once he returns.

125
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,490
Yes, Immortal Fairy.

126
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,840
<i>[Immortal Fairy Hall]</i>

127
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,960
<i>The seal is getting weaker.</i>

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,540
<i>I must send out Heavenly Emperor's token as soon as possible.</i>

129
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,040
Almost there.

130
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,400
Ji Yunhe! I was worried about you!

131
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,060
Luo Luo, how did you get in?

132
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,240
Let me take a look.

133
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
Sanyue, she sent me in.

134
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,260
Li Shu isn't dead.

135
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,060
They helped me persuade Blue Feather Phoenix, who lured Immortal Master away.

136
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,620
That's why the seal is weakened.

137
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,320
Li Shu is alive! Great!

138
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,540
That's not the priority now.

139
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,990
Chang Yi is leading the people of North Abyss here.

140
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,620
They're about to arrive at Lutai Mountain.

141
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,980
Once they rescue the fellow Immortals who are imprisoned here, you can join them and head back to the North Abyss.

142
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,540
By that time, you can start a new life with Chang Yi.

143
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,620
It's not that simple.

144
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,020
I just found out that Immortal Master is behind all this.

145
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,120
His purpose is to disturb the peace of the world.

146
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,260
I'm afraid Chang Yi will be used.

147
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,280
I'm afraid it's all a part of Immortal Master's plan.

148
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,100
Ji Yunhe, why are you always thinking in a strange way?

149
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,640
Escape is always a good thing. Stop overthinking.

150
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,120
I've promised Heavenly Emperor to stop Immortal Master.

151
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,100
I must live up to my word.

152
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,760
Fine. I belong to you. I will do as you say.

153
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,460
What's your plan?

154
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,440
There's something suspicious here.

155
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,320
Heavenly Emperor promised me that he would forgive the Immortals who have sinned.

156
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,480
As long as we get everyone out first

157
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,100
then there would be no need for Chang Yi to attack the mansion.

158
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,960
We can stop the war.

159
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,260
Heavenly Emperor cannot show himself for now.

160
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,940
This is his token.

161
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,960
See if you can find a chance and have Senior Xue take them out.

162
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,600
Once they get out, ask them to head north and join Chang Yi.

163
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,820
What about you?

164
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,320
The seal is weakened now. You should go.

165
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,220
I cannot get away now.

166
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,100
Once I'm gone, Shunde will tighten security and tell Immortal Master.

167
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,580
Once he gets back, it will all be in vain.

168
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,160
I'll stay here first.

169
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,200
Once you escape from the prison, I will find my way out.

170
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,120
We can meet at the foot of Lutai Mountain.

171
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,360
It's too dangerous.

172
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,960
We must leave together. I won't leave you behind.

173
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,980
Luo Luo, not only are the North Abyss and Heavenly Emperor involved but the peace of the entire world.

174
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,320
You have a heavy responsibility.

175
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,940
You must get them out safe and sound.

176
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,520
You're always like this.

177
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,860
Luo Luo, what worries me the most is that our team might be completely annihilated.

178
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,940
The chance is higher if we move separately.

179
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,260
Believe me. I will get out for sure.

180
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,980
You must promise me that you'll make it out safe and sound.

181
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,362
I promise.

182
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,880
Please be safe.

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
<i>[Immortal Master Mansion]</i>

184
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,640
Greetings, Immortal.

185
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,580
So as to deter the rebels,

186
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,780
Heavenly Emperor gave out the order to bring the prisoners from Congji Jail to Heavenly Palace.

187
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,980
That's a grand task. Why didn't we get any notification?

188
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,060
Instead, they send only a guard to transmit it.

189
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,940
I used to be on duty at Heavenly Palace before getting into Immortal Master Mansion.

190
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,200
I know the people there.

191
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,620
Your face doesn't look familiar.

192
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,580
It's been a long time since you left.

193
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,240
I'm a new recruit.

194
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,420
That's normal.

195
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,080
I might be strange to you.

196
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,160
But I'm sure you recognize Heavenly Emperor's token.

197
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,560
It's his order. I dare not to ask more.

198
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,000
If you still doubt it, we may suspend the task for now.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,660
I'll report it to Heavenly Emperor and have him talk to you in person.

200
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,180
However, if Immortal Master asks about it,

201
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,880
it's solely your problem.

202
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,628
Hold on.

203
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,620
Since it's the order of Heavenly Emperor, we will carry it out.

204
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,240
However, I shall escort you to the foot of Lutai Mountain

205
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,280
in case of an escape.

206
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,080
Thank you for your trouble.

207
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,540
<i>[Congji Jail]</i>

208
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,460
Thank you for the escort, Immortal.

209
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,480
Hold on.

210
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,800
What's the matter, Immortal?

211
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,760
After thinking about it, now that Immortal Master isn't around,

212
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,340
we shall see you off all the way to the Heavenly Palace.

213
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,920
It's not that we doubt you.

214
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,040
We can never be too careful.

215
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,550
Sure.

216
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,280
<i>It's my spirit elixir!</i>

217
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,220
<i>It's back! The elixir!</i>

218
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,180
<i>Great! Our spirit elixirs! They're back!</i>

219
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,380
This is urgent. Please listen to me.

220
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,420
There's something wrong with Congji Jail. Your lives would have been in danger if you had stayed there longer.

221
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,600
That's why Yunhe sent me here to rescue you.

222
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,820
She said you may head for North Abyss and settle down, only on one condition.

223
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,700
You must not do evil. Reform yourself and live by the law.

224
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,400
You'll have Heavenly Emperor's protection.

225
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,660
<i>- Great!
- Sure!</i>

226
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,560
Let's go. Come with me.

227
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
Through here. Come on. Keep up!

228
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,540
<i>Hurry!</i>

229
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,600
Keep going!

230
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,060
<i>Thanks!</i>

231
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,540
Why are you still here?

232
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,200
Where's Ji Yunhe? Is she out?

233
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,680
She's still inside to hold off the guards.

234
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,140
Once you leave, she will find her way out.

235
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,040
On her own?

236
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
No way!

237
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,200
It would be unethical for us to run away on our own.

238
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,480
Exactly! Ji Yunhe is a real friend.

239
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,260
We are not dishonest people.

240
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,980
Anyway, we've got our elixirs back. So is our power! Let's fight back!

241
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,380
- Right!
- Take her out!

242
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,440
Hold on! Hold on!

243
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,400
Calm down, please. I know you're not afraid.

244
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,080
But Yunhe said that it's a matter of peace for the entire world.

245
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,240
Besides, the chance is higher if we split up.

246
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,120
Going back now would interfere with her plan. It will make the situation worse. Right?

247
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,780
So, don't worry. Yunhe is good.

248
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,780
She knows what she's doing.

249
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,360
You should trust her just like I do.

250
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,540
Stick to her plan. Leave. Just go.

251
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,500
All right. I believe in her.

252
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,860
Please transfer it to her, I owe her my life.

253
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,820
If we meet again,

254
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,760
I will do everything to repay her.

255
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,160
Okay!

256
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,560
Whenever you need help, just send me a message.

257
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,000
I promise to show up and help you.

258
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,700
Thank you.

259
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,120
Please tell Yunhe, my heart is always for her.

260
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,080
Got it! See?

261
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,300
- You should leave quickly.
-Thank you.

262
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,580
You're only one of many admirers.

263
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,900
Excuse me. Please send our gratitude to her.

264
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,407
Sure.

265
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,440
Head north and keep going.

266
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,660
Sanyue!

267
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,000
How was I?

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,060
I never knew helping others would feel so great.

269
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,840
No wonder Yunhe always helps others.

270
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,860
Yunhe has such a charming character.

271
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,600
They're all willing to listen to her.

272
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
Good for her.

273
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,560
Chang Yi is here.

274
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,033
♫ <i>Heaven is silent, all is quiet</i> ♫

275
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:32,940
♫ <i>Yourself in the mirror</i> ♫

276
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,420
<i>Yunhe, you should be like the wind; free and easy,</i>

277
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,260
<i>Living an unconstrained life.</i>

278
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,680
<i>Just like the scenery here, I like you, too.</i>

279
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,380
Chang Yi.

280
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,300
You now lead an entire army.

281
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,140
Why do you often stay on your own?

282
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,360
I thought you were more amiable before.

283
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,800
You've been so aloof.

284
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,960
I'd say you should...

285
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,667
Who's there?

286
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,540
Please, don't kill me.

287
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,260
You look familiar.

288
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,760
Have we met before?

289
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,480
I'm only average-looking.

290
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,620
You'll see people like me every day.

291
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,300
You must be mistaken.

292
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,160
I remember!

293
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
You were captured by Thousand Flower Valley!

294
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,800
You're the farting ferret who stalks other girls.

295
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,200
It's not like that.

296
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,280
I used to be self-sentimental and chased girls.

297
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
But now, Yunhe is my only love.

298
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,400
I won't even bother looking at other girls.

299
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,960
Ji Yunhe?

300
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,440
That's my girl. Do you know her?

301
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,420
Where is she?

302
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,480
She... She set us free.

303
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,400
But she's still inside Congji Jail, holding the guards off.

304
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,180
- Set you free?
- Right.

305
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,560
Even those people from the North Abyss, captured by Zhu Ling?

306
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
That's right.

307
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,500
Where are you heading?

308
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,240
<i>- Immortal Master Mansion.</i>
- You have the entire army.

309
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,860
Why are you taking action on your own?

310
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,800
Who is it?

311
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,660
How dare she trick us!

312
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,700
She held the Heavenly Emperor's token. I thought...

313
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,560
Foolish!

314
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,180
Ru Jun used to be obedient and high in the Heavenly Palace.

315
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,220
How is that possible that he knows the prisoners?

316
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,780
Let alone freeing them.

317
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,660
You useless fool! Can't you tell?

318
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,160
It's my fault.

319
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,720
Immortal Fairy, it occurs to me that they used scale powder to knock us out.

320
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,580
Scale powder?

321
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,460
Could it be Phantom Butterfly from the Nanhai Sea?

322
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,840
Ji Yunhe's servant is a butterfly, too.

323
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,720
It's her again!

324
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,220
This time, Master is away.

325
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,840
She cannot escape her death!

326
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,560
<i>Didn't you see what happened?</i>

327
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,160
<i>Stop standing here!</i>

328
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,360
<i>- Go capture the escaped prisoners!
- Yes, sir.</i>

329
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,620
They've made it.

330
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,220
Now, it's my turn.

331
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,100
Even at this critical moment, you still think of me.

332
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,560
How flattered I am!

333
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,920
The chaos here is all your fault!

334
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,380
I must kill you to vent my anger!

335
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,880
Don't you understand who the one to blame for what happened is?

336
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,640
All I know is I will take your life myself!

337
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,080
Only by respecting others, will they respect you.

338
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,920
The same works for love.

339
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,440
You must learn to share your love in exchange for their esteem.

340
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,620
Save me the lecture.

341
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:25,320
Whoever it is, no one is born to be trampled on by you!

342
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,180
Kill her for me!

343
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,280
<i>By the way, I have a request for you.</i>

344
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,340
<i>Don't harm my sister.</i>

345
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,540
I made a promise.

346
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,800
If you stop right now, I will spare your life.

347
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,640
Impenitent as you always are.

348
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Do you still remember our bet?

349
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,360
If you can't pacify North Abyss, I will chop off your limbs!

350
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,940
What happened today results from your selfishness and your sin.

351
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,560
It's time to end it.

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
My face...

353
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,200
My face!

354
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,900
No!

355
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,600
Ji... Ji Yunhe! I'll kill you!

356
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,900
Big-tailed Fish.

357
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,800
It's been a long time.

358
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,500
Ji Yunhe, what have you gottem yourself into?

359
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,400
You're right.

360
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,300
Just as you see.

361
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,000
Merman!

362
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,300
Guards! Guards!

363
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,200
The merman has broken in!

364
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,000
Take them down!

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,700
Guards!

366
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,600
You dirty slave!

367
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,100
Let go of me!

368
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,900
Slave!

369
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,500
Sorry. I can hardly move.

370
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,600
Let me go! You palace slave!

371
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,900
I said Ji Yunhe's life is mine alone.

372
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,700
You can't kill me.

373
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,400
I'm the Immortal Fairy!

374
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
I am the master of all living beings!

375
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
The master of all living beings?

376
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,900
Bloody chaos, wars, and bloodshed are what you've done.

377
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,800
I saved your life in the stormy sea.

378
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,000
Now, it's time for me to take it back.

379
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,400
Guards!

380
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,300
Merman, it's you.

381
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,400
Merman?

382
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Is that the merman who marched from the North Abyss to here?

383
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,800
Immortal Chengyu.

384
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
This is my duty, I'm sorry.

385
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,000
This is from your senior fellow apprentice. Where is he?

386
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,800
Kong Ming asked me to tell you.

387
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,200
He wants you to find your own path and stop blind loyalty.

388
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,200
- Go after him!
- No need for that.

389
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
We must save Immortal Fairy first. Hurry up.

390
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,900
Yes, Sir.

391
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,800
What's wrong, Master?

392
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
We should hurry up to Immortal Master Mansion.

393
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,800
It's too late.

394
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,400
Yunhe left with the merman one more time.

395
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,600
- I'll send guards after them.
- Don't bother.

396
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
But she's the reason why we're rushing to the mansion

397
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,400
in the middle of the chaos.

398
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,800
We might catch up with them if we set off now.

399
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,200
How unpredictable.

400
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,600
In such a critical time, we must be careful not to make mistakes.

401
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,500
Or it would bring a catastrophe to Thousand Flower Valley.

402
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,900
Master, I just found out that Congji Jail is on fire.

403
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,700
Fairy Shunde is in danger.

404
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,500
To Immortal Master Mansion. Save Fairy Shunde's life at all costs.

405
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,300
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

406
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,400
Leader Xue, Yunhe told us to wait for her here.

407
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,200
Why hasn't she shown up?

408
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,000
Is she in danger?

409
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,100
Shall we go for her?

410
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,200
No need for that. Chang Yi has rescued her.

411
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,100
For real? Great!

412
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,400
Once she's out from there, she'll be free forever.

413
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,500
Right! They must be heading to the encampment.

414
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Let's go after her.

415
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
What does Chang Yi want?

416
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,700
We're soon to attack Immortal Master Mansion.

417
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,800
Why did he ask us to stop right now?

418
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Your Majesty, Immortal Master Mansion is on fire.

419
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Our informant saw Chang Yi left there with a Spiritual Master.

420
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,600
A Spiritual Master trapped there?

421
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,100
Could it be Ji Yunhe who hurt him before?

422
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,800
What else did you get?

423
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,800
All our fellow Immortals imprisoned have escaped from there.

424
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
They're heading to the North Abyss.

425
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,200
Father.

426
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,800
It's a good thing that they made it out.

427
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,500
It's just that Blue Feather Phoenix may have lured Immortal Master away this time.

428
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,400
He won't fall for it the next time.

429
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,100
Now that he's absent, we shall seize the chance to get into the mansion

430
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,600
and take down Fairy Shunde.

431
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,200
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

432
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,000
Master.

433
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,700
Immortal Chengyu, we just got the news. We're here to help you out.

434
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,400
Thanks, Master Lin.

435
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,200
- Please get Immortal Fairy out from here.
- Okay.

436
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,500
Stay here and help Immortal Chengyu.

437
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,000
You still remember this place.

438
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,000
Are you here to save me?

439
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,300
No. I'm here for revenge.

440
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,700
Chang Yi, actually, I...

441
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Why do you have elixir in your body?

442
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Why did Immortal Master imprison you?

443
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,100
Lin Canglan and Immortal Master used me as a trial.

444
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,600
I'm a monster already.

445
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,200
Just as expected,

446
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,400
the great power inside me is consuming me.

447
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,800
Looks like I'm going to die soon.

448
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,900
Uncle, it's Shunde.

449
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,200
They are from Thousand Flower Valley!

450
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Spiritual Masters again! Let me kill them.

451
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,000
No! We're going after Shunde.

452
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,800
There's no need to expand the conflict.

453
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,300
Fox King Qing Xuan, you're Qing Shu's elder brother.

454
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,000
There is a tie between our clan and Thousand Flower Valley.

455
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm not going after you.

456
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,700
Leave Fairy Shunde to us and you may leave.

457
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,800
I cannot do that.

458
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Don't you understand what she's committed?

459
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,200
Why are you saving her?

460
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
I'm not doing this for her.

461
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,800
Capturing her isn't enough to solve the problem.

462
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,200
She's Immortal Master's apprentice.

463
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,800
If you take her, Immortal Master will go after you.

464
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,600
You'd better leave now.

465
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,300
Enough talking! You're on the same boat.

466
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,200
Uncle, we've suffered from her for years.

467
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,800
The time has come.

468
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,600
We should kill him now that he's in the way!

469
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,800
I'm asking you this one more time.

470
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Will you hand over Fairy Shunde?

471
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,700
No way.

472
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,600
All right.

473
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,200
Then I have no other option.

474
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,800
Attack!

475
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
Immortal Master!

476
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,100
It's you!

477
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,400
You indulged Shunde's wrongdoings.

478
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,300
Recently, I worked out a new formation.

479
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,200
You're here just in time.

480
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Would you like to see that?

481
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,000
It's going for our elixirs!

482
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,600
Prepare!

483
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,800
Pitiful clan. You're asking for death.

484
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,100
<i>Ning Qing, your supremacy ends here!</i>

485
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,200
<i>You have no right to manipulate our lives!</i>

486
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,400
<i>I will make you pay for what you've done</i>

487
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,700
<i>even at the cost of my life!</i>

488
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,800
<i>This is for all living creatures!</i>

489
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,700
Yao, it's my decision.

490
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,800
I will take the outcome on my own!

491
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,300
Ask Chang Yi to reign the North Abyss for me.

492
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,000
If he takes good care of you,

493
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,400
I can die without regret!

494
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,000
No, Father!

495
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,200
Don't you ever trample on our dignity and honor!

496
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Father!

497
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Please don't!

498
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,900
Father!

499
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Qing Xuan and his tribe have committed treason.

500
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
They've escaped to the North Abyss.

501
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,700
Wipe them all out at all cost.

502
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,200
<i>Yes, Master!</i>

503
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,900
Don't you move!

504
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,400
- Heavenly Emperor.
- Send Immortal Fairy back and get her treated.

505
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

506
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,800
Use the best medicine we can get!

507
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,400
Yes, Master.

508
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,000
On my mark, go after them!

509
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,200
<i>- Yes, Master.</i>
- Stop right there!

510
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,000
Didn't you hear His Majesty?

511
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,400
His Majesty commanded you to stop. How dare you disobey him?

512
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,000
If you're deaf, I can help you learn!

513
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,400
They are traitors. I can't believe you're forgiving them.

514
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,000
Whether they're traitors or they were forced to launch the attack,

515
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,300
you know it clearly.

516
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,000
If it wasn't for your indulgence and support,

517
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,200
it wouldn't have ended up like this.

518
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,600
You are accountable for what has happened.

519
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,800
I shall see what to do with them.

520
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,600
What you should do now is to reflect.

521
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,200
Don't start a fight again.

522
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
What if I insist on intervening,

523
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
can Your Majesty stop me?

524
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,000
Mind your language.

525
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,300
Otherwise, we'll treat you as a traitor.

526
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,800
I live by the rules and stick to them strictly.

527
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,600
But Your Majesty is indulging their treason,

528
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
I cannot follow your orders.

529
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
What will you do?

530
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,300
How dare you!

531
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Turning the facts upside down. Enough for the act!

532
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,600
What if I insist you carry it out?

533
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,600
It's the late emperor's token!

534
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,200
Father left it for me.

535
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
The treasure that commands all the troops.

536
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,600
It finally comes to me!

537
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,500
Congratulations.

538
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,600
The token has recognized me.

539
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,200
It means Father has agreed with my decision.

540
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,600
Ning Qing, are you still reluctant to carry it out?

541
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,500
Are you disobeying the late emperor now?

542
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,100
I dare not.

543
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,800
At your command.

544
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,400
<i>The Spirit Token recognized him!</i>

545
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,000
<i>Why? How did that happen?</i>

546
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,200
<i>No one can get in the way.</i>

547
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,000
<i>I will make these sinned officials pay the price!</i>

548
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,800
<i>Get the seal removed and restore my form!</i>

549
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,000
<i>The crown should be mine!</i>

550
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,600
Chang Yi, you're here for revenge.

551
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,400
Is it because I stabbed you in the chest?

552
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,000
If that's so, since I'm dying soon,

553
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,700
you should cheer for my death.

554
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Why are you mad?

555
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,400
Why are you saving me with your pearl?

556
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,200
Ji Yunhe, at first, Thousand Flower Valley manipulated your life.

557
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,000
A while ago, Immortal Master Mansion dominated you.

558
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But from now on,you owe your life to me.

559
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,500
You're not allowed to die without my permission.

560
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,600
You are domineering now.

561
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,000
That's good. They cannot harm you this way.

562
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,200
Still, I must correct you.

563
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,500
My life has always belonged to myself.

564
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,000
Whether in the past, now, or in the future.

565
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Even you have no say in it.

566
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,800
Whatever your idea is,

567
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,600
I won't let you die easily.

568
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,400
Chang Yi,

569
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,400
do I look ugly right now?

570
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,600
Is it monstrous?

571
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,000
What frightens me the most is your mind.

572
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,900
Chang Yi, I have no request for you but one.

573
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,400
If your aim is achieved already,

574
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,300
please ask your troops to withdraw.

575
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,200
Don't fall for Immortal Master's trick.

576
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,000
That is not up to you.

577
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,200
Go back to the North Abyss with me.

578
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,800
I haven't finished my mission. Not now...

579
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Ji Yunhe.

580
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,800
I don't think you're clearheaded enough.

581
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
It is not up to you.

582
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,000
I told you. I own my life.

583
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,500
It is my decision to make.

584
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,400
Didn't you hear me?

585
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,700
Your life belongs to me now.

586
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,900
<i>After the myriad of hardships,</i>

587
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,800
<i>Chang Yi finally rescued Yunhe from the abyss of misery</i>

588
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,400
<i>and brought her to the North Abyss she yearned for.</i>

589
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,800
<i>But this wasn't freedom.</i>

590
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,000
<i>This time, Lin Canglan's trial is gone.</i>

591
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,600
<i>Shunde's torture has ended.</i>

592
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:27,000
<i>Chang Yi will make her pay for the lies she told.</i>
