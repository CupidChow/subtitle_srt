00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,320
If you lose, I will cut an inch of your flesh every day,

14
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,600
and cut you into nothing.

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,760
If you're going to make a bet, you need to be equally sincere.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,500
If you lose, I'll do the same to you.

17
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,420
Let's wait and see.

18
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,980
Give up. I won't let you hurt her.

19
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,380
Well, you figured it out.

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,440
You dare to attack Ru Ling at Immortal Master Mansion,

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,580
do you really think I won't kill you?

22
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,540
Even if I don't kill her, only time as an Immortal will kill her.

23
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,900
Can you even go against destiny?

24
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,980
No one can kill her.

25
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,680
You can't. Time can't.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,440
Even destiny can't.

27
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,480
Do you love her that much?

28
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,220
What exactly do you love about her?

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,840
Her face.

30
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,080
I really didn't expect that an Immortal Master would be so superficial.

31
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,480
Sorry for my disrespect.

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,480
So, the portrait in your studio is not her.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,260
Then who is she?

34
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,780
Is she your lover?

35
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,980
Why isn't she with you?

36
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,080
Is the chaos in the world all because of her?

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,420
You know too much.

38
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,460
All you need to know is that you can't hurt Ru Ling again.

39
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,420
I won't lose

40
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,620
any trace of her in this world.

41
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,700
No one can take her away from me again.

42
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,460
Even just a face like hers?

43
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,040
Yes.

44
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,640
By the way, there is one more thing I should perhaps remind you about.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,860
Though you have practiced Hidden Soul Needle

46
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,100
and can control your spiritual power, it doesn't mean that everything is fine.

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,340
Forcibly refining dual veins violates the law of Heaven and Earth.

48
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,560
This law is very simple.

49
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,400
How much you gain, how much you will lose.

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,800
Fair, but often cruel.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,280
<i>Do you know how precious time is?</i>

52
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,700
<i>You keep me here day after day, wasting so much of my youth.</i>

53
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,040
<i>I told you that I don't care about Thousand Flower Valley anymore. All I care about is Yunhe.</i>

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,580
<i>Just let me out.</i>

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,760
<i>Lin Haoqing. No, Master Lin.</i>

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,540
<i>I promise I won't cause you any more trouble.</i>

57
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,400
<i>I'll cooperate with you all, okay?</i>

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,760
<i>I…</i>

59
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,200
No need.

60
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,020
The conflict between Shunde and North Abyss is getting worse.

61
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,320
How long can the peace of Thousand Flower Valley last?

62
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,940
The disciples sent before have not returned yet.

63
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,520
I'm afraid they were detained.

64
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,800
What's your plan? Are you going to save them?

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,300
Of course. But we can't do it rashly.

66
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,960
Fortunately, the Merman Clan are not indiscriminate killers.

67
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,040
What I am most worried about is the Frost on my disciples.

68
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,660
Luckily, they have taken the antidote before.

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,220
If there is no accident, they can still last for a while.

70
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,890
We need to save them before the Frost breaks out again.

71
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,040
What's this?

72
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,060
I found these in the library.

73
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,340
I saw that they were related to meridians and bones, so I brought them back.

74
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,650
I don't know if it's good for studying Frost.

75
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,480
Heavenly King.

76
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,080
Master, you are here.

77
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,640
Are you here thinking about the matter between Fairy Shunde and North Abyss?

78
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,440
When my father and mother died, I was just a wisp of spirit,

79
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,920
which was kept inside the Bodhi tree and could not come out.

80
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,320
It was my sister who took care of me day and night and talked with me.

81
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,500
It was she who told me the change of the world, the joys and sorrows of all beings.

82
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,420
At that time, she was compassionate,

83
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,360
and would cry for the sufferings of the world, and sigh for the impermanence of life.

84
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,540
But how could she become like this now?

85
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,680
It's all my fault.

86
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,740
Everything is a cycle of cause and effect.

87
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,500
Misfortunes and blessings cannot be judged in a word.

88
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,620
Maybe it's fate.

89
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,280
Maybe it's the experience that you must go through.

90
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,200
Sister and I are now strange,

91
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,900
and she relies on the tolerance of Immortal Master, so she doesn't listen to my advice at all.

92
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,560
But those in the North Abyss are innocent after all.

93
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,933
And I don't want to have any more conflicts.

94
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,840
What is the key to breaking the deadlock?

95
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,720
<i>Why hasn't Master come to see me yet?</i>

96
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,680
<i>Did he go to see that bitch Ji Yunhe again?</i>

97
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,740
Sister mentioned a person today,

98
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,960
someone called Ji Yunhe.

99
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,120
Is she the one who hurt my sister on the cliff before?

100
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,940
- Yes.
- In all these years,

101
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,860
I've never seen my sister being so angry with anyone but not being able to do anything about it.

102
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,140
And I've never seen Immortal Master care about anyone other than my sister.

103
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,380
This Ji Yunhe seems to be an exception.

104
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,220
Where is she now?

105
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,599
<i>Chang Yi,</i>

106
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,700
<i>what happens if a merman loses his mate?</i>

107
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,140
<i>Can he find another mate?</i>

108
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,120
<i>We only love one person in our life, until the end of our lives.</i>

109
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,732
<i>Chang Yi, have you found the person you want to die with?</i>

110
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,340
Ji Yunhe of Thousand Flower Valley.

111
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,160
I've heard about you before.

112
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,960
Are you the one who made my sister angry?

113
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,900
Your Heavenly King has come to visit me, sorry for not welcoming you.

114
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,480
But I've never met you before.

115
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,580
Why are you here?

116
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,660
I heard that you released the merman and hurt my sister,

117
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,880
but Immortal Master protected you, regardless of my sister's objection.

118
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,700
In all these years, except for my sister,

119
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,980
he has never protected anyone like this.

120
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,480
I just want to know why.

121
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,640
In fact, I also want to know.

122
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,240
I heard that Guardian Ji can train the heart.

123
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,820
Can you even control Immortal Master?

124
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,780
You really think too much of me.

125
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,000
I do have some secrets.

126
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,940
But if you want to get the weakness of Immortal Master from me,

127
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,000
I think you've come to the wrong person.

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,290
Don't talk nonsense. Don't judge my mind without permission.

129
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,100
If you say it's not, then it's not.

130
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,680
Just take it as if I guessed wrong.

131
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,600
I promised Immortal Master that I wouldn't escape or make trouble, and be at his disposal.

132
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,140
You can also guess if I am honest,

133
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,300
and whether I will be obedient.

134
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,980
You don't have to test me.

135
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,820
Then, why did you test me?

136
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,740
I've heard about you and the eldest son of the mercenary in the East China Sea.

137
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,200
I heard that you became a prisoner in order to save him,

138
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,820
but he betrayed you and chose someone else.

139
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,820
If you could choose again, would you still save him?

140
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,200
I didn't expect that you would care about such trivial matters of me.

141
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,840
I am really flattered.

142
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,600
I would still save him.

143
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,960
Because saving him was my original intention.

144
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,140
I remember someone once told me,

145
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,180
<i>No one can predict everything in the world.</i>

146
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,560
"And not everything can be measured by profit or loss."

147
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,020
<i>So if there is another time,</i>

148
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,580
"I will do the same with my heart."

149
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,160
"Just take the consequences myself."

150
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,140
Is it really that simple to do with the heart?

151
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,180
If it were so simple,

152
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,280
there wouldn't be so many people hesitating and wandering.

153
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:35,160
You are here today because you want something, but the road ahead is hard.

154
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,160
You're here to take a chance and see if there's a solution. Isn't that right?

155
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,120
You're speculating again.

156
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,040
Don't use your heart training skills on me.

157
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,460
Sometimes I've been really wronged.

158
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,120
It is obviously empathy but is said to be offensive.

159
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,460
But at this moment, you're angry.

160
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,520
Isn't it because I'm right, but you don't want to admit it?

161
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,875
You…

162
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,940
Recently, Fairy Shunde has been spoiled by Immortal Master, so she has been acting arbitrarily,

163
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,100
which has caused many Immortals to flee to North Abyss,

164
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,700
including some Spiritual Masters who are angry with Shunde's atrocities and have defected.

165
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,020
What do you think about this?

166
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,640
Chang Yi, what's your opinion?

167
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,880
I think that whoever came here in the midst of crisis,

168
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,260
there is trust in their heart for North Abyss.

169
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,860
We should accept, tolerate, and show our sincerity to them.

170
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,840
Accept the Spirit Masters. Are you kidding?

171
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,000
Aside from grudges, they defected before the battle,

172
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,200
who are either cowards or losers.

173
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,260
Mr. Kong Ming, I'm not talking about you.

174
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,900
But if you have to think so, I have no problem with it.

175
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,040
I think Chang Yi is right.

176
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,540
Only by strengthening the North Abyss

177
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,080
can we rescue those Immortal friends trapped in Immortal Master Mansion.

178
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,693
<i>Report!</i>

179
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,760
Your King, the spiritual masters of Thousand Flower Valley, who were imprisoned in No Desire Cave, have collapsed.

180
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,240
Maybe it's too cold in the cave.

181
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,780
They have frost on their bodies.

182
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,240
We have brought them to the square.

183
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,080
Your King, I'll take a look with Mr. Kong Ming.

184
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,980
It's Frost.

185
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,280
Could it be that the cold aura of the cave made the frost break out earlier?

186
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,860
Do you have the antidote?

187
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,880
It's not the antidote.

188
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,700
It's medicine I developed to delay the poisoning.

189
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Come on. Distribute these medicines.

190
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,305
Yes.

191
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,360
Mr. Kong Ming, don't you have anything to tell me?

192
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,460
Frost was developed by Lin Canglan,

193
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,220
how could you know how to suppress it?

194
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,260
It's not Lin Canglan,

195
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,180
but Immortal Master who developed it.

196
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,320
And all the frost flowers planted

197
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,540
were sent by me to Thousand Flower Valley.

198
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,360
At that time, I was the oldest disciple of Immortal Master,

199
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,160
who was ordered to go to Thousand Flower Valley regularly

200
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,540
to send the Frost flowers to the new Spiritual Masters.

201
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,840
Didn't you ask me why I fight against Immortal Master Mansion?

202
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,200
In fact, what I have done up to now is not only for the sake of righteousness,

203
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,000
but also to atone for my own sins.

204
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,580
Your Heavenly King.

205
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,200
Are you not angry anymore?

206
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,140
My sister is going out to fight again.

207
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,260
You've come to tell me what's on your mind.

208
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,660
My father's order to organize Spiritual Masters

209
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,259
is to train the sinful Immortals and evil spirits.

210
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,699
But since Immortal Master took control of the masters,

211
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,620
he blindly indulges my sister to overpower the Immortals,

212
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,240
making the situation worse and worse.

213
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,600
I used to comfort myself that

214
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,840
when my cultivation was complete, I could revive the rules of Heaven.

215
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,720
But now I don't want to wait any longer.

216
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,159
Why are you telling me this?

217
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,739
Because what you said woke me up.

218
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,459
I should act with my heart,

219
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,860
but I hesitated to back down because I was weak.

220
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,040
If I could act earlier, I might have been able to save more people.

221
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,660
It's not too late to turn back.

222
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,060
But since you told me these things,

223
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,440
I will definitely give my full support to fight against Immortal Master with you.

224
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,500
But you are under his protection.

225
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,220
Your movements are limited, but at least your life is safe.

226
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,720
If you help me fight against him,

227
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,260
aren't you afraid of dying?

228
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,300
Afraid.

229
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,700
In the past, when it comes to cherishing life, no one can compare to me.

230
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,400
But now I don't seem to be so afraid.

231
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,010
Why?

232
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,460
When there is something in your life that you want to protect more than your own life,

233
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,840
you will be fearless.

234
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,220
Since you want to cooperate with me,

235
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,440
there are some things I have to tell you.

236
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,800
What?

237
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,400
Do you know about Frost?

238
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,940
We are not drinkers.

239
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,960
When meeting a bosom friend, we can drink.

240
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,625
Bosom friend?

241
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,012
Yes,

242
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,100
you and I are both fools.

243
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,900
We can't face our hearts calmly.

244
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
But I'm much worse than you.

245
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,000
The lives of many creatures in the world

246
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,100
have become so rough because of the Frost and me.

247
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,600
You are wrong.

248
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,380
What's happening now is not because of you,

249
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,420
but Immortal Master who controls Frost,

250
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,720
and those conspiracy ambitions.

251
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,860
The Kong Ming I know is strong, decisive,

252
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,460
brave, and in control of the big picture.

253
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,820
Without you, there would be no North Abyss today.

254
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,980
Now that we are all together in North Abyss.

255
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,040
everything is progressing step by step.

256
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,640
Soon we will make those conspiracies, tyranny,

257
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,960
and betrayal pay for it.

258
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,320
Don't be late for tomorrow's meeting.

259
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,523
Bosom friend.

260
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Immortal Master uses such a vicious method to control Thousand Flower Valley.

261
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,040
No. I'm going to see him now.

262
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,220
If you go to him now, he will certainly not admit it.

263
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,160
He is the only one who knows the antidote to Frost.

264
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,000
If he gets angry and stops giving the antidote,

265
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
then Thousand Flower Valley will only be over.

266
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,860
Guardian Ji, you've been in Immortal Master Mansion for so long,

267
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,020
what other news have you found?

268
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,120
There is indeed something strange within the Cong Ji Jail.

269
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,100
That day, in order to teach me a lesson,

270
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,960
Fairy specially sent the people who had enemies with me from the place.

271
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,120
But their spiritual power seemed to flow away unconsciously.

272
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,480
No one knows the reason.

273
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,540
I've also heard that the sinners imprisoned in the Cong Ji Jail

274
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,340
have suffered from spiritual exhaustion and died one after another over the years.

275
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,680
The people who are now imprisoned in the Cong Ji Jail are thieves,

276
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,280
whose sins are no worse than mine against Fairy.

277
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,080
The deeper the sin, the heavier the hostility,

278
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,040
then the faster the death,

279
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,400
which seems to be in line with the principle that good and evil have their own retribution.

280
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,680
But I think that it seems that it is not the truth.

281
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,540
It may be done by Immortal Master.

282
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,720
Could the so-called spiritual power that flows away be transferred?

283
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,080
You mean that Immortal Master plundered their spiritual power.

284
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,240
But… But I have never heard of this spell.

285
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,060
If there is, then it is a forbidden spell and a secret.

286
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,120
Although I haven't figured it out yet,

287
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,480
I know the purpose of Immortal Master.

288
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,860
He wants chaos.

289
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,040
Chaos?

290
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,640
As you can see, Fairy has been using force frequently recently.

291
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,800
But Master just stood by and watched.

292
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,100
He wants to use her to kill and cause disputes.

293
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,220
What he wants is not to kill anyone, but the endless slaughter.

294
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,020
This is exactly what he said, "Funeral for the world."

295
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,040
I am afraid that I'm also one of his pawns.

296
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,280
I thought that what he wanted was supreme power.

297
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,740
But now it seems that…

298
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,460
No. I can't let things go on like this.

299
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,440
It's not too late to save the situation.

300
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,520
Please go to find my attendant Luo Jinsang,

301
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,900
and ask her to go to Leyou Mountain to invite Blue Feather Phoenix off of the mountain.

302
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,220
With the power to contain Immortal Master,

303
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,600
you will have the opportunity to make a plan.

304
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,040
Okay. I believe you.

305
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,960
So beautiful.

306
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,660
I'm not dreaming, am I?

307
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,240
I'm really dreaming.

308
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,367
Who are you?

309
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,074
I am Heavenly King.

310
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,264
Sky mushroom?

311
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:24,800
I've eaten mountain mushrooms.

312
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,060
You're a sky mushroom. You look so beautiful, do you taste good?

313
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,740
I'm not a mushroom.

314
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,560
I'm the Lord of Heaven.

315
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,520
Is the Lord of Heaven so small?

316
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,840
Then, why are you looking for me?

317
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,620
Ji Yunhe asked me to bring you a message.

318
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,260
Fairy Shunde is starting wars, and the whole world is in turmoil.

319
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,500
So you are ordered to go to Leyou Mountain to invite Blue Feather Phoenix off of the mountain to contain Immortal Master.

320
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,920
How is Yunhe?

321
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,840
She won't die for a while, but she's not good.

322
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,200
So you have to go quickly.

323
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,040
I told you to go quickly, so why aren't you gone yet?

324
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,220
I have a question.

325
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,600
Where is Leyou Mountain?

326
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,460
I suddenly regret it.

327
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,720
How can Ji Yunhe trust you with such an important matter?

328
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,660
Forget it. I'll help you go there.

329
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,000
Wait. Are you going to slap me?

330
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,940
Stop talking. <i>Remember.</i>

331
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,760
<i>Invite Blue Feather Phoenix off of the mountain to contain Immortal Master.</i>

332
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,980
<i>Go and return quickly.</i>

333
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,460
Immortal Master's cultivation is unfathomable.

334
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,440
The power of our North Abyss alone now

335
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,640
can not compete with him.

336
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,260
We gather the power of all people.

337
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,580
If we want to attack the mansion as soon as possible,

338
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,800
we still need a person of great prestige to help us.

339
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,100
What do you mean?

340
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,880
Is my uncle's prestige not enough?

341
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,080
Your King, how do you feel about the Blue Feather Phoenix?

342
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,660
Blue Feather Phoenix? Has she escaped?

343
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,060
Yes. When I was imprisoned in the Thousand Flower Valley, she broke the Ten Directions Formation.

344
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,900
If the Blue Feather Phoenix is willing to help,

345
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,840
then our North Abyss is really like a tiger with wings.

346
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,420
Then the immortals from all over the world will surely dispel their concerns,

347
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,220
and more people will come to join us.

348
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,020
However, I have had contact with her before.

349
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,200
She is quite weird.

350
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,920
I don't know if she is willing to help us.

351
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,840
Right. Since she left the Thousand Flower Valley, she has been missing.

352
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,580
It's really not easy to find her now.

353
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,540
<i>From now on, all of Leyou Mountain</i>

354
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,740
<i>will only belong to you and me forever.</i>

355
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,700
Maybe I know where she is.

356
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,560
I'm willing to go for North Abyss.

357
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,300
Did Luo Jinsang just disappear?

358
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,060
The barrier is intact,

359
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,380
and Luo Jinsang disappeared quietly

360
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,180
without triggering the warning of the barrier.

361
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,920
Master, I'm afraid there is some power behind it that we can't monitor.

362
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,000
<i>Ji Yunhe, your life is mine.</i>

363
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,120
<i>Before I take revenge on you, you are not allowed to die.</i>

364
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,747
Master Qing, why are you here?

365
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,520
Seeing you hesitating, I wanted to help you.

366
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,660
Please don't.

367
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,253
Stop!

368
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,880
When did you get back to human shape?

369
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,340
Just now.

370
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,540
You're still lying to me even now.

371
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,160
If Qing hadn't forced you, how long would you have been hiding?

372
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,300
Sanyue, don't be angry.

373
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,440
I just…

374
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,240
It's just that you're willing to hide all the time,

375
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,780
but not give me an explanation.

376
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,080
Sanyue, don't leave.

377
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,660
I'm afraid…

378
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,520
Afraid of what?

379
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,940
You can even sacrifice yourself for the Ten Directions Formation,

380
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,000
what else are you afraid of?

381
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,490
You.

382
00:28:42,205 --> 00:28:44,150
Only you.

383
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,820
Sanyue, there is no superb deception in this world.

384
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,220
At first, I did use you for saving Master Qing.

385
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,760
But I didn't expect that my whole heart would surrender to you.

386
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,800
After the breakup of the Ten Directions Formation,

387
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,740
I felt so guilty that I couldn't sleep night and day.

388
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,940
I wanted to see you, I wanted to explain to you, and wanted you to vent your anger on me.

389
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,420
But I…

390
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,500
But when I got back to human shape, and when I saw you again,

391
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,680
I was suddenly scared.

392
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,940
I was afraid that even if I gave you all my heart, you would not believe me.

393
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,000
Then I would really lose you.

394
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,020
So I can only follow you secretly and dare not show up.

395
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,540
I just...

396
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,740
want to see you for a few more days.

397
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,060
You don't have to be hypocritical.

398
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,140
I've been tricked by you once,

399
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,980
then I won't believe any of your words again.

400
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,480
Now I just want to kill you to vent my hatred.

401
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay.

402
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,880
Now that you've found me,

403
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,000
I am at your disposal.

404
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,100
Sanyue, you're not going to kill me.

405
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,960
We're done with each other.

406
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,500
Done.

407
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,980
No. We can't be done. Let's not be done, okay?

408
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,500
Let me go.

409
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,520
Sanyue, you can't believe in my love,

410
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,660
you should believe yourself.

411
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,680
Let me go!

412
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,060
You said you liked me. Do you remember that?

413
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,520
And you'll always like me.

414
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,700
What I like... is the little lynx who acted as a hero to save me on Qiongling Mountain,

415
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,860
who was the attendant who stayed with me every day in Thousand Flower Valley,

416
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,780
but not this scheming lynx prince.

417
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,200
That's all me.

418
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,640
If you don't like me to be the prince of the lynx clan,

419
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,320
I'm willing to be your little attendant.

420
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,935
Take it.

421
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:03,000
My little lynx died in the Ten Directions Formation.

422
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,075
Thank you.

423
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:12,700
You're welcome.

424
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,620
My father is weak, and if it wasn't for you who helped him deal with affairs,

425
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,380
North Abyss would have been in chaos.

426
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,140
It's just that you are so busy, I'm worried that your body can't stand it,

427
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,920
so you'd better go to bed earlier tonight.

428
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
It doesn't matter.

429
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,900
During this period of time, the number of Immortals coming here is increasing,

430
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,480
but Shunde is frequently sending people to block them.

431
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,740
If they are not settled as soon as possible, I'm afraid it will disturb the peace.

432
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,600
My father is right.

433
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,400
I shouldn't neglect you in daily life, I should learn more from you.

434
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,539
Sanyue.

435
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,000
<i>[Li Shu's attendants, Da Huan and Xiao Huan]</i>

436
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,159
Da Huan. Xiao Huan.

437
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,640
Prince!

438
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,320
Prince, I finally get to see you.

439
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,679
You're about to pat him to death.

440
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,719
Are you okay, Prince?

441
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,560
It's impossible.

442
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,800
He's the strongest in our clan.

443
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,720
How could he be patted to death, right?

444
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,820
Prince.

445
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,899
Prince, what's wrong?

446
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,080
Why are you here?

447
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,820
Please come back to Chongwu Mountain with us.

448
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
When you said you wanted to repay kindness

449
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,240
and sneaked into Thousand Flower Valley alone to save Blue Feather Phoenix,

450
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,100
the elders were worried about you.

451
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,720
But after Blue Feather Phoenix escaped, you disappeared.

452
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,660
Everyone has been searching for you like crazy.

453
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,780
Right, we've finally found you.

454
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,080
Please go back with us.

455
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,980
Yes, let's go back.

456
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,502
No.

457
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,200
Prince, why won't you go back?

458
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,420
Is the fish at home not fresh enough, the wine not good enough,

459
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,160
or the girls not beautiful enough?

460
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,900
Tell us what you want. We'll get it for you.

461
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,120
None of them.

462
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,980
It's just that my heart is already dead.

463
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,500
Prince, your heart is not dead,

464
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,220
but your marriage is broken.

465
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,967
What did you say?

466
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,660
Did you all know about it?

467
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,680
We've seen it.

468
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,440
You were just rejected by a woman. It's not a big deal.

469
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,200
Right. And she is a rude and brutal woman.

470
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,940
Who gave you the permission to talk like that about her?

471
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,960
And violent.

472
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
Right.

473
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,520
You?

474
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,760
No.

475
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,820
Prince, while you were away from home,

476
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,120
news came back to Chongwu Mountain that

477
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,080
you were bewitched by a Spiritual Master,

478
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,960
and you were working for her day and night.

479
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,080
We were all saddened to hear that.

480
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,360
Wouldn't it be nice to have a clean break with her now?

481
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,340
Right.

482
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,000
The rules of our clan cannot be trampled on.

483
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,620
Go away.

484
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,160
Prince, please go back with us.

485
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,740
Yes, let's go back.

486
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,600
- Prince.
- Yes, Prince. Let's go back. Come on.

487
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,840
- Come on!
- Let's go back.

488
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,075
Sanyue.

489
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,440
I'm going back to Chongwu Mountain.

490
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,270
But as long as you say,

491
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,080
as long as you say you don't want me to leave,

492
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,680
I will stay and always be by your side.

493
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,640
Sanyue, I just want a word from you.

494
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,820
Excuse me.

510
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,680
Are you disappointed to see me?

511
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,160
No.

512
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,380
He's gone.

513
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,120
He said that the world is big,

514
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,760
but you have nowhere to go.

515
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,520
So he begged me to let you stay, to give you shelter.

516
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,300
What else did he say?

517
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,000
Little Li Shu seems to be cheeky and not serious,

518
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,120
but he hides many things in his heart.

519
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,440
For many things, don't mind what he says,

520
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,520
but look at what he does.

521
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,400
Don't you ever wonder

522
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,420
who drained out the cold aura for you,

523
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,920
who blocked pursuers of Thousand Flower Valley for you,

524
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,180
and who took care of you day and night?

525
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,680
It's him.

526
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,500
You think that he's fooling around to act like a hero.

527
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,280
But you don't know that this time

528
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,160
he exhausted his spiritual power greatly,

529
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,280
it is not easy to re-gather his shape.

530
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,620
He never talks about the pain of it.

531
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,260
I didn't want to get involved in your affairs.

532
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,060
I really think that you two are not suitable.

533
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,540
But I can't bear to see you get entangled in front of me,

534
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,160
which is very disturbing.

535
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,760
If you do not want him,

536
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,120
break up with him as soon as possible.

537
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,020
Also, stop bothering me.

538
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,040
If they knew that you were going back, they would definitely be overjoyed.

539
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,920
Of course. The elders first, then the kittens.

540
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,447
Right!

541
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,660
I'm tired, I want to take a break.

542
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,320
Prince, you've been tired three times

543
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,700
from the top to the bottom of the mountain.

544
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,380
If you really can't walk,

545
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,260
let Xiao Huan carry you.

546
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,120
Yes. Come on, Prince.

547
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,420
All right, stop it.

548
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,033
I'm not tired.

549
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,760
Let's go.

550
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,880
It really works.

551
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,427
Yes.

552
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,811
There's a Spiritual Master.

553
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,440
What's a Spiritual Master doing here?

554
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,460
Hide.

555
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,098
Quickly.

556
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,215
Follow me.

557
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:53,360
Prince, can you do it?

558
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,560
I'm more than enough to deal with a Spiritual Master.

559
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,663
Let's go.

560
00:41:57,663 --> 00:41:59,263
Go.

561
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,760
Be careful.

562
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,020
Are you talking about me?

563
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,240
Who are you?

564
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,420
No need to tell you.

565
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,720
Get out of my way.

566
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,960
If you want to enter Leyou Mountain,

567
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,520
you have to ask me first.

568
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,040
Who are you?

569
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,880
Prince of Chongwu Mountain is here,

570
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,120
go back.

571
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,320
I don't want to hurt you.

572
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,040
Get out of the way.

573
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,160
Prince, he is a guest.

574
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,740
Why don't we let him go?

575
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,460
Coward. Go away.

576
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,940
What if I don't let you go?

577
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,220
Then I'm sorry.

578
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,280
Thousand Flower Valley.
