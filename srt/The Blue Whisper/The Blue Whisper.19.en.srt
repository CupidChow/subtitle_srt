Retreat! Be quick!

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
Master, help me!

17
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,200
Ru Ling.

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
You overestimate your ability.

19
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Prince Chang Yi.

<i>The seal left by Immortal Master is loosening.</i>

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
<i>The seal and barrier here</i>

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
<i>is based on the power of Immortal Master.</i>

23
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,800
<i>Has something sapped his power?</i>

24
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,800
<i>Anyway, try to get out first.</i>

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,300
<i>I'm finally able to control my spiritual power.</i>

26
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,400
<i>Yunhe, I hope you can be free and uninhibited like the wind.</i>

27
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,300
We can't let the sinner run away! You guys go there.

28
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,900
Yes, Sir!

29
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,900
Are you crazy? We're not allowed to enter Quiet Chamber.

30
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>We'll die if we annoy Immortal Master.</i>

31
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
<i>Yes. Let's go.</i>

32
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,400
<i>Does Immortal Master have a secret chamber</i>

33
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,600
<i>like Lin Changlan?</i>

34
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,600
<i>Why is there a portrait of Shunde hidden here?</i>

35
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
<i>Immortal Master and Shunde?</i>

36
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,100
<i>That can't be it.</i>

37
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,600
<i>They can meet each other anytime.</i>

38
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,100
<i>Why does he keep the portrait?</i>

39
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
<i>This portrait looks particularly old.</i>

40
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>It doesn't look like a new one.</i>

41
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,200
Guardian Ji, you shouldn't be here.

42
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,200
Would you believe me if I tell you the barrier broke itself?

43
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,000
The barrier suddenly loosened

44
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,600
and the chamber also opened itself.

45
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
I'm a curious person.

46
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,000
I just wanted see what was going on.

47
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
You're not mad at me for such a little thing like that, are you?

48
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
I think you're not.

49
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,100
But... what's in that secret chamber?

50
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,000
And there was a sudden shock in Immortal Master Mansion.

51
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
Did something happen?

52
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Do you want to know?

53
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,800
You should ask yourself if you want to tell me.

54
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Ru Ling went to North Abyss today.

55
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
She's really in the mood.

56
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Playing again?

57
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,500
To get a merman.

58
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,200
What?

59
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Fox Clan in the North Abyss claimed to capture a merman and

60
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
sent Lingshuang Pavilion a message.

61
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,800
They agreed to trade the merman for Fox King.

62
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,000
How's Chang Yi?

63
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
What did you do to him?

64
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
You have really good taste.

65
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,200
What do you mean?

66
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
The merman set up an ambush with the others,

67
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,500
attacking Lingshuang Pavilion and hurting Ru Ling.

68
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,400
He's really capable.

69
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,000
What about Fairy Shunde?

70
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
Did she die?

71
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
No.

72
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
What a pity.

73
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,400
But I think you should be alerted.

74
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,800
The thing in North Abyss is just the start.

75
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,600
You seem to have some faith in that merman.

76
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,100
Of course.

77
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,800
He's one of the few sincere men in the world.

78
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,800
No one can defeat his sincere heart.

79
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,000
Sometimes I think...

80
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,200
you're kind of like her in some aspects.

81
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,600
Who?

82
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,800
No matter what,

83
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
as long as you're all right.

84
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,200
You promised me you'd hide yourself and stay cool.

85
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,800
<i>What about the things you promised me?</i>

86
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
There are already disputes,

87
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,500
and soon there will be chaos; just wait for it.

88
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,200
<i>Don't keep me waiting too long.</i>

89
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,600
<i>This little chamber is so boring.</i>

90
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
We made it.

91
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
Unfortunately, Shunde escaped.

92
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Shunde also came?

93
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,400
I could have killed her.

94
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
We still have chances.

95
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Conquering Lingshuang Pavilion is already a good start.

96
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
On behalf of all the immortals of North Abyss,

97
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,700
I'd like to thank you for your help.

98
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,100
Young Lord, you're welcome.

99
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,800
Now that we're allies, there's no distinction between "you" and "me".

100
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
But Zhu Ling has not yet brought my father out of the Pavilion.

101
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,700
Did you find him?

102
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,000
Fox King was imprisoned in No Desire Cave by Zhu Ling.

103
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Please feel assured, Young Lord.

104
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
The barrier is now broken,

105
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
Fox King's been ushered into the hall.

106
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,300
No Desire Cave?

107
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
How dare Zhu Ling do this to my father?

108
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,200
I won't let him get away!

109
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,900
Please follow me to see my father first.

110
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Prince Chang Yi.

111
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
You don't have to be so reckless.

112
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
Let me check the spirit elixir.

113
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm fine.

114
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,400
Let's see the Fox King first.

115
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,300
Father!

116
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,600
Yao!

117
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
Father.

118
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,800
Let me take a look.

119
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,800
I'm sorry.

120
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,800
I put you through all this.

121
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Don't be weak.

122
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,900
I heard that you and your men fought off Zhu Ling.

123
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,800
You're grown up to be their Young Lord.

124
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,100
I'm so gratified.

125
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,200
Come on. Don't cry.

126
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,400
You're supposed to be full of joy.

127
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,800
All right, Father.

128
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I'd like you to meet two people.

129
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,600
We owe the success of our rescue of all immortals of North Abyss

130
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
to Prince Chang Yi and Mr. Kong Ming.

131
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
- Fox King.
- Fox King.

132
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm Chang Yi.

133
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,000
He is my friend, Mr. Kong Ming.

134
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,100
Our clansmen have just told me the whole story,

135
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,600
including your identities.

136
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,200
I'll remember you for coming to our rescue

137
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,900
when we were in danger.

138
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,800
I've decided that the Fox Clan is willing to ally with you

139
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,100
to fight against Immortal Master Mansion.

140
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,500
From now on, we're going to stay with you and help each other out.

141
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,800
Thank you, Fox King.

142
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,600
Uncle!

143
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Qifeng.

144
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,200
Uncle. Uncle!

145
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,300
- Good boy.
- Uncle.

146
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,000
You are stronger.

147
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Uncle, please be assured.

148
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
Shunde and Zhu Ling have escaped.

149
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,200
But I've captured all the spiritual masters of Lingshuang Pavilion.

150
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Well done.

151
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,000
In addition, we found some spiritual masters from

152
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thousand Flower Valley at the bottom of No Desire Cave.

153
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,400
They said they had been captured by Zhu Ling earlier.

154
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,800
Well, I'll leave them at your disposal, Uncle.

155
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,200
Okay.

156
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Mr. Kong Ming, how much longer can this Immortal Capturing Formation stand?

157
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,800
It's a one-time formation.

158
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,000
Therefore, in order to guard against Shunde and Zhu Ling's counterattack,

159
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,200
we should stay put and guard Lingshuang Pavilion first.

160
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
I thought it was so powerful,

161
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,700
but it turns out that it can only be used once.

162
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,600
Qifeng, don't be rude.

163
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, in that case, let's discuss how to organize a defense.

164
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Prince Chang Yi!

165
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,300
- Prince.
- Prince Chang Yi.

166
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
His spirit elixir is broken.

167
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,800
He may not make it.

168
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,000
Chang Yi.

169
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,100
What's the matter with you, Chang Yi?

170
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Immortal Master.

171
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,200
Is anyone here?

172
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,800
I want to meet Immortal Master.

173
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

174
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,100
I want to meet Immortal Master.

175
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,400
I hope the Elixir Fixing Occult Magic of our clan

176
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,700
can help Prince Chang Yi.

177
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,800
Father, are you okay?

178
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,000
His condition is much more serious than I thought.

179
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,800
Using this magic is so draining.

180
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,000
If I hadn't been captured to the No Desire Cave and been tortured,

181
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,700
I could have saved him.

182
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,800
But now, I've been eroded by the cold aura

183
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,700
and suffered a serious illness.

184
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,800
I'm a bit out of my depth.

185
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,000
Or you can teach me, Father!

186
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
Let me do it.

187
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Yao, calm down.

188
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,300
Father, you told me to be a grateful person.

189
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,200
Prince Chang Yi risked his life to save us.

190
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,700
Now it's my turn to repay him.

191
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm also very grateful to Chang Yi for his kindness to us.

192
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,000
If I could have saved him myself,

193
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,600
I wouldn't have hesitated.

194
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,000
But I won't let you save him.

195
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Absolutely not.

196
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Yao, it's really difficult.

197
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,500
You have no idea what it takes to use this magic.

198
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm not afraid of it.

199
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I don't care what it takes.

200
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,000
No.

201
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,200
If he dies,

202
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,000
I can't live alone.

203
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,800
Yao, what are you talking about?

204
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Chang Yi and I...

205
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
Chang Yi and you?

206
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,600
We haven't known each other for a long time,

207
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
but we've fallen in love with each other.

208
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
Our love will never change.

209
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,400
Till death do us part.

210
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,300
So, Father, I beg you to teach me.

211
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,500
Let me try.

212
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
But your spiritual power...

213
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,600
Even if it takes all my spiritual power to save him,

214
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
it can still be a testament to our love.

215
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,400
But if I do nothing,

216
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,500
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

217
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,800
So please, let me try.

218
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,000
Father.

219
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,400
All right.

220
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
I'll teach you.

221
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Thank you, Father.

222
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,000
Sir.

223
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,200
See... See the light.

How's it going?

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
His spirit elixir has been fixed.

247
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,400
But he still needs a good rest to fully recover.

248
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Okay.

249
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,800
I want to thank you both on behalf of Prince.

250
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,000
Thank you very much,

251
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Fox King. Young Lord.

252
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,800
We'll go to see Prince first.

253
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,400
Let's go.

254
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Yao, are you okay?

255
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm fine, Father.

256
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,200
Yao, you spent too much spiritual power.

257
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,600
Go home and get some rest.

258
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,500
Father, you must keep this a secret for me.

259
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,200
And don't tell Prince Chang Yi about it.

260
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Why?

261
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,500
The thing between Chang Yi and me is a secret.

262
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,000
No one else knows about it.

263
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,300
And I don't want to tie him down with it.

264
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,600
I don't need his gratitude.

265
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,200
But you...

266
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Please feel assured.

267
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
He'll be nice to me.

268
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,800
Besides, don't you believe in your daughter's taste?

269
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
Well, okay.

270
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,200
I won't tell anyone.

271
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,000
But just remember that

272
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,600
if he ever hurts you, be sure to tell me.

273
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,900
I'll stand up for you.

274
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,800
<i>Father, I'm sorry.</i>

275
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,400
<i>I'll explain it to you later.</i>

276
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,400
Chang Yi.

277
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,800
Please be okay.

278
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,600
Don't give up.

279
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,100
Prince, are... are you still uncomfortable?

280
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,200
It's... It's all my fault.

281
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm too weak to fight with you, Prince.

282
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,800
I failed to protect you.

283
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,400
You're lucky to have survived this time.

284
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,800
Well, is this how you get revenge,

285
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,200
breaking your spirit elixir

286
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,600
and sacrificing yourself to kill Fairy Shunde?

287
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
It's so stupid.

288
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Don't forget you have more important things to do now.

289
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Without Fox King and Qingyao to fix your elixir,

290
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,600
you, the prince of mermen, would have died.

291
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Sir, Prince just woke up.

292
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,800
Don't be so hard on him.

293
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,500
Sit down!

294
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,400
I know that Mr. Kong Ming is worried about me.

295
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Thanks.

296
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,000
By the way, you just said "fix my elixir"?

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,600
Try to use your power.

298
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,860
It's fixed! The spirit elixir is fixed!

299
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,920
Useless!

300
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,280
Thousand Flower Valley is useless.

301
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,700
Lingshuang Pavilion is the most useless.

302
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,280
Especially you, Zhu Ling!

303
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,160
It was you who swore your loyalty to me and said you would succeed.

304
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,460
That's why I let you go to North Abyss and lead Lingshuang Pavilion.

305
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,120
But what happened?

306
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,580
You went to great lengths to set up a "brilliant" plan,

307
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,420
but only lost the Lingshuang Pavilion.

308
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,840
I almost died in North Abyss because of it.

309
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,740
Zhu Ling, you're really a "genius"!

310
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,200
Fairy Shunde, please calm down.

311
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,720
It's... It's all my fault.

312
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,460
But my devotion to you cannot be questioned.

313
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,080
Now Envoy Zhang is dead.

314
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,100
You need another assistant.

315
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,400
Fairy Shunde, please, let me make this right.

316
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,580
Let me stay in Immortal Master Mansion to serve you.

317
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,860
I won't let you down again.

318
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,460
You really know how to plan for yourself.

319
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,140
I don't want to see you again.

320
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,260
You're annoying me.

321
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,380
Thank you very much, Fairy Shunde.

322
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,500
Thank you. Thank you very much.

323
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,380
Thanks.

324
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Master,

325
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,320
Fairy Shunde took Zhu Ling back to our mansion.

326
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,720
Master.

327
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,400
Zhu Ling has a nasty mind.

328
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,380
He used the power of Fairy Shunde and our mansion

329
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,080
to rule North Abyss like a tyrant, capturing lots of people.

330
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,520
I don't think he's a reliable person.

331
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,220
Can you persuade Fairy Shunde?

332
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,200
Let Ru Ling do whatever she wants.

333
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,180
Yes.

334
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,200
By the way, Guardian Ji's been asking to see you.

335
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,900
Do you want to see her?

336
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,300
I want to see Immortal Master.

337
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,580
I need to see Immortal Master.

338
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,080
Can someone hear me?

339
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,020
I want to see Immortal Master.

340
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,840
You finally come to see me.

341
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,920
What's going on?

342
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,100
Let me go.

343
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,640
- Why?
- Why?

344
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,380
Don't you think it's ridiculous to ask a prisoner why she wants freedom?

345
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,700
If you want to see me, you have to say something useful.

346
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,160
Wait a second.

347
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,080
I want to go to North Abyss.

348
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,020
For that merman?

349
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,340
Yes.

350
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,700
He's still alive, better than you think.

351
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,160
I don't care.

352
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,740
I'm going to see how he really is.

353
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,760
You don't have the leverage to negotiate with me.

354
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,140
I do.

355
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,260
You don't want me to die, but you can't stop me from killing myself.

356
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,680
I die, or you let me go. Pick one.

357
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,000
Okay. I'll find an undertaker for you.

358
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,240
Why on earth are you locking me up like this?

359
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,960
You've tried all kinds of weird treatments on me.

360
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm no longer of use to you as a subject.

361
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,560
What the hell are you locking me up like this for?

362
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,660
I'll give you a chance.

363
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,280
If you win, I'll let you go.

364
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
If you lose...

365
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,400
I won't run away or make any more noise.

366
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,440
You can do anything.

367
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,160
Okay.

368
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,820
Your words are law, so you can't change your mind.

369
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,040
What a surprise. The wisest Immortal Master in everyone's eyes is a chess addict.

370
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,520
If you lose, remember to keep your word.

371
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,600
Why did you make this move?

372
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,280
It looks disorganized.

373
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,740
That's not the rule.

374
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,480
Why do we have to follow the rules?

375
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,580
Without the rules, how can we know who is the winner?

376
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,160
There are laws in Heaven and on Earth.

377
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,860
There are orders for everything.

378
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,420
That's what the rule means.

379
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,600
But no one ever said that not following the rules isn't actually another kind of rule.

380
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,220
Winning or losing is a result, not a process.

381
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,140
In the end, the rules actually depend on the winner.

382
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,380
Being stable is a process, and being chaotic is also a process.

383
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,100
Maybe all roads lead to the same destination.

384
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,980
It seems that Immortal Master's rule

385
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,000
tends to be a chaotic one.

386
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,360
You asked me why I'm locking you up.

387
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,620
You see, the piece is unremarkable.

388
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,420
But when I put it here...

389
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,100
Locking you up is useless.

390
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,720
But it'll make a lot of other things make sense.

391
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,460
This will eventually lead me to where I want everything to be.

392
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,740
The world has been quiet for centuries.

393
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,180
Now, things are going to be lively again.

394
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,800
You'll have a big part in that.

395
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,580
What exactly do you want to do?

396
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,220
To hold a funeral for the world.

397
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,060
You lose.

398
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,140
It's futile.

399
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,700
I guess you still don't know me.

400
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,480
I, Ji Yunhe, was born competitive and disobedient.

401
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,180
I like doing things I'm not allowed to do.

402
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,380
I like your words.

403
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,020
Take care.

404
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,220
Maybe one day, you can understand my rule.

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,260
To hold a funeral for the world...

406
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,600
<i>You hate her?</i>

407
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,680
<i>That's the funniest joke I've ever heard.</i>

408
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,080
<i>- What do you mean?
- Guess.</i>

409
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,660
<i>I won't tell you.</i>

410
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,060
<i>I love seeing you all so anxious and nervous</i>

411
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,780
<i>but not getting any answers.</i>

412
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,400
<i>Anyway, she's a real pain in my neck.</i>

413
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,000
<i>No matter how much I tortured her, she kept laughing.</i>

414
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,260
<i>I'd like to see whether she can still laugh</i>

415
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,800
<i>if I skin her.</i>

416
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,440
<i>Big-tailed Fish, you should live in the water.</i>

417
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,760
<i>That's when you're the freest and the most beautiful.</i>

418
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,780
<i>We all want to live in this place,</i>

419
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,340
<i>so I don't want you to die.</i>

420
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,520
Prince, I know you don't like to waste.

421
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,620
So I picked up some supplies for everyday use.

422
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,080
So that you can live comfortably here.

423
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,960
Prince, are... are you thinking about Ji Yunhe again?

424
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,280
I heard that she was locked up by Shunde.

425
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,720
She's just unlucky.

426
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,520
But when I think about what she did, I just feel like you've been avenged.

427
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,120
She deserves a lesson.

428
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,620
Anyway, what she owes you can't be paid back.

429
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,580
Enough?

430
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,940
No. I'm telling you, if I catch her, first I'll kick... teach her.

431
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,320
I...

432
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,720
Am I right?

433
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,680
Maybe not right.

434
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,180
<i>Ji Yunhe.</i>

435
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:44,960
<i>I'll get back what you owe me, one by one.</i>

436
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,740
<i>Father was right.</i>

437
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,300
<i>The magic of fixing elixir cost too much spiritual power.</i>

438
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,360
Prince Chang Yi, you're awake.

439
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,520
How do you feel?

440
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,380
Young Lord, why do you...

441
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,260
Sorry to bother you.

442
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,800
Why do you look so pale? Didn't you get enough rest?

443
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,740
I'm fine.

444
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,200
Thank you and Fox King for taking the trouble to fix my elixir.

445
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,100
No, that's fine. Never mind. It's...

446
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,820
It's pretty simple.

447
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,540
Young Lord, thank you for saving my life.

448
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,260
I'll find a chance to thank Fox King in person.

449
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,580
Prince, you don't have to do that.

450
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,200
You're still recuperating from serious injuries.

451
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,160
I made some meals for you.

452
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,440
Give me.

453
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,260
Well, uh, you and Fox King are our benefactors for saving Prince Chang Yi.

454
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,360
If you need anything, I'm at your service.

455
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,260
Zhu Ling wantonly captured innocent people.

456
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,100
Now we are lucky to be rescued,

457
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,500
but there are still some people trapped in the Immortal Master Mansion.

458
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,300
With your help today,

459
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm sure we'll be able to get those people out soon.

460
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,540
We used to be friends with Prince Chang Yi,

461
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,160
moved by his ambition, and admired his ability, so we came from afar.

462
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,180
After seeing the charisma of Fox King,

463
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,160
we're willing to obey your commands and help North Abyss.

464
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,400
Well, thank you all for helping us.

465
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,760
However, although it's imperative to attack Immortal Master Mansion,

466
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,980
I'm afraid we don't stand a chance with the current strength of North Abyss.

467
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,400
We need more time to prepare.

468
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,790
There's lots of work to be done during this time,

469
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,950
so I'm going to appoint a commander-in-chief

470
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,520
to take charge of it and lead the troops.

471
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,740
Fox King, I want to recommend myself.

472
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:20,220
Prince Chang Yi, I call you Prince because I respect you.

473
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,620
However, you don't have any other helpers besides those ass-kissers.

474
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,879
Don't show off your ability with these few guys in North Abyss.

475
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,900
General Qifeng, the best soldier is always a skilled one.

476
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,780
But the best general is always the most strategic.

477
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,700
If the general is foolhardy, a thousand troops will die.

478
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,259
You, a traitor of Immortal Master Mansion, who are you to talk with us?

479
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:44,940
Qifeng, don't be rude.

480
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,580
Prince Chang Yi and Mr. Kong Ming are our benefactors.

481
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,420
It's a great honor.

482
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,279
I'd like to join you and live and die as you do.

483
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:57,280
I want to go with you to Lutai Mountain as soon as possible

484
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240
to rescue those innocent people in the Immortal Master Mansion,

485
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,640
to fight against Shunde and Immortal Master, and to get justice for us.

486
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,100
It's not an easy job to be the commander-in-chief.

487
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,600
Since Prince Chang Yi recommended himself, I'd like to thank you for your contribution.

488
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,660
- Uncle, I...
- Chang Yi will live up to it.

489
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,860
We've been making friends here and there for six months.

490
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,920
You've never been a pusher and never taken credit.

491
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Why are you today so uncharacteristically enthusiastic about the position of commander-in-chief?

492
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,640
I was hiding my capacities and biding my time.

493
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,260
Am I wrong?

494
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,320
No, you're not.

495
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,620
Everything you say makes sense.

496
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,960
I just thought you were a little overeager today.

497
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,380
Overeager? Really?

498
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:59,640
Of course, you know if it's real or not. Right?

499
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,300
I stood up for you because I don't want Qifeng to be the commander-in-chief.

500
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,100
He's a greedy and aggressive man and will mess up our plan.

501
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,860
But...

502
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,920
I don't want you to let your feelings get in the way.

503
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,420
Did what Shunde said that day affect you?

504
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,640
She said what?

505
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,520
Don't play dumb when you talk to me.

506
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,420
Are you still thinking about Ji Yunhe?

507
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,300
You're so touchy.

508
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,460
She betrayed me. I don't even remember her.

509
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,660
But... I'll settle scores with her sooner or later.

510
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,960
It will be nice if you were telling the truth.

511
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,520
What Shunde said may be a trap and not true.

512
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,980
Her purpose is to upset you and lure you into her trap.

513
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:55,080
Perhaps, the one who has been behind Shunde to advise her is Ji Yunhe.

514
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,700
The girl you've been thinking about.

515
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,000
She had lured you into her trap. You were badly injured because of her.

516
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,320
It took you a long time to get here.

517
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,040
I hope you can be more sensible and won't head down the same path.

518
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,980
Especially we have more important things to do right now.

519
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,280
Look at North Abyss and the world out of it.

520
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,800
There are injustices everywhere caused by Shunde and Immortal Master.

521
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,780
Now,

522
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,900
are you going to let all of these go?

523
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,300
<i>I'll fight against all injustices in the whole world.</i>

524
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,220
<i>And I won't let go of anyone who's in trouble.</i>

525
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,240
Of course, we can't just sit back and do nothing about Lingshuang Pavilion.

526
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,320
But why are you sending troops to so many places at once?

527
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,460
The peace will be ruined by strife and war.

528
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,480
I will make no promise of the kind.

529
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,480
I wouldn't have done it if those humble immortals hadn't revolted against me and hurt me.

530
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,000
Your Majesty, forgive me for being too mouthy.

531
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,100
The merman and lots of people in North Abyss occupied Lingshuang Pavilion.

532
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,060
If we don't care and do not block the traitors around one by one,

533
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,980
I'm afraid that they'll go to North Abyss and become partners with the merman.

534
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,380
Maybe they'll be powerful enough to fight us.

535
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,560
How dare you!

536
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,160
Did they intend to betray us?

537
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,080
That's where their home was.

538
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,540
Lingshuang Pavilion guarded North Abyss to keep immortals there safe.

539
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,340
But you did the exact opposite and tortured innocent people.

540
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,000
They were displaced and angry because of you.

541
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,560
Get Zhu Ling out of my sight. He's sentenced to 300 lashes.

542
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,680
<i>Yes!</i>

543
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,020
Fairy Shunde!

544
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,860
Fairy!

545
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,980
Ru Jun, I agree with you for punishing him.

546
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,040
But can you agree to what I want to do?

547
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,820
Sister, we can't mix up these two things.

548
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,680
I can't agree to what you want to do.

549
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,140
You can't give me what I want?

550
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,180
What good am I to have a brother like you?

551
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,700
If you don't need my medicine, forget it.

552
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,000
I'll see you again in a few days.

553
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,800
I hope you've figured it out by then.

554
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,260
Guards! Why hasn't Master come to see me yet?

555
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,400
Did he go to visit that bitch Ji Yunhe?

556
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,500
Please calm down, Fairy Shunde.

557
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,960
You dumb bitch! Damn you!

558
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,860
Thank you for the good news.

559
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,180
But your whip has been used for so long. It looks a bit worn.

560
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,940
You need to buy a new one.

561
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,600
I feel nostalgic for the past.

562
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,460
So I didn't change it.

563
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,720
But not everyone is like me.

564
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,860
Do you know what happened to your lover in North Abyss?

565
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,920
I do.

566
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,960
He gave you a hard time.

567
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,460
Very good.

568
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,040
I'm so relieved.

569
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,900
Actually, he didn't get hurt much.

570
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,760
But do you know why?

571
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,460
Because Qing Xuan was protecting him.

572
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,940
Your lover, that merman, is now his son-in-law.

573
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,220
Of course, he is charming;

574
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:52,560
otherwise, you would not be still thinking about him and so paranoid.

575
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,580
Ji Yunhe, you don't have to act like you don't care about it.

576
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,000
You haven't met Qing Xuan's daughter, have you?

577
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,560
She has a pretty face and an awesome figure.

578
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,100
So charming.

579
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,520
A merman only loves one person in their life.

580
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,840
But if Chang Yi is different, it will be fine.

581
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,860
I'm sick of your hypocritical face.

582
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,560
No wonder the merman has fallen in love with someone else.

583
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,340
Well, since you're so smart,

584
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,360
I'll cut off your head and give it to them as a wedding gift.

585
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,100
Is it a good idea?

586
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,900
Ru Ling, I told you, you can't kill her.

587
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,460
Okay.

588
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,020
I can promise you.

589
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,460
But, Master, the troublemakers of North Abyss have taken over

590
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,400
Lingshuang Pavilion and they don't respect me.

591
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,360
I just can't stand it.

592
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,060
The disciples in Immortal Master Mansion are at your disposal.

593
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,120
Master, I also want your Thunderbolt Incantation and Mighty Gold Talisman.

594
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,980
I'll give you whatever you want.

595
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,740
I knew you understood me the best.

596
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,360
What are you laughing at?

597
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,620
You're so naive. Do you think you can defeat them with these things?

598
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,940
Ji Yunhe, don't be so confident.

599
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,360
When I pacify North Abyss, I will let all those who betrayed me see

600
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,300
how you suffer and kowtow to me for mercy.

601
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,760
Okay.

602
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,880
Then I bet you can't kill everyone who stands up to you.

603
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,140
All right. I'll take your bet.

604
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
Let's wager your blood and flesh on it.

605
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:38,520
If you lose, I will cut an inch of your flesh every day, and cut you into nothing.

606
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,620
If you're going to make a bet, you need to be equally sincere.

607
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,320
If you lose, I'll do the same to you.

608
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,300
We'll see.
