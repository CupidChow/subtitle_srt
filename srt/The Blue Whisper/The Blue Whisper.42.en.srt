If I hadn't been at rest for so long, you wouldn't have let down your guard.

You can't kill me easily.

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't forget. I've got a secret weapon.

What's going on?

25

She cannot harm the North Abyss.

You shouldn't have that power.

The Bodhi fruit reforged my meridians. My tail is back.

Now my power is back.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Shunde, give up.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,040
Don't you look down upon me.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,980
A tail won't change a thing.

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,000
That's not as powerful as the evil thoughts of the entire world.

Wake up.

Come on, wake up. Wake up!

35

Clear your mind! We must stop the fight!

Kong Ming, I... I'm not a burden this time, am I?

39
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,000
You promised me to stay at home and wait for me.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Why did you run out?

41
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,160
I was going to save Yunhe.

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,600
But you're so stupid.

43
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,280
So I came to help you.

44
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,440
This time...

45
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,180
don't you... don't you say I'm useless.

46
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,660
I won't. I won't, Luo Luo.

47
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,060
I will never... I will never blame you. I could never...

48
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,800
Don't talk. Hang on.

49
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,480
Kong Ming.

50
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,460
I just realize that...

51
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,220
you're more important to me than the spirit stones.

52
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,180
Luo Luo.

53
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,020
Luo Luo!

54
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,800
Luo Luo, stay with me.

55
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,400
Don't fall asleep.

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
I can give you as many spirit stones as you want.

57
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,720
I'll give you whatever you ask for. Luo Luo.

58
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,640
Once we live through this battle, let's get married, shall we?

59
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,200
Marry me.

60
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,020
Luo Luo!

61
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
No.

62
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,980
Chengyu!

63
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,020
All right. This is all over now.

64
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,060
Wake up!

65
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,540
Come on! Brother!

66
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,640
Master Donglian.

67
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
Xiaoxing!

68
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,480
Thankfully. You are sober now!

69
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,660
Where's Master?

70
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,260
Did Shunde capture him, too?

71
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Is Lin here?

72
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,760
Do you think the Golden Bell is all I have?

73
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,620
That bell is only for the ordinary puppets.

74
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,240
I cast it with my power. It's indestructible!

75
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,900
A perfect match for Lin Haoqing.

76
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,700
Senior!

77
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,760
Chang Yi, Heavenly King is in danger.

78
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,380
Go ahead. I'll take care of her.

79
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,040
Senior! Stop!

80
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,600
Be careful, Guardian Ji.

81
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,040
Don't be distracted. I'll handle him.

82
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,400
Senior, wake up!

83
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
Senior...

84
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
Senior...

85
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,200
Yunhe, listen to me.

86
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm trapped in this game.

87
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,800
It's beyond my control.

88
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,600
I don't deserve to love someone.

89
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,400
If I can use my power

90
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,400
in exchange for the freedom of the girl I love,

91
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,600
I will consider it my final wish.

92
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,100
Don't worry, Yunhe.

93
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm by your side.

94
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,700
<i>Don't worry, Yunhe. I'm by your side.</i>

95
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,800
<i>From now on, you can call me Brother Haoqing.</i>

96
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,400
<i>What will you pay to protect someone you love?</i>

97
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
<i>Everything.</i>

98
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,900
<i>What if they misunderstand you and hate you for betraying them?</i>

99
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,400
<i>I will pay the price if I can keep him safe.</i>

100
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
<i>You're A'Ji.</i>

101
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
<i>Ji as in memory.</i>

102
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,700
<i>Master!</i>

103
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Senior!

104
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Chang Yi.

105
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,000
I can't believe you're killing me for those pests.

106
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,500
Ungrateful brat! We're family!

107
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,000
You don't deserve the throne!

108
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,600
All right.

109
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Hard as you may try,

110
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,800
I won't let you win easily.

111
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
I still have my cultivation!

112
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,800
It will preserve my spirit.

113
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I will turn into the wind and kill everyone I meet.

114
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,200
The entire world shall be buried with me.

115
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,400
<i>I will chain you up, even if you turn into the wind.</i>

116
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,400
<i>I will stop you with my life!</i>

117
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,400
What are you doing?

118
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm sorry, Chang Yi.

119
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,700
I have to do this.

120
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,800
<i>With the light of the Glazed Lantern,</i>

121
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,100
<i>I can draw the Heavenly and Earthly Fire which burns all evils.</i>

122
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,600
<i>As long as the lantern is lit, there is hope.</i>

123
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,100
<i>Long live justice.</i>

124
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,700
<i>Ji Yunhe, I'm right inside you.</i>

125
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,200
<i>If you seal me, you'll stay there with me, too.</i>

126
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,000
<i>Can you abandon the merman?</i>

127
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,400
Yunhe, burning the demon with Heavenly and Earthly Fire. You'll sacrifice yourself again!

128
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
But Shunde hasn't given up.

129
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
We'll never see peace if she's alive.

130
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,800
You don't want her to intrude on the world, do you?

131
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll go with you.

132
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,100
Chang Yi, when I jump into the lava,

133
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,000
Shunde will try to escape for sure.

134
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
By that time, I'll need a helper to seal the volcano

135
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,800
with the power of the Scepter of Merman Clan and stop her.

136
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,600
You must stop the eruption, too.

137
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,200
It has to be you.

138
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
You are asking me to seal you with my own hands.

139
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,900
I know it's hard.

140
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,000
But I trust you the most.

141
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
You yearn for freedom.

142
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,600
You cannot be imprisoned in this dark place.

143
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I'll go for you.

144
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,800
I used to dream about freedom.

145
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,700
That's because I'm indifferent to everything.

146
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,400
After seeing you,

147
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,200
the North Abyss, and what we've gone through,

148
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
I've changed my mind.

149
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,400
They're all a part of me.

150
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,700
Chang Yi, this is my choice.

151
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Don't worry.

152
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,000
I have faith in the lantern. It will protect me.

153
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I will be fine.

154
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,400
Once the demon perishes,

155
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,400
I will find my way back.

156
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,000
We shall be honest with each other.

157
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,100
Whatever obstacle there will be,

158
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,000
we shall face it together.

159
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
Okay?

160
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay.

161
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,400
I need your promise.

162

165
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,800
♫ <i>Any fool looking up can't keep the light</i> ♫

166
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:48,300
♫ <i>Hey, just follow the flow</i> ♫

167
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
Take it.

168
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,700
And you'll know I'm always your Big-tailed Fish.

169
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,600
I will wait for you.

170
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,800
No matter how long it is,

171
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,900
a merman sticks to his spouse all his life.

172
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,400
I promise.

173
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,200
Whenever it is, wherever I am,

174
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,600
I will find my way back.

175
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,400
I will always end up by your side.

176
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,900
This time, don't be trapped in the North Abyss for me.

177
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,800
Take a tour.

178
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
See what the world is like.

179
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
See if there's any delicious food and beautiful sights.

180
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
Make some preparations.

181
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,100
Show me the best of the world once we reunite.

182
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,900
All right?

183
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Okay.

184
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,900
I promise.

185
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,159
♫ <i>I hope you're like the moonlight</i> ♫

186
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,740
♫ <i>Having no pain or wounds</i> ♫

187
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,300

197
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:19,638
<i>- We're free!
- It's all over now!</i>

198
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,580
Li Shu, this is the end.

199
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,720
Can you see this?

200
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,160
Are you sure you want to leave me behind?

201
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,620
Would that be costly?

202
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,720
Luo Luo.

203
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,260
Luo Luo! You're alive!

204
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,200
Luo Luo.

205
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,580
The wedding ceremony, would that be expensive?

206
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,240
How many...

207
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,680
how many spirit stones would it cost?

208
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,880
Whatever it takes.

209
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,020
Whatever it takes!

210
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,740
Out comes the sun.

211
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,660
Is this the end of the chaos?

212
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,020
I finally understand it.

213
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,960
The million soldiers Father left me

214
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,200
are not some mysterious troops waiting to be summoned somewhere.

215
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,180
It refers to every righteous guardian in the world.

216
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,480
Each one of you is a part of it.

217
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,440
- It's just...
- I didn't expect

218
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,280
that Yunhe would sacrifice herself.

219
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,460
I'm sorry.

220
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,680
It's not your fault.

221
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,120
That's how she is.

222
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,620
No one can change her mind once she makes the decision.

223
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,120
Likewise, she will keep her promise.

224
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:59,220
How long will it take for the devil to perish?

225
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,840
It depends on how strong her mind is.

226
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,420
Maybe 100 years, 1,000 years. Maybe even tens of thousands of years.

227
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,320
I get it.

228
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,680
Heavenly King, please reopen the east sea and take care of Thousand Flower Valley.

229
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,300
As for North Abyss,

230
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,180
I believe Qing Yao will make it thrive again.

231
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,878
Are you... resigning from the position of master?

232
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,840
She deserves the title more than I do.

233
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,760
Home is where your heart is.

234
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Looks like North Abyss isn't your home.

235
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,000
<i>[300 years later]</i>

236
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,860
Immortal Master.

237
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,360
- Immortal Master.
- Keep your voice down, Luo Luo.

238
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,040
Immortal Master is discussing with Heavenly King. They don't want any intruders.

239
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,180
But I'm not an intruder.

240
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
After you.

241
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,320
Luo Luo!

242
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,680
What are you doing here?

243
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,080
Your Majesty, glad to see you.

244
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,760
Please judge for us.

245
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,160
Ever since he became Immortal Master, I can hardly see him.

246
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,400
After our wedding day, it's been a long time since the last time we practiced.

247
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,040
That's not how a couple works.

248
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,760
This isn't the right time.

249
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,560
Well. Now that Ms. Luo is here, I should get going.

250
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,920
Hold on. I'm waiting for your gift.

251
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,100
Gift?

252
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,340
What gift?

253
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:13,020
Are you hungry?

254
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,989
All right, it's time to eat.

255
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,680
It's the baby.

256
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,320
Are you saying...

257
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,060
You'll be a father.

258
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,440
I'll be a father!

259
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,080
Luo Luo!

260
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,140
Great! I'm a father!

261
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,540
Is this the right time?

262
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,249
It is! Always!

263
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,200
Master.

264
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,880
Have you heard about Luo Jinsang's pregnancy?

265
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
Prepare a gift for me.

266
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,160
Once I finish the business here, I'll set off to congratulate them.

267
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,860
Yes, Master.

268
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,900
Master, as busy as Kong Ming is, he's got a baby.

269
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,040
Shouldn't you think about having a spouse?

270
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,840
We've received so many proposal letters.

271
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,820
You didn't even open one.

272
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,080
Come on.

273
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,380
Is love the only thing you pursue?

274
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,440
Look around.

275
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,880
Isn't it lovely that North Abyss is peaceful and lively?

276
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,320
It's been so long.

277
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,220
You're still bothered by Fairy Shunde.

278
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,500
I know that my sister committed a severe crime.

279
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,220
Still, she took care of me and raised me up.

280
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,160
Now, she's dispersed.

281
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,220
But I'm still thinking of her.

282
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,320
Master, am I being too weak?

283
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,600
Everyone has his or her life.

284
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,120
It's destiny.

285
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,680
No need to hold a grudge.

286
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,960
But you don't have to forget it.

287
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,880
Sometimes, reflection can light up our way ahead.

288
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,480
Master, you look delighted today.

289
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,680
Any good news?

290
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,080
I heard that Fei Lian and Lei Ze have come to life again.

291
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,780
It makes me happy.

292
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,040
Great. I'm heading to Thousand Flower Valley.

293
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,820
I should tell Commander Xue about it.

294
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,540
If only Prince Li Shu were still alive.

295
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,240
Li Shu is an heir of Lu Wu.

296
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,960
He has nine lives.

297
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,140
He escaped from death many times.

298
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,720
Maybe he'd make it again this time.

299
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,300
On my way here, I came across the Immortal of Marriage.

300
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,760
He told me...

301
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,300
What did he say?

302
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,880
Come on, tell me.

303
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,300
Forget about it.

304
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,800
It's a secret.

305
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,560
A surprise is better left unsaid for lovers.

306
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,680
Don't you think?

307
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,900
There you are again.

308
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,500
You must be hungry.

309
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,980
I've prepared you dried fish.

310
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,440
Where are you going?

311
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,480
You forgot your fish.

312
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,780
Naughty you.

313
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,000
There you are!

314
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,760
You seem overly active today.

315
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,700
Bright fur, smooth figure.

316
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,160
You take care of your spirit pet well.

317
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,180
Who is it?

318
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,240
I'm new here as a mortal disciple.

319
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,640
I lost my way and got here by accident.

320
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,780
You must be a disciple here, too.

321
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,520
I heard that among all the masters here,

322
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,140
Commander Xue is the most powerful one.

323
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,939
I have always admired her.

324
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:13,060
Do you know about her habits?

325
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,380
Would you like to tell me about them?

326
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,939
I'd like to cheer her up.

327
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:19,960
I shall pay you a formal reward if she could meet me.

♫ <i>We bloomed like a flower</i> ♫

329
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,420
Excuse me. Why are you crying?

330
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,419
I like the way you smile. Special.

331
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:56,900
♫ <i>We once met like a song in the sounds of nature</i> ♫

332
00:34:56,971 --> 00:35:04,362
♫ <i>What is left blank is my love confession</i> ♫

333
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,080
Master, Commander Xue has met him.

334
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,860
The time I saw his profile, I knew this was destiny.

335
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,060
Assign him to Sanyue.

336
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,940
He is a mortal with little spiritual power.

337
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,180
But he's innocent and smart.

338
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,320
It's good for him.

339
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,680
Yes, Master. You barely escaped from the fall.

340
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,780
Still, you're badly wounded.

341
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,740
You need rest.

342
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,720
They can renew their bond.

343
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,800
Aren't you happy for them?

344
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,180
They can have a happy ending. I am happy for them.

345
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,600
But you've lost too much.

346
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,500
Your legs...

347
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,200
I'm concerned about you.

348
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,880
Nothing is perfect in this miserable world.

349
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,260
Thousand Flower Valley is intact.

350
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,620
So are you.

351
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,560
That's enough.

352
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,580
What about you?

353
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,120
Me?

354
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm good.

355
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,540
Although I'm a cripple now, I'm free.

356
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,460
I can follow my heart.

357
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,780
More importantly, I can face myself.

358
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,660
You should be happy for me.

359
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,800
Yunhe and Chang Yi, any news about them?

360
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,620
Nothing from the volcano.

361
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,620
Chang Yi has been silent since he went to the human realm.

362
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,360
Do you want me to look for his trail?

363
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
Forget it. Let it be.

364
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,780
I trust in Yunhe.

365
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,360
She will keep her promise.

366
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,340
It's sunny outside. Let's take a walk.

367
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,880
Sure.

Chang Yi, think about it. Our story is like a fairy tale.

406
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,960
In the fairy tale, it's a dreamy world, but it looks so real.

407
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,680
How I wish that all the blessings can act like the breeze,

408
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,260
casting away the mist, and bringing happiness to the world.

409
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,220
By the way, how is your tail?

410
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,120
Just like the day we first met.

411
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,840
It's just... you haven't seen it.

412
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,220
I always find it weird.

413
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,260
Why are you so pure and innocent?

414
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,440
But now, I've witnessed the sea. Everything seems small in the vast ocean.

415
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,000
Obstacles are like sprinkles, they're just temporary.

416
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,140
No need to worry about them.

417
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,620
In this wide world, we live by each other.

418
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:47,820
Yunhe, this time, we shall never depart.

419
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,840
Chang Yi, now that you've got your tail back,

420
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,360
shall we have a race to see who swims faster?
