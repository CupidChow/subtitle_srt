00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,200
Something is wrong.

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,840
What is wrong?

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,600
Why is there a Wisteria tree on Mountain Qiongling?

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
You're focusing on the wrong thing, okay?

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,860
When telling a story, you need to add some details.

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,080
It's romantic. Understand?

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,740
That's not the point at all.

20
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,420
So what's the point?

21
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,140
The point is I made a lot of fish soup to stay with Sanyue.

22
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,520
So you can't just wait.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,480
If you want Ji Yunhe back, you need to do something.

24
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,140
How?

25
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,880
You have to learn a special skill to make her happy.

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,740
If you really want to follow my lead, you can cook yourself in a stew.

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,920
I'm just kidding.

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,700
Get real.

29
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,100
Honestly, I don't have any tips for you.

30
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,900
When I was the King of Mountain Qiongling, my life was amazing!

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,120
I was full of energy every night, romping all over the mountains.

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
But Sanyue was different.

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,100
She got up at 5:00 a.m. to practice and went to bed at 9:00 a.m.

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,760
<i>It's 9:00 p.m!</i>

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,200
Even the rats didn't come out at 9:00 p.m.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,980
How could I stand it?

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,860
Moreover, she hurt her back early on and needed to keep warm in her sleep.

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,300
But I'm covered in hair and couldn't stand the heat.

39
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,100
Now, you see, I could not only warm her bed,

40
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,220
but formed a good habit of early to bed and early to rise.

41
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,740
Because it makes Sanyue happy.

42
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,140
The smile of the girl you love is

43
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,120
better than the most beautiful flowers in the world.

44
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,120
Luo Luo, what did you bring me here for?

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,840
I asked Li Shu to help us.

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,780
Li Shu?

47
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,080
Don't worry. I didn't say anything about our plan.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,540
But Li Shu said you're his ally and he'll help you.

49
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,960
He also said that the key to the relationship between Chang Yi and you isn't how to please him.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,540
But you should let him get it and make you happy in turn.

51
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,220
In a word, as long as you come here tonight,

52
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,260
I'm sure he'll show you an obedient merman.

53
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,800
This cat doesn't seem very reliable at all.

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,960
You silly girl!

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,720
He and Xue Sanyue...

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,760
The thing between Xue Sanyue and him is real love.

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,640
Of course, any tricks can work.

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,580
But the thing between Big-tailed Fish and me is not real.

59
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,920
These two things aren't equivalent.

60
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,580
Ji Yunhe.

61
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,140
Bad news.

62
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,300
Your mermaid is very sick; frothing at the mouth and convulsing!

63
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,800
It must be Lin Haoqing!

64
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't follow her.

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,020
Let me go! Why did you stop me?

66
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,480
I asked you to help me, not to move me!

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,060
You silly cat!

68
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,000
What...

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,419
What a clever butterfly! What are you going to do?

70
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:19,739
I know I'm smarter than you.

71
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,020
But compliments can't work.

72
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,640
Let me go.

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,940
Just a sec, please.

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Big-tailed Fish!

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,780
Yunhe, come here.

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,080
What are you doing here?

77
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,600
Come on.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,740
You helped me take a bath.

79
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,140
I should give you the same experience in return.

80
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,320
It must be Li Shu who taught you, right?

81
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,060
Don't listen to him.

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,460
But I think what he said is right.

83
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,520
I should do it correctly.

84
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm going to do exactly what you did the other day.

85
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,740
I'll do anything for you, including rubbing you down, as long as you can forgive me.

86
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,840
No, no, I don't need that.

87
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Come on. Come here.

88
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,060
No, stay away!

89
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,000
A guest must do as his host does, right?

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,820
I should learn your custom of apology.

91
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,960
That's not our custom.

92
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,560
So you lied to me that day.

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,280
I didn't lie to you.

94
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,540
Then just accept it.

95
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,220
Wait a sec, wait! Don't!

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,240
No!

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,680
<i>Why are you yelling so loud?</i>

98
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,800
<i>Stay back!</i>

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,700
- What are you doing?
- It doesn't sound right.

100
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,500
That merman isn't beating Yunhe, is he? Let me go to take a look, okay?

101
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,580
What do you mean by "hit"? They are happy and fine, okay? Don't worry. It's okay.

102
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,240
Happy?

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,320
Let them spend one night alone, then any conflict will be solved.

104
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,220
Don't you want them to be a couple soon?

105
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,480
What is so great about being a couple?

106
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,840
Can it make her grow a tail?

107
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,640
It's said that the Phantom Butterfly from the Nanhai Sea is clever and reasonable.

108
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,600
But you... you are totally a different one.

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,880
I told you that you were the wittiest in Thousand Flower Valley.

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,000
I think I'm witty, too.

111
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
Witty?

112
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,220
Yes. Yeah, you're witty.

113
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,440
It's okay, Chang Yi.

114
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,020
Enough.

115
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,420
Are you really happy and touched?

116
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,260
Chang Yi, in fact, there are many ways for lovers to get along.

117
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,080
Bathing is not the only way.

118
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,200
Then, what do you like?

119
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,060
<i>Since Yunhe is going to lie to Chang Yi,</i>

120
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,920
<i>it's better to be more real.</i>

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,460
<i>Some books say a predestined relationship for 100 years</i>

122
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,340
<i>will lead them to sleep on the same pillow.</i>

123
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,340
<i>The best way is to sleep together!</i>

124
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,860
Don't give any unwanted advice.

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,480
Really?

126
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,500
Yes. I like sleeping the best. Come here.

127
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
I sleep on that side, and you on this side.

128
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,120
Close your eyes and sleep.

129
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,480
It's my favorite thing.

130
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,140
All right. I'm glad you like it.

131
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,500
Little Butterfly, you're very reliable at a critical time.

132
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,720
Oh, no.

133
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,840
Can't you hear that there's no sound there?

134
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,420
Let's go in and see if they're asleep.

135
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,260
I just complimented you but you're being silly again.

136
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,120
Everything will fall into place. It'll be successful.

137
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,480
All right. Let's go. Go back.

138
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,640
No, I...

139
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,960
Go where you want to go. I'll wait here for Yunhe.

140
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,740
Well, you stay here by yourself.

141
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,160
I'll get back to Sanyue.

142
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,780
<i>I never thought I, the guardian of Thousand Flower Valley,</i>

143
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,660
<i>would be so messed up by a fish.</i>

144
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,679
Chang Yi.

145
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,080
You fell asleep so soon!

146
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,820
You're such a good-looking fish.

147
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,640
What the hell are you giggling at?

148
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,880
Are you still thinking about Yunhe and the merman?

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm telling you... That fish looks silly,

150
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,800
but in fact he's very clever.

151
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,660
He can infer other things from one fact.

152
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,140
Keep your nose out of it.

153
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,240
Sanyue, you're always alone.

154
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,220
But this time you've got an ally, so I'm going to have to do something.

155
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,340
By the way, Sanyue, it's cold today.

156
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,380
The wound on your back must be hurting again.

157
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,600
Let me warm you up, okay?

158
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,580
Come here.

159
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,560
Let me do it.

160
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,920
<i>Can she warm herself with a fish?</i>

161
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,200

178
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,460
What did you say?

179
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,140
Ji Yunhe sneaked into Reflect Cave several times during the ban on training?

180
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,200
Yes. And Guardian Ji seemed intimate with a merman.

181
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
Why did you report it so late?

182
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,700
I... I saw it by accident.

183
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,140
I didn't see it very clearly.

184
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,060
So I was afraid to tell Young Master.

185
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,720
But I felt uneasy about hiding it.

186
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,320
Please make the decision.

187
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,320
You're awake.

188
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,880
What are you doing?

189
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,220
I said that we couldn't sleep on the same side.

190
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,660
Why...

191
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,840
Your face's burning.

192
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,520
What did you do last night?

193
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,480
Did you cook yourself?

194
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,740
I thought you were cold.

195
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,520
So I...

196
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,920
You used your spiritual power to warm me up, right?

197
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,540
Are you crazy?

198
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
You mermen like to be cold and can't stand the heat.

199
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,500
Weren't you afraid of pain when you did this?

200
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,040
I was afraid that you were in pain.

201
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,540
I saw you in agony when you were asleep.

202
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,300
In the sea, only a fish that had suffered acted like that.

203
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,000
Therefore, I wanted you to sleep better.

204
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,060
Why?

205
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,960
What do you mean "why"?

206
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,880
Why are you being so nice to me?

207
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
You said it.

208
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,800
We are lovers.

209
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,460
And you're so nice to me.

210
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,060
I'm happy when you're happy.

211
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,340
Yunhe, you're finally out.

212
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,700
How are things with you and him?

213
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,560
Sleeping with you all night, did he say yes?

214
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,700
What's going on?

215
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,440
Let's go back.

216
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,440
Young Master, do you believe it now?

217
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,400
I'm afraid Ji Yunhe is having an affair with the merman.

218
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,540
Xue Sanyue let Ji Yunhe sneak into that cave

219
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,700
several times during the ban for personal gain.

220
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,440
Maybe they're already in collusion.

221
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,830
Do you know what you're talking about?

222
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,360
Collusion is different from having a secret relationship with Earth Immortals.

223
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,300
She's just trying to placate that merman.

224
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,260
Considering what's happened since the merman came here,

225
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,720
do you really think it's just placation?

226
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,800
She's the guardian of Thousand Flower Valley after all.

227
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,320
A few words are not enough.

228
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,700
You're thoughtful, Young Master.

229
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,660
But women often know more about relationships than men do.

230
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,520
I'm worried about this because of you.

231
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,240
Young Master, please trust me this time.

232
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,080
If I guessed wrong, I'm willing to pay for it with my life.

233
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,500
Luo Luo, can you stop giving me your bad ideas next time?

234
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,440
When did I give you a bad idea?

235
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,880
Didn't you sleep warmly?

236
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,320
Ji Yunhe, there's something wrong with you.

237
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,620
You're not convinced by the merman to follow him into the sea, are you?

238
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,520
In fact, when I was a kid, I was always afraid to go to sleep.

239
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Every time Lin Canglan unleashed the Frost Mark,

240
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,700
I was always sore, cold, and tired.

241
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,440
I was afraid to sleep.

242
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,240
I was afraid that if I closed my eyes,

243
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,620
I wouldn't be able to open them again.

244
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,960
But last night,

245
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,460
I slept soundly.

246
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,040
If I really let Big-tailed Fish lose his tail,

247
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,640
will he never forgive me again?

248
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,460
Ji Yunhe, what on earth happened to you?

249
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,380
Since you met him, you have become indecisive.

250
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,320
You're not really into him, are you?

251
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,520
We need to focus on escaping. I have no other thoughts.

252
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,000
All right.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,340
There's something wrong in Thousand Flower Valley.

254
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:11,440
I have a feeling that Lin Haoqing is going to do something awful.

255
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,460
Qing Shu, Master is still on a retreat.

256
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,599
Is there anything urgent to call all of us over?

257
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,060
It's a matter of great urgency.

258
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,140
I have to act on behalf of Master.

259
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,440
Elders, do you remember our most important commandment?

260
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,300
It's forbidden, of course, for a Spiritual Master to fall in love with an Earth Immortal.

261
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,760
Good.

262
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,020
The attendants of Spiritual Masters were selected from among the Earth Immorals.

263
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,040
But Young Master received a secret message

264
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,880
that said a Spiritual Master was secretly in love with an attendant.

265
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,140
Usually, Master is very kind, governing our valley gently.

266
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,560
But I never thought someone would make such a big mistake.

267
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,720
Maybe it's a rumor. Someone is wanting to mislead us.

268
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,740
It's about the reputation of Thousand Flower Valley.

269
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,580
Who dares to make a rumor out of this?

270
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,280
Well, maybe.

271
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,980
If someone is jealous of someone else's work, wants to frame others,

272
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,140
and tries to disturb our peace, he must have concealed intentions.

273
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,560
Thousand Flower Valley won't stigmatize anyone.

274
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,480
This mirror is called "Mirror of Love."

275
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,200
It's a treasure for identifying this.

276
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,540
Put the blood of a Spiritual Master and his attendant on it.

277
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,320
If one has feelings for the other,

278
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,480
the blood will melt automatically.

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,840
I invited the elders today to be witnesses.

280
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,660
Let's see who made such a big mistake.

281
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,560
Guardian Ji is the top one of this generation.

282
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,700
Guardian Ji, please do it first.

283
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,800
Master Qing Shu, Guardian Ji and her attendant, Luo Jinsang, are like sisters.

284
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,880
It shouldn't be a test between Luo Jinsang and her.

285
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,680
I didn't know that Guardian had any other attendants.

286
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,800
It's not an attendant.

287
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,820
But she's training an exceedingly beautiful merman.

288
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,680
A merman?

289
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,640
That merman is the attendant that Fairy Shunde chose.

290
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,580
Coveting the attendant of Fairy Shunde is doubly guilty.

291
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,280
So that's what they're trying to do.

292
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,420
He's going to do everything he can do to win me.

293
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,680
But isn't it a little serious to have so many elders

294
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,580
and spiritual masters here?

295
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,260
I'm just looking out for your reputation.

296
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,220
Guardian Ji, it's good for you to shut those mouths with facts.

297
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,700
But the merman is locked in the Reflect Cave.

298
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,220
It's inconvenient.

299
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,160
So let's give the others a blood test. Go to Reflect Cave after the test.

300
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,880
You are so noisy.

301
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,460
I found that Thousand Flower Valley is a lucky spot, providing good food and drinks.

302
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,240
Therefore, I condescended to come here.

303
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,100
But you guys are surprisingly troublesome.

304
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,320
I won't stay here anymore.

305
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,040
Stop!

306
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,060
Master Qing Shu, Young Master is wounded.

307
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,880
Master Qing Shu. I'm afraid I'll give out.

308
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,220
Please stop here today and continue the test tomorrow.

309
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,320
Hand this person over to me. He'll be severely penalized.

310
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,380
Do as what Young Master said.

311
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,140
You took Li Shu's hit on purpose.

312
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,520
What are you trying to do?

313
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,380
You don't worry about tomorrow's test

314
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,220
but care so much about another's attendant.

315
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,440
Could it be that you're sure in tomorrow's test

316
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,120
he and Xue Sanyue will be found guilty?

317
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,360
I see, Li Shu is covering Commander Xue.

318
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,260
That explains why Xue is so partial to Guardian.

319
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,500
You've already got something on her.

320
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,280
I'm your target.

321
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,940
Don't get the innocent involved.

322
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,080
We will deal with you later.

323
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,820
Just wait and see.

324
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,020
Okay. I'll wait.

325
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,280
Young Master, although we could catch Xue Sanyue and Li Shu,

326
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,000
we can't find fault with Ji Yunhe.

327
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,060
I think she is not worried about herself.

328
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,560
It's not the only way to convict her.

329
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,520
Go to a place for me.

330
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,540
How's it going? Any progress?

331
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,520
Relax.

332
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,740
Mirror of Love only works for those falling in love.

333
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,960
Li Shu and Xue Sanyue should worry.

334
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,840
Why are you nervous?

335
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,320
Do you and the fish really have something going on?

336
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,720
Nonsense!

337
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,480
Read the books, hurry!

338
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,200
Tomorrow is the public test.

339
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,120
Xue and I are of the same school.

340
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,540
How can I leave her to sink?

341
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,040
But that Mirror of Love is an ancient treasure.

342
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,120
There's no way to fool it.

343
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,060
Then ruin it.

344
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,600
What did you say?

345
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,320
The guard of the hall will slack at midnight.

346
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,520
Ji Yunhe, are you willing to go with me?

347
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,900
Yunhe won't do that.

348
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,620
If she gets caught, the conviction will be affirmed.

349
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
Also, Yunhe...

350
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,540
As allies, we share weal and woe.

351
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,260
Besides, the thing you worry about

352
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,420
couldn't get solved unless the Mirror of Love is destroyed.

353
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,580
I'm not afraid of Lin Canglan, how can I be afraid of his son?

354
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,620
What are you doing?

355
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,080
<i>Li Shu, where are you?</i>

356
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,160
<i>Commander Xue.</i>

357
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,200
<i>Young Master knows you love your attendant, so you would come and save him.</i>

358
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,080
<i>So he asked me to wait here and tell you that Li Shu is somewhere else. But he is fine.</i>

359
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,800
<i>Words left by Young Master must be more than that.</i>

360
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,280
<i>You should know Young Master's purpose is just to beat Ji Yunhe.</i>

361
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,960
<i>What's between you and your attendant is not what he cares about.</i>

362
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,700
<i>Since Commander Xue has decided to find an ally, why not choose one who can bring more benefits?</i>

363
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,120
<i>What does he want?</i>

364
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,660
<i>Tonight, let Ji Yunhe destroy the Mirror of Love.</i>

365
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,060
<i>Only in this way, can you save Li Shu's life.</i>

366
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,900
<i>It's like asking a tiger for its skin.</i>

367
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,960
<i>Why should I believe you?</i>

368
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,660
<i>For Li Shu's sake, does Commander Xue have a better choice?</i>

369
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,060
<i>You'd better keep your word.</i>

370
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,680
Master Qing Shu.

371
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,600
What happened?

372
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,340
I went around at midnight and saw Guardian Ji act covertly around the Shrillwind Hall.

373
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,380
So I sent a message to Young Master and followed Guardian Ji into the hall

374
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,260
to find out what she was doing.

375
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,020
Master Qing Shu, Haoqing also got a confidential report

376
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,860
that Ji Yunhe intended to destroy Mirror of Love tonight,

377
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,560
which echoes with Commander Xue.

378
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,460
So I dared to invite you to come with us.

379
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,240
But it's too late.

380
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,120
The Mirror of Love has been destroyed.

381
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Master Qing Shu, Ji Yunhe doped the guards and destroyed the Mirror of Love.

382
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,540
Whether she had an affair with others or not, she should be sent to Reflect Cave.

383
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,960
Master will deal with her when he comes out.

384
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,420
Guardian Ji, as a Spiritual Master, how can you deliberately break the rules!

385
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,600
Master Qing Shu, you accuse me of destroying the Mirror of Love.

386
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,460
Then what's that?

387
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,140
Siyu said that I doped the guard. I was worried that someone would destroy the treasure.

388
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,980
So I came here to check.

389
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,260
Unexpectedly, when I arrived, the guard had already been doped.

390
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,000
In an emergency, I stepped into the hall to check.

391
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,880
Luckily, the Mirror of Love is fine.

392
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,020
Master Qing Shu, Ji Yunhe is very crafty.

393
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,660
Maybe, she was prepared.

394
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:37,860
Siyu, everyone in this valley, except for Master, respectfully calls me Guardian.

395
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,800
You are just an attendant. How dare you be brusque with me!

396
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,660
But like a great person, I am broad-minded. I will ignore it.

397
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,220
Since everyone cares about whether I had an affair with the merman, don't wait until tomorrow.

398
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,180
Use the Mirror of Love today to find the answer.

399
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,340
Go and get the merman's blood.

400
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,800
Yes.

401
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,000
See?

402
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,400
Can it prove my innocence now?

403
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Xue Sanyue, did you help her?

404
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,920
You don't care about Li Shu's life?

405
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,400
Master Qing Shu, Xue Sanyue loves her attendant, Li Shu, and has colluded with Ji Yunshu.

406
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,260
This must be their trap!

407
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,460
When the rule of Thousand Flower Valley gets so terrible that even a crazy dog can bite anyone?

408
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,540
Master Qing Shu, when you held the test in the morning,

409
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,260
Li Shu made trouble suddenly. Isn't it suspicious?

410
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,240
Commander Xue, since everyone is here, why don't you have a test, too?

411
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,040
Qu Xiaoxing.

412
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,400
Haoqing, you asked someone to remove Li Shu secretly.

413
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,740
I also asked someone to follow secretly.

414
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,800
See? I didn't let you down.

415
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,580
It is quite lively here.

416
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,900
Commander Xue.

417
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,340
Impossible. It must be a fake.

418
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,840
Ji Yunhe must have changed the mirror.

419
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,520
You can say whatever you want.

420
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,600
Test yourself, and see whether it's a fake or not.

421
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,960
You're an attendant too, right?

422
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,880
Enough. Since we've cleared the air, let's call it a day.

423
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,420
Master Qing Shu, Haoqing worked rashly and made trouble.

424
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,820
I'm prepared to accept my punishment.

425
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,340
She made such big trouble. Why do you want to call it a day?

426
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,740
Somebody, lead Siyu away.

427
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,320
Wait!

428
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,620
Don't you want to know whether the Mirror of Love is a fake?

429
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,400
You said everyone in the valley should be tested.

430
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,970
But only your attendant is an exception.

431
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,980
Isn't it unfair?

432
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,700
Young Master, please don't.

433
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,980
How dare you have wishful thinking about Young Master!

434
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,260
- Ji Yunhe!
- Stop!

435
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,340
Attendant Siyu has a crush on her master,

436
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,880
spread slander, and attacked others.

437
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,100
Combining all the punishments, send her to Reflect Cave first.

438
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,360
Execute her another day and wipe out her spirit.

439
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,980
Young Master's blood didn't move.

440
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,880
Your heart is untouched, but you failed in the duty of oversight.

441
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
You are grounded.

442
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,260
Haoqing is at your disposal.

443
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,940
Why do you lead me here?

444
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,140
If you want to save your life, be quiet.

445
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,760
Master Qing Shu?

446
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,280
You've followed Young Master for a long time and gone through fire and water for him.

447
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,500
Some credit should go to you.

448
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,000
But in front of the public, I must punish you severely.

449
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,180
These days, you have to pay the penalty.

450
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,980
When Master is out, I'll persuade him to give you a chance of survival by exiling you.

451
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,620
You're not gonna kill me?

452
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:01,220
Having feelings that can't be expressed isn't always a fault.

453
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,900
If you leave the valley and forget it, maybe you can still find a living.

454
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,940
That's all I can do for you.

455
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,420
Take her away.

456
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,240
Master, Young Master needs a helper!

457
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,280
He needs me to contend with Ji Yunhe!

458
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,640
Please let me stay!

459
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,440
Don't fancy yourself.

460
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,560
You're not that important.

461
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,580
Before the feelings get stronger, leave.

462
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,720
Or it will be too late.

463
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,080
Take her away.

464
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,540
<i>Were you abandoned, too?</i>

465
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,660
<i>Live a good life. At least don't die here.</i>

466
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,520
<i>Your attendant Siyu bows before Young Master.</i>

467
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,160
<i>The selection of attendants is full of hard steps.</i>

468
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,020
<i>You fought your way up here. Why?</i>

469
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,580
<i>Three hundred years ago, in Snake Cave, Young Master saved Siyu's life.</i>

470
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,800
<i>I don't need you to pay me back.</i>

471
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,820
<i>You've told me to live a good life.</i>

472
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,700
<i>You saved my life. I owe you my loyalty.</i>

473
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,060
<i>Please accept me.</i>

474
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,200
<i>From now on, you're my attendant.</i>

475
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,500
<i>From now on, Siyu will follow you, Young Master.</i>

476
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,400
<i>I have had no other wish my whole life.</i>

477
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,400
<i>I only wish Young Master gets what he wants.</i>

478
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,000
Time for punishment. Come on.

479
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,200
As Young Master, being grounded is just a form.

480
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,000
Why be hard on yourself?

481
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,700
Follow the rules strictly, so that there's no blame in the valley.

482
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,800
Well, having the great ambition of being the master,

483
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
no wonder you're different from idlers like me.

484
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,100
I've heard that you want to apologize to me in person.

485
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,600
It is unnecessary to waste our time.

486
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Xue Sanyue pretended to cooperate with me

487
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
but told you the whole plan.

488
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,700
Under her cover, you broke and substituted the mirror. Right?

489
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,400
Do you have any evidence?

490
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
I do have no evidence.

491
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,900
I'm just curious about what you promised her

492
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,600
to get her back to your side.

493
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,000
If you don't want me to find Qing Shu again, make it clear to me.

494
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
If Xue Sanyue could betray me so easily,

495
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,200
she wouldn't have been my ally at the very beginning.

496
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,500
From beginning to end,

497
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,600
she'd never been on your side.

498
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
<i>Lin Haoqing asked me to come here.</i>

499
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,600
<i>Tonight Lin Haoqing will ask Master Qing Shu to catch you at the hall.</i>

500
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
<i>You could have cooperated with Lin Haoqing.</i>

501
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,600
<i>Why in the end, did you decide to help me?</i>

502
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,200
<i>The person I love should never be anothers' chip.</i>

503
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,200
<i>Whoever dares to touch him should pay a price.</i>

504
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,400
<i>Good. I'll do your favor.</i>

505
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,600
<i>Found it!</i>

506
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,200
<i>I found the way to make a fake one.</i>

507
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,400
<i>There must be a good play.</i>

508
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,000
<i>Wait.</i>

509
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,500
<i>Don't you want to know whether the Mirror of Love is a fake?</i>

510
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,400
So when you tested yourself and Xue Sanyue, you used the fake one.

511
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Only when testing Siyu, you used the real one.

512
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,600
Everyone was being used by you.

513
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,200
You really have means.

514
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Please remember a word.

515
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Harm set, harm get.

516
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
What are you afraid of?

517
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Since there is no fear in your heart

518
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,400
and no affair between you and the merman,

519
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,100
why use the fake one to test yourself?

520
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,200
Could it be that you and the merman

521
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,300
aren't purely playing mind games?

522
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,000
I don't understand your word.

523
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Ji Yunhe, I've told you...

524
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,600
Don't get burned by playing with fire.

525
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,400
Bad news. Siyu escaped.

526
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,400
You get prepared!

527
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,000
You've brought realgar!

528
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,400
I must prevent an attack from a trapped beast.

529
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,800
I used to have pity for you.

530
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,500
Now I just feel sad for you.

531
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,800
Even if I die, I must help Young Master kill you.

532
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,400
Young Master, why?

533
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,300
I told you.

534
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,000
Do not lay a finger on my business.

535
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,200
An attendant for a hundred years can be killed so easily.

536
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,400
When I was gone,

537
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Young Master became crueler.

538
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,000
It is harder and harder to read Lin Haoqing's mind.

539
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,400
He is scheming.

540
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Compared with him, your Chang Yi is so naive.

541
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,200
You'd better care about your Li Shu first.

542
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,600
This trouble must have made him suffer.

543
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,600
Thank you for this time.

544
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,000
Our cooperation isn't just about interests.

545
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,600
Thank-you gift?

546
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,400
Li Shu said that the rest of the Mirror of Love

547
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,000
can be exchanged for some spirit stones.

548
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,600
Li Shu asked you to give it to me?

549
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,800
Don't you want it?

550
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,100
No.

551
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,700
Even the smallest fly has meat.

552
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,600
<i>Since there is no fear in your heart</i>

553
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,400
<i>and no affair between you and the merman,</i>

554
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,600
<i>why use the fake one to test yourself?</i>

555
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,400
<i>Could it be that you and the merman</i>

556
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,300
<i>aren't purely playing mind games?</i>

557
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,700
<i>Ji Yunhe, Lin Haoqing asked the right question.</i>

558
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,200
<i>Why are you afraid to use the Mirror of Love to test yourself?</i>

559
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,000
<i>Could it be that you have feelings for Chang Yi?</i>

560
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,700
<i>Don't you know the answer?</i>

561
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:38,700
<i>What result would have the Mirror of Love given?</i>

562
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:01,100
