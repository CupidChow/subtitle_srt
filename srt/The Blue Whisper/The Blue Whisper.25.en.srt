She loves freedom, more than her life.

21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,760
You trapped her like this, can she be happy?

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,300
Well. You don't want her to leave North Abyss, that is okay.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,780
But you don't have to lock her up on Lake Island.

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,160
How oppressive.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,760
Can't you each take a step back?

26
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,080
If you love someone, you'll want to make them happy.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Or how can you say that it's love?

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,840
When did I tell you that I still loved her?

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,140
You don't need to tell me.

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,340
Follow your heart.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,060
It's late. I have to go back to make soup for Sanyue.

32
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,640
<i>I don't know what has happened to Yunhe.</i>

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,900
<i>Damn that rope!</i>

34
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,100
<i>Is it so powerful?</i>

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,240
<i>Let's have a try.</i>

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,640
Luo Jinsang, don't move.

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,700
So I still can't leave your sight.

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,620
Don't worry.

39
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,300
This time I won't take off your clothes.

40
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,460
Where do you want to go?

41
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,960
Do you really want to stay with me?

42
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,400
You can't close your eyes.

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,120
I must stay within your sight.

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,020
If by any chance the spell pulls me back, what if I fall into your heart?

45
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,440
How could you fall into my heart?

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,840
Do you have any logic?

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,740
When you close your eyes, what you see is your heart.

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,240
What you see is what is on your mind.

49
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,220
Well. Will I fall into your heart...

50
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,840
or on your mind?

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,109
Luo Jinsang, did you do it on purpose?

52
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,840
I'm thinking...

53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,020
your mind...

54
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,540
How is Yunhe?

55
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,140
I've locked her up.

56
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,840
Chang Yi, why did you do that?

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,700
You know clearly what she wants.

58
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,460
If you give her freedom, you won't lose anything. Why won't you agree?

59
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,360
Listen. Not this time, I'll do it next time.

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,840
If it doesn't work next time, I'll do it next time.

61
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
One day I will succeed.

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,100
Do you know what's going on now?

63
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,540
The rumors say Ji Yunhe practices forbidden spells.

64
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,000
Everyone thinks it's she who killed Qing Shu.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,340
So many people are spying on her and want to kill her.

66
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,980
Stay here or get killed outside.

67
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,254
If you were her, how would you decide?

68
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,840
Outside North Abyss, Immortal Master and Shunde are so aggressive.

69
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Inside North Abyss, the Fox Clan also wants to kill her.

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,660
It's a big world. But except for the Cloud Quarters,

71
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,700
there is no place for Ji Yunhe to stay.

72
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,460
After all, you still love her.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,460
I won't let her go, and I won't let her get killed.

74
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,960
No matter if it's obsession or torture,

75
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,740
she must stay alive and suffer.

76
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,780
In the world, only love is difficult to solve.

77
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,620
Xue Sanyue and Li Shu couldn't solve it.

78
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,120
You and Ji Yunhe can't solve it, either.

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,260
None of you can get out of it.

80
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,920
How about you? Can you get out of it?

81
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,600
Why are you involving me?

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,080
When did I fall in love with someone?

83
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,900
A doctor does not cure himself.

84
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,960
You also can't get back.

85
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,760
<i>Sanyue's favorite food. Don't touch it.</i>

86
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,860
<i>Sanyue's medicine for practicing martial arts. Don't touch it.</i>

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,740
<i>I do follow Sanyue everywhere,</i>

88
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,980
<i>but if she feels bored and wants to leave here to have a quiet life.</i>

89
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,520
<i>That's fine.</i>

90
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,980
<i>If you don't want me to be the Lynx prince,</i>

91
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,660
<i>I'd like to be your attendant.</i>

92
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,127
Why are you smiling?

93
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,040
The view is beautiful.

94
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,000
So are you. I want to see you more.

95
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,000
You've seen Chang Yi?

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,840
Sanyue, I didn't want to keep it a secret. I was afraid that you will get into a fight.

97
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,100
Then...

98
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,900
I'm not angry.

99
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,220
How about your talk?

100
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,420
He just deceives himself.

101
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,440
So stubborn.

102
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,160
In his heart, he clearly cares about Yunhe,

103
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,180
but he refuses to say anything.

104
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,900
Same goes for Yunhe.

105
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,960
The person you are thinking about is right in front of you.

106
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,180
No one explains. Both of them just torture themselves.

107
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,280
Two stubborn lovers are angry with each other.

108
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,660
I just hope that...

109
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,140
they won't regret until there is no turning back.

110
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,720
Sanyue, why are you looking at me?

111
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,200
Is there anything on my face?

112
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,800
In the past, I always thought that things in the world were either one or the other.

113
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,860
Dilemma or difficulties: those were excuses.

114
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,720
But now when I see Yunhe and Chang Yi's entanglement,

115
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,559
I seem to suddenly understand.

116
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,260
Everything is not that simple in the world.

117
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,340
There are so many dilemmas,

118
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,520
and it's hard to make a choice.

119
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,220
Li Shu, was it the same situation as this when you saved Qing Ji?

120
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,580
Sanyue, I'm sorry.

121
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,325
- I...
- I don't blame you.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,107
I said I don't blame you anymore.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,140
What do you mean?

124
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,610
Sanyue, I think it's better to say it clearly.

125
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,720
I will believe what you say.

126
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,360
Actually, I don't hate you anymore.

127
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,100
I just don't know how to start over.

128
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,820
So I've been indulging in grief and can't extricate myself.

129
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,840
I don't dare say what I think in my mind.

130
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,660
Yunhe and Chang Yi are like that.

131
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,560
I'm in the same situation, too.

132
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,500
Between us, it's me who is not brave.

133
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,500
After the Ten Directions Formation was broken, I always ignored you.

134
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,420
You always smiled.

135
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,020
You never complained about it.

136
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,200
And you were always with me when I needed your help.

137
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,740
During this period, I know you were trying to make up for your mistake.

138
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,720
But I didn't give you any hope.

139
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,660
For you, that's too cruel.

140
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,980
No. Not at all, Sanyue.

141
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm always thinking that I can pay back what I owe Qing Ji with my life.

142
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,280
What I owe you,

143
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,742
I don't know...

144
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,900
I don't know how to pay you back.

145
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,620
You don't owe me anything.

146
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,720
Really. Nothing.

147
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,240
I've heard what you said to Chang Yi.

148
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,500
That's right.

149
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,900
Loving someone means that you'd like to make him or her happy.

150
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,580
I don't want you to be anxious and cautious like now.

151
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,180
I'd like to see you still shining and confident.

152
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,440
So you mean that...

153
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,760
you still love me?

154
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,575
I love you.

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,680
Let's restart our life.

156
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,140
♫ <i>We shine like the same light</i> ♫

157
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,040
♫ <i>The same brightness</i> ♫

158
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,480
♫ <i>And become the light together</i> ♫

159
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:38,440
♫ <i>What is left blank is my love confession</i> ♫

160
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,560
It hurts.

161
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,560
Immortal Fairy!

162
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,580
Immortal Master ordered that you can't touch your face after treatment.

163
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,180
No. It hurts.

164
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,040
I can't bear that.

165
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,140
Let me go!

166
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,380
Immortal Fairy, this medicine was sent by Master Lin to ease your pain.

167
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,920
Allow him in.

168
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,460
Immortal Fairy.

169
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,680
Did you bring this?

170
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
I hope it can ease your pain.

171
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,100
What reward do you want?

172
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,640
I don't want anything.

173
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,600
I just have a question.

174
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,740
Say it.

175
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,620
There is always a person in my heart that I respect.

176
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,760
But recently, she seems to feel very confused.

177
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,940
What she cherishes was destroyed by others.

178
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,080
I feel so sorry for her.

179
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,640
But more desperately, the one she loves doesn't care about her at all.

180
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,680
Even more, she has to suffer a lot every day.

181
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,060
If you were her, do you think it was worth it?

182
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,420
You are dismissed.

183
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,280
Yes.

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,520
What do you mean?

185
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,620
Immortal Fairy knows what I mean.

186
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,340
Or you wouldn't need to ask others to leave.

187
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,280
I think you've noticed.

188
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,540
If Immortal Master really cared about you, how could he ignore your pain?

189
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,700
No.

190
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,080
Master cares about me.

191
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,220
What he did was to cure me.

192
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,360
Even I can make medicine easily to ease your pain,

193
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,460
why didn't Immortal Master give it to you?

194
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,200
There is only one reason.

195
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Immortal Master doesn't care about your pain at all.

196
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,080
What he cares about is only your appearance.

197
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Shut up!

198
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,660
You liar. That's not true.

199
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,460
Yes, what I say doesn't exactly count.

200
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,640
You are the one who feels the pain.

201
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,700
Have you never doubted the reason before?

202
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,200
Have you really never thought if Immortal Master was actually looking at you...

203
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,560
or someone else?

204
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,380
<i>How dare you! Why did you change your clothes?</i>

205
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,620
Lin Haoqing, don't try to instigate my hatred towards Immortal Master.

206
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,100
Say one more word, and I'll kill you now.

207
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,760
What I said today was because I'm loyal to Immortal Fairy.

208
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,000
I just wanted to kindly remind you.

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,700
It was not only your face that was hurt, but also your heart.

210
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,440
If you want to make sure about what I told you,

211
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,680
why don't you go to Immortal Master's Quiet Chamber to have a look?

212
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,420
There is a secret room.

213
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,625
The answer is there.

214
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,625
Get out!

215
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,360
Master, Shunde's temperament is too weird.

216
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Maybe she won't follow what you told her but will kill you instead.

217
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,800
Why don't we go back to Thousand Flower Valley and plan next?

218
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,640
Her not killing me...

219
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,660
means that she listened to what I said.

220
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,920
She is willful and cruel, but if we take advantage of that,

221
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,860
it's the best weapon to fight against Immortal Master.

222
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,380
Right. What happened to the Spiritual Master who was sent to North Abyss before?

223
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,960
Our spy has entered North Abyss.

224
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,900
I believe we will get a message soon.

225
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
You've gathered so many people here.

226
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,200
Is there something important to discuss?

227
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,280
On behalf of them,

228
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,920
today Qing Yao would like to recommend one person to be the leader of North Abyss.

229
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,740
Firstly, we can gather people and reunite the immortals of North Abyss

230
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,640
to maintain harmony and peace well.

231
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,280
Secondly, to intimidate Immortal Master Mansion.

232
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,120
Immortal Master and Shunde will know clearly that North Abyss has a leader.

233
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,240
We won't be bullied by them.

234
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,140
We won't let them threaten us at will.

235
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,944
Then, who is the perfect candidate in your mind?

236
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:19,160
You. Merman Prince.

237
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,840
Prince, you don't want to be the leader?

238
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,180
I'm just a guest here.

239
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,240
I'm not suitable for that position.

240
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,240
At that time, we were saved by Prince Chang Yi.

241
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,940
Since Father escaped from No Desire Cave, he will need time to recover.

242
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,120
All of the matters of North Abyss were taken over by you.

243
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,320
All immortals were gathered and arranged by you.

244
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,420
You have many ideas and are trustworthy.

245
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,360
I've talked with them about this.

246
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,460
We all agree to it.

247
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,840
Prince, please don't decline it.

248
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,160
<i>- Right.
- Yeah.</i>

249
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,060
Chang Yi, North Abyss does need a leader now...

250
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,180
<i>Please lead the North Abyss, Master.</i>

251
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,159
Fine. I'll do it.

252
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,219
<i>We pay our respects, Master.</i>

253
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,440
I thought you wouldn't promise them so soon according to your behavior style.

254
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,640
I do not want to be the leader.

255
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,080
And it won't stop me from fighting against Immortal Master

256
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,000
and protecting North Abyss.

257
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,460
Then, why did you promise them?

258
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,160
The North Abyss needs to reunite people and expel darkness,

259
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,940
to no longer fear injustice and coercion.

260
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,640
That's why I must promise to be the leader.

261
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,820
As it's so urgent, why did you hesitate?

262
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,000
Actually, everyone knows your ability and sincerity clearly.

263
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,020
What you are worried about isn't whether you have the ability to assume the role of Master of the North Abyss.

264
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,760
But you are worried that your private matters will be involved in the business of the North Abyss.

265
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,240
You can't act out of personal considerations

266
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,280
to care about someone or something. Right?

267
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,020
About your entanglement, others can't force you to do anything or help you, either.

268
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,920
So I hope that you can solve that as soon as possible.

269
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,460
Young Lord, are you okay?

270
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,160
I'm fine.

271
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,240
You come here to cure his elixir every day.

272
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,200
You've consumed too much of your power.

273
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,520
It's okay.

274
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,780
My spiritual power is limited.

275
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,680
But it's good enough that Chang Yi is here to lead North Abyss,

276
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,360
or I wouldn't be able to handle both.

277
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,940
Because it's your proposal, Prince Chang Yi agreed to it.

278
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,120
Prince does care for you.

279
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,340
Moreover, which woman in the world is more suitable for Prince than you?

280
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,700
No, it's Master.

281
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,240
Okay.

282
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,840
The next step is the enthronement ceremony of the Master.

283
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,880
This is about the prestige of Chang Yi,

284
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,940
and the morale of all the Immortals here.

285
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,100
Be sure to prepare well and don't make any mistakes.

286
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,713
Yes.

287
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,800
Why doesn't this mark get lighter?

288
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,300
Well, will I live my whole life with this mark?

289
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,160
Isn't it good to be alive?

290
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,340
Yeah. It's good to be alive.

291
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,880
But what matters is the way you live.

292
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,760
For my whole life, I've been fighting against my fate.

293
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,960
When I fought against Lin Canglan,

294
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,260
Shunde, or Immortal Master,

295
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,120
I have never given up.

296
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,240
And looking back at these battles now,

297
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,880
I won some and also lost some.

298
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,860
Until today,

299
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,640
haven't the battles been fierce?

300
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,680
Even so, my life is still my own decision.

301
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,620
I... I don't understand.

302
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,535
A'Ming, I want to take a break.

303
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,640
Outside of North Abyss,

304
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,440
with such good scenery, I can only stay here.

305
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,060
Otherwise, I can clean this house.

306
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,460
When did you get here?

307
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,700
It's not time for dinner yet.

308
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,640
What do you want to do?

309
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,500
I took it out and shook it.

310
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,900
Shake it.

311
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,340
I'm done shaking.

312
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,103
Put it back.

313
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Since you're already here,

314
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,560
why don't we start our meal early?

315
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,800
<i>Suicide is too painful and not guaranteed.</i>

316
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,000
<i>Jumping down from this short building,</i>

317
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>at best, can only hurt the buttocks.</i>

318
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,200
<i>A hunger strike?</i>

319
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
<i>But I'm not a mortal.</i>

320
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,400
<i>And the daily scheduled delivery of medicinal food</i>

321
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,200

<i>How about suffocating myself by holding my breath?</i>

323
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,600
<i>How about setting fire to the house?</i>

324
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000

325
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,100

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The weather has gotten colder in recent days

328
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,800
and my hands and feet are cold.

329
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,600
Get me some more pots of coal.

330
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,000
Is there any red charcoal in the yard?

331
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,200
Yes.

332
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,700
Then get me the red charcoal.

333
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,800
I've heard that charcoal is the best.

334
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Remember to get more pots for me.

335
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,400
I can use more when it's cold

336
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
and warm up a bit.

337
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What's wrong?

338
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
It's nothing.

339
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,800
You're getting more and more solemn.

340
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,600
Compared with the past, you have changed a lot.

341
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200

342

I like to look at you while eating.

344
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,300
You're a little weird today.

Prince?

346
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Prince, Young Lord Qing Yao wants to talk to you.

347
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,000
Go ahead, I'm done eating anyway.

gentlest, and kindest person I have ever met.

I would like you very, very much.

I don't think so.

The backfire is so painful, but she doesn't cry.

Now she has everything she needs, she wouln't cry.

Miss Ji, is there enough charcoal?

That's enough, A'Ming.

391

You can leave now.

392
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,100
I want to take a nap.

It seems that God is joking with me.

I was not even allowed to run away.

425

You want to die?

Do you really want to die?

429
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
Don't you want to get revenge on me?

430
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Ji Yunhe, who are you to end your life?

431

Who gave you the guts?

432

Chang Yi,

433
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,200
the wind on the cliff wasn't cold enough that day, was it?

434
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,000
Isn't it good to do as you're told and run away from the beginning?

435
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,200
Why do you insist on turning back?

436
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,200
My compassion was wasted and I was punished by Shunde.

437
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,800
I was helping you with that sword, Chang Yi.

438
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,100
End your pain in advance so that you wouldn't be sent to Shunde to suffer.

439
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,800
Shut up! Stop saying that!

440
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,700
Now, look at what you've done.

441
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,000
Biting the hand that feeds you and locking me up here.

442
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Taking away even my chance for deliverance.

443
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,400
Your heart is far more ruthless than mine was that day.

444
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,200
Don't you hate me?

445

I hope that you can go and treat her.

481
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,100
She made you ruin the enthronement ceremony.

482
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,300
I can even kill her, and you want me to save her?

483
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,600
Sir, please.

484
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,500
Today you left the ceremony without a word,

485
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,000
undermining the authority as the Master of North Abyss.

486
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You brought shame on the Fox Clan.

487
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,300
Young Lord Qing Yao is really sincere to you.

488
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,000
I promise you that I'll check her out.

489
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,600
But I hope you can give everyone an explanation.

490
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,200
Good.

491
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,600
I have told you not to care too much about this merman.

492
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,500
He is not a good man.

493
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,400
How dare you?

494
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,000
Qing Yao trusts you so much,

495
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,600
but you left her alone in the Great Hall

496
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,200
in front of the entire North Abyss, and ran away.

497
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,400
Do you deserve to be the Master of North Abyss?

498
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,600
We can't get over it if you keep silent.

499
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,400
Cousin, let me take care of this matter myself.

500
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,300
You can go now.

501
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,800
Okay. Let's go.

502
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,000
- Let's go.
<i>- Let's go back.</i>

503
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,700
Master.

504
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,800
What happened today?

505
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,300
Today, it's my fault.

506
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,000
Making things difficult for you and your fellow immortals,

507
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,200
I am deeply sorry.

508
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,600
But the enthronement ceremony is just a ceremony.

509
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,000
Managing North Abyss,

510
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,200
from the beginning to the end, is not by red tape.

511
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,600
I won't forget the kindness of you and the Fox King.

512
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,200
You have my word.

513
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,900
I, Chang Yi, will protect the stability of North Abyss.

514
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,800
A promise is a promise.

515
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,200
I believe in you.

516
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,000
I don't want you to break faith with the Immortals of North Abyss.

517
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,800
You left the ceremony and went to Cloud Quarters,

518
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,400
Mr. Kong Ming and I have concealed it for you.

519
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,600
But this is not the end of the day.

520
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,400
I don't care what's going on in that Cloud Quarters.

521
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,200
But you're so distracted by Ji Yunhe.

522
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,400
How should you deal with it?

523
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,000
She doesn't belong to North Abyss,

524
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,700
and her stay here is not voluntary.

525
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,300
It's me who's looking for troubles for nothing, how can it be dealt with?

526
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,000
If there is a fault, it is my fault.

527
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,200
You can punish me if you want.

528
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,600
I'm not going to punish anybody.

529
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
I just want to ask you...

530
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,400
How do you want to treat her in the future?

531
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Since you know that she doesn't belong here,

532
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,200
why do you refuse to let her go?

533
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Now that you are the Master of North Abyss,

534
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,000
you should no longer be swayed by her.

535
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Is this the purpose of you pushing me to the throne?

536
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,400
Of course not.

537
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,000
Then what is the connection between her and my governance of North Abyss?

538
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,200
Have I neglected any official business since she came?

539
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,100
No.

540
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,400
From today onwards, I will keep a good eye on her.

541
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
I won't let her make any trouble.

542
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,800
Do what you want to do.

543
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,300
I won't make it difficult for you.

544
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,000
I won't force you.

545
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,800
All I hope is that you and North Abyss are doing well.

546
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,600
Thanks a lot.

547
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Last time, the picture showing the Immortal order was drawn down as it was.

548
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
After pondering these days,

549
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,900
I still can't see what the immortal order refers to.

550
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,400
Your Majesty, don't worry.

551
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,600
An Immortal treasure as it is, it's not easy to penetrate.

552
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,600
It's time to go to Daiyu for cultivation.

553
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,300
Please go together with Lei Ze.

554
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,800
Wait. The cultivation can wait.

555
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,900
Although it can enhance cultivation

556
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,600
and help His Majesty to fight against the Immortal Master in the future,

557
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,400
it is still a very long road.

558
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,700
It's not the most appropriate method at the moment.

559
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,000
Isn't the reaction of this treasure

560
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
because the comprehension of His Majesty has reached a new level?

561
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So, His Majesty should stay with me for enlightenment.

562
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,400
Right, you are perceptive.

563
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,000
Then why don't you interpret it?

564
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,400
You can go.

565
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,000
Have you penetrated the mystery of the diagram?

566
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,600
Do you want to guide me to this place in the picture?

567
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,200
What are you talking about?

568
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,600
There is no place name or direction on this map.

569
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,000
Is this really a map?

570
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,400
You can go to Daiyu.

571
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,600
You really need to say things in one sentence.

572
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,400
Does Daiyu have anything to do with this map?

573
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
His Majesty has been there several times.

574
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,800
But he didn't find any guidelines.

575
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Maybe... this time it will be different.

576
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,600
That's right.

577
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:13,000
The so-called timing is also about luck.

578
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,400
Then, I'd like to ask you two to go with me.

579
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,700
Yes.

580
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,200
Okay.

581
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,600
Be careful.

582
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,400
Everything has to be wiped clean.

583
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,600
No corner is allowed to be dusty.

584
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Is this house to be demolished?

585
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,400
Master will move in.

586
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,200
Move... Move in?

587
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,800
Master has given an order that in addition to going out for a meeting, patrol,

588
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,400
all other matters will be handled at Cloud Quarters on Lake Island.

589
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
But... don't worry.

590
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,800
Master has commanded that

591
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,700
you won't be disturbed during the day.

592
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,800
A barrier will be added in the middle.

593
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,800
No sound can leak in at all.

594
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,400
Barrier? Where?

595
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,800
Could it be added to my bedside?

596
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,500
Right.

597
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,600
<i>Good for you, Chang Yi.</i>

598
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,900
<i>Isn't it just for spying on me?</i>

599
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,000
Wait.

600
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,300
He's not going to sleep here, is he?

601
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,800
Master said he will move in here.

602
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,600
He will stay over during the day and at night.

603
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,800
But isn't this a lake-centered courtyard?

604
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,400
It's so isolated. It's not appropriate for him to come over.

605
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,600
You must be joking.

606
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,200
Wherever the Lord goes, the center is naturally.

607
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
Why is it isolated?

608
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,300
Prepare the bed for Master.

609
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,000
<i>Yes.</i>

610
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,400
Ji Yunhe, see?

611
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,600
You're really good.

612
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,500
Instead of being relieved,

613
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,800
the bed is now the only thing you have.

614
