<i>[Episode 16]</i>

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,300
<i>The body of Zhu Yan is eternal black ice.</i>

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,300
<i>Every Frost mark comes from him.</i>

22
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,400
<i>If Zhu Yan does not die, the Frost will not disappear.</i>

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,100
So, the Frost is born from the body of Zhu Yan,

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,600
no wonder it can't be cured by medicine.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
You're injured.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
It doesn't matter.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,400
So it means if we want to eradicate the Frost mark,

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
we must destroy Zhu Yan.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,300
That's it.

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,600
Heavenly King and I wanted to destroy him long ago.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,700
We'll start to do it as Yunhe wakes up.

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,000
Even the former emperor can't exterminate it,

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
so it must be very risky.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
That's what I've promised him.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,000
It was also Yunhe's wish.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,900
Yunhe's wish...

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Go ahead.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,200
I bought your favorite osmanthus cakes.

39
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
As your master,

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,400
of course, I should fulfill your little wish.

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,900
Though I protected them carefully all the way,

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,100
they're still broken.

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,400
I know that... A'Ji has left

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,800
and she won't come back.

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,800
You've made up your mind again.

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,700
It's still not me.

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,800
As long as you can be happy and safe,

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
I won't stop you again.

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,100
You can have your own future now.

50
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,900
I'll give you a peaceful future.

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,000
I hope we can have a chance to meet again

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
after we leave each other this time.

53
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,700
If you don't want to see me bring her away,

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,000
take care of her.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,600
I will.

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
At all costs.

57
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Master, as you're seriously injured,

58
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
shall we go back to Thousand Flower Valley first?

59
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,500
No. Let's go to Lutai Mountain.

60
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,800
Why must you go there if you're badly hurt?

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
Zhu Yan is secretly helping Immortal Master.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,400
The Frost mark won't disappear until Zhu Yan dies.

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,000
If we decide to do nothing, then we can't fight against him forever.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Thousand Flower Valley will never regain its freedom.

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't want her trapped in a chaotic situation again.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,200
But Chang Yi says he will complete it.

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Your body can't endure any more damage.

68
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,500
It's the hatred between Thousand Flower Valley and Immortal Master.

69
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,400
Besides, as I'm seriously injured,

70
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,100
why not try to fight against Zhu Yan?

71
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,800
Do you have a plan?

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,000
Zhu Yan doesn't have a body

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,800
so he needs to find a place to stay.

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
If we can avoid him and destroy it,

75
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,400
maybe we can ruin Zhu Yan's residual soul.

76
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,800
I think I know where it is.

77
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Do you think you can enter Immortal Master Mansion?

78
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,000
Aren't you overestimating your power?

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
What are you going to do?

80
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,100
You don't need to be nervous.

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,800
I came here because I heard that something happened in North Abyss.

82
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,500
I never thought I could hear such an interesting thing.

83
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,200
Turns out, according to Ji Yunhe,

84
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,800
it's Zhu Yan who helps Ning Qing secretly.

85
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Senior, what are you going to do now?

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,400
Though you youngsters try to seek revenge on Ning Qing,

87
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,000
shouldn't I be the first one?

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,400
Tell me some details about Zhu Yan.

89
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Shall I bring you to Lutai Mountain?

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Do you want to cooperate with me?

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
You want to get revenge on him.

92
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
So do I.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You tackle Zhu Yan

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,900
and I'll fight against Ning Qing.

95
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,800
What do you think?

96
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
Deal!

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,600
You're finally back, Ji Yunhe.

98
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,800
Senior.

99
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,100
As I'm not dying, how can I meet you?

100
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,400
You've died once.

101
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,600
Your existence is beyond all laws.

102
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
Well, I see.

103
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
I never thought you'd not change at all.

104
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,900
You're still so cruel to yourself.

105
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,400
Maybe it's my destiny.

106
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,800
No matter how my memory, appearance, and experiences change,

107
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
the core of myself won't be changed.

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,500
Fate always brings Chang Yi and me together.

109
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,000
I think you'll have a perfect end this time.

110
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Yunhe, you're awake.

111
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,800
How do you feel?

112
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
Let me ask Kong Ming to diagnose you.

113
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Chang Yi...

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,800
You've suffered a lot these days.

115
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Never mind. As long as you're here.

116
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,000
Big-tailed Fish, it's really hard for you.

117
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,900
Yunhe is okay, right?

118
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,800
Luo Luo.

119
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,300
They've been apart for a long time

120
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,400
so let them have a good talk.

121
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,600
Okay.

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,800
Let them have a good chat.

123
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
By the way, I have something to tell you, too.

124
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,400
When did you know Ji was Yunhe?

125
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,800
Well... I...

126
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,400
When we came back from North Abyss...

127
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,800
Before or after you saw me...

128
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Well...

129
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
- Be...
- Before...

130
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,000
So you've hidden it from me since you met me?

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,600
If there was no ground fire eruption and Yunhe didn't show us her true face,

132
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,000
would you have hidden it from me forever?

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Luo Luo, I promised Chang Yi.

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,800
Who's more important? Chang Yi or I?

135
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,700
I...

136
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,000
You see! You hesitate!

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,700
Didn't you say that I was the most important?

138
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,200
Have you forgotten everything after you kissed me?

139
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
When did you become so flippant?

140
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,000
Why are you so ingratiating?

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,400
How could you deceive me?

142
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,600
Come on.

143
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,400
Don't be sad.

144
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,700
How can you laugh at me?

145
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,400
Fine, I'll stop.

146
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,600
But I'm not ingratiating and flippant.

147
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,000
All my words to you are sincere.

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
If you don't like it,

149
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I won't kiss you anymore.

150
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
You can't!

151
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
How can you give up so easily?

152
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,300
I need to have a good talk with you about it.

153
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
Come on! Let's go home!

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Have a nice "talk"!

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,600
I've been lying in bed for a long time

156
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,400
and I can't even feel my body right.

157
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Show me around here.

158
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,400
Where do you want to go?

160
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,600
I've been in North Abyss for a long time

161
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
but I haven't seen the full view here.

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,200
Bring me to the highest place.

163
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,900
I want to see the land.

164
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,700
I will.

165
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
The ground fire didn't devour the whole North Abyss

166
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,000
but make me recall my memories and bring us together.

167
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Will Immortal Master and Shunde be mad if they learned of it?

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You've never let yourself suffer losses.

169
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
It's so beautiful here.

170
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,800
No wonder so many people treat it as their home.

171
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,200
Chang Yi, is the view beyond the mountains more beautiful?

172
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,800
Do you still want to leave here?

173
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,700
Maybe.

174
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Fine.

175
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,900
When you recover, you can go wherever you want.

176
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,000
I won't lock you up anymore.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,700
What about you?

178
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,800
I have to be responsible for North Abyss

179
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,600
but you don't need to share it with me.

180
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,900
I'm afraid I can't give you the freedom you want.

181
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,000
So you can go wherever you want.

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Luo Luo can accompany you.

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,800
She's found her a lover and isn't my attendant.

184
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Besides, I'm not the one who only wants to be free.

185
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,200
Chang Yi, you've changed.

186
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
So have I.

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,200
I've been imprisoned since I was young.

188
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,600
That's why I hate being shackled.

189
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,000
I always wanted to pursue so-called freedom.

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,800
But after I'd died once, I find that

191
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,200
freedom doesn't mean traveling all over the world.

192
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,700
It means I can make decisions at a whim.

193
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,000
What does your mind tell you?

194
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,400
It tells me that I want to be bound.

195
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,600
I want to have a place that I can go back to whenever I wish.

196
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Don't you understand what I mean?

197
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,600
Though the world is vast,

198
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,800
what I want is to be with you.

199
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,400
Yunhe, if you decide to stay with me,

200
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,000
I won't let you regret it. Do you know?

201
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
Chang Yi,

202
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
actually, I still need to apologize to you.

203
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,400
You always asked me what happened that day.

204
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Actually...

205
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,700
I never betrayed you.

206
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,200
I know.

207
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,000
I know that.

208
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,700
You never betrayed or abandoned me.

209
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,400
What you did was to save me.

210
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,600
It was me who was angry with myself,

211
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,400
so we lost so much wonderful time.

212
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,000
No...

213
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,700
It's me who deprived you of your right to choose.

214
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,400
I thought it was my difficulty.

215
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
I thought I was helping you if I didn't explain it.

216
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,300
Actually, my selfishness and hesitation brought you more pain.

217
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,000
Now I understand.

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,400
If I had confronted you frankly,

219
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,600
things wouldn't have been like this.

220
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,600
As you and North Abyss are fine,

221
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
that's enough for me.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,600
Yunhe, give me some time.

223
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,500
When everything is over

224
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,600
and I'm not the master of the North Abyss,

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,800
then your Big-tailed Fish will belong to you alone.

226
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I will be with you forever.

227
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,500
We can go wherever we want.

228
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
As you've waited for me for so long,

229
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,000
I'll wait for you this time.

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
♫ <i>....on the same leaf</i> ♫

231
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,400
♫ <i>Meeting by the river of time</i> ♫

232
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,880
♫ <i>We were also once on the same stage...</i> ♫

233
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,100
I can forgive you this time but don't do it again.

234
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,400
I'm leaving now.

235
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,400
Be good.

236
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Come out.

237
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,500
Senior Kong Ming, is A'Ji okay?

238
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,400
She's fine.

239
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't worry about her.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's good.

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
What about Chengyu?

242
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
He's not doing that well.

243
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Apprentices of Immortal Master Mansion need to follow Immortal Fairy's orders,

244
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,800
often having to do something against their will.

245
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,000
Senior Chengyu doesn't like it,

246
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,400
but he has no other choice.

247
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,600
Senior Kong Ming, I know you were best brothers.

248
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
Could you help him?

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,200
No one can do things really against their will.

250
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,900
Though we have fate, it still can be decided by ourselves.

251
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,000
Don't forget.

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Whatever one does, they should rely on their own will.

253
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Nobody but he can help himself.

254
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
Ruochu.

255
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,400
Our misunderstandings for a thousand years

256
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,800
were all caused by him.

257
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,300
I will get revenge for you today.

258
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,800
It seems you're not that silly.

259
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Anyhow, you're still wrong.

260
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,200
All the misfortunes were caused by you.

261
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I know you hated that I fell in love with Ruochu.

262
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm guilty of Ning Xiyu's death.

263
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,700
However, I never thought you would kill your senior.

264
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,200
He also saved you at that time

265
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,600
and raised you up with Ning Xiyu.

266
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
He was unprepared for your surprise attacks.

267
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,100
Hurting a man who cares about you...

268
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,400
Ning Qing, how could you be so ruthless?

269
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,400
If he could have abandoned you

270
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
and stayed with us,

271
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,000
all these misfortunes wouldn't have happened.

272
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,600
You and he persisting in doing so,

273
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,200
apathy of Thousand Flower Valley,

274
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
and the misunderstanding and cruelness of the world,

275
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,600
finally made her die an unnatural death.

276
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
She cared for all the creatures,

277
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,400
but it was they

278
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
who hated, abandoned, and refused her.

279
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,800
So what's the meaning of the existence of the world?

280
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,700
That's why you want the world to be buried with her?

281
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,200
You have her blood on your hands.

282
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,900
As she's dead, why should you still survive?

283
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,400
Absurd!

284
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Do you think you can be relieved by it?

285
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
Do you think she can rest in peace?

286
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
Master, Qing Ji's message.

287
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
She's found time to engage Immortal Master to avenge Ning Ruochu.

288
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,600
He's now at Leyou Mountain.

289
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,300
We should set off, too.

290
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Success or not, it's all up to today.

291
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,100
Blue Feather Phoenix will engage Immortal Master?

292
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes.

293
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,100
Fine. Don't stop them.

294
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,700
I'll be glad if it causes destruction to both sides.

295
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,400
Fairy...

296
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,800
My power is too poor.

297
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I hope you can let me off.

298
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,200
Never mind. I don't mind it.

299
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,400
Isn't it your honor to offer yourself up to me?

300
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,400
Ning Qing, though you're powerful

301
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,800
and have become Immortal Master,

302
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,700
your mind is still that narrow.

303
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,200
You've never understood Ning Xiyu.

304
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,700
No wonder you are only worthy of looking for her shadow on a bastard like Shunde for so many years.

305
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Enough!

306
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
You're not qualified to mention her name.

307
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,800
If she were here,

308
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,600
would she be happy to see you

309
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
become absurd and extreme?

310
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,400
Don't try to enrage me.

311
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,500
Ning Ruochu's fate was his own fault.

312
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,400
Do you want to know his words to me before his death?

313
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
He asked me to let you off.

314
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
He said he's willing to atone for the crime himself

315
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
as long as I could spare you

316
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
and let you be safe and free for the rest of your life.

317
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,300
However, you two caused her death.

318
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,600
Why should you be peaceful and free?

319
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,400
As you think you've outguessed everything,

320
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,600
try to guess the reason why I didn't kill you.

321
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,800
He's dead but you're still alive.

322
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,600
Is it more painful than death

323
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,800
as you've never had a chance to meet him again?

324
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,000
You're right...

325
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
He died alone many years ago...

326
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
How lonely he is!

327
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Today, one of us must go to accompany him!

328
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Senior Chengyu! Some evil spirits haunt the mansion.

329
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,700
Please tell us what to do.

330
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,200
I'll lead men to tackle them.

331
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
Yes.

332
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
Wait a minute.

333
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You guys go to exterminate them first.

334
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I have something to handle personally.

335
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,600
Yes.

336
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,400
<i>Zhu Yan should be hiding in the painting of the mansion's backroom.</i>

337
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
<i>As long as you can lure him away,</i>

338
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,900
<i>Siyu will help me slip in there.</i>

339
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,700
<i>I'll use the extreme fire practiced by the Jibai Herb to ruin the painting.</i>

340
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,000
<i>When Zhu Yan dies, Immortal Master will be seriously hurt.</i>

341
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,300
<i>Then you'll have the chance to kill him.</i>

342
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,240
<i>How dare you treat me like this!</i>

343
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,080
<i>Ants!</i>

344
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>You're just a swarm of ants!</i>

345
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,700
It seems those former tricks can't deceive you anymore.

346
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,180
Master, I'm here to help you...

347
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,700
Was the evil thing in that painting

348
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,720
hidden in the backroom from my master?

349
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,900
Yes.

350
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,100
It's the remnant soul of the fierce beast, Zhu Yan.

351
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,420
Don't you know that Immortal Master and you are helping a tyrant?

352
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,560
Senior Chengyu.

353
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,240
<i>It seems that someone took advantage of the chaos to break into the Immortal Master Mansion.</i>

354
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,700
It's all right here.

355
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,460
Go and check somewhere else.

356
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,960
<i>Yes!</i>

357
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,120
Leave now.

358
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,840
If you let us leave,

359
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,220
Immortal Master won't let you off. What about coming...

360
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,000
He's my master so I need to give him an explanation.

361
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,060
Just go.

362
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,500
Is that all you can do?

363
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,140
This is all I can do.

364
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,260
Ruochu.

365
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:40,020
You've waited for a long time and now you can be at ease.

366
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,660
Senior, I'm glad that you found a brilliant future there.

367
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,300
Anyway, I need to complete what I've chosen.

368
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:57,480
Did you help Blue Feather Phoenix and Lin Haoqing?

369
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,240
Yes.

370
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,340
I'd been thinking I should listen to all your words

371
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,380
as you saved my life.

372
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,420
But I still can't deceive myself.

373
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,840
I don't want you to associate with evil spirits.

374
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,620
Don't repeat mistakes.

375
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
I violated your order.

376
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,660
I'm willing to be punished.

377
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,780
Anyhow, I won't regret.

378
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:32,740
Chengyu, you finally chose the wrong way.

379
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,320
<i>Fortunately, I felt something unusual and moved to another place.</i>

380
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,000
<i>Only a residual shadow was there.</i>

381
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,980
<i>Otherwise, I might have been killed by them.</i>

382
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,200
<i>After this great shock, do you think such a little power can satisfy me?</i>

383
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Too greedy.

384
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,800
What else do you want?

385
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,720
<i>Ji Yunhe. Ji Yunhe.</i>

386
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,700
- Senior.
- Qing Ji met a mishap.

387
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,100
I'll lend my eyes to you.

388
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,120
A dream again, right?

389
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,320
You could come to meet me...

390
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,260
only in dreams.

391
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,580
Ruochu, I've been muddled all my life.

392
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,480
For thousands of years.

393
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,540
In the end, I've done nothing.

394
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,240
I still lost.

395
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,360
Qing, it's not the final end.

396
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,560
Success or failure, it's unknown.

397
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,640
Zhu Yan has changed his hiding place

398
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
and Ning Qing has noticed us.

399
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,200
We're now in a dilemma.

400
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,280
What else can we change?

401
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,200
You're proud of your life.

402
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,580
When did you give up?

403
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,860
Remember. Though you're in a dilemma,

404
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,780
I'll be with you forever.

405
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,720
Zhu Yan.

406
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,160
<i>As you fail on the verge of success,</i>

407
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,680
<i>you should have a lot of resentment. Right?</i>

408
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,240
You're here to laugh at me.

409
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,860
What a "broad-minded" ancient beast!

410
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,240
<i>I'm not here to laugh at you.</i>

411
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,460
<i>Do you want to cooperate with me?</i>

412
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,120
If you want to absorb my power, just go ahead.

413
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,540
You don't need to deceive me anymore.

414
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,080
Isn't it enough for you to have Ning Qing?

415
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,120
<i>A dominator always wants more servants.</i>

416
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,680
<i>Besides, as he's a Celestrial Immortal,</i>

417
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,920
<i>we can only have a blood pact.</i>

418
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,960
<i>He can't provide me a body.</i>

419
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,760
<i>As we're both Earth Immortals</i>

420
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,960
<i>and you're a Phoenix King,</i>

421
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,580
<i>I think you're more suitable.</i>

422
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,120
Oh, I see.

423
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,680
You just want a body.

424
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,680
If I give it to you, I'll totally disappear.

425
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,340
It's a high price.

426
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,260
So what can I get from it?

427
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,600
<i>Aren't you eager for revenge?</i>

428
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,320
<i>As you don't mind dying with him,</i>

429
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,020
<i>why not ask for my help to kill him easily?</i>

430
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,000
Would you like to kill him for me?

431
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,960
<i>His mind is complicated</i>

432
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
<i>and he's hard to be controlled.</i>

433
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,480
<i>As long as you give me your body,</i>

434
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,000
<i>then we'll integrate.</i>

435
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,520
<i>I'm you and you're me.</i>

436
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,040
<i>I can kill him for you at once.</i>

437
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,480
<i>As long as he's dead,</i>

438
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,060
<i>you can meet Ning Ruochu happily. Right?</i>

439
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,660
Fine.

440
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,900
<i>I love a frank person like you.</i>

441
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,420
Senior, what on earth is she going to do?

442
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,880
Can we stop her?

443
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,560
No one can stop her.

444
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,100
She doesn't want to cooperate with the devil.

445
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,700
She's decided to sacrifice.

446
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,300
What can I do for her?

447
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,560
I'll bring you to see her.

448
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,700
I now get the taste of integrating with you.

449
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,320
We share all senses.

450
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,940
How long can I be conscious?

451
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,840
<i>You'll be unconscious forever after I conquer your spirit elixir.</i>

452
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,900
<i>Do you still have any regrets at the last minute?</i>

453
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,040
I just forget to tell you that you misunderstand one thing.

454
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,660
<i>What are you doing?</i>

455
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,060
<i>You want to trap me?</i>

456
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,779
<i>Want to kill me?</i>

457
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:12,020
<i>Our pact is completed so you can't regret it!</i>

458
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,579
<i>Otherwise, you'll die!</i>

459
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:16,800
I'm different from Ning Qing.

460
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,390
Though I have a grudge against him,

461
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,430
I still won't choose to join you.

462
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,660
I won't be a monster like him!

463
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,480
If so...

464
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,120
Ruochu will fail to recognize me on the way to the netherworld.

465
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,520
<i>You...</i>

466
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,200
<i>Senior.</i>

467
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,260
You didn't tell lies in the letter.

468
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:29,600
Ning Xiyu... really can help you hide in the wind.

469
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,500
When I integrated with Zhu Yan,

470
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:41,360
I noticed the rest of his soul was in Ning Qing's ring.

471
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,960
I hurt him when I was conscious.

472
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,520
He should recover himself first after he returns to the ring.

473
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,480
He won't move at once.

474
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,720
But it's hard to say... what happens later...

475
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,960
<i>Senior, you're seriously injured.</i>

476
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,160
<i>You should cure yourself first.</i>

477
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,860
Don't dawdle.

478
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,600
Go...

479
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,100
Do what you should do...

480
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,580
<i>Let me help you.</i>

481
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,420
<i>You'll be saved.</i>

482
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,580
I don't need any sympathy from a youngster...

483
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,280
I've missed, hated, and loved in my life...

484
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,280
It's enough.

485
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,660
My life is so wonderful...

486
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,400
It's my last time to act shamelessly...

487
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,060
Then... it's all up to you.

488
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,040
Ruochu has waited for me for too long...

489
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,020
I need to go and find him.

490
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,560
<i>Senior! Senior!</i>

491
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,240
<i>Yunhe!</i>

492
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,700
Chang Yi.

493
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,260
Senior Qing Ji...

494
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,480
went back to her "home"...

495
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:14,220
♫ <i>A gentle smile on lips disturbed the time-line</i> ♫

496
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:19,660
♫ <i>A thousand years passed in moonlight</i> ♫

497
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,980
Qing'er.

498
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,940
Where did you go?

499
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,940
I've waited for you for so long.

500
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:34,930
I once lost my way but luckily, I finally found the way back.

501
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,800
Where do you want to go?

502
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,860
Everywhere is fine as long as we're together.

503
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,740
From now on,

504
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:51,290
nobody and nothing can separate us.

505
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,420
Ruochu, let's go.

506
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:10,367
♫ <i>We once met like a song in the sounds of nature</i> ♫

507
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:17,150
♫ <i>What is left blank is my love confession</i> ♫

508
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,440
I've told you being too greedy would do harm to yourself.

509
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,200
You should take a lesson.

510
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,760
<i>Ning Qing! You're doing this on purpose, right?</i>

511
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,180
<i>You let me out to find the Blue Feather Phoenix deliberately!</i>

512
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,760
<i>You want to watch me make a fool of myself, right?</i>

513
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,800
I wanted to know what you were going to do.

514
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,960
But what you did was just perfect.

515
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,140
After the fire subsides, there will always be something new to do.

516
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,220
How beautiful the starry sky is!

517
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,000
It has almost come to an end.

518
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,740
Everything will be over soon.

519
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:21,440
So, Zhu Yan hides in Immortal Master's ring?

520
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,300
What are you going to do next?

521
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,160
Senior Qing hurt Zhu Yan with her life.

522
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,100
We must complete everything before Zhu Yan recovers.

523
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,720
Let's confront it together this time.

524
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,620
As long as I'm here, I won't let you meet any mishaps, no matter who our enemy is.

525
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,120
But we can't fight recklessly.

526
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,940
We need to win by strategy.

527
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,980
His weakness is not his skill but his mind.

528
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,520
I think I know how to control his mind.

529
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,420
Come on. I don't want to fight against you guys.

530
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,360
I'm here to see Immortal Master.

531
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,760
Call him out.

532
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,820
Or let me beat you up before you call him out.

533
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,700
You can choose yourselves.

534
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Ji Yunhe, you are still alive.

535
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,340
You always exceed my expectations.

536
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,120
You're still alive so how can I die?

537
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,660
It's fine to see you here.

538
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,240
That merman cares about you the most.

539
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,640
If something happened to you, he'd be in a mess.

540
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,175
At that time, the North Abyss will declare war and the Heavenly Palace will have to tackle it.

541
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:43,320
There will be endless fights and chaos.

542
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,920
The Immortal Master thinks contrary to what is straight.

543
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,960
But I actually quite understand you.

544
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,920
You've lost your closet relation and have become heartless.

545
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,460
You don't know why you're still in the world.

546
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:59,460
However, would Ning Xiyu be happy to see you if she saw you like this?

547
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,660
Where did you hear that name?

548
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,960
Qing Ji told you?

549
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,140
In a dream, Ning Xiyu told me herself.

550
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:43,060
♫ <i>Hey, if I weren't me and you weren't you</i> ♫

551
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:49,840

552

556

557
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,300
♫ <i>From now on, there will be no lies, forget the mundane world</i> ♫

558

♫ <i>Let regret not grow</i> ♫

♫ <i>Never again recalling anything about me</i> ♫

♫ <i>The flowers here are blooming once again</i> ♫

569

of light years have passed</i> ♫
