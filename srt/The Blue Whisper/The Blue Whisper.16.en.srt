13
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,560
Master.

14
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,080
Are you all right, Master?

15
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,220
Lin Haoqing, you didn't get Yunhe back.

16
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,840
She wouldn't come with me.

17
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Father was right. I'm not strong enough.

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,840
I can't save her now.

19
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,020
Master, what do we do now?

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,600
- Return to Thousand Flower Valley.
- Return to Thousand Flower Valley?

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Then what about Ji Yunhe?

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,100
If you want to return, go by yourselves.

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,380
In the whole world, Jin Yunhe's the only person I know.

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,720
I'll save her if you don't.

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,592
Luo Jinsang!

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,958
Back in Immortal Master Mansion,

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,560
Yunhe's only request was to ask me to take care of you.

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,724
Do you want to disappoint her?

29
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,680
<i>Yunhe, wait for me.</i>

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,878
<i>One day, I will get you out all safe.</i>

31
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:49,500
Say it again.

32
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,160
Lin Haoqing from Thousand Flower Valley broke into Congji Jail

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,940
and took Ji Yunhe away while Master was away?

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,220
An attendant saw it. It's quite true.

35
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,300
Luckily Immortal Master came back just in time

36
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,300
and kicked him out of Immortal Master Mansion.

37
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,240
Didn't Ji Yunhe run away with the merman?

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,260
Why is she in Immortal Master Mansion?

39
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,780
How could Master keep that defier and hide it from me?

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,440
Ji Yunhe stirs up trouble all the time.

41
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,620
She must have disturbed Immortal Master's mind.

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,000
Except for me, no one can get into Master's head.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,660
Well, I sent men to look for you, but who'd know you would be here?

44
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,360
You just learned?

45
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,740
Immortal Master doesn't treat you as well as the rumors say.

46
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,600
There are still lots of secrets between you.

47
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Sinner.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,700
Being imprisoned and still so clueless!

49
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,700
What do you want?

50
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,380
I've prepared something

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,300
to celebrate our reunion.

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,979
Frost mark?

53
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,540
You really are thoughtless.

54
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,600
Will a Spiritual Master from Thousand Flower Valley be short of Frost marks?

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,100
Of course, I know you have enough of them.

56
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,760
But how can it go deep into the bone marrow with just a shallow taste?

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,620
How I want to see the look on your face when you turn into a piece of cold ice.

58
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,500
Looks like you've grown weary to work Thunder Magic on me.

59
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,220
But I don't have much time left.

60
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,920
You can just give me a quick death.

61
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,720
You want a quick death.

62
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,080
I can grant your wish.

63
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,240
Tell me what you said to Immortal Master to bewitch him into saving your life.

64
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
That's what you want to know.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,440
Since you're so curious, I certainly can't tell you the secret's between me and him.

66
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,200
They all say you're good at training the heart.

67
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,820
I thought you were a smart one.

68
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,300
I won't give you a quick death, then.

69
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,840
You've repeatedly defied me.

70
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,980
I can't vent my hatred if I don't let you suffer for days and nights.

71
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,740
Now you're on your knees?

72
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,760
Too late.

73
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,720
What happened?

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
How did you turn into this again?

75
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,900
Why are you here?

76
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Master.

77
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,920
I heard there was movement in the Immortal Master Mansion and something happened in Congji Jail,

78
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,680
I was worried, so I came.

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,460
I didn't expect she was the person I'd been looking for.

80
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,840
I want to kill her.

81
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,280
No.

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,080
Master, I lost the merman because of her and she even tried to kill me.

83
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,740
I can't keep her.

84
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
Leave us.

85
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,760
Master!

86
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,465
Ru Ling.

87
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Just kill me if you want.

88
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,380
Why let her humiliate me like that?

89
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,920
You won't die.

90
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,100
She put so many Frost Marks inside me, how could I not die?

91
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
What's happening?

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,640
The spirit elixir of the nine-tailed fox.

93
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,920
Inside a cultivator's body, the spiritual power goes along with the spiritual vein.

94
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,460
Once the Frost mark takes effect, the spiritual vein will be frozen and the spiritual power will be stopped.

95
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,660
unless the whole body is covered in ice.

96
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,640
Intriguingly, there are two kinds of spiritual power inside your body.

97
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,720
These two powers coexist and collide with each other, but they don't crack you.

98
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,740
On the contrary, a new spiritual vein has grown and resolved the Frost marks.

99
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,260
More Intriguingly,

100
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,060
Qing Shu's spiritual power produced a new spirit elixir in your body.

101
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,520
Lin Canglan has turned you into a monster with two veins and a spiritual elixir.

102
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,580
So this is the trial he's been trying to complete.

103
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,320
Maybe I should congratulate you for getting out of the Frost shackles.

104
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,760
You're the first one to have done it.

105
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,500
Congratulate me?

106
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,440
Right.

107
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,999
I've received lots of surprises.

108
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:45,179
I'm given a rebellious soul,

109
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,640
but here I am trapped in this prison.

110
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,080
I met Chang Yi,

111
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,800
who I want to protect with my own life,

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,360
but I was forced to hurt him so much.

113
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,520
I thought death could set me free.

114
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,900
But now you're telling me...

115
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,160
that I can't die.

116
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,760
I can't even die now.

117
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,380
Chang Yi, I can't die now.

118
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,140
Chang Yi.

119
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,920
Who does she think she is?

120
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,520
Master always spoils me.

121
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,140
Why did he take her side this time?

122
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,940
Please be calm.

123
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,920
Don't get angry at her, she isn't worth it.

124
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,880
Could Master really...

125
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,660
No.

126
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,280
He's mine.

127
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,420
No one can take him away from me.

128
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,250
Fairy.

129
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,580
Fairy Shunde.

130
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,220
Fairy Weaver has made the Scale Dress for you.

131
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,340
Please have a look.

132
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,640
How could I forget about it?

133
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,660
Invite Master to come tonight and find some maids to dress me up.

134
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,340
I'm giving Master a surprise.

135
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,010
Ru Ling.

136
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,470
Nonsense!

137
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,100
Why did you get changed?

138
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,280
Master, my previous dress was old.

139
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,580
I made a point of finding a fishtail to make this new dress and dance for you.

140
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Master.

141
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,980
Did I upset you for being self-willed?

142
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,540
I shouldn't have said that.

143
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,520
Then why did you hide the truth from me

144
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,760
and keep Ji Yunhe alive?

145
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,680
From today, she'll be my herbal maid.

146
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,360
Just a herbal maid?

147
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,880
Yes.

148
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,280
I know many ways to test and decoct herbs.

149
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,780
From now on, I'll help you train this herbal maid.

150
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,437
Approved.

151
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,049
Yunhe, I'm sorry.

152
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,500
Ji Yunhe, I can't kill you,

153
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,940
but I have many ways to torture you.

154
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,940
I'd like to see how tough you are.

155
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
Thank you for that.

156
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,760
After going through all that trouble, you actually brought me good news.

157
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,460
You haven't caught Chang Yi.

158
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,400
Listen. No matter where he runs to,

159
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
he won't run away from me.

160
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,360
Shunde, you are so naive.

161
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,380
Counting the sun at night and the moon in the day will suit you well.

162
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,500
You cheap maid!

163
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,020
How dare you imply Fairy Shunde's stupid?

164
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,560
Did I?

165
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,160
Isn't it what you said?

166
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,769
You!

167
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,520
Shunde, if you feel confident that you can catch Chang Yi,

168
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,780
why are you torturing me?

169
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,740
Don't you get it?

170
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,260
The more you lash out at me, the more guilty you feel,

171
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,960
and I'll be more at ease.

172
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,740
Ji Yunhe.

173
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,940
I really hate to hear you laugh.

174
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,760
I'll definitely make you cry today.

175
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,880
It'll be hard to go your way.

176
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,860
But if your master scolds you again, I might squeeze out some tears.

177
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,640
Naturally, it'll be out of joy.

178
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,860
As for your tricks of torture, I'm not even afraid of Frost marks,

179
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,940
what can these ice pupaes do to me?

180
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,640
Look at how scared you are.

181
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,459
You're much more toxic than the pupaes. They won't hurt you at all.

182
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,880
But if I can scare the heck out of you, I may get rid of an evil soul.

183
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,200
Ji Yunhe!

184
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,760
Fairy Shunde, don't act recklessly.

185
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,940
Hands off.

186
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,020
Don't think too highly of yourself just because I call you Senior.

187
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,120
Master allowed me to train her.

188
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,220
Why are you protecting her?

189
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,260
Do you also want to be disobedient as your senior?

190
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,760
Now you know what pain feels like.

191
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,380
♫ <i>Heaven is silent, all is quiet</i> ♫

192
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:19,360
♫ <i>Yourself in the mirror, can't see clearly in the fog</i> ♫

193
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,880
♫ <i>Floating across the galaxy, across the Netherworld,
injury and parting</i> ♫

194
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:33,640
♫ <i>Broken dreams are locked deep at the bottom of the sea</i> ♫

195
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,900
♫ <i>The rain washed the dust away, who is waiting for me</i> ♫

196
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,300
♫ <i>Our fated love can light up the starry sea of time</i> ♫

197
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,500
♫ <i>I come on my own for you, searching for you step by step</i> ♫

198
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,600
♫ <i>Getting into my blood through every breath</i> ♫

199
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,200
♫ <i>Love is reborn on its own</i> ♫

200
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,740
<i>My body can withstand the torture better.</i>

201
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,260
I was right.

202
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,660
The merman pearl inside you works wonders.

203
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,620
You knew there was a merman pearl inside me?

204
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,720
I heard in the four seas and eight wastelands,

205
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,800
only the merman pearls of the East Sea have healing powers.

206
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,600
Even if you lost your spirit elixir, it can bring you back to life and live eternally.

207
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,980
Sure enough.

208
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,000
So you let Shunde torture me

209
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,800
in order to test the healing power of the merman pearl?

210
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,340
Turns out you and she are just equally unscrupulous.

211
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,480
The merman gave you such a treasure, you should be thankful.

212
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,460
You're one of a kind in the four seas and eight wastelands.

213
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,560
We should provide you enough care.

214
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,940
I asked Ru Ling to go back.

215
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,660
You can recuperate for a day.

216
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,564
Immortal Master, I'm curious about one thing.

217
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:07,120
Did you get used to cruelty or were you accustomed to doing evil?

218
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,020
Have you never wavered or felt sorry when doing these things?

219
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,460
I've asked the same question,

220
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,560
but never got an answer.

221
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,120
So you've also been through such a perplexed and desperate situation?

222
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,040
Big-tailed Fish, you're blessing me again with your pearl.

223
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,940
It's good though. Shunde tortures me every day,

224
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,660
which tells me that you're still safe.

225
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,640
My life is so tough.

226
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,820
I'm still not dead after everything.

227
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,620
In this case, I'll push myself through.

228
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,160
I've spent so much effort, why hasn't she surrendered?

229
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,580
Please calm down.

230
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,140
Ji Yunhe is just a lowly herbal maid.

231
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,960
Why did you go to that filthy place and let her affect your mood?

232
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,460
Everyone should bend to me.

233
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,400
Why is she an exception?

234
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,540
I need to cut out her heart, take out her liver, so that she'll never laugh again.

235
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,100
What do you think is more important

236
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,480
than her body, life, and freedom?

237
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,560
Prince. Prince, don't worry.

238
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,740
I've reported to the Merman King. He'll send people to you in no time.

239
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,480
He's resourceful. When we get back to the East Sea, you can recuperate first.

240
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,000
When you're fully recovered, we can think about how to get revenge.

241
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,900
It's not right.

242
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,720
The Merman King led his subordinates to rebel and committed a heinous crime.

243
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,260
Now the Merman Clan is only confined to the East Sea,

244
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,580
that's too light a punishment.

245
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,120
Fairy Shunde is visionary.

246
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,080
She expected you'd come to the East Sea after you got away,

247
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,320
so I've been waiting for you here for a long time.

248
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,220
Quickly surrender yourself.

249
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,460
You want to cordon off the East Sea and take away Prince Chang Yi?

250
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,800
What a joke!

251
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,820
Don't you know who owns this place?

252
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,140
His Majesty won't spare you!

253
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,120
Reasonable.

254
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,560
But will the Merman King spare us?

255
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,580
Why don't you ask him yourself?

256
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,280
I almost forgot.

257
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,900
The Merman King defied orders and hurt the disciples of Immortal Master.

258
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,520
He was unforgiven.

259
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,660
Following the orders of Fairy Shunde receiving the Golden Talisman of the Twelve Immortal Masters,

260
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,240
his immortal bones are to be broken, his roots pulled out, and killed on the spot.

261
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,880
<i>No way.</i>

262
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,960
<i>How did that happen?</i>

263
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,980
<i>No way.</i>

264
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
Sneaky! What a dirty trick!

265
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,380
Everyone, attack and leave them no chance to escape.

266
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,680
Prince, it's His Majesty's scepter.

267
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,380
It's you.

268
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,440
The traitor of Immortal Master Mansion.

269
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,000
You came just in time.

270
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,800
I'll take you with him and get another credit.

271
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,640
If you use spiritual power again and break your spiritual elixir, no one will save you by then.

272
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,900
Prince! Prince.

273
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,740
They escaped! They escaped!

274
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,740
Losers!

275
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,480
<i>Chang Yi, my son.</i>

276
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,980
<i>Chang Yi, my son.</i>

277
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,640
<i>You're back.</i>

278
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,480
<i>Father.</i>

279
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,060
<i>You told me not to go ashore and to not be gullible.</i>

280
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,020
<i>But it was me.</i>

281
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,320
<i>I was blinded by an illusion, walked out on my responsibilities, and got into trouble.</i>

282
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,360
<i>Prosperity builds your strength and adversity nurtures your soul.</i>

283
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,520
<i>This is what you have to go through to be a king.</i>

284
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,820
<i>Father, are you leaving me?</i>

285
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,340
<i>I'll always be by your side just like the sea water.</i>

286
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,720
<i>Where there's water, there's me.</i>

287
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,620
<i>I'll entrust the future of the Merman Clan to you.</i>

288
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,660
Father!

289
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,560
Prince! Prince. Your Highness.

290
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
You're... finally awake.

291
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,740
I thought I'd never see you again.

292
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,521
It's good that you are awake.

293
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:59,060
His Majesty sealed his spiritual power in the scepter which protected your heart.

294
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,340
Otherwise, your spiritual elixir would have shattered, and you wouldn't have made it.

295
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,620
Prince. We can't... go back to the East Sea.

296
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,900
What should we do now?

297
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,380
Where's Kong Ming?

298
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,460
You're still alive.

299
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,380
Thank you for saving my life again.

300
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,240
They set the trap for you to jump in.

301
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,280
Shunde must have gotten the real merman pearl.

302
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,160
So don't think about getting it back.

303
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,360
It's good that you didn't get killed.

304
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,300
Okay, I'll be out of here.

305
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,180
From now on, you're on your own.

306
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,980
I want revenge.

307
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,400
I want to confront Immortal Master Mansion with you.

308
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,380
With your ability now?

309
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,740
You were the prince of the Merman Clan, and the East Sea stood behind you.

310
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:00,480
Now you're by yourself and your spirit elixir is broken. You're no use to me.

311
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,120
If I'm of no use to you, why did you stalk me?

312
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,600
You saved me because you still trust me.

313
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,620
Is the Golden Lotus still guiding you to me?

314
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,000
Maybe the Golden Lotus isn't working.

315
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,740
I know why.

316
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,920
You've lived for hundreds of years, but could never fight against Immortal Master,

317
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,880
because your status is awkward and you have no helpers.

318
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,880
The Spiritual Masters are after you, and other Immortals don't believe you.

319
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,780
To fight against Immortal Master, you need assistance.

320
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,880
I'm your best assistant.

321
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,200
- You?
- Yes.

322
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,120
I'll let everyone know that if we don't get rid of Immortal Master and Shunde,

323
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,700
they'll be facing their doom just like what we experienced.

324
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,400
Prince, are you out of your mind?

325
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,440
Only His Majesty's spiritual power is supporting your spiritual elixir.

326
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,560
You should take a good break.

327
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,960
If you run around with this guy, and cause the elixir to break, there'll be nothing...

328
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,340
Luo Suo, you talk too much.

329
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,140
Now we have peace.

330
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,560
Luo Suo, my spirit elixir has been broken.

331
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,460
It has already happened.

332
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,920
I want to use my borrowed time to tell more people that

333
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,720
only if we fight against Immortal Master and Shunde together

334
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,000
can we bring peace back to the Immortal Realm.

335
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,400
I thought you'd mope around and let the worst happen.

336
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,860
Prosperity builds my strength, and adversity nurtures my soul.

337
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,640
To revitalize the East Sea and stop a further tragedy, I have no other choice.

338
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,500
I have to get on with it.

339
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,840
I believe that's also my father's wish.

340
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,800
Sir, will you take me?

341
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,880
Will you take us two with you?

342
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,320
Then, what about the Spiritual Master called Ji Yunhe?

343
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,420
Can you get over her?

344
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,400
Then, why do you keep fighting against the Immortal Master?

345
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,660
I have my own reason.

346
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,840
You don't need to know.

347
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,080
All you need to know is I won't give up until I get what I want.

348
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,340
Same for me.

349
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,200
I'll never forget the pain of being betrayed.

350
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,580
It'll keep reminding me that from today, my determination will never wane.

351
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:33,580
I swear that one day, I'll revitalize the East Sea and let my clansmen return.

352
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,092
Good.

353
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,120
Hey, here's a reminder.

354
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,820
If you do this to me again, I will...

355
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,840
Let me tell you. One more word out of you, and I'll drive you away.

356
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,480
I'll be quiet.

357
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,940
Sir, where are you going next?

358
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,360
The Heavenly King is still young.

359
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,760
Though he's disapproving of the Immortal Master, he doesn't have enough spiritual power.

360
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,758
However, we'll find somewhere else to go.

361
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,900
I heard you went to Immortal Master Mansion and got into a fight with Fairy Shunde.

362
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Is it because of the mess she stirred up in the East Sea?

363
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,980
She's gone too far by Immortal Master's authority.

364
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:29,100
I wanted to release them, but that barrier is an ancient formation and quite extraordinary.

365
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,600
Once being set, it won't be broken down easily.

366
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,380
I could do nothing to help.

367
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,840
Sometimes, I feel bad about myself.

368
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,570
If I were stronger and could stop Immortal Master and my sister,

369
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,660
those things wouldn't have happened.

370
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,580
There is a long way to go, no need for haste.

371
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,260
Life is like a chess game.

372
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,840
Many truths are explained in it.

373
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,540
You'd better think about how to make the next move.

374
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,620
You put the piece in the North.

375
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,380
May I ask why?

376
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,280
It just occurred to me that of the two spiritual lands,

377
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,620
North Abyss suffers more from Immortal Master's insolent power.

378
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,870
If one day I could compete with Immortal Master,

379
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,640
I'd start with this place to diminish his power.

380
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,640
<i>[The North]</i>

381
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,880
Right.

382
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,800
Deep inside the North Abyss dwells many kinds of immortals.

383
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,480
And they complain about Immortal Master and Shunde.

384
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,620
If we go in this direction, we can make friends with many like-minded immortals.

385
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,880
It's just there's Thousand Flower Valley in the South and Lingshuang Pavilion in the North,

386
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,040
and the leader of Lingshuang Pavilion is Shunde's henchman.

387
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,960
If we go there, we'll surely encounter him.

388
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,660
Do you have the nerve to try it with me?

389
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:09,340
Envoy Zhang told me Immortal Master Mansion hates you as much as they hate me.

390
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,400
Do you have the nerve?

391
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,000
The crisis might also be an opportunity.

392
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Since you've made up your mind, I'll keep you company.

393
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,360
- Let's set off.
- Okay.

394
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,060
<i>Only Ji Yunhe can dissolve the Frost marks.</i>

395
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,900
Two veins.

396
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,600
She has two veins.

397
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,620
Master, what do you mean?

398
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,720
The trial Father did on Ji Yunhe's body

399
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,500
gave her two spiritual veins.

400
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,780
That's why she dissolved the Frost marks and turned into a fox.

401
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,060
So you're saying Yunhe won't die?

402
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,760
Great. No matter what she turns into, I just want her to be alive.

403
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,978
That's also your biggest wish.

404
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:39,460
Since we've learned the reason,

405
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,520
can we remove all the Frost marks in their bodies?

406
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,840
Do you know how much time and spiritual power it takes to grow two spiritual veins?

407
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,960
Father and Qing Shu spent a hundred years

408
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,900
and all their strength to open another vein for Yunhe.

409
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,320
Even if Father didn't die that day from the wounds caused by the Blue Feather Phoenix and the Ten Directions Formation,

410
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,820
he and Qing Shu wouldn't have lived much longer.

411
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,520
So if we want to save all the people in Thousand Flower Valley,

412
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,840
we will...

413
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,358
You're right.

414
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,040
We'll sacrifice many innocent people's lives.

415
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,780
Master, bad news.

416
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,760
Elder Liuying's dying.

417
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,680
Elder. Elder.

418
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:28,320
How did it happen?

419
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,800
Why isn't the antidote working?

420
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,380
People are all talking about this,

421
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,520
I could only tell them Elder was having an emergency.

422
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,660
Can we save Elder Liuying?

423
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,320
Master.

424
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,600
Go find a trusted attendant.

425
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
We must save him.

426
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,558
Master, it's too late.

427
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,640
Why did this happen?

428
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,820
Why did it come so suddenly?

429
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,680
The symptoms are showing.

430
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,920
Master, what did you say?

431
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,880
Elder Liuying had an old-time disease.

432
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,800
His body was aging.

433
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,120
He couldn't resist the Frost mark

434
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,760
and didn't take medicine in time, so he passed away.

435
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,440
Elder Liuying's the first one.

436
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,120
Who's next?

437
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,200
There'll be the second, the third one,

438
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,760
and even more.

439
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,140
Master, what do we do now?

440
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,340
Reassure others.

441
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,640
Tell them Elder Liuying died of illness, don't make wild guesses.

442
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,720
Go.

443
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,304
Yes.

444
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,560
You're very patient.

445
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,180
You've tortured me for months

446
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,040
and still haven't given up.

447
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,140
I'm in a good mood today.

448
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,400
I know you still care about that merman,

449
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,740
so I've decided to give you a gift

450
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,540
in order to put you out of your misery.

451
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,140
Isn't it pretty?

452
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,240
How does the Merman King's pearl

453
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,920
compare to the pearl that that merman gave you?

454
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,440
Shunde.

455
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,640
Don't you know about it?

456
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,100
Your beloved merman is the prince of the Merman Clan in the East Sea.

457
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,580
When they learned that their prince was being tortured by me,

458
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,800
all of the East Sea was frightened.

459
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,620
The Merman King even left the sea,

460
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,960
got into a fight and hurt someone in Immortal Master Mansion.

461
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,420
It gave me a perfect excuse to kill him.

462
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,480
Take it out on me if you must.

463
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,040
Why did you hurt the innocent?

464
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,600
What a pity.

465
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,420
I haven't caught your merman.

466
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,780
I just feel disappointed,

467
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,580
and couldn't wait to share it with you.

468
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,940
Oh, right.

469
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,240
The East Sea has been cordoned off.

470
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,520
Right now, those mermen have nowhere to hide.

471
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,760
I wonder whether your merman will blame you if he finds out.

472
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,320
I'll kill you.

473
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,200
Ji Yunhe, you finally stopped laughing.

474
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,720
Do you know?

475
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,740
I love to see the desperate and hopeless look on your face.

476
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,360
I won't spare anyone who's connected to you

477
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,300
for even a little bit.

478
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,440
Come after me if you hold a grudge.

479
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,080
Don't hurt Chang Yi!

480
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,800
Come after me!

481
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,660
I'll tell you one more thing.

482
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,720
Your merman has colluded with the wanted traitor in our mansion.

483
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,400
Crime upon crime.

484
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,680
All Spiritual Masters in the four seas and eight wastelands

485
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,760
are now searching for him until he gets caught.

486
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,620
Not only the pearl,

487
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,680
I'll grind his bones into powder and share it with you.

488
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,960
What do you think?

489
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,500
Shunde.

490
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,640
Let Chang Yi go.

491
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,120
Fairy.

492
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,360
Let Chang Yi go!

493
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,200
Shunde! Shunde!

494
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,900
Guardian Ji, why do you have to annoy her?

495
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,040
If you beg her, you'd suffer much less pain.

496
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,320
Immortal Chengyu, I'm begging you.

497
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,900
Please ask Immortal Master and Shunde to let Chang Yi go.

498
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,920
I can do anything for you.

499
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,260
Why do you have to do this for a merman?

500
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,180
He's the only good one I have in my life.

501
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,570
<i>Chang Yi.</i>

502
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,000
<i>You must be hating my guts.</i>

503
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,660
<i>Haoqing, I once believed that</i>

504
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,360
<i>if we don't win, we'll die.</i>

505
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,640
<i>We can only protect what we cherish by being strong.</i>

506
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,040
<i>You'll have to face him one day.</i>

507
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,500
<i>He's too powerful.</i>

508
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,600
<i>If you don't force yourself to be invincible,</i>

509
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,920
<i>you'll never win over him.</i>

510
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,080
<i>I've made my point clear.</i>

511
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,440
<i>If you still want to be kind,</i>

512
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,920
<i>I'll see what your future holds for you.</i>
