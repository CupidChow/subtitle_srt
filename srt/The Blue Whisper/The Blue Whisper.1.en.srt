<i>Up in the sky, there is an immortal realm.</i>

14
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,360
<i>The world gave birth to two clans.</i>

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,380
<i>The Celestial Immortals are upright and graceful, maintaining law and order.</i>

16
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,940
<i>While the Earth Immortals are unruly and rebellious, often violating the rules.</i>

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,080
<i>As a result, the Celestial Immortals selected a squad</i>

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,320
<i>to moralize the transgressors.</i>

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,600
<i>Members of the squad are spiritual masters.</i>

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,580
<i>The love between a spiritual master and an Earth Immortal is strictly prohibited.</i>

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,540
<i>The prohibition is inexorable in Thousand Flower Valley to the south,</i>

22
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,280
<i>a base to the strongest spiritual masters.</i>

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,340
<i>However, I, Ji Yunhe, don't believe in fate.</i>

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,100
I'm free!

25
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,720
<i>Once, my beloved one told me,</i>

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>that I was born free,</i>

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
<i>just like the wind.</i>

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,720
<i>I remember every word he said.</i>

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
<i>He, is Chang Yi, a merman.</i>

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,380
Chang Yi, my life is coming to an end.

31
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,040
Freedom is all I yearn for now.

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,840
Please let me go.

33
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,500
Chang Yi...

34
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,040
<i>To my surprise,</i>

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,280
<i>my beloved one...</i>

36
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,800
<i>is the one who breaks my wings</i>

00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,600
<i>and imprisons me.</i>

38
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,740
Do you think I'll be fooled for another time?

39
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,520
Your life is in my hands.

40
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,740
And I'm warning you,

41
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,240
you can only stay by my side.

42
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,900
In this whole world,

43
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,200
you have nowhere else to go.

44
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,940
<i>How did this happen?</i>

45
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,240
<i>It all dates back to a long time ago.</i>

Zhuyu herb!

48
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,520
Guhuo Bird! You finally show up.

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,020
I've been waiting for a long time.

50
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,940
Skip the fight and surrender. The fight is tiresome.
<i>[Ji Yunhe, spiritual master of Thousand Flower Valley]</i>

51
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,860
A spiritual master?
<i>[Guhuo Bird]</i>

52
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,620
I'm afraid you're not enough to capture me.

53
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,600
<i>Ji Yunhe, you cannot match her power.</i>

54
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,380
<i>Lure her into our ambush.</i>

55
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,420
I forgot to tell you. I got this egg just now.

56
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,820
Yin? Yin! Give it back to me!

57
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,980
Catch me first.

58
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,360
<i>[Qu Xiaoxing, spiritual master of Thousand Flower Valley]</i>

59
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,080
What's she waiting for?

60
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,720
Guhuo Bird violated the law.

61
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,100
Fairy Shunde asked for it herself.
<i>[Envoy Zhang]</i>

62
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,080
You will be punished if she runs away!

63
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,600
Mr. Envoy, according to our rule,

64
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,020
we, the combat force, cannot move without hearing the master's signal.

65
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,380
But...

66
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,740
Here it is!

67
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,940
Qu Xiaoxing, bring it in!

68
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,960
We've got her, Envoy.

69
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
What are you doing?

70
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,320
The feather will be ruined!

71
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,340
Fairy reminded me that Guhuo Bird's feather is what truly matters.

72
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,920
You!

73
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,960
You'd injure Yin!

74
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,840
Filthy!

75
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,480
You are searching for the Zhuyu herb for its cultivation.

76
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,920
It's not your business.

77
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,480
If you hurt it,

78
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,160
I will never forgive you!

79
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,960
Maternal love,

80
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm deeply touched.

81
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,820
However, this baby isn't your child.

82
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,920
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,500
As is recorded in history,

84
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,400
120 years ago, the wildfire in the southwest lasted for three months.

85
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,380
Your child died in that accident.

86
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
This baby bird belongs to Guanguan.

87
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,020
You stole it away.

88
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,260
Shut up!

89
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,080
I understand that you're using it for your emotional attachment.

90
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
Stop lying to yourself.

91
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,740
You know what it feels like to depart from a family member.

92
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,620
Why must you make it suffer?

93
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,280
Guhuo Bird, stop it.

94
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,320
You have sinned enough.

95
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,260
Sin?

96
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,200
It's already too much to be expiated.

97
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,800
I understand you. You blame yourself.

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,180
Your challenge to Bi Fang was the root of that fire.

99
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,600
You blame yourself for killing Yin.

100
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,640
That's why you couldn't move on. Is that right?

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
After it came to life,

102
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
my child hadn't seen what the world was like.

103
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,920
My child died because of his mom.

104
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,140
He wouldn't forgive me.

105
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,800
He shouldn't.

106
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,660
You're the only one who keeps punishing yourself.

107
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,080
I borrowed this from the Judge of Life.

108
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,840
Take a look.

109
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,640
<i>Mom!</i>

110
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,260
<i>Yin is keen on birds, right?</i>

111
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,720
<i>I bought you one.</i>

112
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,540
<i>Do you like it?</i>

113
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,260
<i>Don't you like it, Yin?</i>

114
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,820
<i>I do. But birds belong to the sky.</i>

115
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,100
<i>A bird can only be happy when it's free.</i>

116
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,400
<i>I don't want it locked.</i>

117
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
<i>Let's set it free.</i>

118
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,200
<i>Okay. We'll do as you say.</i>

119
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,540
<i>Great!</i>

120
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,740
Upper Immortal saved Yin and sent him to the Incarnation Pool.

121
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,380
Yin reincarnated in the lower realm.

122
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,340
Just as he said,

123
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,520
a bird can only be happy when it's free.

124
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,640
It's the same for you.

125
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,000
Let go of obsession.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
Forgive yourself and move on from him.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,220
I'm sorry, child.

128
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Sorry for keeping you away from your family.

129
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,360
It's my fault.

130
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,820
This is the end of our connection.

131
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,280
Whatever reason it is,

132
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,080
it's a sin to traffick children.

133
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,360
Thankfully, you never intended to harm him.

134
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,780
As long as you admit your sin and give out your spirit elixir,

135
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,000
you may expiate your sin by taking the penalty at Immortal Master Mansion.

136
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,520
Guards. Take her back to Thousand Flower Valley

137
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,860
and send her to Immortal Master Mansion.

138
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,380
Yunhe, good for you!

139
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,740
I'm impressed by your skill!

140
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,760
The spiritual discipline skill is a top secret.

141
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,880
I can't disclose it to you easily.

142
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,720
If you really want to learn, you know the rules.

143
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,160
Hand out the spirit stone.

144
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,280
Yunhe, seriously? Asking me for the stone?

145
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,640
I heard that Guanguan's feather can clear one's mind.

146
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,500
Here it is! I'll send it to the Fairy!

147
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,900
Envoy, it's still young. It did nothing wrong.

148
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,340
We'd better send it back to his tribe.

149
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,080
It's only a child of a lower immortal.

150
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,500
It's his honor to serve Fairy.

151
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,000
Ji Yunhe, right?

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,400
Not bad.

153
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,320
Take it.

154
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,700
It's precious enough.

155
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,980
Silencing white talisman?

156
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,040
Even for Immortal Master Mansion,

157
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
it's rarely used when commanding masters.

158
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,320
It's so generous of you, Envoy.

159
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,460
You!

160
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:24,320
However, the duty of a spiritual master is to go after the bad guys, not to play up to Fairy's minion.

161
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm not an expert in talismans. I only know how to cast one.

162
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,260
You'd better ask Fairy for help.

163
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,080
Xiaoxing, the baby bird is innocent.

164
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,900
Please send it back to its hometown. I wish it a peaceful life.

165
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,680
Yunhe, Fairy Shunde is Heavenly King's only sister.

166
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,640
And Immortal Master favors her.

167
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,500
Envoy Zhang might be annoying, but he's admired in Immortal Master Mansion.

168
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,840
You shouldn't have offended him.

169
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,960
Submitting to humiliation isn't good for mental health.

170
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,440
Why would I? It's not worth it.

171
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,400
<i>Ji Yunhe! That's so bold of you.</i>

172
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,360
Oh no. It's Young Master. He's going back ahead of us.

173
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,760
Yunhe, you're losing the trial.

174
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,220
<i>[Shrillwind Hall]</i>

175
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,180
Father.
<i>[Lin Canglan, Master of Thousand Flower Valley] [Qing Shu, Attendant of Thousand Flower Valley]</i>

176
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,760
I have fetched you the spirit elixir of the Xisi rhino.
<i>[Lin Haoqing, Young Master of Thousand Flower Valley]</i>

177
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Here I present it to you.

178
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,400
Young Master could tame a beast at such a young age!

179
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,840
Like father like son.

180
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,420
Master used to do the same.
<i>[Donglian, Elder of Thousand Flower Valley]</i>

181
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm sure that Young Master can take the title of Guardian.

182
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,160
The match isn't over yet.

183
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,620
Elder Donglian, how come you're so sure of the winner?

184
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,240
I remember that Ji Yunhe won the last trial.
<i>[Mu Ze, Elder of Thousand Flower Valley]</i>

185
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,840
Master, in this mission, our team passed by Mountain Guyao .
<i>[Siyu, Lin Haoqing's Attendant]</i>

186
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,920
We got some Ganoderma.

187
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,780
I know Elders suffered before from injuries during wartime.

188
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,680
This is good for your health.

189
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,520
Okay.

190
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,480
Thanks.

191
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,840
The best one of all goes to my father.

192
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,380
I wish it helps with your leg disease.

193
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,120
Thanks, Son.

194
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,960
It's my pleasure.

195
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,520
Master, Ji Yunhe hasn't returned now.

196
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,560
Shall we keep waiting for her?

197
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,180
There is still time. We shall wait until the end.

198
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,320
It's a match, not an incarnation. It's not about priorities.

199
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,380
Master, I do not know about etiquette, I got no gift for you.

200
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,480
Witness my loot.

201
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,840
<i>Spirit Elixir of Guhuo Bird!</i>

202
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,600
<i>Yes. I can't believe it.</i>

203
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,460
<i>So good of her. I reckon so.</i>

204
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,420
<i>She really got it!</i>

205
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,540
Guhuo Bird is a fierce beast.

206
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,560
It's too powerful an enemy for you. I can't believe it.

207
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,740
Not a big deal.

208
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,160
Yunhe is worthy of it.

209
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,380
I hear that you offended Envoy Zhang over a baby bird.

210
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,220
I know this is a match for Guardian.

211
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,980
But Thousand Flower Valley is subordinate to Immortal Master Mansion.

212
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,440
Fairy Shunde has been living in the mansion for a long time.

213
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,860
She's the apprentice of Immortal Master.

214
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,970
She can command all spiritual masters.

215
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,580
What's in it for you by offending Fairy Shunde?

216
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,280
I'm wondering what happened to your Xisi?

217
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,360
I killed it.

218
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,400
It's a fierce and cruel beast.

219
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,500
Following your thought,

220
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,720
Thousand Flower Valley answers to Immortal Master Mansion.

221
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,520
They have given out the order that all sinned immortals and spirits

222
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,300
shall be trialed by them in accordance with Heavenly Law.

223
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,420
When Xisi violates, it will be punished according to the law.

224
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,780
Why did you exceed your duties and meddle in their affairs?

225
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,720
If Immortal Master Mansion blames us,

226
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,860
your fault is greater than mine.

227
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,100
After the foundation of this realm,

228
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,960
we spiritual masters are the descendants of Dijun, the Celestial Immortal.

229
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,200
We were born to discipline the Earthly Immortals and spirits who violated the law.

230
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,520
The most ideal way of educating isn't killing

231
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,420
but moralizing.

232
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,380
This way, we restrain them and guide them for the better.

233
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:08,060
That's to say, we shall moralize them when possible.

234
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,920
Haoqing, although you vanquished the beast, you're still bold.

235
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,240
You'll need more practice.

236
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,600
Yes, Father. I will work harder.

237
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,640
I shall live up to father's expectation

238
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,580
just as you do.

239
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,260
Ji Yunhe moralized Guhuo Bird at the smallest cost.

240
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,640
You've done a great job.

241
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,540
The prize is doubled.

242
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,280
You may pick two more treasures from my treasury

243
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,740
as a welcome gift for being promoted to Guardian.

244
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,120
Thanks, Master.

245
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,780
<i>It's a wise decision!</i>

246
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,620
Yunhe, the time has come for passing on my power to you.

247
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,660
Yunhe, you've been promoted to Guardian.

248
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,400
And you're getting the power of Master.

249
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,920
It's a bright future.

250
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,360
Congratulations.

251
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,300
<i>Congrats.</i>

252
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,820
Thanks, Master.

253
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,520
And I shall thank Elders for their favor.

254
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,400
<i>Yunhe! Hold on.</i>

255
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,560
<i>Yunhe.</i>

256
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,000
<i>You've just beat his son.</i>

257
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,420
<i>He won't let you go easily.</i>

258
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,520
Don't worry. It's not the first time.

259
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,980
Wait for me.

260
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,040
<i>Take care.</i>

261
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,160
Master.

262
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,980
Master, she's here.

263
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,580
Master, it's almost the limit.

264
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,700
Master, why is it so painful this time?

265
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,660
I see your maneuver today.

266
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,560
I understand. I shouldn't have offended Envoy Zhang.

267
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,620
But I'm doing it for Young Master.

268
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,340
Is that so?

269
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,160
I know Master is regarding me highly and turning me into a whetstone for Young Master.

270
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,040
Help him grow and be his rival,

271
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,720
so that he will be the rightful master today.

272
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,680
I deliberately fought with Envoy Zhang so that he'd hate me.

273
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,620
As a result, he'd be in favor of Young Master, who meant him no harm.

274
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,820
That way, Envoy Zhang would put in a word for Young Master in front of Fairy Shunde.

275
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,860
It's helpful for him.

276
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,420
I owe my life to you, Master.

277
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,100
Please grant me the cure.

278
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,880
Guardian Ji, you've always been wise.

279
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,020
Master.

280
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,640
What about the treasures you promised me?

281
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,000
Yunhe, are you all right?

282
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,340
If you had come back later, I'd have set off to rescue you.

283
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,500
Don't shake me, Luo Luo. My head hurts.

284
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,920
Hold my hand and get some rest.

285
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,640
How do you feel? Is the soup warming you up?

286
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,680
Don't worry. It's only a scratch.

287
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,120
It only makes me feel worse.

288
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,180
Lin Canglan cast the Frost Mark on you. It's bitterly cold.

289
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,880
The frost brings agony.

290
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,440
It's far from a scratch.

291
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,500
All right, enough.

292
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,580
Anyway, we've made a profit!

293
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
Look.

294
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,320
So many spiritual stones!

295
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,260
You bargained with Lin Canglan!

296
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,420
I've seen enough between life and death.

297
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,280
Why would I be afraid of him?

298
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,160
There's more!

299
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,220
Look.

300
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,880
It's a roll of sparkly fabric granted by Celestial Heaven.

301
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,040
I fetched it for you to make you a dress.

302
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,760
Look at you.

303
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,560
You're a lady. Stop dressing in crappy clothes like this.

304
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,760
Qu Xiaoxing would call you a moth again.

305
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,840
How dare he!

306
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm not a moth!

307
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,360
Why must a butterfly always be glamorous?

308
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,740
I like the way I am now.

309
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,040
Luo Luo, have you ever thought about getting married

310
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,320
once we get out of here?

311
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,860
Shall I ask the Immortal of Marriage for some help?

312
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,740
You'd better not!

313
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,720
I don't understand you guys.

314
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,480
Always talking about rules.

315
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
You even set standards for dating.

316
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,320
I'd rather use the time to make more spirit stones.

317
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,420
With enough stones, we could buy a beautiful island from the Immortal of Land

318
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,820
and enjoy our lives there.

319
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,720
How about going to the north?

320
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,760
It snows there.

321
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,340
The snowflakes are white and pure.

322
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,440
It's so different from this place.

323
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,000
Although there are flowers everywhere,

324
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,060
it's full of poisonous thorns.

325
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,920
I love that idea.

326
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,440
But... what about the Frost Mark on you?

327
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,040
Shall I steal the cure for you?

328
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,920
Forget about it.

329
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,400
We must stick together.

330
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Just be patient.

331
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,480
The time will come.

332
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,760
The task for you now is to find some targets to be my apprentices.

333
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,020
That way, I can get more rewards and earn more stones.

334
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,260
The more apprentices I have, the sooner the island comes.

335
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,740
Great!

336
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,700
<i>[A month later]</i>

337
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm telling you.

338
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,120
It's not very often to learn from Guardian Ji herself.

339
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,160
Watch closely.

340
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,320
There's no refund

341
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,660
if you didn't catch up.

342
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,680
I know that your home is flooded.

343
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,960
There isn't much food.

344
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,920
Still, stealing is wrong.

345
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,300
Just turn yourself to Immortal Master Mansion.

346
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,680
I will take care of your brothers.

347
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,580
<i>- That's it!
- Impressive!</i>

348
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Behave.

349
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,960
Hanyin, I know it's your habit to crow.

350
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,700
You'll gain courage there in Immortal Master Mansion.

351
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,280
Look at you.

352
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,160
Even if you can't find a spouse, you shouldn't have stalked others.

353
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,600
Reflect on yourself there.

354
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,620
I shall pick you up when you come out.

355
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,560
Yunhe, do you love me?

356
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,040
Fine.

357
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,180
Thank you. I get it.

358
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,020
Is it that touching?

359
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,300
No! It's...

360
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Luo Luo!

361
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,520
What did you get me? Come on!

362
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,920
I think it's okay.

363
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,100
Stop looking. Leave.

364
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,600
Hurry up. Move.

365
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Yunhe, good for you.

366
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,080
Aren't you afraid that you'd miss it?

367
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,920
Don't look down upon me.

368
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,660
I always take the initiative.

369
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,480
I don't miss it.

370
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,700
Never.

371
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,320
Time to go.

372
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,000
<i>Ji Yunhe, it's been a long time since the last time you practiced.</i>

373
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,600
Luo Luo, I've finally figured it out.

374
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,080
Now that I'm a Guardian, I must remain reclusive.

375
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,560
Besides, the monsters in Reflect Cave are so ugly.

376
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,720
I'll leave them to Qu Xiaoxing.

377
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,520
Please carry on, for the sake of our island.

378
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,520
Our time has been tough enough.

379
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,840
How could I live on without fun like this?

380
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,980
Thankfully, in this encyclopedia are many places of interest, food, and stuff.

381
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,760
Reading it cheers me up.

382
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,200
It's just a rubbish book. We don't even know who the author is.

383
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
It's a deserted book, collecting dust.

384
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,800
Why do you cherish it this much? You've read it so many times.

385
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,160
Aren't you tired?

386
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,660
I'd rather spend the time on spiritual discipline.

387
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,160
Cut it off.

388
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,480
Give me a good-looking one.

389
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,560
I'd rather use a honey-trap to get a good-looking target.

390
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,900
Stop dreaming.

391
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,280
You'd better think about

392
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,180
how to deal with Lin Canglan.

393
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,360
He ranked the highest here.

394
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,240
I need to find someone superior to him.

395
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,480
How do we do that?

396
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,060
Who is qualified to command him?

397
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,480
Yunhe! Bad news.

398
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,980
Envoy Zhang, the one who got tricked by you, is looking for you.

399
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,880
You'd better hide. I'll cover it up for you.

400
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,680
Thanks for warning me.

401
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,060
I'm afraid it's too late.

402
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,680
Guardian Ji, this is your chance to take the lead.

403
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,540
Follow me.

404
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,740
Fairy gave out an order to send this beast here.

405
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,700
It wounded many apprentices in Immortal Master Mansion.

406
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,080
I know you're a qualified guardian.

407
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,080
It only makes me assured if you open it on your own.

408
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,940
<i>What to do?</i>

409
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,880
<i>Envoy Zhang is avenging her in disguise.</i>

410
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,660
<i>Still, Ji Yunhe is powerful enough.</i>

411
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,540
<i>If she succeeds, Fairy will be ecstatic.</i>

412
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,300
<i>And Ji would get an edge over Young Master.</i>

413
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I heard that Fairy has so much power

414
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,920
that the Immoral Realm was violated by her.

415
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,720
It just no longer exists

416
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,080
in Celestial Heaven, a land so peaceful once.

417
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,900
Yunhe, the box is sealed by the gold talisman of Immortal Masters.

418
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,260
Thunder Spell, an extremely powerful sealing spell.

419
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,920
What's trapped inside could be tough.

420
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,340
The Envoy is taking vengeance on you.

421
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,220
Yunhe, that's terrifying.

422
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,500
There is no escape.

423
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,540
Now that there's a gold talisman,

424
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,120
what's trapped inside must be an elite, too.

425
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,340
Maybe it's a pretty one!

426
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,700
<i>[Chang Yi, Merman from the East Sea]</i>

427
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,580
Big-tailed Fish, nice move.

428
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,740
I'm impressed.

429
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,520
Welcome to Thousand Flower Valley.

430
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,020
That's rude.

431
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,100
Irritable as hell.

432
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,460
Senior, don't scratch his tail!

433
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,920
Bravo! Bravo!

434
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,640
Fairy is here!

435
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,080
You shall receive her now!

436
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,600
<i>At your service, Fairy.</i>

437
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,460
<i>[Ru Ling, Fairy Shunde]</i>

438
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,100
What a show!

439
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm enjoying it.

440
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,640
I intended to teach my apprentices

441
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,960
on disciplining the merman after your arrival.

442
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,440
To my surprise, Envoy Zhang got here in advance.

443
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,640
Thankfully, it's under control now.

444
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,220
It's all my fault.

445
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,320
Please forgive me.

446
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,460
Fairy.

447
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,280
I've seen what I want.

448
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,780
I'm sure Thousand Flower Valley will not let me down.

449
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,360
Please go to Shrillwind Hall.

450
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,100
Haoqing, lead the way.

451
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,640
Yes, Father.

452
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,480
Days ago, I took a trip to East Sea.

453
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,540
This insubordinate merman harmed the apprentices of our mansion.

454
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,620
All living creatures shall acknowledge allegiance to me.

455
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,740
So should this merman.

456
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,560
It's your fortune to be selected by Fairy.

457
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,360
This must not go wrong.

458
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,020
I get it.

459
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,680
Unfortunately, my injury relapsed recently.

460
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,180
I'm not in a good condition.

461
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,180
After thinking about it, I think I shall entrust this task

462
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,340
to elite apprentices in the valley.

463
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,200
Fairy, it was Young Master who captured this merman.

464
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,150
This precious chance must...

465
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,260
should go to him.

466
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,120
I'm willing to carry out the task.

467
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,340
May I know about your requirements?

468
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,520
There are three requirements.

469
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,780
Firstly, make the merman speak and submit to Fairy.

470
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,260
Secondly, have the merman cut off his tail and never return to the sea.

471
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,200
Thirdly, make him offer his pearls and never turn his back.

472
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,800
Why would she?

473
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,120
It's more than disciplining the merman.

474
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,760
Sounds like she's recruiting the merman as her attendant.

475
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,040
Fairy, it's not hard to make him speak.

476
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,140
But I heard that the tail and pearls are as precious as a merman's life.

477
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,260
I'm afraid it's impossible.

478
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,680
Are you saying that I'm asking too much of you?

479
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,280
Am I being unreasonable?

480
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,160
I misspoke. It's my fault.

481
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,380
Please forgive me.

482
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,400
Fairy, Elder Mu Ze may have misspoken but he means you no offense.

483
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,060
Please forgive him.

484
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,960
I didn't even say a word.

485
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,100
Why are you so nervous?

486
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,380
It's just that everything should be straightforward and thorough.

487
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,860
The one who's useless to me is rubbish.

488
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,900
And rubbish shall perish.

489
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,620
Don't you think so, Master Canglan?

490
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,200
Hold on, Yunhe.

491
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,540
It's not our business. Why are we even here?

492
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,480
We shall go back.

493
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,160
Lin Canglan is a foxy foe.

494
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,000
To deal with a fox, we shall take advantage of the beasts.

495
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,760
But that's Fairy Shunde.

496
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,120
Asking her for help?

497
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,780
What if we screw it up?

498
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,380
It's too precious a chance.

499
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,740
I don't want to and I can't waste it.

500
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,160
You have my word.

501
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,100
As long as I take your order, I will try my best and make you satisfied.

502
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,580
But as you know, the merman is a rare beast.

503
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:09,200
If I complete the task, is it possible to ask for a reward?

504
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,020
It's our duty to serve Immortal Master Mansion.

505
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,760
We shouldn't do that.

506
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,580
It doesn't bother. I'm not the stingy type.

507
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,680
Whoever accomplishes my wish, will have their wish realized.

508
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,300
You can ask me for anything.

509
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,260
Thanks, Fairy.

510
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,280
Ji Yunhe, Guardian of Thousand Flower Valley volunteers for disciplining the merman.

511
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,460
Please allow me, Fairy.
