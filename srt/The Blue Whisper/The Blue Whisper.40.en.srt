Kong Ming.

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,500
What on earth has happened?

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,200
I've asked a lot of questions. But you won't reply.

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,520
Did something happen?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,300
Kong Ming!

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,900
Though I like you, I can still beat you up.

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm joking.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,640
I just want to make you happy. I won't beat you.

29
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,760
Sir, I heard that Shunde devoured Zhu Yan's remaining power.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,480
North Abyss may be in danger. Shall we organize defensive measures?

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,760
Shut up!

32
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,880
- Calm down.
- Calm down.

33
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,700
Immortal Master has died. Heavenly King is in Infinite Mountain.

34
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,460
Shunde now has no fear. She'll attack North Abyss soon.

35
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,460
So we must start playing defense.

36
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,540
Convey my order.

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,500
Build a barrier at the border to defend against Shunde's attack.

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,540
Yes.

39
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,800
Young Master, don't worry. I'll assist you.

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:49,560
By the way, Chang Yi and I are getting married in three days.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Yunhe, great!

42
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,580
Why in a hurry?

43
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,400
I see.

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Chang Yi and you have gone through many things.

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,020
A ceremony is a must.

46
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,600
Shunde is quite crazy.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,640
We should strengthen our defense.

48
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,600
But we shouldn't just wait

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,480
and delay our matters.

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,340
But if you get married, the whole North Abyss should celebrate.

51
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,120
Three days are not enough to prepare.

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,140
As for the etiquette,

53
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,200
neither Chang Yi nor I care.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,100
We just want to invite some of our family and friends overto have a joyous feast.

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,600
Chang Yi, do you want to prepare anything?

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,560
If North Abyss exists and you're with me, I'll be satisfied.

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
I don't know if you can understand.

58
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,660
You'll get married. What does he understand? Look at me.

59
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,400
Just three days. Three days later,

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm sure Yunhe will have a wonderful wedding ceremony.

61
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,800
I'll destroy everything!

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,940
Between heaven and earth, I'm the master of everything.

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:39,020
From now on, it's my turn to ruin the world for Master.

64
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,400
To make your wedding clothes,

65
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,720
I forced the manager to give me the best cloth.

66
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,640
Look. Do you like it?

67
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,420
Are you sure you want to give me such nice cloth?

68
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,860
Won't you save it for you and Kong Ming?

69
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,360
He hasn't asked me to marry him.

70
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,200
By the way, a wedding will cost me many spirit stones.

71
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll use them to buy a fairy island.

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,040
You always care about your spirit stones only.

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,060
When will you make changes?

74
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,880
Yunhe, shall I make your wedding dress?

75
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,040
Your needlework...

76
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,200
I know I'm poor at needlework.

77
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,100
But I still want to make a unique robe for Chang Yi by myself.

78
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,760
You'd better make one for Kong Ming.

79
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,240
Formal invitation.

80
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,840
Nice!

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,060
Why do you have two?

82
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,960
This one is for who?

83
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,560
I heard that you have something to tell me.

84
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,200
Would you like to come to my wedding?

85
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,880
But you said you would only invite good friends.

86
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,320
We've gone through life and death.

87
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,540
That makes us friends.

88
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,620
I don't care about the past anymore.

89
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,420
What about you?

90
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,860
Don't worry. Let bygones be bygones.

91
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,600
Yunhe, thank you for letting me know I have more important things

92
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,960
and more important people to protect.

93
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,040
I really admire you.

94
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,360
I hope I can live like you one day.

95
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,400
I want to be worthy of my heart.

96
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,560
Qing Yao, you're really open-minded and optimistic.

97
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,240
Please take good care of North Abyss.

98
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,460
I would like to thank you.

99
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,400
Yunhe is like Master when she says that.

100
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,320
It's my duty.

101
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
You're welcome.

102
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,260
I'll send you the medicine when it's ready.

103
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,620
What do you want to do?

104
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,500
Shunde will attack us.

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,940
I've set a barrier at the border.

106
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,380
She's gathered many soldiers.

107
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sure she'll enter our trap.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,460
Then we just need to encircle her.

109
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,960
Anything else?

110
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,040
By the way, I hope you can be the host of my wedding.

111
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,180
No.

112
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,200
Can we have a drink on the wedding day?

113
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Luo Jinsang agreed. But I haven't.

114
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,300
Be honest, okay?

115
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't have much time.

116
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,800
Why do you treat these medicinal materials in this way?

117
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,320
Believe it or not, I'll smash all these medicine jars.

118
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,160
I know you treat me as your best friend.

119
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,120
Without you, I would have died in the East Sea.

120
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,460
I just want you to know

121
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,880
that all these choices are my own wish.

122
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,340
Don't blame yourself.

123
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,360
Don't feel guilty.

124
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,340
I just regret why I dragged you into this in the first place.

125
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,420
Chang Yi,

126
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,440
if I had not involved you in this mess,

127
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
you might not have to face such a fate now.

128
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,060
If I hadn't met you,

129
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,160
my life would have been much simpler

130
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,320
but would also be like a piece of white paper,

131
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
leaving no trace,

132
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,580
and not be accompanied by my beloved or best friend.

133
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,280
Facing the result, I don't regret it.

134
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,280
You are my most trusted friend.

135
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,640
In my heart, you're the most suitable person to be the host.

136
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,640
I hope I can share the happiest time of my life

137
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,060
with my best friend.

138
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,300
Well. Got it.

139
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,180
Get some rest.

140
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,560
I'll treat you soon.

141
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,120
<i>[Double Happiness]</i>

142
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,200
I wanted to discuss the style with you.

143
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,800
But then I found that I can only do the simplest one.

144
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,300
But it's fine.

145
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,800
Other styles are hard to decide on.

146
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Why not use spells?

147
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,200
Ordinary people envy us that we have spells

148
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,600
in that everything can be done with a snap of our fingers.

149
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,300
But marriage is a commitment of two people.

150
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,400
We have to be sincere and fall in love with each other.

151
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,700
So I must make your wedding robe on my own.

152
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Let me help you.

153
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,400
Though I'm poor at needlework,

154
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
I have some experience.

155
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Did you use needles at sea?

156
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,800
At sea, we wear nothing at the wedding.

157
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,600
Therefore, no matter what style it is, I like it.

158
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,000
Mermen don't care about etiquette.

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,600
Luo Luo said jewelry is a must at the wedding.

160
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,400
It's a pity that the merman's tear was destroyed by the fire.

161
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,600
It would be great if you could squeeze out two more tear drops

162
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,300
and make me a pair of pearl earrings.

163
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,200
You're like a cornucopia.

164
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
I can't waste it.

165
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,100
Okay. It's up to you.

166
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,100
Come on.

167
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,600
I can't bear to make you cry anymore.

168
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,800
We used to sit together and talk about war.

169
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,400
Now we can talk about trivial matters.

170
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,700
It really feels like we're living a peaceful life.

171
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
Why are you staring at me?

172
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:18,500
I just think you're suddenly making me realize... that we finally have our own home.

173
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:39,000
♫ <i>Each pair of eyes belongs to a merman</i> ♫

174
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,600
♫ <i>A drop in the ocean</i> ♫

175
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,500
♫ <i>Time is dreamy and turns into scales</i> ♫

176
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,800
♫ <i>The Milky Way ripples</i> ♫

177
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,800
♫ <i>I'm flying in the Milky Way like wind</i> ♫

178
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,400
♫ <i>Passing through the sea of stars</i> ♫

179
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,400
♫ <i>Enter the forest of light</i> ♫

180
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,200
♫ <i>Leap over the stream in the sky</i> ♫

181
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:24,800
♫ <i>My shadow is like a smile curve</i> ♫

182
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,300
How long do I have?

183
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,800
The freezing is faster than expected.

184
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Even if I try my best,

185
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,900
I can only keep you alive until midnight tomorrow.

186
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,400
The wedding night?

187
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,800
Is there any way

188
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,400
to help me suppress my weakness for a while?

189
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,800
I can suppress the cold aura.

190
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
But in the end,

191
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
the ice will quickly break out

192
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,000
and you'll feel freezing cold.

193
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,600
Must you do that?

194
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,400
Since I can't stay with her for long,

195
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll try my best to leave some good memories in my limited days.

196
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,100
Why?

197
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,200
Why is the last fragment always missing?

198
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,900
Heavenly King. I'm afraid this shard was destroyed in the war,

199
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,000
so you can't get it back with the array.

200
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,800
Don't be discouraged.

201
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,300
Take a little more time and you'll find a way out.

202
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,900
But how long will it take?

203
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,800
This new evil spirit is becoming more and more fierce.

204
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,600
I don't know how many people will die.

205
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,000
Sister is in Immortal Master Mansion. I don't know if she's still alive.

206
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,800
I just hate my own incompetence and can't compare with my father.

207
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,200
I can't fulfill his wish.

208
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,800
Your Majesty, you've set the array for days.

209
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,400
You must be tired. You'd better take a break.

210
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Lei Ze and I will find a way out.

211
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
Yes.

212
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,700
Sanyue, get some rest.

213
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,200
I'll inquire about the news.

214
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,100
Prince! Prince!

215
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,200
Why are you here?

216
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Prince, we've been waiting for you.

217
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,400
Do you know there's a big event in Lutai Mountain?

218
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,300
Yes, a big event.

219
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,200
No wonder a new devil appeared.

220
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
It's Shunde's conspiracy.

221
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,400
Madam, why aren't you afraid?

222
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,600
No need to be afraid of Shunde.

223
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,800
I'm just really happy that Yunhe has finally returned.

224
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,100
I used to feel guilty.

225
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,800
I used to think that only I could stay with the person I love,

226
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,400
but I couldn't see the happiness of my friends.

227
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,600
Now, it turns out to be a good ending.

228
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
This room is a little stuffy.

229
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,500
I want some fresh air.

230
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,600
Prince has become a bit strange since he returned.

231
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
He seems to be speechless.

232
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,500
I think so, too.

233
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,500
<i>You must continue my mission</i>

234
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,300
<i>and retrieve the Heavenly Fire again.</i>

235
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,000
<i>Why must I do that?</i>

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,600
<i>Why can't I live peacefully with Sanyue?</i>

237
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,500
Li Shu.

238
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
What's wrong?

239
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,600
Yunhe has returned. Aren't you happy?

240
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
That's not it.

241
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm worried about Chang Yi.

242
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,100
Shunde's evil aura is fierce.

243
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,400
He and Yunhe have just met again

244
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,600
but will face such a strong enemy.

245
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
What if they face life and death again?

246
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,000
Shall we help them?

247
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,200
When we defeat Shunde,

248
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,800
we can ask them to provide us with a small house on the island

249
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,500
that they will finally buy.

250
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,200
Though I've been fighting,

251
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
I want to settle down

252
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,100
and lead a peaceful life.

253
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,400
I also want to marry my beloved husband

254
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
with beautiful clothes and hairpins...

255
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
like ordinary women.

256
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,600
You! Let me see!

257
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,800
Did what I say frighten you?

258
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
Sanyue.

259
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If one day I have to leave you

260
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,800
and go somewhere, what will you do?

261
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
Where are you going?

262
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,500
Listen. Wherever you go, I will go with you.

263
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,900
Whether life or death, we go and return together.

264
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,200
What if I don't want you to go?

265
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,400
What do you mean?

266
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,800
You want to leave me alone again?

267
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
I don't want to make you tired.

268
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,400
Li Shu, listen. If you abandon me again,

269
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,500
I'll randomly marry a man and not forgive you.

270
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,400
So serious?

271
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,400
If so, I should keep you.

272
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,800
Tell me where you will go.

273
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,000
Of course, North Abyss.

274
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,400
You haven't seen Yunhe for a long time.

275
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
Don't you miss her?

276
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,200
Pack up.

277
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,200
We'll go soon, okay?

278
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Prince.

279
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
It's over?

280
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,800
It is what the elders asked us to bring to you.

281
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,000
They said you should show the charm of Chongwu Mountain

282
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,400
if you marry your wife.

283
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,500
- Look.
- Open and have a look.

284
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,200
We won't bother you with your proposal.

285
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,400
You've known her for a long time.

286
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
We won't bother you anymore.

287
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,600
We'll leave.

288
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
See you. Don't miss us.

289
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
See you, Prince.

290
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,800
Father, the Frost has been eliminated.

291
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,200
It's a pity that I failed to destroy Zhu Yan

292
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
and Senior Qing Ji died as a result.

293
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm regretful.

294
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,800
You exhausted your spiritual power to burn the portrait.

295
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,700
You woke up after being in a coma for days.

296
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,200
You need to get some good rest.

297
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,600
Have you heard any news?

298
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
After Immortal Master and Zhu Yan died,

299
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,300
Shunde got complete control of the Master's mansion.

300
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,200
In recent days, the mansion has been entangled by a black aura.

301
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,400
I'm afraid it's ominous.

302
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,200
It seems that the fierce battle is not over yet.

303
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Qu Xiaoxing got the news

304
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,400
that Ji Yunhe and Chang Yi have set the barrier to defend against Shunde.

305
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,200
And...

306
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,800
Ji Yunhe will marry Chang Yi.

307
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
They'll get married?

308
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,700
When?

309
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,300
Tonight.

310
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,300
Fine.

311
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Yunhe's dream is coming true.

312
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,400
Young Master, I have to supervise the defense of North Abyss,

313
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
and I still have to prepare for the wedding tonight.

314
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
Why are you dragging me away for no reason?

315
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,800
Ji Yunhe, you'll marry the Master of North Abyss.

316
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,200
No matter how simple it is, it is still a grand event.

317
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
You're going to dress like this to get married?

318
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
Is there anything wrong with me?

319
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,700
Come with me.

320
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,000
Senior?
<i>[Guhuo Bird]</i>

321
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,600
Senior? Why did you return?

322
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
I didn't plan to return.

323
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
You saved me.

324
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,300
I owe you a favor. So I'm here to help you.

325
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,400
Young Master, is everything ready?

326
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes.

327
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,300
Then I'll leave it to you, Senior.

328
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,000
Come here.

329
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,200
I didn't know you had such a skill.

330
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
We have no skill of changing appearance.

331
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,800
But we are good at make-up.

332
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:58,300
Otherwise, how do you think I was able to get away so many times from under the eyes of the Immortal Master?

333
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,400
Sit still.

334
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,200
I thought I would never enjoy love from parents

335
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,600
and would be alone.

336
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,000
But I didn't expect that someone would be dressing me up.

337
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,700
Senior, what have you done these days?

338
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,000
I traveled around,

339
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,600
seeing clouds in the sky, and people come and go.

340
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,400
I don't want to be involved in the matters of North Abyss.

341
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,200
Forgetting the past and indulging in the world

342
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
is also a pleasant life.

343
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,200
It seems that you have really put down your previous obsession.

344
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,600
Yes.

345
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Though A'Yin has died,

346
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,800
it's good to see a mother and son reunite in the world.

347
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,600
But are you really happy before the wedding?

348
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,800
Why do you ask that?

349
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:57,200
Newlyweds seek nothing more than a sincere love that lasts forever.

350
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,400
But there is no hope in your eyes for the future.

351
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,800
Does true love only mean staying together forever?

352
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,300
I think it's worth remembering for a lifetime

353
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,200
if we can go through life and death together, even if it's just for a moment.

354
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
A moment?

355
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,100
Even if you can't live together forever?

356
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,000
Sometimes it is because of facing pain and choices

357
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,200
that love has a deeper meaning.

358
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,000
Thank you.

359
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,200
Now that I'm ready,

360
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,300
I'll never regret.

361
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,700
Let's start.

362
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,200
Nice.

363
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,000
♫ <i>Heaven is silent, all is quiet</i> ♫

364
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's beautiful tonight.

365
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
It's worth it even if we just have one night.

366
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,000
Chang Yi, don't think of anything else tonight.

367
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,500
In the world, happiness is the most important. Okay?

368
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,300
Okay.

369
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,400
Once in a lifetime. Lifelong promise.

370
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Even one carefree night is enough for me.

371
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,700
♫ <i>The rain washed the dust away, who is waiting for me</i> ♫

372

♫ <i>A grain of sand growing out of everything</i> ♫

382
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,500
It's the wedding of Yunhe and Chang Yi. Don't be sad.

383
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,800
Everything else should be put aside.

384
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,200
♫ <i>I'll be with you forever</i> ♫

385

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,100
♫ <i>I became fireworks and burn everything</i> ♫

391
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:15,200
♫ <i>I'm worthy of my life</i> ♫

392
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,600
It's my first time to host a wedding.

393
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,000
I have no experience.

394
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,600
Humans have three bows.

395
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,200
First, bow to Heaven and Earth.

396
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Second, bow to the parents.

397
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,000
Third, bow to each other.

398
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,700
Will you bow like humans?

399
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,400
Chang Yi and I have no parents now.

400
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
We're unwilling to bow to anyone.

401
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,100
How to get married should be decided by us. Okay?

402
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
Okay.

403
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,600
We came together all the way.

404
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
We don't need secular etiquette. We don't need to bow to anyone.

405
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Okay.

406
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,900
Tonight, let me toast to Heaven and Earth

407
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,800
and everyone I care about.

408
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,300
Heaven and Earth are our witnesses.

409
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,800
Friends connect us two.

410
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,900
Our hearts are connected. Never abandoning each other.

411
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,500
Finally, stay or get drunk.

412
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,000
<i>Great!</i>

413
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,100
Chang Yi, your wife is so elegant and unconventional.

414
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,600
I'll follow her suggestion.

415
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,200
It's up to her.

416
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Master Chang Yi, the ceremony is not over yet.

417
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Why are you in a hurry to leave with her?

418
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
<i>Yes!</i>

419
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I'm Ji Yunhe from Thousand Flower Valley. I'm here to tell Heaven and Earth

420
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,600
that I'm willing to be Chang Yi's wife.

421
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,800
A tied red rope means a good marriage.

422
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,300
No matter what suffering we encounter, we will never abandon each other.

423
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,300
I'm Chang Yi, a merman from East Sea.

424
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,700
Today, I'm here to tell Heaven and Earth

425
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,800
that I'm willing to be Ji Yunhe's husband.

426
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,200
If we can't live in the same room,

427
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,400
I hope to be buried with you after death.

428
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,000
Till our hair turns white,

429
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,200
I just want to always be with you.

430
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Look.

431
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,400
<i>So beautiful!</i>

432
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,200
Chang Yi.

433
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
North Abyss is preparing for war.

434
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,800
We should be nervous.

435
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,900
Why are they putting lanterns in the sky?

436
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,600
It's a blessing.

437
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,000
As Master of North Abyss, you protect it.

438
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,500
Immortals living here hope that you can be happy.

439
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,600
I used to think only family could do that.

440
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
They treat you as family.

441
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Chang Yi, you are true and pure.

442
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,400
But you lost your clan and home.

443
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
You've been suffering.

444
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,800
God owes you a lot.

445
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,000
The lanterns may be a little compensation for you.

446
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,600
Heaven doesn't owe me anything.

447
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,700
You and the lanterns in the sky

448
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,500
are the best gift in the world.

449
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Chang Yi, you are too gentle.

450
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,200
You've married a good man that can accompany you for the rest of your life.

451
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,200
I should be happy.

452
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,800
It's a pity that I can't go and congratulate you.

453

Okay. Tell me why you were upset at the wedding.

469
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,200
Look at me.

470
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Is there anything wrong?

471
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,600
It's almost midnight.

472
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,300
Midnight?

473
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Are you hiding something from me?

474
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,800
Kong Ming.

475
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Why didn't tell us that Chang Yi and Yunhe were getting married?

476
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,000
Let's make some noise at the bridal chamber.

477
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,400
Sanyue, let's go and meet Yunhe.

478
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,000
There's something wrong.

479
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Luo Luo.

480
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,200
I have to tell you the truth...

481
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,000
lest you can't accept it.

482
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,800
Luo Luo is good at drinking wine.

483
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,000
But she's drunk.

484
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,000
Because she's terribly happy for you.

485
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
I'll go and find Kong Ming.

486
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,100
Yunhe...

487
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,800
I just want to be with my wife on my wedding night.

488
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,300
Okay.

489
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,000
On our wedding night, we should stay together.

490
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,900
Chang Yi,

491
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:52,200
was the tail on the wedding dress embroidered very coarsely?

492
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,300
It is said that brides have to embroider wedding clothes by themselves.

493
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,000
But I'm not good at embroidery.

494
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,700
You did a good job.

495
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
It looked like my tail.

496
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,200
This is the only thing I regret.

497
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,000
If you didn't lose your tail,

498
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,400
would everything have become different?

499
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,200
I didn't lose anything.

500
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
After meeting you,

501
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,900
my life was complete with no regrets.

502
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,600
It's almost midnight.

503
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,100
It's time to sleep.

504
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,600
You still have a lot to do tomorrow.

505
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,400
Chang Yi.

506
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,900
I'm not sleepy yet.

507
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,400
Talk to me for a while, okay?

508
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
Okay.

509
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
Turn around.

510
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,200
Close your eyes.

511
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,800
I'll sing for you.

512
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,500
Then you'll be sleepy after the song. Okay?

513
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay.

514
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,600
Sing the song you sang to me in the Ten Directions Formation.

515
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:58,000
♫ <i>Each pair of eyes belongs to a merman</i> ♫

520
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,000
<i>I can only keep you alive until midnight tomorrow.</i>

521
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,200
<i>The wedding night?</i>

522
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,600
<i>Must you do that?</i>

523
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,600
<i>Since I can't stay with her for a long time,</i>

524
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,300
<i>I will try my best to leave some good memories in my limited days.</i>

532
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,200
Chang Yi, I'm sleepy.

533
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,100
I want to sleep.

534
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,800
Chang Yi.

535
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,800
It's a good night.

536
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,400
Thank you.

537
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,700
Yunhe.

538
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,600
Shunde brought me to the shore. I don't regret it.

539
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,800
She's crazy.

540
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,700
She made many mistakes.

541
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,400
But she did one right thing...

542
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,600
that she brought me to Thousand Flower Valley...

543
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,000
and let me meet you.
