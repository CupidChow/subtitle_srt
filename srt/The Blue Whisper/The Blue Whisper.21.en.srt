Thousand Flower Valley.

14
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,740
Sanyue, you do care about me.

15
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,620
Cut the crap.

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,940
A beauty came to the rescue.

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
You're Xue Sanyue from Thousand Flower Valley?

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,820
So you're one of our own.

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,520
I heard after the Ten Directions Formation Incident,

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,820
Commander Xue had been taken away by Master Qing.

21
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,900
Since you're here, I guess I came to the right place.

22
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,960
May I ask where Master Qing is?

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,940
Who are you?

24
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,580
Why do you look for her?

25
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm Kong Ming.

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,100
Under the order of Prince Chang Yi and the Fox King Qingxuan,

27
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,340
I came to invite Master Qing

28
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,040
to go to the North Abyss and help us.

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,940
Chang Yi?

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,560
You mean that dorky fish?

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,700
He's in North Abyss.

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,440
Then, what about Ji Yunhe?

33
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,380
It's a long story.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,440
What an intense story.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,620
It's just I don't understand what they're talking about.

36
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,202
Just listen.

37
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:03,660
Impossible.

38
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,960
Ji Yunhe was never the type to be unfaithful.

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,460
But it's what happened.

40
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,740
She lied to Chang Yi and even wanted to kill him.

41
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,380
Why should I believe you?

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,420
If you dare to talk nonsense again, I'll take your life.

43
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,340
Sanyue, calm down.

44
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,920
Master Qing likes quiet and hates being disturbed,

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,060
especially by Spiritual Masters.

46
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,520
He came empty-handed,

47
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,000
I believe someone will take his life.

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,360
I... should have prepared something.

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,900
It won't work.

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,600
Master Qing loves wine.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,140
If you can prepare some good wine

52
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,580
and freeze it at Jiuhan Cave for one night,

53
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,440
she might consider doing you a favor.

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,180
But...

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,400
I don't think you can stay a night in the chilly Jiuhan Cave.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,100
You'd better go home early.

57
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,888
Thanks.

58
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,040
Why did you help him?

59
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,900
There may be a misunderstanding between Yunhe and Chang Yi.

60
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,060
And he isn't evil. I trust him.

61
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,120
- Sanyue.
- They're gone.

62
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Sanyue, listen.

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,140
First, he has high spiritual power,

64
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,960
even among one of the best, but is plainly dressed.

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,360
Second, he looks rough

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,039
and I smelled herbs on him,

67
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,240
so I can infer he works with herbs all the time.

68
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,360
He must be the legendary Kong Ming

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,440
who betrayed Immortal Master Mansion.

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Besides, everything he said about Chang Yi is true.

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,240
Say no more.

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,440
I'll get to the bottom of what happened to Yunhe.

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
Sanyue.

74
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,060
Sanyue, you just saved me. Is it because you don't want me to leave?

75
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,800
I...

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,555
I just don't want people to touch my stuff.

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,780
Your stuff?

78
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,100
Sanyue, are you willing to take me now?

79
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,120
Sanyue.

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,660
- Prince. All right, all right.
- It's getting late.

81
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,040
- We should go back.
- Forget about whose stuff it is.

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,880
All the stuff in Chongwu Mountain is yours.

83
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
- Right, right, let's leave.
- Go, go, go.

84
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,100
You don't understand.

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,460
She's my karma.

86
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,460
Karma?

87
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,020
If I don't conquer her, I can't complete my cultivation.

88
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,240
The prosperity of our clan will be ruined

89
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,920
and my reputation will be tainted.

90
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,980
It's not that I want to stay. It's the mandate of Heaven.

91
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,320
I have no choice but to stay here.

92
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,940
So Da Huan and Xiao Huan, you guys go back first.

93
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,020
After I clear my karmic debt,

94
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,440
I'll return to Chongwu Mountain.

95
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,820
Da Huan, get him off me.

96
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,840
If you don't leave, we won't leave.

97
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,320
We'll help you to clear your karmic debt.

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,420
Right, right.

99
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,920
I can do it on my own. I can do it.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,260
- Prince, don't treat us as outsiders.
- Yes.

101
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,620
- Xiao Huan, carry him away.
- You're welcome.

102
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,540
- Let's go.
- No, no, no.

103
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,280
Go.

104
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
Wait, wait, wait.

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,360
Go, go, go.

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,220
Put me down.

107
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,880
Go.

108
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,260
Prince, perfect timing.

109
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,220
Young Lord Qingyao specially prepared these dishes for you.

110
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,900
Try this one first.

111
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,260
Sweet potatoes in ginger syrup.

112
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,160
It can take the chill off you.

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,967
Sweet potatoes?

114
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,740
P-Prince, well, it doesn't suit your taste?

115
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,120
If I want to take the chill off, I can just practice more.

116
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,780
I don't need these things.

117
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,280
Tell Young Lord her good will is appreciated.

118
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,740
This is the medicine. Bear with it for a while.

119
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,440
When the right time comes, I'll find an excuse to let you out.

120
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

121
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,640
Now that you're here, let's discuss a few more things.

122
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,160
Go ahead.

123
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,640
Although we're both against Immortal Master,

124
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,380
I'm doing you a favor after all.

125
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,380
But you only give me a small bottle of medicine every time,

126
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,520
it makes me feel a little...

127
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,320
Don't worry. I'll make it worth your while.

128
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,080
You don't want me to give your merman a hard time after everything's settled, right?

129
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,100
You're insightful, Your Majesty.

130
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,400
But I might want to ask you for more.

131
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,960
Please do.

132
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,760
In this Congji Jail,

133
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,900
many immortals have been punished more than they deserved.

134
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,240
Those who should have been released are still being held.

135
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,900
I want to plead for your help on their behalf.

136
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,860
Please release them.

137
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,120
This isn't a small request.

138
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,340
I know I've gotten a little greedy.

139
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,960
You agreed?

140
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Immortal Masters performed forbidden magic, but we haven't found proof.

141
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,240
But the accidental death of the guilty immortal is indeed true.

142
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,060
More and more people have become weak for no reason.

143
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,800
The situation cannot be underestimated.

144
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,340
As the emperor, I have my own difficulties.

145
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,980
You'll have to release them in secret.

146
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,500
This token can help you.

147
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,420
There's one more thing. Please promise me...

149
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,720
not to hurt my sister.

150
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,020
Your Majesty, I'm not that kindhearted.

151
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,040
I can't return good for evil.

152
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,160
At best, I can promise you

153
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
I won't harm her

154
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,760
before she gives me trouble.

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,960
Okay, it's a deal.

156
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,019
I wonder if you have ever thought

157
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,359
that our loved ones could also be our calamity that we have to overcome?

158
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:41,899
Success or failure doesn't necessarily depend on us.

159
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,140
What's your point?

160
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,200
Nothing. It's just some of my random thoughts.

161
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,100
If we can't change those people during our lifetime,

162
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,400
should we persist or let it go?

163
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,420
There's a jar of wine here.

164
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,580
No wonder I smelled alcohol.

165
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,640
My spirit stone is saved.

166
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,880
Why is it so cold?

167
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,120
Who left the wine here to freeze it?

168
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,080
He'd be frozen before he could take a sip.

169
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,603
Smells so good.

170
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
What's wrong with you?

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Why do you steal my wine without warning?

172
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,600
Don't you know how to be kind to girls?

173
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,000
I left it here to make iced wine.

174
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
How hilarious.

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,800
No one was here when I came in.

176
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,700
Fine.

177
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,200
If you insist this wine is yours, just call it.

178
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,800
If it answers you, I'll give it to you.

179
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,600
What an unreasonable woman. That's utter nonsense.

180
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
This wine is useful to me. I can't let you have it.

181
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,800
Good.

182
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
This wine is also useful to me.

183
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,400
I can't let you have it, either.

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Why... is the door closed?

185
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,700
Oh, crap.

186
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,800
Master Qing must have set a trap here.

187
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,400
If something happens in the cave, the door will be closed.

188
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm afraid it could only be opened from the outside.

189
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Then, what should we do now?

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,700
Say something.

191
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,100
I just don't believe it.

192
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,000
It won't work.

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,600
What do you mean?

194
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,300
You're not even helping me.

195
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,100
You inexplicably froze the wine here and started a fight with me.

196
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,800
Why on earth are you here?

197
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,400
- To see someone.
- See someone?

198
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm also seeing someone here.

199
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,900
- Who do you want to see?
- Who do you want to see?

200
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,100
Well, it's a long story.

201
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,200
Anyway, my master has been imprisoned by the Immortal Master.

202
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm looking for helpers.

203
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
Is your master surnamed Ji?

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
How did you know?

205
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,600
You must be Ji Yunhe's attendant.

206
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes, yes, I am.

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,900
You are...?

208
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,400
I came for Chang Yi.

209
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Chang Yi?

210
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,400
Hasn't he gone to the North Abyss?

211
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,700
So you're also looking for Blue Feather Phoenix?

212
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,000
Big Brother, it was a misunderstanding.

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,600
Turns out we're on the same side.

214
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
Since you are one of us,

215
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
don't just sit here.

216
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Help me open that door.

217
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Who's one of you?

218
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Don't make connections.

219
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,400
I suggest you not reinvent the wheel.

220
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,600
When Li Shu and Xue Sanyue find out,

221
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,400
they'll come to save us.

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,800
Xue Sanyue's here, too?

223
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,000
Why didn't you tell me?

224
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,000
I've wasted so much spiritual power.

225
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,700
Li Shu?

226
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,800
Li Shu is also here?

227
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
He's still alive!

228
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,700
So he didn't die that day?

229
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,800
Tell me what happened.

230
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,200
You know what?

231
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
All the attendants in Thousand Flower Valley

232
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,000
are good at playing dead.

233
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,200
Like Siyu and Li Shu.

234
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Do you think I could do the same?

235
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
I want to play dead, too.

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,700
I'm dead.

237
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Slow down, Xiao Huan.

238
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,800
Put me down!

239
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,400
- Careful.
- Hurry.

240
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,100
Relax, Prince. I'm not tired. Put me down!

241
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,300
I didn't ask if you were tired.

242
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,600
Now, I'm ordering you as the prince to put me down.

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Come on.

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,600
Relax, Prince.

245
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,200
With us two here, your karmic debt will definitely be cleared.

246
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Stop it.

247
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,900
There's no place for you to live.

248
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,200
Prince, we lived in Chongwu Mountain.

249
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,300
This is also a mountain. It's the same.

250
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,100
- We're the best at climbing mountains. Don't you think?
- Right.

251
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,800
Rest assured, Prince. We'll take care of ourselves.

252
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,400
We'll make the wild our home.

253
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
Just relax.

254
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Good for you two.

255
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,400
<i>Catch up!</i>

256
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
What are you doing?

257
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,400
Keeping myself warm.

258
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,200
Haven't you heard that

259
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,000
people can cuddle for warmth?

260
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,200
Chang Yi cuddled Yunhe once while sleeping,

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,400
and Yunhe said it felt warm and safe.

262
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,800
That's how she trained the heart.

263
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,200
It's a sin.

264
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
What are you whispering?

265
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you feel cold?

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,800
I'm freezing, too.

267
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,600
Shall we... cuddle up?

268
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
No, thanks.

269
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,800
I'm not Chang Yi.

270
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,100
You and I are different from them.

271
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,800
What's the difference?

272
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
They're one man and one woman.

273
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,000
It's the same with us.

274
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,600
Yunhe always tells me she loves Chang Yi.

275
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,400
But what is love?

276
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Is it edible?

277
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
Can we trade it for spirit stones?

278
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,100
If love can keep me warm,

279
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,000
I could love you.

280
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,000
If you talk nonsense again,

281
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,300
I'll set your spirit elixir to fire.

282
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,500
I've had enough of it.

283
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,400
I've never seen someone as rigid as you.

284
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
This wine is for Master Qing. You mustn't drink it.

285
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,500
I'm between life and death.

286
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,800
It's about a great cause.

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,800
No mistakes are allowed.

288
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,900
But you'll freeze to death before you accomplish the great cause.

289
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,600
For what I believe in, I'd rather die.

290
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Didn't Ji Yunhe teach you this?

291
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,300
We don't know about beliefs.

292
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,100
Our life is simple.

293
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,200
We only want to save some spirit stones

294
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,000
to purchase an Immortal Island.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
Sure enough.

296
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
An apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

297
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
You're both mercenary.

298
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,100
What makes you say that?

299
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,900
Jin Yunhe betrayed Chang Yi for her own future.

300
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,400
She didn't.

301
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,800
She wanted to let Chang Yi go.

302
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
But she tried to kill him.

303
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,700
She had reasons.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,700
Then tell me, were you on the cliff that day?

305
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you know how cruelly she talked to and treated Chang Yi?

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How do you know she wouldn't lie to you?

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Though I wasn't there,

308
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,600
I trust her.

309
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't want to persuade you.

310
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,000
Forget it. Let's talk about them later.

311
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,600
Now...

312
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,600
could you lend me some of your spiritual power?

313
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,800
What do you want again?

314
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
What is with you?

315
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Wake up!

316
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
I'll drink it.

317
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,000
It's a strong wine.

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,200
Yunhe taught me it's hard to live.

319
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,800
So each of us has to be responsible for our own lives.

320
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,200
Never mind about the wine.

321
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Life is what matters.

322
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,600
I feel so warm after drinking it.

323
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Do you want to try it, too?

324
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,800
I'll help you.

325
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
No way.

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,400
Is the wine this strong?

327
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Lucky for you, you won't feel cold when you're asleep.

328
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,400
You're warm.

329
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
So warm.

330
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,900
The warm power is coming out of your body itself.

331
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,600
Since it's already out,

332
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,500
I may just use it.

333
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,800
If you don't talk, I'll take it as a yes.

334
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,600
So warm.

335
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,600
It feels so warm.

336
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,200
You... You... Why did you throw me away?

337
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
You really don't know how to treat girls tenderly.

338
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I...

339
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,000
It hurts.

340
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,900
W-What did you do to me?

341
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,200
Don't you know what I did to you?

342
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Look.

343
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,600
Delusion.

344
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
Delusion. Delusion.

345
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,000
It's a delusion.

346
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Delusion. Delusion!

347
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Sanyue.

348
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Oh, no. There's a trap in Jiuhan Cave.

349
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,600
If Kong Ming is locked inside,

350
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,800
he may not come out alive.

351
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Kong Ming!

352
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
Kong Ming!

353
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,200
I'll try if I can open it from the outside.

354
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay. Be careful, Sanyue.

355
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,800
Sanyue.

356
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,300
Sanyue, you're amazing.

357
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,800
Commander Xue, there you are.

358
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,400
Luo Jinsang? Why are you here?

359
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
You two are...

360
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,000
Yunhe asked me to come here.

361
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
She sent me to look for Master Qing.

362
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Who would have known that I would meet this dorky man here?

363
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,100
He tried to steal my wine.

364
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,700
I was locked up here all night because of him.

365
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,800
You're saying you and Kong Ming

366
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,900
were locked up alone for a whole night?

367
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,000
Kong Ming?

368
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,400
So your name is Kong Ming.

369
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,500
Don't come close.

370
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
You've wasted such a good name.

371
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,100
How rude.

372
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
He's so rude.

373
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,100
It's freezing in this cave.

374
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,600
Not to mention one night,

375
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,100
an ordinary attendant can't even stay here for two hours.

376
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,000
But I think he's getting heated.

377
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
Yes, a lot.

378
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,000
I made him drink last night,

379
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and the warm power in his body rose all the way here.

380
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,300
He was burning like a stove.

381
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,200
Enough.

382
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,300
Can't you talk properly?

383
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
That's for scolding me.

384
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,200
Last night, you were quite happy.

385
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Why today you become...

386
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,400
Stop it.

387
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
I won't.

388
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,600
Well, you threw me away.

389
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,600
What are you laughing at?

390
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,400
You guys also think it's funny how we kept each other warm?

391
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,000
Li Shu, I have to say you're so good at playing dead.

392
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We were worried about you for nothing.

393
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,400
So you and Commander Xue ended up being together.

394
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,000
If we could really be together,

395
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,200
that'd be great.

396
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's been a long time.

397
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
My memories have grown dim.

398
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,400
The freckles on your face...

399
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
What's wrong with my face?

400
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,400
It's ugly.

401
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You drank the whole jar?

402
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,600
How will Master Qing see me?

403
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,300
You...

404
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,200
It's just a jar of wine.

405
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
I drank the wine.

406
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,800
I'll be responsible for it.

407
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,200
Yunhe taught me this.

408
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,800
Good!

409
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,400
You want to get me drunk with this empty jar?

410
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,800
Are you kidding me?

411
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,600
It's only a jar of wine.

412
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,600
I can make every dish I've tasted

413
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,400
and every wine I've drunk.

414
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,500
Master, please wait.

415
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Lynx, make way.

416
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Master.

417
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't need to drink it.

418
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,500
Master Qing.

419
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Alcohol reminds me of the past.

420
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,600
The more I drink, the more sober I get.

421
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,800
There's no use in drinking such wine.

422
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,000
You haven't had a sip, how could you know it's useless?

423
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,400
I get it.

424
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,600
Master, you must be scared.

425
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,200
I've never been scared in my life.

426
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,200
Fine.

427
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,000
If your wine can get me drunk,

428
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll grant your request and leave this mountain to help you.

429
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,600
But if I don't get drunk,

430
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,500
you'll be forbidden to set foot on Leyou Mountain ever again.

431
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,600
Master, please think twice.

432
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,500
- It's a deal.
- You!

433
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,300
All right.

434
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,100
Sanyue, I've cleaned it.

435
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,300
<i>This...</i>

436
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,700
Mr. Kong Ming.

437
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,900
Well,

438
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,600
are you still thinking about last night?

439
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Don't talk nonsense.

440
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
They've been drinking for a long while.

441
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,000
Can we count on Luo Jinsang or not?

442
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,200
You know best whether we can count on her or not.

443
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,400
I only met her yesterday.

444
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,800
How could I know?

445
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,400
She drank a whole jar with you last night.

446
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,200
If it was only for warmth,

447
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
either the wine is bad,

448
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
or that Luo Luo can hold liquor.

449
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Sir, which reason do you think it is?

450
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,200
Do you think everyone is as gossipy as you?

451
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,600
What we should be thinking about right now is if we fail,

452
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,500
how will we persuade Master Qing.

453
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,800
Luo Jinsang seems ditzy,

454
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,400
but she learned from Ji Yunhe.

455
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,300
Among the four of us, she might stand the best chance of winning.

456
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,800
Then let's wait and see

457
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
what tricks she has up her sleeve.

458
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,300
Little girl, you're losing.

459
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,600
The wine can't get people drunk,

460
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,800
nor can it drown sorrows.

461
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,100
Wait.

462
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,500
There's something else in the last bowl.

463
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,200
Fermented sweet rice?

464
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,100
Do you honestly believe this sweet thing

465
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,000
can make me drunk?

466
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,200
Yunhe said this is what works.

467
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
She doesn't know wine.

468
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
It's you who doen't know wine.

469
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,400
As an alcoholic, you have been wasting wine all the time.

470
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
How did I waste wine?

471
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,300
I made the wines with the spirits of grains, flowers, and grass.

472
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,200
You just drank it to comfort yourself,

473
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,600
it's surely a waste.

474
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,500
Every time Yunhe drank wine, she would finish the last bowl

475
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,800
with fermented sweet rice in it.

476
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,600
She said, it could give her strength

477
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,500
when she got sober.

478
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,200
She could say the words

479
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
she had been longing to say,

480
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,800
and do the things she had been longing to do.

481
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,600
That's how you should forget sorrows.

482
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,200
You little girl drank this whole jar alone last night.

483
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,000
What did you get to teach me a lesson?

484
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Anyway, the thing I did kept me warm.

485
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We're getting off track.

486
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,800
In my heart, I've already made a decision.

487
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,500
Whether you agree to help or not,

488
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,200
I'll save my friend, whatever it costs.

489
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,100
<i>If we can't stay true to ourselves and do what we want,</i>

490
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,400
<i>what's the point of being alive?</i>

491
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,600
I've been living a befuddled life,

492
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,000
what have I done?

493
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,700
I profess to be a free spirit,

494
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,600
but in the end,

495
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,400
I'm not even as sensible as a young girl.

496
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,800
Girl, the world is boring.

497
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,400
But your wine is interesting.

498
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Ji Yunhe has taught you well.

499
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,200
Of course.

500
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,000
Tell them I'll leave tomorrow.

501
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,000
Really?

502
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,200
Thank you, Master!

503
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,960
How was your talk with Master Qing?

504
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,440
She... She agreed!

505
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,620
I told you. Maybe she could persuade Master.

506
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,560
Is it what you said?

507
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,620
I believe in everything you say.

508
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,640
Whoever said it is the same.

509
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,600
Are you all right?

510
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,840
I'm not, actually.

511
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,440
I drank too much. My head hurts.

512
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,260
Luo Jinsang, where are you going?

513
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,700
Why does she look whiter now?

514
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,860
Will something happen to her?

515
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:40,140
Who is this? So pretty.

516
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,679
Could you be Luo Jinsang?

517
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,920
Where are my freckles?

518
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,900
<i>Everything depends on warm power.</i>

519
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,500
<i>I got it.</i>

520
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,760
So that's why Yunhe is drawn to Chang Yi.

521
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,880
Why are you so pretty?

522
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,740
Are you sober now?

523
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,620
About last night,

524
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,080
we should talk.

525
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,850
Kong Ming!

526
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,000
Kong Ming.

527
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,760
Kong Ming, you're full of vigor. I really admire you.

528
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,140
It's fate that we met.

529
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,940
This time, could you share with me some of your spiritual power?

530
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,040
And could you use some more time? More time.

531
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,000
Luo Jinsang, don't make such kinds of jokes again.

532
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,580
I'm not joking. I'm very serious.

533
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,700
Look at me.

534
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,800
I'm serious.

535
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,860
Ji Yunhe's attendant is quite blunt.

536
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,780
Fine, fine.

537
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,720
Just take what happened last night as a misunderstanding.

538
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,300
A misunderstanding. We should go our separate ways.

539
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,460
How could I take it as a misunderstanding?

540
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,440
I, Luo Jinsang, can't just take advantage of you.

541
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,100
I'll be responsible for you.

542
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,300
Listen to me.

543
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
I have lots of spirit stones.

544
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,040
When we can live on the Immortal Island,

545
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,940
I'll treat you to all the delicacies. Am I not nice to you?

546
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,640
Yes, you are.

547
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,120
You're very nice.

548
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,600
But, Luo Jinsang, could you stand on your own now?

549
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,080
No.

550
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,340
Looks like Mr. Kong Ming has been taken advantage of.

551
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,640
Luo Jinsang, if you're still like this, I'm going to throw you away again.

552
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,580
You won't.

553
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,300
You are just as stubborn as a mule,

554
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,480
who won't admit your feelings.

555
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,500
Should we help him or not?

556
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,760
- Luo Jinsang.
- I'm here.

557
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,240
You said Ji Yunhe is still trapped in Lutai Mountain.

558
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,440
Master Qing is now leaving here to deal with Immortal Master.

559
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,100
Do you want to go to save her with me?

560
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,160
That's what I came for.

561
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,960
I do, I do. I'll go with you.

562
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,400
Let's go.

563
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,960
Sanyue, I'm going with you.

564
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,280
You'd better follow Master Qing.

565
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,092
But I want to...

566
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,380
Sanyue still won't open her heart to me.

567
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,940
We're both adult men,

568
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,480
why are we disturbed by the girls

569
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,940
and can do nothing about it?

570
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,880
What a shame.

571
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,840
Don't talk nonsense here.

572
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,800
After Master Qing wakes up, we'll set off immediately and return to Lingshuang Pavilion.

573
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,540
- We'll join you.
- Right, right.

574
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,580
Don't even bother.

575
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,700
If we're all gone, who'll guard Leyou Mountain?

576
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,980
If I come back and see a speck of dust,

577
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,360
I'll mop the floor with your bodies.

578
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,980
- I...
- Moreover, no more eavesdropping.

579
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,200
This book tells some fascinating anecdotes.

580
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,300
Look at this. In a wealthy family, the master and the hostess

581
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,740
were both killed in one night.

582
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,500
It's said they look peaceful as if they were sleeping.

583
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,360
The local people thought it was the evil spirit who did this.

584
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,300
But the writer later found out after investigation

585
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,180
that they used charcoal in the room which blocked the ventilation and resulted in this tragedy.

586
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,540
The writer called it charcoal poison.

587
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,400
People make up evil spirits to explain what they don't know

588
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,780
and to ease up their discomfort.

589
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,420
It's rare to have someone willing to find out the truth

590
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,960
and make a book out of it.

591
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,560
Sadly, not many people stuck to the last page.

592
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,567
She wouldn't let go.

593
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,273
She?

594
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,880
Now the North Abyss is prospering under your leadership

595
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,980
and tens of thousands of immortals have taken refuge here.

596
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,920
It's like a large army.

597
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,840
I've been trapped in No Desire Cave for many years.

598
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,720
I'm already in a delicate state of health.

599
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,700
Prince Chang Yi is credited

600
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,140
with creating prosperity here.

601
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,360
I'm flattered.

602
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,140
Just accept his praises.

603
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,660
Let's cut to the chase.

604
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,100
You went through all the trouble to have invited me over, what's your plan?

605
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,940
We can split into three teams.

606
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,900
The first team goes with you

607
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,160
to lure Immortal Master out of Lutai Mountain,

608
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,900
and stall him as long as you can.

609
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,900
The second team stays in the North Abyss and takes Mr. Kong Ming

610
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,960
as the leader for reinforcements.

611
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,140
The third team goes to the south with me

612
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,380
to Immortal Master Mansion and save all the innocent immortals being trapped.

613
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,320
Chang Yi, what a bad plan you proposed.

614
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,760
If we're going to fight, we shall unite and work together.

615
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,940
Though now the number of us is growing,

616
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,280
half of them traveled a long way here.

617
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,300
They're sickly and need rest. Not all of them can go with us.

618
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,680
Besides, Fairy Shunde has been coveting the North Abyss.

619
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,860
If all of us leave here and no one stays,

620
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,120
we will probably get attacked.

621
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,740
If we're not careful enough,

622
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,280
North Abyss will fall into her hands again.

623
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,440
Fine. Then you stay here. I'll go to Immortal Master Mansion.

624
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,540
I have to go to Immortal Master Mansion.

625
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,500
- Why?
- Because I'm capable.

626
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,500
Qifeng, don't argue with Chang Yi.

627
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,220
Chang Yi, it will be a dangerous journey.

628
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,820
In order to show support, I will go with you.

629
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,540
Thank you, Fox King.

630
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,380
Fox King, I've been to Lutai Mountain and know the terrain there very well.

631
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,940
I'm hoping you agree that when we get there, we'll do what I planned.

632
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,380
Okay. You're the commander of the North Abyss.

633
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,640
We should do as you planned.

634
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,160
<i>I wonder how it went.</i>

635
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,180
How did it go?

636
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,380
Master Qing has promised to help us.

637
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,080
I'll set off with the army shortly.

638
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,360
All right. After talking about business, let's have a private chat.

639
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,040
Since we parted at the Thousand Flower Valley, I've been missing you.

640
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,220
Did you shed some tears

641
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,320
when you heard of my death?

642
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,935
I didn't.

643
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,060
Stubborn.

644
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,380
It's good that we could meet again.

645
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,900
Okay. I'm going to Lutai with you.

646
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,100
As you like.

647
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,900
Right, Chang Yi.

648
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,900
I have a token.

649
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,900
When you see Ji Chengyu, you can show it to him,

650
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,080
so that he won't give you a hard time.

651
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,560
It'll be good to suffer less on the road.

652
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,588
Thanks.

653
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,763
Prince Chang Yi.

654
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,580
You're quite occupied.

655
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,080
Good luck with that.

656
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,300
- Let's go.
- Okay.

657
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,020
Prince Chang Yi, you insisted on going to Lutai Mountain.

658
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,320
Except for rescuing the immortals, is there anything else you want to do?

659
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,060
Young Lord, you're overthinking.

660
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,140
I can see it in your eyes that something's up with you.

661
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,920
Do you have someone on your mind?

662
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,660
You can tell me so we'll work together on it.

663
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,280
Thank you, Young Lord.

664
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,720
I greatly appreciate it.

665
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,000
You'll be helping me

666
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,820
by taking care of the Fox King and holding the army together.
