<i>Ji Yunhe, Lin Haoqing asked the right question.</i>

14
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:42,820
<i>Why are you afraid to use the Mirror of Love to test yourself?</i>

15
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,440
<i>Could it be that you have feelings for Chang Yi?</i>

16
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,040
<i>Don't you know the answer?</i>

17
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,240
<i>What result would have the Mirror of Love given?</i>

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,239
Yunhe! Yunhe!

19
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,660
What are you hiding?

20
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,360
It's a secret. Where have you been?

21
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,240
Chang Yi said he wanted to see you.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,199
You went to see him again.

23
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,880
You spent so much time on him,

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,400
and there's no progress at all.

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,440
Of course, I'll help you out.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,800
I went to tell him.

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,120
Siyu was dead.

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,240
Lin Haoqing was grounded.

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,560
No one would bully him anymore.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,300
You know what? He was moved to tears.

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,320
And he said he'd get you a gift.

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,680
He-He has nothing now.

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
What can he give me?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,220
Check by yourself. You'll see.

35
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,520
It's nice to be in love.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,100
You get gifts every day.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,000
You don't have to go.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Since you are so tired, I'll go and see for you.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,038
No.

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,440
I should enjoy it after receiving it.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,929
Bye.

42
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,880
You mermen can control the snow with Water Control magic.

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,040
Luo Luo said that you want to see the snow.

44
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,960
So I...

45
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,100
Didn't you say that there wasn't anything on shore that you liked?

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,040
There's a lot of good stuff on shore.

47
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,580
Flowers in spring. The moon in autumn.

48
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,700
The breeze in summer and snow in winter.

49
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,860
There's a lot to remember.

50
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,338
You're right.

51
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,763
Things are beautiful ashore.

52
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:16,880
The snow. Do you like it?

53
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,560
No.

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Big-tailed Fish.

55
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,200
Actually, I dealt with Lin Haoqing and Siyu

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,440
also for myself.

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,398
You don't have to repay me like this.

58
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:37,460
I'm not trying to repay you.

59
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,306
I did this just for you.

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,740
I've made the decision.

61
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,220
I'd love to stay ashore with you.

62
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,695
What if...

63
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm not as good as you think?

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,640
What if I don't deserve your trust?

65
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,360
Mermen just listen from here.

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
It says you're worth it.

67
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,116
And you are.

68
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,778
Big-tailed Fish.

69
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:44,720
Actually, there's one thing you never gave me an answer to.

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,060
As a kind man as you,

71
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,760
why did you hurt Fairy Shunde

72
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,540
and beat up disciples of Immortal Master Manor?

73
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,880
Does that matter?

74
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,706
Sure.

75
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,280
I saved her.

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,220
Who?

77
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,960
Fairy Shunde you just mentioned.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,840
The storm was rough that day.

79
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,580
She fell into the sea.

80
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,140
I saved her and sent her back to shore.

81
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,480
And then?

82
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,320
She said she wanted to find an attendant who can protect her.

83
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,120
She wants to take me back.

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,680
I didn't agree.

85
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,360
And she ordered to arrest me.

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560
That's why you beat up disciples of Immortal Master Manor?

87
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,460
But even if you were on shore, it's so close to the sea.

88
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,980
You could just turn around and jump back into the ocean.

89
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,080
Once a merman enters the ocean, your strength would be multiplied.

90
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,460
And who could bind you then?

91
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,060
Her master.

92
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,861
Your Immortal Master.

93
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,040
Have you learned your lesson?

94
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,560
Will you save people randomly anymore?

95
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,040
How do you know for sure

96
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,400
whether you save the right ones or not?

97
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
I don't know either.

98
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,640
Good and evil are simply a thought.

99
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,680
It is evil to betray kindness.

100
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,080
But what about leaving people to die?

101
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,200
No one can know everything about the world.

102
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,380
Not everything can be measured in terms of pros and cons.

103
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,760
So. If there is a next time,

104
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,200
I'd follow my heart anyway.

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,600
Nothing more than just bearing the consequences.

106
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,645
Just like that?

107
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,404
Just like that.

108
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,840
What if one day you regret it?

109
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
One day, you'd suffer for life because of this.

110
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,620
If I regret it, it would be sad.

111
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,000
But if you lose sight of what you want for fear of regret,

112
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,360
wouldn't it be sadder?

113
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,140
Thank you, Big-tailed Fish.

114
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,760
You helped me figure something out.

115
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,900
<i>Chang Yi, your pure goodness</i>

116
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,040
<i>is the most precious beauty and hope in the world.</i>

117
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,740
<i>I'll guard it whatever happens.</i>

118
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,050
Yunhe! Wait for me.

119
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,560
What happened to you? You look so pale.

120
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,038
There's one thing that I've forgotten for a long time.

121
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,980
Thanks to Chang Yi, I could hear my own inner voice.

122
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,400
I've decided not to cut off Chang Yi's tail.

123
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll get him out of here.

124
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,060
What?

125
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,840
It was Shunde who lied. She concealed the truth.

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,200
Chang Yi was innocent.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,480
Fairy Shunde. All I ever knew was that she was domineering.

128
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,412
I can't believe that she accused others for no reason.

129
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,760
I can't live with this.

130
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,040
But, Yunhe, in the eyes of others,

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,220
Chang Yi is a sinner. They won't believe him.

132
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,480
That's why we need to get him out.

133
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,180
Otherwise, I don't know how much he will suffer here.

134
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,200
Great. I like exciting things.

135
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,220
Let's go find Xue Sanyue.

136
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,760
Before we go to her,

137
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,800
we need to find a secluded man first.

138
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,760
He has something to do with this.

139
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,069
Open your mouth.

140
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,760
Sanyue, I want to lie in your arms.

141
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,240
Don't be so talkative when you're wounded.

142
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
Really.

143
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,240
The cell was dark and damp.

144
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,440
It's hard to sleep there.

145
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,120
I asked you to practice hard, and you're lazy.

146
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,940
Now you've learned your lesson.

147
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,400
Because of you, I'm not worried about anything.

148
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,320
By the way, why did you ask me to give the Mirror of Love

149
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,733
as a gift to Ji Yunhe?

150
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,800
Sanyue, the medicine you made is a little bitter.

151
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,500
Can you go to the flower sea and pick some fruit for me to get rid of this bitterness?

152
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,438
All right. Drink the medicine yourself.

153
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:13,960
Okay.

154
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,290
Come in.

155
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,080
I knew you'd be here for sure.

156
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,720
I knew there was something wrong with you.

157
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,740
They say I'm a good actor.

158
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,760
Compared to you, I'm much worse.

159
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,918
Xue Sanyue has been tricked away by you.

160
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Tonight, we need a good conversation indeed.

161
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,430
Have a seat.

162
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,400
There's no need to be polite.

163
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,838
Tell me.

164
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,080
When did you know Chang Yi and I were acting?

165
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,360
As I said, you can come to Sanyue for fighting.

166
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,540
When it comes to love, you have to ask me.

167
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,060
If you really were a couple, there would be no need to coax him ashore.

168
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,580
You could just follow him to the East Sea.

169
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,400
It seems that judging people by their looks, you're as good as I am.

170
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,280
Siyu's thoughts. My thoughts.

171
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,060
You've known them all.

172
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,720
Why didn't you expose me?

173
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,760
Sanyue needs friends. You need allies.

174
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,480
And I need a guarantee to make sure you have no other choice

175
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,720
but to look for the cure devotedly and take Sanyue out of Thousand Flower Valley

176
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,360
without being threatened by Frost.

177
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,360
You're so sure that I'll accept your request for Chang Yi?

178
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,540
I only know one thing.

179
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,420
If the play is realistic enough,

180
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,760
the actors had in fact long ago already become a part of the play.

181
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,440
Now, can we talk about the deal again?

182
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,860
If you want, Sanyue doesn't need to know this.

183
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,740
I've heard all I need to know.

184
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,300
Sanyue, how did you get back so soon?

185
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,620
I returned to ask what kind of fruit you wanted.

186
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,440
I didn't expect that I would hear a lot of surprising things.

187
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,600
- What are you doing?
- Calm down, Sanyue. We can talk about this.

188
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,440
Ji Yunhe, between you and Chang Yi, was it just acting?

189
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,760
I am afraid it is true love without them knowing.

190
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,460
But by using the Mirror of Love, it should be clear by now.

191
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,300
The Mirror of Love was smashed to pieces by Siyu.

192
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,680
So, I didn't know my feelings for Chang Yi.

193
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,520
Just like when we stole the cure, I didn't know what our fate would be.

194
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,220
Alliance with you was just a stalling tactic.

195
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,220
So that after cutting off Chang Yi's tail, I can give him to Lin Canglan.

196
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,500
What about now?

197
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,498
Now, I just want to give Lin Canglan a little trouble.

198
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:12,700
Send Chang Yi home, and then do whatever I want.

199
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,360
Xue Sanyue. I, Ji Yunhe, always considered more and talked less.

200
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,540
But now I will hold nothing back.

201
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,260
Our original alliance, does it still count now?

202
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,740
Throughout my life, I have hated betrayal.

203
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,140
This is a warning.

204
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,120
If there is a next time, I won't forgive you.

205
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,420
Ji Yunhe, I heard when the immortals are allied, you need a gift as a gesture of good faith.

206
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,258
We're out of spirit stones.

207
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,920
Sanyue just spared your master's life. Isn't that enough?

208
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,480
Yunhe, take out your treasures.

209
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,000
The terrain of Thousand Flower Valley is rugged. Prohibitions are set in all directions.

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We need permission from Master to train out of Thousand Flower Valley.

211
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
If we want to get out of here,

212
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,540
we must know the terrain of Thousand Flower Valley

213
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,358
and their defense habits.

214
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,020
This is a map I drew based on my observations over the years.

215
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,720
It seems that you're well-prepared.

216
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,100
Although the Thousand Flower Valley is not in Heaven,

217
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,260
but it is also the residence of the immortals.

218
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,800
Why is it guarded so strictly?

219
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,200
Because the Ten Directions Formation to repress the Blue Feather Bird is in the Thousand Flower Valley.

220
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,820
Ten Directions Formation.

221
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,520
It's an old story.

222
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,680
Just like the Star of Life masters destiny.

223
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,700
Fairy Weaver knows color well.

224
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,120
Master of Wind and Rain controls the clouds and rain.

225
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,680
As Emperor Jun's descendants, Spiritual Masters have their own duties.

226
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,540
After the Zhuyan Rebellion,

227
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,020
Spiritual Masters were assigned to discipline all the criminals below.

228
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,740
Everything was in order before.

229
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,860
But just a thousand years ago,

230
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,740
the Blue Feather Rebellion broke out.

231
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,960
The Blue Feather Phoenix was an ancient sacred bird;

232
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,080
the Phoenix King.

233
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,620
But she's naturally arrogant.

234
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,400
It is said that every time she went out,

235
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,920
she'd make a mess of the world

236
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,780
and stir the world into chaos.

237
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,920
The head of the Spiritual Masters in the Thousand Flower Valley,

238
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,480
Impermanent Sage, Ning Ruochu, and other nine senior Spiritual Masters

239
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,340
lured the Blue Feather Phoenix into the Thousand Flower Valley.

240
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,260
They fought for ten days.

241
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,120
Finally, they combined ten Spiritual Masters' strengths to form Ten Directions Formation.

242
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,280
In the end, Master Ning sacrificed his life

243
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,100
to seal the Blue Feather Phoenix.

244
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,620
Because Thousand Flower Valley sealed the Blue Feather Phoenix,

245
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,720
the defense was strict.

246
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,860
Ten array eyes of the Formation are all hidden

247
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,308
just to prevent the Blue Feather Phoenix from escaping or being rescued.

248
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,860
It is a pity to say so.

249
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,140
At that time, the late emperor and Spiritual Masters of Four Directions had already perished in order to suppress the Zhuyan Rebellion.

250
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,440
Heavenly King's spirit was kept in the bodhi tree and not yet born.

251
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,260
Otherwise, Master Ning wouldn't have had to sacrifice his life

252
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,000
to seal the Blue Feather Phoenix.

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,820
However, isn't the Blue Feather Phoenix the Phoenix King?

254
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,340
Why didn't her companions come to rescue her?

255
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,280
Are you stupid?

256
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,120
The Blue Feather Phoenix fellows were all tamed by Spiritual Masters.

257
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,920
Who would rescue her?

258
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,200
She's called the Phoenix King with supreme power.

259
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,480
But it sounds like she's not so clever.

260
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,100
She was trapped by such an obvious Ten Directions Formation.

261
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,180
Who knows?

262
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,300
Maybe there were people who were good at controlling minds among the Spiritual Masters at that time.

263
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,820
He lured the Blue Feather Phoenix to come here alone with clear awareness.

264
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,540
What about the other nine Spiritual Masters?

265
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,880
They all came from different places.

266
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
When the job was done, they returned to where they came from.

267
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,560
As time passed by, they were all cut off.

268
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,100
But since they left,

269
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,760
no one knows where the Ten Direction Formation array eyes are.

270
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,340
Such a secret was handed down by generations of Thousand Flower Valley Masters.

271
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,160
Only Lin Canglan knows.

272
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,160
At most, Lin Haoqing may know.

273
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,940
But it's a thousand years ago, it has nothing to do with us.

274
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,079
We just need to find the weakness of the defense and take Chang Yi away.

275
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,319
What about the antidote?

276
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,140
Lin Canglan has difficulty walking.

277
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,699
The antidote must be in his inner room.

278
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,580
We can steal the antidote first and run away after that.

279
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,520
But Lin Canglan is now in seclusion.

280
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,240
If we enter his inner room, would we fall into the trap?

281
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,120
So we're going to make a mess.

282
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,440
and distract Lin Canglan and those guards.

283
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,400
But to distract Lin Canglan, a trivial matter is not enough.

284
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,060
As long as you and Sanyue can steal the antidote that day,

285
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,760
I'll take care of this chaos.

286
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,220
You?

287
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,260
You can't even defeat Siyu.

288
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,000
Sanyue, she... she looks down on me.

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,577
I believe him.

290
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,620
- Yunhe.
- I also believe in him.

291
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,680
There's just one thing.

292
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,480
After Lin Canglan comes out, he will only care about the tail of Chang Yi.

293
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,900
So we must do it before he gets out.

294
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,820
There are three days left.

295
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,860
In three days, I'll give you a satisfactory solution then.

296
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,280
Yunhe!

297
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,680
Leaving such an important task to Li Shu,

298
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,220
do you not care about anything just because he looks good?

299
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,800
Luo Luo, do you really think Li Shu is so simple?

300
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,100
Except for his good appearance, there's nothing special.

301
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,280
The bell around his neck looks like an antique.

302
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,960
It should be worthy of plenty of spirit stones.

303
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,240
No wonder you're just a bookkeeper.

304
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,280
Think about it.

305
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,058
On that day, Li Shu was under Lin Haoqing's secret detention.

306
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,940
I sent Xiaoxing to rescue him.

307
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,280
Xiaoxing told me he lost him from the start.

308
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,020
Li Shu eluded the guards by himself and sent him a message.

309
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,620
That's why you think Li Shu is not simple?

310
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,340
Think about it.

311
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,300
He was the one who convinced Xue Sanyue to make an alliance with us.

312
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,840
Then, he reminded me to use the Mirror of Love to test Siyu.

313
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,900
He also found out the relationship between Chang Yi and me was fake.

314
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,040
Read the situation and the heart. Be calm at risks.

315
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,420
And he can find a way to get himself out.

316
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,840
I think there are more secrets to him than we've imagined.

317
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,100
Li Shu is really brilliant.

318
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,200
Then, why do you dare use him?

319
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,960
Because I bet that the way he looks at Xue Sanyue must be true.

320
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,220
Sanyue, the fish soup is ready.

321
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,820
It's been a long day. Drink it.

322
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,186
Is it good?

323
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,080
It's getting late. Go to bed.

324
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,478
Okay.

325
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,970
Come on.

326
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,761
Sleep.

327
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:38,140
You keep staring at me like that.

328
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,200
How can I fall asleep?

329
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,504
I won't leave until you fall asleep.

330
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,960
An ice queen like you, it's so cute when you are shy.

331
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,460
If you keep saying nonsense, I'll kick you out.

332
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,960
Sanyue, Ji Yunhe was testing me.

333
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,640
Luo Jinsang didn't believe me.

334
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,960
Why are you so sure that I'll make it?

335
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,680
I don't know.

336
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,020
But since I'm determined to go with you, I have no worries.

337
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,080
If we succeed, let's go out together.

338
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,340
If we fail, even if we die here,

339
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,100
I have no complaints.

340
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,820
<i>Ji Yunhe, the location of the array eyes is confidential.</i>

341
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,340
<i>But the defense in Thousand Flower Valley was based on the ten array eyes.</i>

342
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,920
<i>With a careful deduction, we can get a clue.</i>

343
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,140
<i>Over the years, I've already found nine of them.</i>

344
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,040
<i>Now thanks to your map, I finally found the tenth.</i>

345
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,700
Master's seclusion has reached a critical stage.

346
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,280
Elders, please guard Master with me.

347
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,320
<i>Yes.</i>

348
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,300
Master Qing Shu. Elders.

349
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,460
Young Master, you're grounded because of Siyu's issue.

350
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,400
What are you doing here?

351
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,780
Please go back, Young Master.

352
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,780
If there's anything, wait till Master gets out.

353
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,400
I'm not looking for my father.

354
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,638
I came here specifically to see Master Qing Shu.

355
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,320
The one who actually committed the crime is about to show himself.

356
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,600
I came to invite you to witness with me.

357
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,440
Why did I sleep so soundly?

358
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,320
<i>Xue, Siyu left clues before she died</i>

359
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,800
<i>which can prove the feelings between you and Li Shu.</i>

360
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,180
<i>Head for the Snake Cave. Let's work together to destroy it.</i>

361
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,638
Sanyue, it's time to drink the fish soup.

362
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,880
<i>Li Shu, Siyu left a clue to prove you and I are in love.</i>

363
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,990
<i>- Ji Yunhe sent a message to meet her in Snake Cave and discuss the solution.
- I'll go first.</i>

364
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,420
<i>No. Sanyue was tricked.</i>

365
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,660
Sanyue, let's go.

366
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,520
It's a trap. Get out of here with me.

367
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,320
A trap. How come?

368
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,540
If Siyu really found proof that we love each other,

369
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,240
she should have taken it out before she died.

370
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,920
This must be Lin Haoqing's trap.

371
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,420
Before they get here, let's go.

372
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,220
Illusion Art.

373
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,760
Now that you know it's a trap, how dare you come here?

374
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,700
It seems that you two are not simply master and servant.

375
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,593
Li Shu!

376
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,212
Lin Haoqing.

377
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,980
You even took advantage of a dead attendant?

378
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,800
<i>With Sanyue's power,</i>

379
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,100
<i>Lin Haoqing is no match for her.</i>

380
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,800
<i>She must have been affected by the hallucinogenic drug I put in her fish soup last night.</i>

381
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,760
<i>Xue Sanyue and Li Shu are in love?</i>

382
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,960
<i>So, the accusation that day was all true.</i>

383
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,660
<i>Young Master, since you're so sure,</i>

384
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,520
<i>why didn't you clarify this to me earlier</i>

385
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,080
<i>but asked for punishment?</i>

386
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,120
<i>If I'm not grounded, how could they let their guard down?</i>

387
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,460
<i>Haoqing had no evidence that day.</i>

388
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,280
<i>But those with a guilty conscience will then throw themselves into the net.</i>

389
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,880
Xue Sanyue and Li Shu violated the rules.

390
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,800
They should be heavily punished.

391
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,640
Master Qing Shu, can you let me take care of them?

392
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,980
There's another one I'd like to invite to see their end together.

393
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,080
I need to guard Master with the elders.

394
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,780
Young Master, you're in charge of this.

395
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,389
Yes.

396
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,040
Go and tell Chang Yi that you'll take him with you.

397
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,240
Why do you have to drag me with you?

398
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,200
You're my attendant. You should go with me wherever I go.

399
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,981
Wait a minute.

400
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:19,600
I think you've failed in taming his heart.

401
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,800
Nonsense.

402
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,160
When have I ever failed?

403
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,800
Then when Chang Yi made the snow for you, why did you run away?

404
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,040
It's written in the books.

405
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,480
If a woman dares not face a man,

406
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,620
it is likely that she has a crush on him.

407
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,720
It's nonsense.

408
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,040
I think you're obsessed with Xue Sanyue and Li Shu. Everyone looks like a lover in your eyes.

409
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,880
The road ahead is uncertain.

410
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,900
There is no such luxury.

411
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,980
I want to take him away because I see myself in him.

412
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,080
Chang Yi is a merman. The sea is his permanent home.

413
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,840
His future lover should be a Big-tailed Fish like him.

414
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,300
Well, tell me. What does it feel like to be a lover?

415
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,280
I'll find a lover someday to order him about every day.

416
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,160
Keep saying nonsense and I'll punish you.

417
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,922
Look over there.

418
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,320
I'll deal with you later.

419
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,180
<i>No woman hates flowers.</i>

420
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,820
<i>Why did she leave?</i>

421
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,840
<i>Did I do something wrong?</i>

422
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,420
<i>Or is she worried about something?</i>

423
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,680
Chang Yi, I have some good news for you.

424
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,540
Li Shu and Xue Sanyue promised to take us with them.

425
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,480
We can all leave now.

426
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,540
You're not mad at me anymore?

427
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,700
Why would I be mad at you?

428
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,080
You saw the snow and left.

429
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,500
Did I do something wrong?

430
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,300
Fool. How could I be mad at you for this?

431
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,060
I was really happy about the snow.

432
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,922
It's just...

433
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm afraid I don't deserve your snow.

434
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,440
You're worried about something else.

435
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,570
Chang Yi, these days, you really suffered a lot.

436
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,680
Soon you'll be free.

437
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,260
When we leave here,

438
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,920
we're still lovers.

439
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,800
We won't separate.

440
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,707
Right?

441
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,087
Guardian Ji.

442
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,440
Senior, you were grounded for several days.

443
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,280
As soon as it ends, you immediately came to Reflect Cave.

444
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,180
I guess you are really afraid of losing to me.

445
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,480
I'm here to invite you to witness the trial.

446
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,720
What trial?

447
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,400
Xue Sanyue is in love with Li Shu. Evidence has been found.

448
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,860
They are preparing to be sentenced.

449
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,100
It was proved to be a misunderstanding.

450
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,360
Nobody can escape the judgment of Heaven.

451
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,720
If you did something wrong, there's always a clue.

452
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,740
Please.

453
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,248
Wait here for me.

454
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Yunhe, I found out.

455
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,960
Lin Haoqing set a trap with Siyu's death.

456
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
They caught them on the spot.

457
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,240
What's going on now?

458
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,120
They're being escorted to the hall for trial.

459
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,880
I heard that when Sanyue was arrested,

460
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,360
Li Shu was captured without a fight.

461
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,800
Last time, didn't he fight hard?

462
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,720
Why did he get caught this time without a fight?

463
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
This is not the time to figure this out.

464
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,700
Now the question is if they got caught, what do we do?

465
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,360
Play it by ear.

466
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,240
Young Master, this time, you mobilized elite guards

467
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,100
and disturbed the Guardians.

468
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,440
Why did you do that?

469
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,800
I just want to ring an alarm bell for all.

470
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,080
No matter who you are and what position you have,

471
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,160
as long as you break the ban in the Thousand Flower Valley,

472
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,940
you're an alien to the Thousand Flower Valley.

473
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,400
You're the shame of the Thousand Flower Valley.

474
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,840
It seems that Young Master has convicted me.

475
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,500
How are you going to punish me?

476
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,840
Break your bones. Eliminate all your power.

477
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,880
Then cut the crap. Punish me.

478
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,060
Senior, this is a matter of great importance.

479
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,860
We'd better wait till Master comes out.

480
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,720
Besides, now, none of the elders are here.

481
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,060
You convict them by yourself. It's inappropriate.

482
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,438
Junior,

483
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,320
Master Qing Shu has left it to me.

484
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,258
Commander Xue, you're the elite of Thousand Flower Valley. You're a rare talent.

485
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:41,460
If you could destroy the spirit core of Li Shu,

486
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,240
maybe I'll go easy on you. What about that?

487
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,560
Junior, you're good at taming. You must be very persuasive.

488
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,880
Why don't you persuade her and show her the way out?

489
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,060
<i>If I persuade Xue Sanyue to kill Li Shu,</i>

490
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,140
<i>the trust between her and me would no longer exist.</i>

491
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,360
<i>If I don't, Lin Haoqing can naturally kill my ally.</i>

492
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,080
<i>Both ways are a dead-end.</i>

493
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,360
Xue Sanyue, we worked together.

494
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,536
That's why I'm giving you this chance.

495
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,880
I don't need the chance.

496
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,552
Sanyue.

497
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,381
Senior.

498
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,460
Do you want to rebel?

499
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,118
I dare not.

500
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,060
Even if Commander Xue is guilty, you can't punish her by yourself.

501
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,158
- Maybe...
- Maybe you can stop pretending.

502
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,560
She chose the wrong ally.

503
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,620
You can't save her today.

504
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,560
I have made up my mind. No one can stop it.

505
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,120
Ji Yunhe, if you mess with me,

506
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,740
I'll make you bleed.

507
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,760
How could he have such power?

508
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,219
Is he still the cat we know?

509
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:37,620
Sanyue, don't you want to get out of Thousand Flower Valley?

510
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,399
Leave today.

511
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,120
I'll help you destroy it.

512
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,105
Chase them.

513
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,800
Li Shu.

514
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
What are you doing?

515
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,020
Blue Feather Phoenix, I'll sacrifice my body...

516
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,280
to the Ten Directions

517
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
and help you break the formation!

518
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,020
He's making a blood offering for the Ten Directions Formation to release Blue Feather Phoenix.

519
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,758
Li Shu. Li Shu, stop!

520
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,600
<i>[Qing Ji: A Blue Feather Phoenix]</i>

521
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,780
Master Qing.

522
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,360
Little Li Shu, you saved me with your life?

523
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,240
Li Shu was late...

524
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,580
and made Your Highness suffer.

525
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,160
Take down Blue Feather Phoenix.

526
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,228
<i>Yes.</i>

527
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Spiritual Masters now

528
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,280
even try to capture me with such a basic trap.

529
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,420
Ask Ning Ruochu to meet me.

530
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,280
You dare to run wild in Thousand Flower Valley.

531
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,569
And you show disrespect to Master Ning.

532
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,040
I said to ask Ning Ruochu to meet me.

533
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,000
Or... I will tear down your Thousand Flower Valley.

534
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,017
Father.

535
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,280
Yunhe, Lin Canglan comes out.

536
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,460
The inner hall is empty. We can go steal the antidote.

537
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,240
Who are you?

538
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,980
Master of the Thousand Flower Valley, Lin Canglan.

539
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,560
Rest assured. Li Shu is here. She'll be fine.

540
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,280
And if we don't leave now, it will be too late.

541
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,500
Survive. Escape.

542
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,915
Go.

543
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,450
The successor of the Lin's.

544
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,980
Ning Ruochu is the elder.

545
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,360
And he asked his apprentices to cover for him,

546
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,320
while he's hiding in the shadows.

547
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,260
The Blue Feather Phoenix cannot remain in the world.

548
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,440
Kill her.

549
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,640
All right.

550
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,980
It gives me a chance to stretch my muscles.

551
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,280
Luo Luo, what about that?

552
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,640
It's such a big place.

553
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,740
But there's no antidote.

554
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,860
Yunhe.

555
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,760
Xiaoxing, what are you doing here?

556
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,020
I thought you were supposed to fight against Blue Feather Phoenix.

557
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,500
I'm heading there.

558
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,280
I saw you two on my way. You looked sneaky, so I followed.

559
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,120
What are you doing here?

560
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,080
Xiaoxing, this is a matter of life and death.

561
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,720
It's better that you don't know.

562
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,660
You... You just pretend that you haven't seen us.

563
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,800
I'm not leaving. I'll be on the lookout for you.

564
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,320
Are you stupid?

565
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,200
If Master finds out you're helping us,

566
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,980
he won't let you go.

567
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,520
Over the years, the one who taught me how to tame creatures in Thousand Flower Valley

568
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,060
and took care of me was not Master but you, Ji Yunhe.

569
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,620
Although I don't understand why,

570
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,560
there must be a reason for you to do this.

571
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,460
This time, I still believe you.

572
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,560
Look at how loyal he is.

573
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,760
Ning Ruochu! When will you stop hiding from me?

574
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,918
Tell me. Where is he hiding?

575
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,200
You tricked me into the formation.

576
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,600
Now, you're too scared to even see me?

577
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,720
Shut up.

578
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,440
The departed should be respected.

579
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,680
We won't let you abuse him freely.

580
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,060
<i>The departed.</i>

581
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,820
What did you say?

582
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,720
The departed?

583
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,800
In order to seal you in the Ten Directions Formation,

584
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,280
Master Ning sacrificed himself.

585
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,720
He passed away a thousand years ago.

586
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,000
He's dead?

587
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,260
Everyone, today, I will imitate my predecessor.

588
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,160
Reseal the Blue Feather Phoenix into the Ten Directions Formation.
