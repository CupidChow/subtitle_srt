How could this happen?

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,671
They just got married.

22
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:44,180
Why do they have to end like this?

23
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,160
Kong Ming, you're capable.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,940
Turn me into Chang Yi. I want to be frozen for him.

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,120
I don't want Yunhe to be sad.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Sanyue, what are you going to do?

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,420
I want to go and stay with Yunhe. She can't take it.

28
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,040
It's after midnight, Sanyue.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,140
I'm afraid it's too late.

30
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,380
Let me go. Let me go.

31
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,740
Yunhe already knew it.

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,700
They made this decision together.

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Tonight is their last night.

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,920
Do you want to disturb them?

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,300
Leave the last time to them.

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,020
Master Lin, your beloved one got married.

37
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,620
Are you just going to watch her?

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,560
Shall I help you get Ji Yunhe back?

39
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,360
You still want to protect her?

40
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,340
Yunhe.

41
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,560
You haven't slept well for a long time.

42
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,040
It's good to take this chance to get some sleep.

43
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,040
There are so many things to do in North Abyss.

44
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,020
I'll be right back.

45
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,700
Tell me about your dream when I come back tonight, okay?

46
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,060
Sanyue. Li Shu. You're back.

47
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,600
Yunhe.

48
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,980
Kong Ming already told us about Chang Yi.

49
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,920
- He...
- He's already frozen.

50
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,840
How's North Abyss?

51
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Shunde is gathering troops.

52
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm afraid she's going to attack North Abyss.

53
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,580
But it's okay.

54
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,760
Chang Yi already took care of many affairs of North Abyss.

55
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,820
I told Qing Yao not to let anyone know about Chang Yi being frozen.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,700
Now that Shunde will come at any time, I'm going to check the defense.

57
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll go with you.

58
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,940
Luo Luo, I'm fine.

59
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,860
Chang Yi wore the wedding robe I made for him.

60
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,040
He watched the sky lamps with me.

61
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,800
And he sang the Song of Mermen for me all night.

62
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,820
That's more than I deserve.

63
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,140
Besides, I have you to keep me company.

64
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,120
Why can't I take it?

65
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,020
I'm leaving.

66
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,160
Li Shu, you're right.

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,700
They have just reunited.

68
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,300
And now they are parted by death.

69
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,920
That's too cruel for them.

70
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,880
Yeah.

71
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,160
How could they make such a decision?

72
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,380
I wish you had been so obedient.

73
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,060
It would have saved me time and energy.

74
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,360
That merman fed the sword with his blood.

75
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,780
Now he must be dead.

76
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,100
Since you're so obedient, I'll give you another gift.

77
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,160
Ji Yunhe is in North Abyss now, isn't she?

78
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,260
I'll send you to see her. Isn't that great?

79
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,460
You've loved her your whole life.

80
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,220
You've been with her your entire life.

81
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,560
Did she ever look at you?

82
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,920
In her eyes, what you did was just a joke.

83
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Ruin her since you can't get her.

84
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,440
<i>The Glazing Heart Lamp was made by ancient immortals with their bones.</i>

85
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,560
<i>Now its fragments are missing.</i>

86
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,600
<i>It seems I can only restore it with my bones.</i>

87
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,360
Masters, why are you here?

88
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,520
Time flies like a moment.

89
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,600
Heavenly King, you're grown.

90
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,660
However, you still have to practice the skill of escaping.

91
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,220
It's good for Heaven and Earth because you're responsible.

92
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,300
Unfortunately, we can't follow you anymore.

93
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,040
Masters, what are you going to do?

94
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,620
We speculate the newborn demon to be Fairy Shunde.

95
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,800
It's my sister?

96
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,260
It's the misfortune in your life.

97
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,440
You should get through it on your own.

98
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,500
You have a vital responsibility.

99
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,220
We'll take care of the lamp.

100
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,340
Masters.

101
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,000
Don't, Masters.

102
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,160
You practiced hard for thousands of years. It's how you got where you are.

103
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,960
If you take out your bones, your lifelong cultivation will go up in smoke.

104
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,780
Getting into the lamp is between life and death.

105
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,380
It's my duty.

106
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,360
How can I let you sacrifice your lives for me?

107
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,960
Heavenly King, don't feel bad for us.

108
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,840
The reason why we followed you all these years

109
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,520
was not because you're the Heavenly King, but because you moved us.

110
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,080
We hope you keep helping the world.

111
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,580
Abide by your original mission

112
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,900
and practice your ambition.

113
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,440
Worse comes to worst, we turn to ash.

114
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,140
It'd be better than doing nothing and failing our conscience.

115
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,060
Or our cultivation would be in vain.Just take it as a misfortune.

116
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,940
I can take it.

117
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,660
Heavenly King, you'll be alone the rest of the way.

118
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,000
Fei Lian and I are going to leave.

119
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,100
I didn't expect you to be with me at the end.

120
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,460
It's good.

121
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,280
I won't be bored on the way having you nagging me.

122
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,000
Old Lei, after this, let's be partners again if we're lucky.

123
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,880
See you around.

124
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,040
Masters. No. Don't.

125
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,680
Come on.

126
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,140
Masters!

127
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,840
The rest will be done in two days.

128
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,560
We must take the defense seriously.

129
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
I'll check it again later.

130
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,780
Okay.

131
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,940
Yunhe, you just got married.

132
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,440
Why don't you go and stay with Chang Yi?

133
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
You always work with us.

134
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,500
Xiaoxing, go ahead. I'll stay here and think about something.

135
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,220
Don't worry about me. I'm okay.

136
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,700
Don't try to be strong.

137
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,360
You look uglier when you laugh.

138
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,200
Smiling is better than crying, isn't it?

139
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,420
You're afraid of crying in front of the North Abyss.

140
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,920
You're scared to shake the army.

141
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,900
But before friends, you don't have to hide anything.

142
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,500
I used to think I was strong enough.

143
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,440
I thought I was ready for his death.

144
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,740
But now I finally understand. We liked each other.

145
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,280
I even had him.

146
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,920
But it was the worst kind of pain once I lost him.

147
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,800
My heart is almost broken.

148
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,628
Why don't you take Chang Yi to find a way?

149
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:08,057
There must be a way to break the freeze.

150
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,660
What about the North Abyss if I leave with Chang Yi?

151
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,740
Shunde is coming soon.

152
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,700
Someone has to stay, right?

153
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,500
I'll do it for you.

154
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,880
Sanyue. Li Shu. Thank you.

155
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,720
But it's my duty.

156
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,020
I must finish it on my own.

157
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,800
Now I'm not like I was in Thousand Flower Valley where I could walk away from anything.

158
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,240
Now the whole North Abyss is entrusted to me.

159
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
And I have to fulfill the wish of the world.

160
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,080
My life is no longer mine.

161
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,180
Chang Yi was responsible for this place.

162
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,200
Now it's my duty.

163
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,920
Since it already started, I have to finish it. Right?

164
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,640
Yunhe.

165
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,720
Heavenly King, why are you here?

166
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,020
Commander Xue. Prince Li Shu.

167
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,180
So, the Heart Lamp was restored?

168
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,700
Yes.

169
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,780
Where are Master Fei Lian and Master Lei Ze?

170
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,160
Why didn't they come with you?

171
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,160
They sacrificed their lives to the lamp.

172
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,360
But I'll finish my duty of suppressing the demon.

173
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,960
By the way, I met Kong Ming on my way here.

174
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,580
I heard Master Chang Yi was frozen.

175
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,260
Could you let me see if I'm able to turn it around?

176
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,120
How is it?

177
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,440
Shan Jun. No, Heavenly King.

178
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,780
Can you break the freeze?

179
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,940
There's really no one who can save Chang Yi?

180
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,540
Young Lord Qing Yao, anything from Shunde?

181
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,340
Shunde's army is close to the border.

182
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,560
I'm afraid they'll arrive tomorrow.

183
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,685
Heavenly King, can your Heart Lamp fight against the enemy?

184
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,140
This Glazing Heart Lamp has no flame.

185
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,160
Only sky fire produced by thunder can light it up.

186
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,860
When my father exterminated Zhu Yan, he opened the Demon-killing Formation with sky fire.

187
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,300
Though the lamp has been repaired now, the sky fire faded.

188
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,785
I'm afraid it's not half powerful as it was.

189
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,599
Where do we get the sky fire?

190
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,400
I'll try to get it.

191
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,385
I only know the fire was gained by a loyal subordinate who followed my father.

192
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:21,260
But my father and all his subordinates died in that war.

193
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,740
It's hard to investigate how to obtain the fire.

194
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,380
I have no idea.

195
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,520
Whether the sky fire reignites or not, we can only fight.

196
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,220
Kong Ming. Young Lord Qing Yao. Let's go to the border to see if there are any loopholes in the defense.

197
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,620
I'll go with you.

198
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,640
I'll lead the men into the war.

199
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,060
Sanyue. You go first.

200
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,390
I want to see Chang Yi.

201
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,760
Okay.

202
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,380
<i>You must continue my mission and regain the sky fire.</i>

203
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,960
I heard you ended up like this in order to eliminate Zhu Yan.

204
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,440
You tried to be a hero, so you're worth it.

205
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,460
I used to laugh at you because you couldn't learn to let go.

206
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,540
Now I'm the one who can't let go.

207
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,100
Luckily, it's not too late to know.

208
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,820
There must be someone to do something,

209
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,060
even if he's not willing to let go.

210
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,620
It's my turn to be a hero.

211
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,920
I'm leaving.

212
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,220
Grandfather.

213
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,960
Tell me where the damn Nine Thunder Sea is.

214
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,660
<i>Are you sure you want to take the mission?</i>

215
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,460
Grandfather, I know the path is dangerous and hard.

216
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,560
But it's my choice.

217
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,880
Didn't you say only the best one of the Lu Wu descendants can get the fire?

218
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:24,200
At such a critical moment, how can I abandon the world for my own personal gain?

219
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,960
Besides, don't make it so sad.

220
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,014
How do you know I can't return alive?

221
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
What's up?

222
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,560
I feel assured after you came back.

223
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,340
Thank you, Sanyue.

224
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,740
You don't have to thank me.

225
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,640
If something happens to me, help me take care of Li Shu.

226
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Why is the thunder so strange?

227
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,120
Sanyue, what's wrong?

228
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,160
I don't know why I'm always feeling uneasy.

229
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,100
Seems like something bad is going to happen.

230
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,520
Yunhe, something is wrong with the lamp.

231
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,920
Somehow it was burning up just now.

232
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,260
Like it's connecting to something.

233
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,880
Could it be my sister's movement?

234
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,560
Except for that thunder, there's no movement.

235
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,080
Luo Luo, did you see Li Shu?

236
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,680
He left Lingshuang Pavilion when he came out of Chang Yi's room.

237
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,060
I thought he went to meet you.

238
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,780
Let's split up and find Li Shu.

239
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,680
Li Shu.

240
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,200
Li Shu. Li Shu.

241
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,780
- Prince Li Shu.
- Li Shu.

242
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,680
Li Shu.

243
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,360
What's that?

244
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,880
The Heart Lamp is finally lighting up.

245
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,760
Heavenly King, who has gained the amazing sky fire you mentioned?

246
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,220
Where's Sanyue going?

247
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,460
Li Shu!

248
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,280
How's Sanyue?

249
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,180
She's been on her knees without talking or moving.

250
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,042
She almost fell apart when she thought Li Shu was dead on Ten Directions Formation Rebellion.

251
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,540
Fate is too cruel to her.

252
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,540
<i>Sanyue, sorry.</i>

253
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,700
<i>I lied to you again.</i>

254
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,420
Li Shu.

255
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,520
<i>You said you'd marry another good man if I left you again.</i>

256
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,520
<i>I was sad.</i>

257
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,680
<i>And then I thought...</i>

258
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,620
<i>it'd be good if you could continue to live your life happily.</i>

259
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,640
<i>I wanted to carve two characters of "love wife" on this hairpin.</i>

260
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,440
<i>But later I only had your name engraved on it.</i>

261
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,560
<i>In case something happens to me, it won't delay you.</i>

262
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,160
Turns out you already thought of everything.

263
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,700
<i>Sanyue, you're quiet and depressed by nature.</i>

264
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,600
<i>Your life is tiring.</i>

265
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,360
<i>I just want you to keep your life casual in the future.</i>

266
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,080
<i>I've asked Da Huan and Xiao Huan to find a house for you in the letter.</i>

267
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:37,600
<i>When you finish what you want to do, you can live your life happily as you like.</i>

268
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,200
<i>As for everything else,</i>

269
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,940
<i>I'm not qualified to say anything else.</i>

270
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,860
Li Shu,

271
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,860
do you know you're a bastard?

272
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,000
Aren't you afraid I'll marry any man?

273
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,920
<i>The rest of your life is still long.</i>

274
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,340
<i>If no one takes care of you, find someone who's nice to you.</i>

275
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,040
<i>Don't let him lie to you.</i>

276
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,720
<i>And don't let him make you sad.</i>

277
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,500
No. No. No.

278
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,620
No.

279
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,320
<i>Sanyue, don't cry.</i>

280
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,600
<i>I don't regret it.</i>

281
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,320
<i>The happiest thing in my life was to be your little lynx.</i>

282

<i>Heavenly King, today, a myriad of stars converge on your own sign.</i>

320
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,080
<i>The yang is at its highest.</i>

321
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,780
<i>It's the best opportunity to completely eliminate the demon.</i>

322
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,380
<i>You can't miss it.</i>

323
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Chang Yi, we got a war report from the border that Shunde was coming soon.

324
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,340
I have to go.

325
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,780
Most of North Abyss's troops will go to the border with me.

326
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,940
Young Lord Qing Yao will be in charge of Lingshuang Pavilion.

327
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,000
I should leave what comes next to you.

328
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,980
I'll do my best in this war.

329
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,480
Heavenly King, are you really determined?

330
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,010
I gave her too many chances.

331
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
But she didn't reflect on herself.

332
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,740
Now, it has to end.

333
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,060
Yunhe, the battlefield is dangerous, you must be careful.

334
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,960
Same goes for you.

335
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,580
The war is coming. Why are you here, Luo Luo?

336
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,240
I'll go to fight the enemy with you.

337
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,800
Stop it, Luo Luo.

338
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,640
Nowadays, Shunde's power is not to be underestimated.

339
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,860
If you go to the battlefield with me, I have to take care of you.

340
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,360
I'm not your burden. You don't have to take care of me.

341
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,180
I know. You're not a burden.

342
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,260
All right. Wait for me here.

343
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,800
When this is over, I'll take you to find the best immortal island. Okay?

344
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,360
Will you always leave me behind in front of your great cause?

345
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,340
You take everything on. Am I so useless in your eyes?

346
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,280
Absolutely not. In my mind...

347
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,780
Luo Luo, it's not the time to be willful.

348
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,900
Listen, wait for me.

349
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,460
No.

350
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,880
Okay.

351
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,320
Be good.

352
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,960
Let Shunde come if she wants to come.

353
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,700
North Abyss is not afraid of her.

354
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,400
It won't back down.

355
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,000
And it won't be ruined by her.

356
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,620
Stop.

357
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,340
What? We can't be soft at this moment.

358
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,900
They're Siyu and Elder Donglian.

359
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,860
Yunhe, the Spiritual Masters of Thousand Flower Valley are among them.

360
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,380
They're my fellows.

361
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,060
They don't want to work for Shunde. They were supposed to escape.

362
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,860
Why are they here?

363
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,040
Stay alert, everyone.

364
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,420
Shunde has controlled their minds.

365
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,160
They are no longer themselves.

366
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,300
Hold the barrier, everyone. Don't fight against them directly.

367
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,260
Stick together. Fight together.

368
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,940
I wonder how long you're going to hold it.

369
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,620
Ji Yunhe.

370
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,340
Didn't you say you could give up everything for North Abyss?

371
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,580
Then show me how you can protect it.

372
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,240
I'm really enjoying this casting game.

373
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,740
Go. Destroy this place for me.

374
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,820
I must leave this area to you two.

375
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,180
It's time to repay Shunde.

376
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,800
Since you came all the way to North Abyss, why do you hide here?

377
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,920
You delivered your men to death.

378
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,420
Now that you came, why didn't you come over to my wedding?

379
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,760
Ji Yunhe, I should have killed you.

380
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
What a shame.

381
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,960
You never did what you were hoping for.

382
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,620
I'm afraid you can't do it in the future, either.

383
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,720
Shunde, do you think there should be an end between us?

384
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,840
Ji Yunhe, you lured me here on purpose.

385
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,460
You're known as a cautious person.

386
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,940
I can't believe you've used up all your tricks now.

387
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,580
Looks like we have to fight eventually.

388
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Since you won't go into the formation, I'll force you inside.

389
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,980
Oh, that's ridiculous.

390
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,400
Now the merman is dead. You're alone.

391
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,200
How dare you be arrogant?

392
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,300
The chaos began with the Merman-taming Agreement we signed.

393
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,680
We should end it, shouldn't we?

394
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,400
You're nothing!

395
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,140
How dare you compare yourself to me?

396
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:14,480
Ji Yunhe, today, I'll kill you and everybody of North Abyss.

397
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,460
Sister, I must stop you in person.

398
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,960
<i>Guardian Ji, the Demon-killing Formation is going to open.</i>

399
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,360
<i>You must hold it.</i>

400
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,620
Ji Yunhe, my expectations on you were so much higher.

401
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,820
I never thought you were so weak.

402
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,960
Beg me!

403
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,680
I'll let you die quickly if you surrender.

404
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,760
Otherwise, I'll cut you into pieces according to the agreement back then.

405
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,500
Shunde, you're so miserable.

406
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,500
I have everything now.

407
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,260
Why do you have to be pitiful?

408
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,240
Now, you should beg me.

409
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,580
You finally woke up.

410
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,360
Sorry. I'm late.

411
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,380
I knew you wouldn't want me to be bullied.

412
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,240
How could it be possible?

413
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,040
Maybe I deserve to survive.

414
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,280
If I hadn't been at rest for so long, you wouldn't have let down your guard.

415
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,580
<i>This Bodhi fruit can save Chang Yi?</i>

416
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,080
<i>The Bodhi tree bears fruit every 100 years.</i>

417
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,800
<i>The fruit can recreate veins and unlock the freeze.</i>

418
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,860
<i>It was born when my sister took care of me for 100 years.</i>

419
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,720
<i>I always take it with me in memory of her.</i>

420
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,460
<i>I didn't expect it to be such a chance.</i>

421
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,360
<i>Heavenly King, Shunde thinks Chang Yi is frozen.</i>

422
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,200
<i>I suggest we keep it a secret. So that Shunde will think she has the advantage.</i>

423
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,160
<i>When she's at her happiest moment, Chang Yi will kill her while her guard is down.</i>

424
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,980
<i>But I don't know whether Master Chang Yi can wake up in time.</i>

425
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,200
<i>What if you're at risk when you fight against my sister, but he can't be there in time?</i>

426
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,500
<i>Isn't this too risky?</i>

427
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,220
<i>Chang Yi won't let anything bad happen to me.</i>

428
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,320
<i>I trust him.</i>

429
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,500
<i>He'll be there.</i>

430
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,920
<i>Big-tailed Fish.</i>

431
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,280
<i>Don't keep me waiting for too long.</i>

432
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,820
Now my power is back.

433
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,060
Shunde, give up.
