Commander Xue, could you talk to him again?

Heavenly King has been waiting for several days.

It's okay. I can wait.

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,100
Your Majesty, not that I'm being pessimistic,

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,960
but with Chang Yi's temper now,

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,100
maybe you'll wait till the end of time.

I'm also responsible for Fairy Shunde's rebellion.

This is what I owe North Abyss.

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,800
And I believe that the one whom Ji Yunhe risked her life to help

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,160
won't wallow in grief forever.

60

<i>or you'll be willing to see the letter.</i>

61

<i>It all depends on fate.</i>

62
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,620
Master, you finally came out.

63
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,220
Invite Heavenly King here.

64
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,120
Okay.

65
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,420
Master, Heavenly King has arrived.

66
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,020
Please.

67
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,680
I've always believed that a strong person like Ji Yunhe,

68
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
no matter in what situation, she'd make it out alive.

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,040
I've been looking forward to meeting her again one day.

70
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,040
But I didn't expect that she would sacrifice herself to protect North Abyss and Thousand Flower Valley.

71
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,700
I... respect her a lot.

72
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,320
Your Majesty, if you came here just to say all this,

73
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,120
I'll go back first.

74
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm here today for two things.

75
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,300
First, I'll apologize to North Abyss.

76
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,040
For the disaster, I'm guilty of carelessness and connivance.

77
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,000
I owe the North Abyss once.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,540
And I will do my best to pay you back.

79
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,640
North Abyss has never needed any pity.

80
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,440
The injustice we suffered, I'll get revenge for it, step by step.

81
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,320
Your Majesty, please say the second thing.

82
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,360
This time, I want to cooperate with you to fight against Immortal Master Mansion

83
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,100
and restore peace in the Immortal Realm.

84
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,780
Why would you think I would like to cooperate with you?

85
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,500
Because... I believe that neither of us...

86
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:14,540
wants any creature in the world to suffer anymore.

87
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,040
Even if there's hatred in your heart, Master,

88
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,220
your love for the world won't disappear.

89
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,480
About Ji Yunhe, I'm very sorry for your loss.

90
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,400
That's all I need to say about the alliance.

Ji Yunhe, you were right about him.

157
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,260
With him, the world will become what you want it to be.

158
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,780
♫ <i>...to write an end that will last forever</i> ♫

159
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,420
♫ <i>We won't be afraid or separate</i> ♫

160
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,800
♫ <i>We shall be together forever, we'll be together</i> ♫

161
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,780
♫ <i>You gave me freedom by loving you</i> ♫

162
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,540
♫ <i>I get the meaning of life when I'm falling</i> ♫

163
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,720
♫ <i>I don't care whether I live or die</i> ♫

164
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,200
♫ <i>I became fireworks and burn everything</i> ♫

165
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,020
Master, I've taken all your things out of Cloud Quarters.

166
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Master, after all, you have memories here.

167
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,440
There's no need to block it.

168
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,320
Before, Yunhe didn't like being locked up here.

169
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,700
So, there's no need to open this place.

170
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
<i>[Ning Qing]</i>

171
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,060
<i>Yunhe's handwriting.</i>

172
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,780
<i>Invite Heavenly King to the main hall.</i>

173
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes.

174
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,260
Master, you said that you've found clues of the Immortal Master.

175
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,580
This is the book that Yunhe often read.

176
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,980
One page was dog-eared. The name of Ning Qing was written on it.

177
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,760
Maybe... it can help you, Your Majesty.

178
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,650
<i>[Ning Qing]</i>

179
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,720
Who wrote this book?

180
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,620
How is it related to Immortal Master?

181
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,420
I can answer your questions, Your Majesty.

182
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,560
It's you.

183
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,360
Your Majesty, you're the one I met.

184
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,020
It turns out what happened before was fated.

185
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,920
You just said you know the origin of this book.

186
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,680
Right.

187
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,720
On that day, before Ji Yunhe went to the battlefield,

188
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,060
she knew she'd never come back.

189
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,520
She told me everything.

190
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,490
And she asked me, if one day, I could meet the Heavenly King,

191
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,840
I need to tell you everything.

192
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,740
The author of the book is named Ning Xiyu.

193
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,160
So, Immortal Master did everything for Ning Xiyu.

194
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,940
But the page Ji Yunhe marked, how is it related to Immortal Master?

195
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,780
Master Fei Lian, did you know that

196
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,460
Immortal Master practiced in Thousand Flower Valley under Lin's command?

197
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,760
I've heard about it.

198
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,860
Immortal Master was just a normal Spiritual Master in Thousand Flower Valley,

199
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,800
His strength was normal, no match for Lin.

200
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,340
But why, in such a short time, did his cultivation improve so rapidly?

201
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:09,740
He rose up so high that later he invented the Frost mark

202
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,860
to threaten Lin instead and got full control of them.

203
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,660
Everyone, have you ever thought about the reason behind it?

204
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,920
He wanted to get revenge.

205
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,340
He needed power.

206
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,200
He found a horrible but strong power.

207
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Right.

208
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
In the dream, Ning Xiyu once told Ji Yunhe.

209
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,580
<i>After Ruochu was killed, Ning Qing suddenly left Thousand Flower Valley for a while.</i>

210
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,800
<i>By that time, I was in the wind.</i>

211
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,940
<i>I followed him all the way to a barren mountain.</i>

212
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,600
<i>I recognized the mountain.</i>

213
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,960
<i>I remembered that I went there once by mistake.</i>

214
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,380
<i>It was a very strange place.</i>

215
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,220
<i>Strange?</i>

216
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,020
<i>I've always liked to travel.</i>

217
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,840
<i>Not long after I adopted Ning Qing, I took him to travel everywhere.</i>

218
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,100
<i>There was one time that somehow we suddenly entered a barren mountain.</i>

219
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,160
<i>We had illusions there.</i>

220
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,920
<i>You can see what you want most and what you fear most.</i>

221
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,260
<i>I thought there was something else in that mountain.</i>

222
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,800
<i>I was about to explore before somehow we got out of the mountain.</i>

223
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,560
<i>And when we got back, we couldn't find the mountain anymore.</i>

224
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,360
<i>I thought it was strange.</i>

225
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,200
<i>So I asked a lot of villagers around.</i>

226
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,040
<i>No one knew the existence of that mountain.</i>

227
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,620
<i>I thought it was a miracle.</i>

228
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,940
<i>So I wrote it down in the encyclopedia.</i>

229
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,820
<i>That mountain is the nameless mountain in the encyclopedia.</i>

230
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
<i>Exactly.</i>

231
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,520
<i>But since this mountain can vanish and no one can find the way,</i>

232
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,540
<i>how did Ning Qing find it later?</i>

233
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,180
<i>And after finding it, what did he do in there?</i>

234
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,980
<i>I don't know either.</i>

235
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,420
<i>At that time, I tried to follow Ning Qing and enter there.</i>

236
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,920
<i>But somehow, I was blocked out of the mountain.</i>

237
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,140
<i>I don't know what happened to him in there.</i>

238
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,020
<i>All I know is when he came out, he brought back a mysterious power.</i>

239
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,840
<i>Then he improved rapidly.</i>

240
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,760
<i>He went all the way up and became the top of all Spiritual Masters.</i>

241
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,580
<i>He also invented the Frost mark to punish Lin and control Thousand Flower Valley.</i>

242
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,200
<i>A mysterious power.</i>

243
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,440
<i>Was it what he hid in his secret chamber?</i>

244
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,420
<i>That day, it was you who led me into the secret chamber.</i>

245
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,520
<i>There's something odd about that portrait.</i>

246
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,680
<i>But I don't know what's in it.</i>

247
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,960
Maybe because Ning Xiyu only remained a little spirit.

248
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,660
She couldn't get into the mountain.

249
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,740
But she could feel that the power of the Immortal Master

250
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,500
was from the strange mountain.

251
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,280
And that's the power that helped Immortal Master to make chaos around the world.

252
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,100
That's why on that day,

253
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,380
Ji Yunhe marked this page in the encyclopedia.

254
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,640
Since this mountain could give the power to Immortal Master.

255
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,360
I think the key to defeating him is hidden in these mountains, too.

256
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,920
I know this mountain.

257
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,600
Spirit Token also referred to this mountain.

258
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,160
I used to go through ancient books.

259
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
There's no record of this mountain.

260
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,980
I didn't expect that the mountain was recorded in the encyclopedia.

261
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,100
If Spirit Token also guided you to the mountain,

262
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,700
there must be something in this mountain.

263
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,640
Master, can I borrow this book or make a copy of it?

264
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,260
Since Yunhe has allied with you,

265
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,380
I also wish that you can solve this mystery, Your Majesty.

266
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,380
Thank you, Master.

267
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,260
I will return it intact to you.

268
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,760
Master, your strength is advanced.

269
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,880
Do you want to come with us and find the mountain together?

270
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,000
This is the place where Yunhe used her life to protect.

271
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,080
I won't leave.

272
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,200
And if you make a move, Your Majesty, Immortal Master will notice.

273
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,820
North Abyss is at the rear of the battle against Immortal Master.

274
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,920
Since it's established, there has to be someone in the rear.

275
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,040
Then please defend North Abyss, Master.

276
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,920
I'll look for the mountain with these two masters.

277
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,320
If we have any news, we'll instantly inform you.

278
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,980
Okay.

279
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,540
<i>Master, a fallen flower has lost its shape.</i>

280
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,780
<i>But its breath still circulates in the world.</i>

281
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,760
<i>When the fate is in your heart, she lives forever.</i>

282
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,920
<i>Maybe thousands of years later, someone will return.</i>

283
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,720
<i>Return.</i>

284
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,540
<i>Would she?</i>

285
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,800
The war is over.

286
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,360
Master wants no more blood.

287
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,980
He let you go.

288
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,220
The future destination is your choice.

289
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,520
What about the Spiritual Masters of Thousand Flower Valley?

290
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,800
Master ordered that those who are willing to live in North Abyss are all accepted.

291
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,460
And the others want to leave and live a normal life.

292
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,240
With the protection of Ji Yunhe's spirit,

293
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,320
Mr. Kong Ming also promised to give them regular relief from the Frost mark.

294
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,460
They should be safe from death.

295
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,980
Thank you for your generosity, Young Lord.

296
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,480
You've finally fulfilled your dream to send everyone into the North Abyss.

297
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,360
However, we're all separated from now on.

298
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,320
Thousand Flower Valley will have no former glory.

299
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,600
They gave half their lives to Thousand Flower Valley. That's enough.

300
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
Now we're going our separate ways.

301
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,160
It's also a good choice.

302
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,460
What about you, Master?

303
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,040
Your move must have been noticed by Immortal Master.

304
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,900
Why do you want to go back?

305
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,620
Why don't you just stay here?

306
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,640
Thousand Flower Valley is my home, after all.

307
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,400
Shunde is currently grounded. But the power of Immortal Master is still there.

308
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,020
Yet the old and the weak are in the valley. If I completely betray them,

309
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,900
Immortal Master would do harm to them.

310
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,080
Besides, Kong Ming can only relieve the Frost mark.

311
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,320
He cannot eliminate it.

312
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,200
The duty is unfinished.

313
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
How could I stop?

314
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,140
We'll follow you, Master.

315
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,520
Elder Donglian, what are you doing here?

316
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,620
Master, I'd sworn to follow you all my life.

317
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,800
At this time, how can I break my word and escape halfway?

318
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
I was wrong about you.

319
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,460
Trust me.

320
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,940
In the future, I'll make compensation.

321
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,000
And me.

322
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,020
Master, I was too stupid before to understand you.

323
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,360
I didn't know what you put up with and what you planned was for our good.

324
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,000
But fortunately, I'm not that stupid.

325
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
When I figured it out, it was not too late.

326
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,520
Master, I regret. I'm not joining North Abyss.

327
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,560
I'll follow you.

328
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,140
I sent you to the North Abyss because I didn't want you to risk your lives with me.

329
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,260
It's a Spiritual Master's duty to punish evil and uphold justice.

330
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,800
Now, the evil of Immortal Master has endangered the world.

331
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,000
If we hold back now, what about the dignity of a Spiritual Master?

332
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,220
The people of Thousand Flower Valley will never be the cowards controlled by Immortal Master.

333
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,220
Right. Please accept us.

334
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,360
Thank you all for myself and Thousand Flower Valley.

335
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,400
It's a long way to go against the Immortal Master.

336
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,678
I want to use the heavenly and earthly herbs to cure the Frost mark.

337
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,520
Everyone, please help me find the herbs needed.

338
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,080
Sure, Master. Just tell us what to do.

339
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,580
These are the medicines needed.

340
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,560
Rest assured, Master.

341
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,260
We'd go all over the world to get what you want.

342
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,240
Take care, everyone.

343
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,660
Qu Xiaoxing, you don't have to go.

344
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,580
Then I'll follow you back to Thousand Flower Valley.

345
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,040
You stay in North Abyss.

346
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,680
Why? You don't want me?

347
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,600
You and Chang Yi were familiar in the past.

348
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,920
You can stay there to take care of the people from Thousand Flower Valley.

349
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,040
- Then I can rest assured.
- But...

350
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,440
Since we're both against Immortal Master, it doesn't matter where we stay.

351
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,840
If you need any help, send me a message.

352
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,140
Okay. I won't let you down.

353
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,660
Master.

354
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,740
Yunhe. Is she really gone?

355
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,580
I know. She sacrificed her life to save us.

356
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,400
But I felt that it didn't seem real.

357
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,760
In the Snake Spirit Cave before,

358
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,860
what did I tell you?

359
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,200
Don't think too much.

360
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,300
Just believe in you.

361
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,940
Try to survive.

362
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,760
One day, you'll get what you want.

363
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,760
Master, why are we here?

364
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,760
- To find someone.
- Find someone?

365
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,480
She's here.

366
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,280
She?

367
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,660
A fox?

368
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,720
No. It's Yunhe.

369
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,700
Didn't Yunhe perish already?

370
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,920
The Spiritual Master's body has disappeared,

371
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,160
but she has another chance to rebuild her body.

372
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,800
To fight against the Frost mark, double veins were formed inside Yunhe.

373
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,580
They lived together.

374
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,920
When one vein vanished, the other would revive.

375
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,620
It will keep her spirit and help her rebuild her body.

376
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,760
From then on, the fairy vein of the Spiritual Master is dead.

377
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,620
She will be a complete nine-tailed fox.

378
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,780
So when Shunde ordered you to kill Ji Yunhe, you'd already planned everything.

379
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,480
Even if you took her back to Shunde, you'd never give up on her.

380
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,580
You'd use this way to deceive others, right?

381
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,220
Where are we taking her?

382
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,380
Will you tell Chang Yi?

383
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,700
Yunhe sacrificed all her life for North Abyss, for Thousand Flower Valley, and for everyone.

384
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,340
She'd never cherished herself.

385
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,160
This time, I hope she can forget all the past pain.

386
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,440
I'll take her home.

387
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,760
I used to think that I didn't need any friends in my life.

388
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,420
Until Yunhe came and insisted on making an alliance with me.

389
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,420
I was really annoyed with her at first.

390
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:15,480
But I never expected that she would get inside my heart, step by step.

391
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,280
Though we're more apart than together,

392
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,300
in my heart,

393
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,280
she's been the best friend of my life.

394
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,760
I know.

395
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,300
You'd either refuse to love

396
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,860
or love others forever.

397
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,260
Yunhe's unfinished wish,

398
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,340
I want to help her finish it.

399
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,340
Me too. I know what you're trying to do.

400
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,840
I've sent messages to Master Fei Lian.

401
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,480
We can set out tomorrow and catch up with them.

402
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,460
Are you going with me?

403
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,320
After this, I feel the world is always changing.

404
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,000
If I want to regret less,

405
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,100
all I can do is cherish the moment,

406
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
cherish the people I'm with.

407
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,880
In my heart,

408
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,660
staying with you is my happiest thing.

409
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,660
Don't leave me behind for my own good.

410
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,460
Let's do it together.

411
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,200
Together.

412
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,140
Yunhe!

413
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,040
Where are you hanging out now?

414
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,280
You're going out without me.

415
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,180
You neglect our friendship.

416
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,460
Yunhe. See?

417
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,540
We're free.

418
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,300
We don't have to think about running away anymore.

419
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,220
Without you, I don't know where to go now.

420
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,080
Without you,

421
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,140
I don't see a way forward.

422
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,460
Stop.

423
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,440
Don't think that I didn't beat you up because I would forgive you.

424
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,000
I don't need it. Thanks.

425
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,060
Stop drinking.

426
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,260
Even if I drink myself to death,

427
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,620
it has nothing to do with you.

428
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,320
Ji Yunhe wouldn't want to see you like this.

429
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,800
You need to take care of yourself.

430
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,060
Ji Yunhe is gone.

431
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,140
What's the meaning of taking care of myself?

432
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,340
Leaving me alone, what's the point of it?

433
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,260
But you mean a lot more.

434
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,700
Heartless people like you who know nothing but business would never understand.

435
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,900
I was attacked by a predator and accidentally fell into Thousand Flower Valley.

436
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,100
It was Yunhe who saved me from dying.

437
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,801
At first,

438
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,580
everyone in Thousand Flower Valley said that I was the most useless attendant.

439
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,600
It was Yunhe who supported me everywhere.

440
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,040
So no one could think less of me.

441
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,660
Without Ji Yunhe, there would be no Luo Jinsang.

442
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,820
But now Yunhe is gone.

443
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,120
You tell me. Who should I take care for?

444
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,520
But for some people, you're also important.

445
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,320
Actually, I...

446
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,620
I know about your relationship with Ji Yunhe.

447
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,920
But the most precious meaning is that you live in the world.

448
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,620
I believe in the future, you will find your own way.

449
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,840
But before that,

450
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,480
you have to learn to take care of yourself first.

451
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,660
The weather is cold, drinking is harmful to your health.

452
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,440
Master, to the outside world, Ji Yunhe is dead.

453
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,460
If we bring her back here, will they find out?

454
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,540
This is the place she knows best. It's also where she feels most at home.

455
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,290
I'll set up a barrier. No one will see or reach the yard.

456
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,210
I'll tell others that this place was destroyed.

457
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,280
They won't find her here.

458
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,260
Ji Yunhe.

459
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,860
Master, why do you set so much space inside the barrier?

460
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,640
All the flowers behind are covered.

461
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,520
She likes flowers. I'll leave them all to her.

462
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,260
♫ <i>A thousand years passed in moonlight</i> ♫

463
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,920
♫ <i>In the corridor at the end of the world</i> ♫

464
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,120
Siyu.

465
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,780
♫ <i>I seem to see us there out of the corner of my eyes</i> ♫

466
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:13,580
♫ <i>We bloomed like a flower</i> ♫

467
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:22,340
♫ <i>Meeting outside a pavilion full of flowers</i> ♫

468
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:36,500
♫ <i>We once met like a song in the sounds of nature</i> ♫

469
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,680
To rebuild her body, you spent half of your power.

470
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,510
Is that worth it?

471
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,820
It's worth it.

472
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,280
Who are you?

473
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,260
And... who am I?

474
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,500
Master, what happened to her?

475
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,840
It's the common rules that when you get some, you lose some.

476
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,120
Memories of the past are gone.

477
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,260
Now she can start a new life.

478
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,260
What's in your hand?

479
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,140
Master, it's Chang Yi's merman tear.

480
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,080
It's not appropriate for her to keep it.

481
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,700
If you like it, you can keep it.

482
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,040
Do you know me?

483
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,700
Why do you look so sad when looking at me?

484
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,440
Your name is Ji. It means memory.

485
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,340
I'm your master.

486
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,840
Master.

487
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,920
<i>The battle of North Abyss was resolved by Ji Yunhe.</i>

488
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,460
<i>I didn't get the killing power I need.</i>

489
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,940
<i>Besides, now even the little Heavenly King</i>

490
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,360
<i>dares to bully you.</i>

491
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,880
<i>He locked Shunde in Immortal Master Mansion.</i>

492
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,030
<i>What does it mean?</i>

493
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,300
<i>He did that to warn you.</i>

494
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,780
<i>He's telling you that he disposed of the one you were protecting</i>

495
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,280
<i>but there's nothing you can do about it.</i>

496
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,960
<i>Useless.</i>

497
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,840
<i>You.</i>

498
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,400
<i>How many times have I told you?</i>

499
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,540
<i>Even if you fix Shunde's face, nothing would change.</i>

500
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,260
<i>In the heart of Ning Xiyu, Ning Ruochu is the most important.</i>

501
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,140
<i>Her favorite apprentice is always Ning Ruochu.</i>

502
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,880
<i>You'll never be better than him.</i>

503
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,220
Shut up!

504
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,760
<i>Look at your temper.</i>

505
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,200
<i>Facts are facts. Why can't I talk about it?</i>

506
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,620
<i>Don't go.</i>

507
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,500
<i>Look at yourself. You get angry every time I mention her.</i>

508
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,980
<i>Don't forget that you have a contract with me.</i>

509
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,700
<i>If you don't do what you promised, I'll choose another ally.</i>

510
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,720
I know what to do.

511
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,740
If you can't wait, do whatever you want.

512
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,280
<i>Do you really think I don't have another choice?</i>

513
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,880
<i>All right. Don't regret.</i>

514
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,080
<i>Sister.</i>

515
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,320
<i>Ru Ling.</i>

516
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,900
<i>Sister.</i>

517
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,700
I knew it. All that misery was a dream.

518
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,880
Come on! Serve me good wine.

519
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,840
Where are you going? Stay and serve me.

520
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,000
Master.

521
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,000
Master, you won't leave me, will you?

522
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,400
You still love me, right?

523
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,300
Master. My face.

524
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,620
Master, don't go.

525
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:59,540
Give me back my face. Give me back my face.

526
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,740
Master!

527
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,500
Master!

528
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,160
<i>They can come and go as they wish.</i>

529
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,400
<i>You're the only one stuck in here.</i>

530
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,020
<i>This is a cage only for you.</i>

531
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,780
<i>Sad? Painful?</i>

532
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,680
<i>Angry?</i>

533
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,100
Who?

534
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,680
<i>Do you understand?</i>

535
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,680
<i>Without power, everyone will think less of you.</i>

536
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,780
<i>Even like your master, your brother will not pity you any more.</i>

537
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,260
<i>No one is reliable. Power.</i>

538
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,060
<i>Power. Power is everything.</i>

539
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,260
Enough! Who are you?

540
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,020
<i>It doesn't matter who I am. It's who you are, that matters.</i>

541
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,120
<i>Are you a weak one to be trampled on</i>

542
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,820
<i>or the Immortal Fairy who is above them all?</i>

543
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,380
Can you give me strength and help me out?

544
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,720
<i>I can teach you how to seize the power of others and get out of here.</i>

545
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,120
I was put in prison. My position was abolished.

546
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,980
Can you see anyone by my side?

547
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,880
<i>You're the Immortal Fairy.</i>

548
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,240
<i>Everything in the world is supposed to belong to you.</i>

549
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,160
<i>Those Spiritual Masters who fled outside, can you forgive them so easily?</i>

550
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,100
<i>Bring them back.</i>

551
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,440
<i>Take their power.</i>

552
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,700
Right. The whole world is all mine.

553
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,620
Everyone should obey me.

554
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,720
It is their glory to be used by me.

555
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,860
<i>It wasn't a dream. Who was it?</i>

556
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,120
<i>What he said was true.</i>

557
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,920
<i>I can really grab others' power for my use.</i>

558
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,960
Immortal Fairy.

559
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,940
If you don't want to die, keep your mouth shut.

560
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,400
If you tell others about what happened today,

561
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,600
I'll turn you into ashes.

562
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,760
Where's Zhu Ling? He's not dead, right?

563
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,040
Get out. Ask him to see me.

564
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,140
Yes!

565
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:46,540
