00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Lu Jinyan. Why is it you?

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,360
No arts can bring the dead back to life.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,680
It's a trap especially laid for you.

<i>Fake bait for the real fish.</i>

25
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,760
So you know, but then what?

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,400
For your information, I've made a perfect plan.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960
If I don't return in time, there will be a riot in the town.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,080
Is that so?

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,720
Those elders who colluded with you have confessed everything.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,760
You've got your back against the wall.

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,760
So you've been waiting for so long not only to catch me,

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,040
but also to take them out.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,360
Now that I'm governing the North Abyss, I'll allow nobody to disturb its peace.

34
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,560
Chang Yi, this is not the end.

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,280
Kill me and you'll never see the fox that you care so much about.

36
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
Brother A'Ji, why are we here?

37
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,520
Didn't the merman say he'd set us free?

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
Why do we continue laboring?

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
You idiot.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,440
Who knows if the merman will go back on his word?

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,680
Now he is fishing.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,120
It's our only chance to run away.

43
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,060
Order from the general. Catch the fox.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,320
Catch me?

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,120
You wish.

46
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,200
Brother A'Ji, I feel dizzy.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,260
This is smoke made from the Moon Sand Fog.

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,360
It can cause confusion and weaken spiritual power.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,160
There's no way you can escape.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,420
Split up.

51
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,980
Catch them.

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,840
He's wounded and without spiritual power.

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,780
It's hard to navigate amid the heavy fog.

54
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,760
He must not have gone far.

55
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,639
I noticed it when we were in the hall

56
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,760
that you are indeed a sentimental person.

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,520
The fox only vaguely reminds you of Ji Yunhe

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,600
by being surnamed Ji.

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,920
You don't know what to do with it.

60
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,940
Try me.

61
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,320
If I don't go back in time,

62
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,820
he won't survive, either.

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,820
Qifeng, listen.

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,460
An evil man like you is in no place to negotiate with me.

65
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,120
As for A'Ji, you're unable to hurt him.

66
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,360
Master... Master, they're after A'Ji.

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,000
In the woods near the Ice Lake.

68
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,160
Even the spiritual power can't sustain the Illusion Art.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,100
There's a reason master didn't allow me to come to the North Abyss.

70
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,160
Am I going to die here?

71
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,620
I have to run faster.

- Over there.

Luo Suo, Master was carrying Ji, wasn't he?

88
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,640
Since when did Master care so much about him?

89
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,300
Good question.

90
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,780
That can't be right.

<i>Why don't I remember any of it?</i>

94
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,640
Where am I?

95
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,600
It's my room.

96
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,400
You're safe now.

97
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,560
Wait, the Illusion Art...

98
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,100
It's gone.

99
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,440
Illusion?

100
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,600
So that's why you looked different?

101
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,160
<i>Oh no... he recognized me.</i>

102
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,740
<i>Did he bring me here to punish me by skinning me?</i>

103
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,820
Finally, you're back.

104
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,360
I thought I'd never see you again.

105
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
Master, that's a good one.

106
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,240
Actually... of course, you'd see me again.

107
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,080
I was just taking a walk in the woods.

108
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,640
I never thought about running away.

109
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,900
You don't have to call me Master.

110
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,720
Just call me like you used to.

111
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Well... that's inappropriate.

112
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,440
You're a man of nobility.

113
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
I shall respect you.

114
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,360
You must be very busy.

115
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,260
I won't intrude.

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Are you still mad at me?

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,360
It was all my fault.

118
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,580
This time... please stay.

119
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,760
Master... You're the master of North Abyss, and you saved my life.

120
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,600
How dare I be mad at you?

121
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,680
There might be some misunderstanding between us.

122
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,750
Why don't we forgive and forget, then we can be friends?

123
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,625
Friends?

124
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,300
What are you saying?

125
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,920
You don't remember me?

126
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,860
You're master of the North Abyss, aren't you?

127
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,280
Are you still under the influence of the smoke in the woods?

128
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,020
Well, get some good rest. I'll see you later.

129
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,620
Ji Yunhe, are you playing dumb with me?

130
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,280
You really don't know who I am?

131
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,100
<i>God, and who is Ji Yunhe?</i>

132
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,660
<i>What is he talking about?</i>

133
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,620
- Are you okay?
- Back off.

134
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,120
Stay still.

135
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,520
<i>Didn't he want to kill me?</i>

136
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,600
<i>Why is he trying to heal me now?</i>

137
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,840
<i>That's kind of... a soft touch.</i>

138
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,040
It's all right.

139
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,920
It won't hurt with the petting.

140
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,600
<i>A petting will stop it from hurting?</i>

141
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,920
<i>Yes, it won't hurt with the petting.</i>

142
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,960
<i>From now on, this spell only belongs to you.</i>

143
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,400
Well... I think I'm all right now.

144
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,320
I'll go back to the Ape Wing Camp.

145
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,200
Stay here till you're fully recovered.

146
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
Save your spiritual power.

147
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,500
Don't use the Illusion Art.

148
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,480
Well, I don't think so.

149
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,660
There are so many people here.

150
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,800
If they see me like this, I need to explain it to them.

151
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,340
That's too much trouble. It's better that I go back in disguise now.

152
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,600
If you don't want others to see your real looks,

153
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,220
I won't allow anybody in to disturb you.

154
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,120
Please stay.

155
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,600
Well... if you insist.

156
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,040
I feel tired and feel like taking a nap.

157
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,440
Master, you can leave me alone.

158
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,140
Why are you bringing me here?

159
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,880
Does that bastard Chang Yi want to have me killed?

160
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,580
Answer me.

161
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,620
Cousin?

162
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,740
Cousin...

163
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,360
Master said that you're one of our kind after all.

164
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,840
So he left you to me.

165
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,940
I knew you wouldn't let Chang Yi kill me.

166
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,800
Cousin, I slipped up.

167
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,400
You'll forgive me, right?

168
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,720
Have you not come to your senses by now?

169
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,660
What are you doing?

170
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,080
You're not going to help him deal with me, are you?

171
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Everything I did was for you. For our clan.

172
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,620
Chang Yi will never love you. Why are you helping him?

173
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,020
Cousin! North Abyss has long been not for the glory of you and me.

174
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,980
I won't kill you.

175
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,360
But if you can't understand this, you can't stay in North Abyss anymore.

176
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,540
Spread the news that Qifeng has been stripped of spiritual power.

177
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,680
He's expelled from Lingshuang Pavilion,

178
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,900
and shall not set foot in North Abyss again in this lifetime.

179
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,020
You're doing this for someone who's not one of us.

180
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,700
You'll regret it. You'll regret it.

181
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,160
You'll regret it...

182
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,220
<i>There might be some misunderstandings between us.</i>

183
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,860
<i>
Why don't we forgive and forget, then we can be friends?</i>

184
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,080
<i>Yunhe, you're finally back.</i>

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,820
<i>But why don't you remember me?</i>

186
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,580
Why are you back?

187
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,840
About A'Ji...

188
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,420
I think you deserve an explanation.

189
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,120
<i>The merman saw my real looks but didn't kill me.</i>

190
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,960
<i>And he offered his room to me.</i>

191
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,760
<i>Is it because I helped him out, and he was returning the favor?</i>

192
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,960
<i>If this is the case, I might as well stay here before figuring out the next step.</i>

193
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,980
<i>But why did he look at me so strangely?</i>

194
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,300
<i>And what he said...</i>

195
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,280
I think I heard it in my dream...

196
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,660
What on earth happened between us?

197
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,400
How did you figure out A'Ji was Yunhe?

198
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,100
When I received your letter the other day, I began to suspect it.

199
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,780
I traveled to many places, looking for clues in ancient records.

200
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,320
Finally, I found out about it.

201
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,220
There's one thing I can't figure out.

202
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,860
I watched Yunhe's soul disappear with my own eyes.

203
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,760
How did she come back to life?

204
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,300
She didn't die in the first place.

205
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,860
I think Lin Canglan had infused her with two opposite powers. So she had two spirit veins.

206
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,400
The day when you saw her die, her life as a Spiritual Master disappeared.

207
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,980
But the spiritual power of the nine-tailed fox saved her other life.

208
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,140
That's why she survived.

209
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,300
Someone else must have known about it,

210
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,060
and helped reshape her human look.

211
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,360
In other words, her memory is gone because her life

212
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,040
as a Spiritual Master is gone.

213
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,540
Yes.

214
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,260
No wonder she doesn't know me.

215
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,100
Only Lin Haoqing knows about her two veins.

216
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,220
The master A'Ji talked about... is it him?

217
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,580
Yes, it is.

218
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,820
What's your plan?

219
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,520
If you want her memory back, I'll keep searching.

220
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,560
Even if I have to search the whole world, I'll find a way for you.

221
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,800
<i>Do you think I want to be a Spiritual Master?</i>

222
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,640
<i>But if I don't follow orders of the Thousand Flower Valley, how can I leave this hell?</i>

223
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,900
<i>Big-tailed fish...</i>

224
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,240
<i>I'm nothing but a happy humble immortal.</i>

225
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,440
<i>I never meant to offend you.</i>

226
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,140
Don't bother.

227
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,860
You had a long journey. Get some rest.

228
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,060
Chang Yi, can you really let it go?

229
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,380
The Yunhe I knew would shoulder everything.

230
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,700
No matter how badly bruised, she'd never groan a bit.

231
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,780
But now... she seems a lot happier.

232
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,480
Perhaps it's mercy and a gift from Heaven.

233
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,980
I'd hate to see her burdened with the past.

234
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,960
Therefore, don't bother.

235
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,260
She's fine the way she is now.

236
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,860
How about you?

237
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,740
Are you going ahead with the burden of the past?

238
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,160
No matter if she remembers me or not,

239
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,120
so long as she is Ji Yunhe, that's enough for me.

240
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,160
Her happiness as A'Ji should not be disturbed.

241
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,600
Just keep it a secret between us.

242
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay, I will.

243
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,699
Where are you going?

244
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,680
I've made my decision.

245
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,940
I should let go of the past.

246
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:50,325
♫ <i>Hey, if I weren't me and you weren't you</i> ♫

247
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:57,275
♫ <i>Hey, think more... think more</i> ♫

248
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:04,625
♫ <i>Hey, where are you going?</i> ♫

249
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,500
♫ <i>Any fool looking up can't keep the light</i> ♫

♫ <i>Hey, just follow the flow</i> ♫

251
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,920
<i>Yunhe, I once believed fate was too cruel.</i>

252
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,800
<i>It made me admit that my love was for nothing.</i>

253
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,940
<i>But you're not.</i>

254
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,000
<i>My love for you is not nothing.</i>

255
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,820
<i>Thank you... for coming back.</i>

256
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,225
♫ <i>From now on, you don't have to be scared of anything</i> ♫

261
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,620
What? Chang Yi carried A'Ji back to Lingshuang Pavilion?

262
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,940
Not sent him back under guard?

263
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,240
He carried him back, and treated him by himself.

264
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,060
No one was allowed in.

265
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,520
Except for Ji Yunhe, I've never seen him care about someone so much.

266
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,600
I think he has been missing Yunhe too much

267
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,140
to get muddled and mistake Ji for Yunhe.

268
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,100
It can't be. He can't mistake A'Ji for a girl.

269
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,380
Now that Luo Suo mentioned it, A'Ji does resemble Yunhe in some way.

270
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,420
Do you think it is a miracle?

271
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,780
Yunhe didn't die at all and is back for us in the appearance of A'Ji.

272
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,940
Listen. There's only one Ji Yunhe in the world.

273
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,340
No one can ever replace her.

274
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,500
Chang Yi can't randomly take back a fox and pretend it to be Yunhe.

275
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,780
I'll go to find out the background of A'Ji.

276
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,980
<i>I haven't told Luo Luo I'm back now.</i>

277
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,680
<i>If I go to see her, will she be surprised?</i>

278
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,740
What are you looking for?

279
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,240
Poison.

280
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,000
You're back.

281
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,940
What are you doing?

282
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,700
Do you know? Chang Yi is obsessed with a fox.

283
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,320
I can't beat A'Ji.

284
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,080
I came here for some poison, but you're better than poison.

285
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,900
Let's go to talk some sense into Chang Yi and have A'Ji expelled from here.

286
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,160
- Come on.
- Luo Luo, wait.

287
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,060
Well, don't you think it's a good thing

288
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,120
that Chang Yi is finally moving forward?

289
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,320
Good thing?

290
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,680
You're taking his side?

291
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,640
You're in favor of out with the old, and in with the new?

292
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,190
Do you think now that Yunhe is dead, Chang Yi should forget about her and find someone else?

293
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,760
Chang Yi should forget about her and find someone else?

294
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,380
Even if it's a fox he picked up nowhere?

295
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,600
No, I didn't mean that.

296
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,000
What do you mean then?

297
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Do you think Chang Yi is doing the right thing?

298
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,320
I see. If I die someday, you'll find someone new, too.

299
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,680
Listen, Kong Ming! If you don't help me get rid of A'Ji, I'll beat you up.

300
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,460
What was I saying just now?

301
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,860
You'll never die.

302
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,080
No matter what will happen in the future...

303
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,120
Even if I'm dead myself, I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you.

304
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,820
And nobody can replace you, ever.

305
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,750
You're the most important person...

306
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,720
to me in the world.

307
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,300
How important?

308
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,120
As important as a... spirit stone is to you?

309
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,880
Well no... wait... I'll start over...

310
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,620
I'm that important to you?

311
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:11,400
Kong Ming, you're also the most important one to me.

312
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,820
<i>Yunhe, no matter if you remember the past or not, I don't care.</i>

313
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,220
<i>This time... all I want is for you to be safe,</i>

314
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,200
happy, and carefree.

315
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,840
<i>Master, is Yunhe... really dead?</i>

316
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,100
<i>Live on, and your wish will come true one day.</i>

317
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,280
<i>Does Master have something to do with A'Ji's appearance?</i>

318
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,260
Drink it.

319
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,120
I'm basically recovered.

320
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,980
Shall we pass it? Too bitter.

321
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,160
Fine, I won't force you.

322
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,660
The four hours I spent on it are for nothing.

323
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,100
Hold on. You worked so hard for it.

324
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,040
Of course, I'll drink it.

325
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
<i>Good boy.</i>

326
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,560
<i>Let's see what mom is doing.</i>

327
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,440
<i>My sweet little baby.</i>

328
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,500
<i>Smile.</i>

329
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,900
Do you envy them?

330
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,540
I don't know why,

331
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,100
but every time I'm here,

332
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,520
I always feel so peaceful.

333
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,420
Perhaps this is what a family looks like.

334
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,180
It's ordinary, simple,

335
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,240
but so rarely precious.

336
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,780
We can have that. After pacifying the chaos of Immortal Master,

337
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,580
everything will return to order.

338
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,740
By then, we can either live in seclusion,

339
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,260
or the bustling city.

340
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,500
Wherever you want to go,

341
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,620
I'll go together with you.

342
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,780
Well, you don't have to humor me all the time.

343
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,560
I've never been to Chongwu Mountain.

344
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,520
I don't mind visiting it with you.

345
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,060
That's great.

346
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,420
Da Huan and Xiao Huan went back to placate the elders for me.

347
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,020
As long as you want, we can go back anytime.

348
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,300
Your Majesty. Masters.

349
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,860
You're finally back.

350
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,020
Majesty?

351
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,700
Calm down. Commander Xue. Prince Li Shu.

352
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,520
We finally found out the origin of the unknown mountain.

353
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,460
That's great news.

354
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,480
<i>Look! What's Dad doing?</i>

355
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,640
The mountain doesn't belong to the human world.

356
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,100
It was the battleground where the Immortals fought against Zhuyan's army. The Infinite Mountain.

357
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,020
Back then, Zhuyan's army gathered here.

358
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,760
Father led the army to crush them with the ancient treasure, the Colored Glazed Lamp.

359
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,560
Both sides were killed and wounded in months of fierce fighting.

360
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,220
In the end, Father gave up his own life to destroy Zhuyan.

361
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,540
But why does the Infinite Mountain appear in the human world?

362
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,980
It was a very fierce battle.

363
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,800
The mountain couldn't withstand the shock,

364
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,200
thus falling into the gap between the two worlds.

365
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,480
According to records, every 500 years, it will cross the line between the living and the dead.

366
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,860
When the new replaces the old, it will open for a moment.

367
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,480
I've calculated it.

368
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,760
It will fall upon these days.

369
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,280
What are we waiting for then? Let's go.

370
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,820
Come on, every 500 years.

371
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,400
We don't want to miss it, do we?

372
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,040
Immortal Li Shu, you're always so impatient.

373
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,180
Of course, I am. After we defeat Immortal Master,

374
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,680
Sanyue and I have something important to do.

375
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,600
Something important? What is it?

376
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,900
Isn't marriage a big thing?

377
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,480
- Marriage?
- Li Shu...

378
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,140
Your Majesty, the records give a vague description.

379
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,180
Where exactly is the gap?

380
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,520
And when exactly will the Infinite Mountain open?

381
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,220
Everything in nature is interconnected.

382
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,060
One change may lead to many others.

383
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,140
Infinite means uncertainty.

384
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,920
Therefore, changes are to be expected.

385
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,760
The gap between the two worlds... It must be concealed.

386
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,460
How about we look around and see if we can feel its whereabouts?

387
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,020
Okay, let's do that.

388
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,420
Come on.

389
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:20,860
<i>Li Shu... Li Shu...</i>

390
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,300
Hold on.

391
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,240
Somebody is calling me.

392
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,880
- Did you hear it?
- What?

393
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,300
Are you sure of it?

394
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
<i>Li Shu...</i>

395
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,160
- Yes.
<i>- Li Shu...</i>

396
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,500
Yes.

397
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm sure of it.

398
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,300
What are you doing?

399
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,940
The voice is coming from over there.

400
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,620
At the bottom of the cliff?

401
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,860
Or the mountain on the other side?

402
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Neither.

403
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,580
Maybe we ignored one thing.

404
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,660
What is it?

405
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,540
Why does a mountain have to be on the ground?

406
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,780
What if the gap is in the void right in front of us?

407
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,740
You mean... the sky?

408
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,820
Are you sure?

409
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,920
We'll find out.

410
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,200
Sanyue... I was speculating.

411
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,400
I believe your speculation.

412
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,900
Okay, we'll find out together.

413
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,440
Well...

414
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,800
The Infinite Mountain.

415
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,620
End and beginning, life and death are all on this line.

416
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,100
Li Shu, that's impressive.

417
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,060
But the voice you were talking about... what is it?

418
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,180
No idea.

419
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,340
Let's drop it for now, and enter it.

420
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,980
Come on.

421
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,380
What is this place?

422
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,120
<i>It's the Infinite Mountain.</i>

423
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,500
<i>Your Majesty is in my consciousness.</i>

424
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,120
Who are you?

425
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,340
Your Majesty, I'm Master of Four Directions.

426
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,200
Master of Four Directions?

427
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,540
But... didn't you die with Father back then?

428
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,560
The late emperor protected the last of my spirit from disappearing.

429
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,740
Following his order, I've been waiting in this mountain for you.

430
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,100
I will assist your Majesty to destroy Zhuyan the beast.

431
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,800
What?

432
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,360
Zhuyan is still alive?

433
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,920
Originating from human evil, it will live as long as there are evil thoughts.

434
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,640
During the battle,

435
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,500
Zhuyan's body and spirit elixir were destroyed,

436
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,530
but its spirit lingered.

437
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,180
The late emperor imprisoned it in the mountain in time,

438
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,600
but its evil was too obstinate.

439
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Zhuyan has been looking for someone

440
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,980
to bring it back into the world.

441
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,360
Then one day, a Spiritual Master and her pupil stumbled into the mountain.

442
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,280
Sister?

443
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,100
No, it's not her.

444
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,540
They're Ning Xinyu and Ning Qing.

445
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,380
Ning Xinyu had a pure heart,

446
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,980
thus Zhuyan couldn't influence her a bit.

447
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:23,900
But her pupil felt its vague calling.

448
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,580
<i>One day, you will come back here.</i>

449
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,800
Zhuyan was right.

450
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,980
The target he set his eyes on returned one day, by destiny or fate.

451
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,940
That day, yin rose and yang fell in the Infinite Mountain.

452
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,280
With the imbalance of powers,

453
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,900
I failed to control Zhuyan for a moment,

454
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,260
giving it an opportunity.

455
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,960
<i>You are back.</i>

456
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,880
<i>You did hear my calling.</i>

457
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,240
<i>It's pity that you're too weak.</i>

458
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,760
<i>You're seeking revenge, aren't you?</i>

459
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,980
<i>Sign a blood contract with me. You'll have access to all forbidden arts.</i>

460
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,380
<i>None of your enemies will compete with you.</i>

461
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,180
<i>The immortal realm, the devil realm...</i>

462
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,460
<i>You will be able to destroy whoever you want.</i>

463
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,220
<i>I'll help you gain the most formidable power.</i>

464
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:36,220
<i>We'll pay homage to Ning Xinyu with all lives of the world.</i>

465
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,180
<i>Then you have to do what you say.</i>

466
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,560
<i>I want the whole world to pay for her death.</i>

467
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,160
They made a blood contract.

468
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,540
Zhuyan would help Ning Qing gain power and authority.

469
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,840
In return, Ning Qing would take Zhuyan out of the Infinite Mountain.

470
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,619
He also promised to collect killing energy to reshape Zhuyan's body and help him return to the world.

471
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:21,559
What's more, Zhuyan's original body was that of eternal black ice.

472
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,020
Every Frost mark comes from it.

473
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,660
Therefore, as long as Zhuyan lives, the Frost marks will live.

474
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,680
Upon his death, the late emperor only left the Map of the Spirit Token.

475
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,040
And I've been unable to leave here.

476
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,660
All I could do was to wait for Your Majesty and tell you the whole story.

477
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,380
Even Father couldn't destroy Zhuyan.

478
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,060
Will I be able to do it?

479
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,660
The pure heart of Your Majesty

480
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,219
is the key to putting a stop to it, as well as the hope of the world.

481
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,940
Now you know everything.

482
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,340
It's time for me to leave.

483
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,740
Master, wait!

484
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,420
Master!

485
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,660
<i>I am nothing but a wisp of spirit.</i>

486
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,400
<i>My mission is accomplished.</i>

487
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,160
<i>There's no reason for me to linger on.</i>

488
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,200
<i>Finally, one thing for Your Majesty.</i>

489
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,940
<i>Hope it can be some help to you.</i>

490
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,400
<i>It can activate the Devil Subduing Formation, which will suppress Zhuyan.</i>

491
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,140
<i>When the moment comes, seize it.</i>

492
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,660
<i>Seal Zhuyan's spirit in it once and for all.</i>

493
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,520
<i>Do remember.</i>

494
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,100
Your Majesty.

495
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,440
Zhuyan's not dead yet.

496
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,498
No, he's not.

497
00:35:47,498 --> 00:35:50,900
We all entered the consciousness of the Master of Four Directions.

498
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,460
We saw everything.

499
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,640
Your Majesty, with all due respect,

500
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,160
your father has left you with no army.

501
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,200
What he left behind was big trouble.

502
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,280
I never thought Immortal Master to be in cahoots with Zhuyan.

503
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,680
Had I seen this coming, I would have struck him with my thunder.

504
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,900
With his strong spiritual power and Zhuyan's forbidden arts,

505
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,020
you stand no chance.

506
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,780
Masters, would you return to the Heavenly Palace

507
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,740
and tell four seas and eight wastelands about it?

508
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,260
To keep it a secret,

509
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,020
Immortal Master has set a barrier outside the mountain.

510
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,360
We can barely spread the news to the North Abyss

511
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,760
with the message talisman.

512
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,120
That's as much as we can do.

513
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,660
Sorry, Your Majesty. We are too incapable.

514
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,020
Before disappearing, the Master of Four Directions left me with one thing.

515
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,580
Maybe it will help.

516
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,180
The Colored Glazed Lamp.

517
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,260
This is the treasure used by the late emperor to fight against Zhuyan.

518
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,120
The lamp burns forever.

519
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,860
With its help, not only can we leave Infinite Mountain,

520
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,700
but we can seal Zhuyan again.

521
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,640
However, Your Majesty...

522
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,880
it is somewhat damaged.

523
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,120
We can't light it.

524
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,260
Indeed.

525
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,300
It was damaged in the battle.

526
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,820
But the lamp burns forever to pass on brightness.

527
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,260
I'd like to try repairing it and be the lamp-holder.

528
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,800
<i>Go kill them...</i>

529
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,020
<i>They have got the lamp.</i>

530
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,140
<i>I want them all dead.</i>

531
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,760
They aren't able to leave Infinite Mountain.

532
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,860
I should go get some medicine.

533
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,460
<i>Ning Qing, I taught you the forbidden arts</i>

534
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,160
<i>and helped you gain power.</i>

535
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,680
<i>According to our blood contract, you should obey me,</i>

536
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,340
<i>instead of being obsessed with treating her face.</i>

537
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,220
<i>My existence should be your guiding principle.</i>

538
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,420
Let me remind you.

539
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,520
It was me who helped you off of Infinite Mountain and back into the world.

540
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,760
We just did what we could and took what we needed.

541
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Without her face to witness the world's doom,

542
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,560
everything I have done is meaningless.

543
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,080
<i>Ning Qing, you're indeed obstinate and unruly.</i>

544
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,320
<i>But don't forget the consequence of breaching the contract.</i>

545
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,660
<i>Your wish will never come true by then.</i>

546
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,540
<i>You and I still have the same goal, don't we?</i>

547
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,220
The power of Heavenly King is inferior to his father's.

548
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,080
Fei Lian and Lei Ze are just ordinary.

549
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,640
I bet they cannot repair the lamp.

550
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,200
<i>You're too arrogant.</i>

551
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,020
<i>No matter what you have in mind, I still need more power.</i>

552
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,980
<i>Killing is not enough.</i>

553
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,260
<i>What I need is a shattered and bloody world.</i>

554
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,160
Then wait patiently.

555
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,340
We're near the end of the game.

556
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,180
You'll have what I promised you.

557
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,160
You've got fewer and fewer Spiritual Masters.

558
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,060
How about I take away your power?

559
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,520
Fairy, you have my absolute loyalty.

560
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,260
Master!

561
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,180
Master, you finally come.

562
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,500
You're making a good recovery.

563
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,600
Ru Ling, don't worry. I'll go and find better drugs.

564
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,980
Your face will recover soon.

565
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,820
Can you get more Spiritual Masters?

566
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,060
The more, the better.

567
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,900
Is it them who you want, or their spiritual power?

568
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,260
<i>[Immortal Fairy Hall]</i>

569
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,340
With their spiritual power, I can recover sooner. Right?

570
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,580
Then ask him about the Thunderfire Vein.

571
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,540
<i>[Immortal Fairy Hall]</i>

572
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm going to look for medicine.

573
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,720
I'll leave the affairs here to you.

574
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,840
Fairy, when I was stationed at the Lingshuang Pavilion,

575
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,900
I heard the Thunderfire Vein is an ancient vein spanning the North Abyss.

576
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,140
It has been in slumber for years.

577
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,140
Once reignited, fire will burst out.

578
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,880
The North Abyss will be destroyed.

579
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,420
By then, those Spiritual Masters will have no shelter.

580
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,040
Catching them will be so easy.

581
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,960
Master, when the Thunderfire Vein is ignited,

582
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,920
the North Abyss will be a real abyss.

583
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,480
Isn't it... too cruel?

584
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,420
What's more, Senior Kong Ming is there.

585
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,020
Master, please think twice.

586
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,580
He is a traitor.

587
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,940
Do you expect him to come back?

588
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:49,080
Chengyu, what you're thinking and doing behind me,

589
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,760
I know it all clearly.

590
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,400
Again, don't disappoint me again.

591
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,100
<i>[Immortal Fairy Hall]</i>

592
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,140
The merman's treatment works well on me.

593
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,180
Doesn't hurt at all.

594
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,460
Now that I'm fully recovered and the merman is not here,

595
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,460
maybe I can run away...

596
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,060
Run where?

597
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,580
Run to get some gifts to express my gratitude to Master.

598
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,120
Really?

599
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,220
Fine, I just want to take a walk outside.

600
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,000
Spending too much time indoors, I'll get crankier and increasingly uglier.

601
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,580
Okay, let's take a walk.

602
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,860
Are we going to walk here?

603
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,460
Last time when I stumbled here,

604
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,840
you knocked me out real hard.

605
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,580
It was my mistake last time.

606
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,720
If you want to relieve your anger, you can hit me back.

607
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,300
No, I'm fine.

608
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,620
You won't regret it, right?

609
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,560
You seem to like it here a lot.

610
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,860
It always feels like the sky is wide open.

611
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,560
So free and unrestrained.

612
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,180
All I want is to run on the ice field.

613
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,560
Not running away.

614
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,920
It's okay.

615
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,140
Run as you wish.

616
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,900
Really?

617
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,840
I'm going. Don't you regret it.

618
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,000
Go.

619
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,740
<i>Why is he looking at me like that again?</i>

620
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,480
<i>And why does it feel so familiar?</i>

621
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,940
<i>Why is my heart beating so fast?</i>

622
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,860
Relax. I won't punish you.

623
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:58,440
If you like it here, I can bring you here every day.

624
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,460
Don't bother. I have work to do.

625
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,140
To make you work as punishment was a mistake.

626
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,640
You don't have to do it.

627
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,540
From now on, I won't force you to do anything.

628
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,900
As long as you're happy, you can do anything.
