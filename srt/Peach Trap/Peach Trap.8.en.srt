00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,120
on purpose.

188
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,100
I won't do anything to bother you anymore.

189
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,770
I'm sorry.

190
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:20,200
Thank you for telling me the truth.

Now,

194
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,770
it's over.

[3 years later]

196
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,550
Go inside.

197
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,050
I told you
to wear clothes at home, too.

198
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,870
I refuse.

199
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:29,970
Gosh.

200
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,900
I told you not to leave toothpaste stains
on your lips around me.

201
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,600
Do you want to be kissed?

202
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,800
Gosh!

203
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,070
Come out quickly!

205
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,750
Three years ago,

206
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,970
during what I thought was
the biggest slump of my life,

207
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,220
like a miracle...

208
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,000
I met my first love.

209
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:08,720
He's a little taller than I am
and gentle—

210
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,770
my boyfriend.

211
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,020
[Thank you for the times we shared—
as sweet as a peach's fragrance.]

214
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,370
Let go of all distractions for now.

215
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,700
Just focus on your body and your opponent.

216
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,620
But, did you know?

217
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,700
Jiu-jitsu is a sport

218
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,100
you need a partner for.
