1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,810
56 minutes.

2
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,720
57 minutes.

3
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,030
58 minutes.

4
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,020
59 minutes.

5
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,390
60 minutes.

6
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,150
Hey, Yoo Doha!

7
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,590
You're an hour late.

8
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,650
You owe me 60 ice creams.

9
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,910
Hey, it's because I had to work overtime.
Cut me some slack.

10
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:18,990
Fine.

11
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,480
As if!

12
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,870
No no, we had a deal!

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,130
But how could your company

14
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,330
make a one-month rookie work overtime?

15
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,759
But work's been fun.

16
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,229
I'm a little scared of the team leader,

17
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,780
but he's quite cool.

18
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,900
Cool, my ass.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,390
You're so unemployed.

20
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,190
What do you know about work life?

21
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,780
Hey.

22
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,920
Are you looking down on the legendary
national jiu-jitsu athlete, Taek Gyeon?

23
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,610
Just with this move and I can kill you!

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,090
Code Red!

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,360
Code Red?

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,100
Don't you mean Code Blue, dummy?

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,100
No! It's Code Red between us.

28
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,530
Code Red? What does it mean?

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,540
If I say Code Red,

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,820
come to me immediately.

31
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,620
It's an alert that I'm in danger.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Why should I go to you?

33
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,470
Am I your dog?

34
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,530
Yes, you're saved as Woof in my phone.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,150
Goodness. Just answer your calls well.

36
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,829
Hey, don't touch my hair!

37
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,780
But seriously,

38
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,380
you can't even do that for me?

39
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,590
Three times.

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,310
I'll do it for you three times.

41
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,990
This is mutual, dummy!

42
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,190
I won't let you just order me around.

43
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,250
Let go of me!

44
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,380
Gosh.

45
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,040
Do you think I can't do a chokehold?

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,500
Wow, you're quite strong.

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,600
Hey, you want a piece of me?

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,220
Don't mess with me.

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,420
You want a piece of me?

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,300
Is he okay?

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,140
Where are you?

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,690
Yoo Doha!

53
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,720
Huh?

54
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,920
Are you okay?

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,260
What? What do you mean?

56
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,529
Let's talk outside.

57
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,760
Are you here for coffee?

58
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,500
Or are you Doha-hyung's guest?

59
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,020
We're closing soon.

60
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,780
If you want to order,
you have to do it now.

61
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,210
Shall I take your order?

62
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,880
No, thanks. Let's go.

63
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,090
What are you doing?

64
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,730
Uh...

65
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,240
That's all I have to say.

66
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Let's talk about the details later.

67
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,510
Your friend came for you. You should go.

68
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,850
I'll contact you again.

69
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,050
I'll buy you a meal next time.

70
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,070
Sure.

71
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,330
As for the restaurant,

72
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,520
I'll look it up and text you the location.

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,720
What are you doing? Let's go.

74
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,230
Doha-hyung.

75
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,500
Don't forget to contact me too.

76
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,630
Uh... okay.

77
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Hey, are you mad at me?

78
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,510
No.

79
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,140
You sure? I know you're angry.

80
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,200
I'm not.

81
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,540
Just forgive me this time,

82
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,880
okay? Yeah?

83
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,780
You also tricked me. Twice, even.

84
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,400
Goodness.

85
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,720
I told you not to touch my hair.

86
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,960
Oh, right.

87
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,210
Mr. Jeon just recommended me for a job.

88
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,980
That guy at the cafe? Why?

89
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,800
Wow... Why?

90
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,060
What do you mean "why"?

91
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,830
I may not look like it,

92
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,430
but I was recognized
for my competence at work.

93
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,130
Are you sure there aren't other reasons?

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,170
What other reasons?

95
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,950
Do you mean he pitied me?

96
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,020
No, that's not what I meant...

97
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,930
Are you kidding me, dude?

98
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,740
Hey, wait.

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,060
Goodness.

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,820
I told you not to touch my hair!

101
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,740
Hurry up.

102
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,040
Gyeon was a bit... weird today.

103
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,260
I'll buy you a meal next time.

104
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,340
Sure.

105
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,580
Doha-hyung,
don't forget to contact me too.

106
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,400
Uh... okay.

107
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,410
Yoo Doha.

108
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,850
Still sleeping?

109
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,500
This is driving me crazy.

110
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,240
Why is he...

111
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,060
Why doesn't he wear his clothes properly?

112
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,350
What's going on? When did you come?

113
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,790
Get up!

114
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,790
I know you were fired,
but you can't just sleep all day.

115
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,170
Oh my god, your belt...

116
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,440
What? You didn't explain it properly.

117
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,970
You just told me to put it on.

118
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,620
Look at you pouting.

119
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,800
How did you even tie your belt like that?

120
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,200
A 27-year-old
who can't put on clothes properly.

121
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,890
This is a belt.

122
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,990
Done. Let's start... with stretches.

123
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,080
Pft. You want a piece of me?

124
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,960
Don't tell me...

125
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,380
he didn't save my number?

126
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,770
Wait! Hold on! I give up!

127
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,580
Hey, isn't this too intense
for a first lesson?

128
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,240
Jiu-jitsu teaches you
real-life self defense.

129
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,420
If strange people approach you,

130
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,620
you must... take them down right away.

131
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,640
Can I learn too?

132
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,420
Oh?

133
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,020
What are you doing here?

134
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,470
Doha-hyung, are you learning jiu-jutsu?

135
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,040
Perfect. We can learn together.

136
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,340
By the way,

137
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,320
why didn't you call me?

138
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,370
Sorry, I've been a bit busy.

139
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,720
Wow, I can't believe this.

140
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,140
I've been waiting for your call.

141
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,530
I'm sorry. I'll save your number.

142
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,440
Give me your phone.

143
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,640
I'll type it for you. Save it right away.

144
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,080
My phone...

145
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,060
Hey, over there.

146
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,750
Give me a sec.

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,160
Can I sign up too?

148
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,360
I want to learn about
real-life self defense too.

149
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,460
To sign up, go over there.

150
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,580
Are you signing up?

151
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,120
Yes.

152
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,790
Because you're learning here too.

153
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,860
When do you have lessons?

154
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,300
Just whenever—

155
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,170
Then I'll come when you come—

156
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,890
Hey, hey... Here. You didn't fill this in.

157
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,130
Oh... Okay.

158
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,230
Hello, Mr. Jeon.

159
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,960
Yes.

160
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,820
Do you spar with students too?

161
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,780
Have you done sports before?

162
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,540
A little.

163
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,150
It depends on your skills.

164
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,840
If you reach the level of sparring,

165
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,900
I'll spar with you.

166
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,240
You spar with Doha-hyung, though.

167
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,730
Since we're both beginners,

168
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,020
I can spar with Doha-hyung.

169
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,980
You will receive coaching...

170
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,880
from him.

171
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,570
He'll take care of you from now on.

172
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,970
Hello, I'm Lee Hanwool.

173
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,850
I have to go.
I have to meet someone tonight.

174
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,580
Finish up with your registration.

175
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,490
Bye.

176
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,140
It should be around here.

177
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
I didn't know there was such a place.

178
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,670
Do you have an appointment?

179
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,560
Under Jeon Yeonsang.

180
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,790
It's the table inside.

181
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,190
You're early.

182
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,780
Yes.

183
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,270
The ambiance is really nice.

184
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,320
Let's order first before we talk.

185
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,020
Uh, okay.

186
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,780
I promised to treat him this time.

187
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,650
Can I order some wine?

188
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,890
Uh, yeah.

189
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,940
It's so expensive.

190
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,390
I think you should stop drinking.

191
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,589
It's so delicious I just kept drinking.

192
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,500
One last glass.

193
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,730
Okay.

194
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
You're surprisingly gentle.

195
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,410
Surprisingly?

196
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,080
You always look so serious.

197
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,980
I'm a little afraid of you.

198
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,720
You always just scold me...

199
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,280
When did I always scold you?

200
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,670
That's why I thought
I must be really bad at my job.

201
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,700
You're not bad—

202
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,760
I guess I was wrong.

203
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,440
You even personally
recommended me for a job.

204
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,280
It doesn't matter if it works out or not.
I'm already happy.

205
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,100
Because you recommended me for a job.

206
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,930
It makes me feel like I'm still useful.

207
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,920
After all, I got your recognition.

208
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,280
Thank you.

209
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,940
You're good with work.

210
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,700
Why do you keep smiling?

211
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,040
You just smiled too.

212
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,050
I didn't.

213
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,070
No, you did smile.

214
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,190
Yoo Doha.

215
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,160
You just let down your guard whenever,
don't you?

216
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,150
I need to use the restroom.

217
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,820
He's so unpredictable when he gets drunk.

218
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,320
Excuse me.

219
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,880
Yes.

220
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,040
Bill, please.

221
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,270
I said I'm fine.

222
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,730
I'll ask you one last time.
Where do you live?

223
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,760
It's close...

224
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,800
That's why I'm taking you home.

225
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,030
Where is it?

226
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,050
You just said it was the last time
you'd ask me.

227
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,700
I'm busy.

228
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,800
Tell me before I scold you.

229
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,150
O... Over there.

230
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,130
Crazy.

231
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,570
This is crazy.

232
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,810
I don't remember anything.

233
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,480
Yoo Doha!

234
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,580
Why? Is there a cockroach?

235
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,670
Then why'd you scream?

236
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,810
I...

237
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,540
I...

238
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,770
What's wrong?

239
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,190
I did it. It happened.

240
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,960
What?

241
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,310
I had my first kiss.

242
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,780
With my team leader!

243
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,790
[Peach Trap]

244
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,450
Mr. Jeon wasn't the only one there.

245
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,550
Who else was there?

246
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,380
Don't you remember anything?

247
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,640
Did you forget that
you met me that day?

248
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,770
When did you start wearing this?

249
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,060
I told you not to
tie your shoelaces like this,

250
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,260
but you never listen.

251
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,780
You two must be really close.

252
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,110
Because we're friends.

253
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,190
You keep avoiding me. Scared to lose, huh?

254
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
I won't lose to you in other aspects.

255
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,890
I don't plan to lose either.

256
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,320
Doha-hyung, you tell us.

257
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,120
Who do you want that person to be?

258
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,530
Mr. Jeon.

259
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,700
Did I do anything that I shouldn't have?
