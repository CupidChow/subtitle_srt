1
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,460
Three years ago,

2
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,540
during what I thought was
my greatest slump in life,

3
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,010
like a miracle...

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,950
I met my first love.

5
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,070
He's a bit taller than me...

6
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,560
And unbelievably affectionate.

7
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,320
Wow.

8
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,170
Did you see this email?

9
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,880
It was Yoo Doha.

10
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,810
What's going on?

11
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,970
Look at this.

12
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,450
The team leader is here.

13
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,800
What are you doing?

14
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,490
-Morning, Mr. Jeon—
-The director wants to see you.

15
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,470
Come in.

16
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,820
It really wasn't me, Director.

17
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,160
I got a tip-off that
they got it from you, Mr. Yoo Doha.

18
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,079
Do you have any other evidence?

19
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,900
Tip-offs are baseless.
Anyone can say anything.

20
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,780
Do you think I didn't look into it?

21
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,579
How can you believe that?

22
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,079
Only you and I have
this final draft proposal.

23
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,540
Are you saying I leaked it?

24
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,790
No... that's not what I meant.

25
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,060
The advertiser has this proposal too.

26
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,920
Are you saying we should
interrogate them about it?

27
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,900
If we want to keep this advertiser,

28
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,430
someone has to
take responsibility for this.

29
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,710
Do you get the picture now, Mr. Yoo Doha?

30
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,970
But I just started work here...

31
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,410
Exactly ten months ago.

32
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,530
Did Yoo Doha really leak it?

33
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,240
Isn't he the new employee?

34
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,960
I guess the rumors are true.

35
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,210
I'll pay you two months' compensation.

36
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,810
Let's wrap this up like this.

37
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,010
I'll make sure it doesn't
affect you getting a new job.

38
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,530
Doha.

39
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,930
You left your employee badge.

40
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,190
Going down.

41
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,320
The elevator door is closing.

42
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,320
Going down. The elevator door is closing.

43
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,710
Mr. Jeon.

44
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,340
Let's skip the goodbye pleasantries.

45
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,690
But still, thank you for everything.

46
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,590
Thank you for your hard work these months.

47
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,880
The elevator door is closing.

48
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,970
Didn't you say to
skip the goodbye pleasantries?

49
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,970
Today's fortune?

50
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,320
Pft. What fortune?

51
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,640
You'll meet your lucky star today.

52
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,880
Identify your lucky star
by the color green.

53
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,700
Did my lucky star
die before getting to me?

54
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,880
Who is it?

55
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,050
What did you ring the doorbell for?

56
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,190
Who else would come here other than me?

57
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,120
What were you doing?

58
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,300
I was just resting.

59
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,710
What about your dojo?

60
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,420
Today is Hanwool's shift.

61
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,230
Oh, right.

62
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,050
But...

63
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,610
something's off with you today.

64
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,020
They say my lucky color today is green.

65
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,800
Green?

66
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,070
And?

67
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,230
Do you want some soju?

68
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,240
Goodness!

69
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,200
Hey!

70
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,730
You can't hold your liquor.

71
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,630
What happened?

72
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,430
What? And you just accepted it?

73
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,090
At least I got the compensation.

74
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,820
That's not the issue right now.

75
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,150
Didn't your team say anything?

76
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,630
Nothing?

77
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,840
Yes, Mr. Jeon.

78
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,140
Sorry?

79
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,900
U-Uh, no, you didn't have to...

80
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,780
What? What did he say?

81
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,080
He told me...
to come to the farewell party.

82
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,160
What party when you fired him?

83
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,100
Yes, that's it!

84
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,780
Drink up. You've worked hard.

85
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,220
It's a pity to suddenly say goodbye.

86
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,960
Yeah.

87
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,370
Here, cheers.

88
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,120
Hey, drink with us too.

89
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,650
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

90
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,530
You've worked hard.

91
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,230
Doha.

92
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,960
Here, I'll pour you a drink too.

93
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,240
Forget everything.

94
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,810
All kinds of absurd things happen in life.

95
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,200
Cheers!

96
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,180
Everyone, bottoms up!

97
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,630
-Bottoms up!
-Cheers!

98
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,590
Mr. Jeon!

99
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,410
What the hell?

100
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,310
My farewell party is just an excuse
for them to drink.

101
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,740
Drink up.

102
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,970
Nice.

103
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,470
Doha, well, is it true?

104
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,210
Sorry?

105
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,900
Hey, come on.
Doha's not that kind of person.

106
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,820
Then would the director leak it?

107
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,950
Why'd he shoot himself in the foot?

108
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,380
Watch what you say.

109
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,800
Doha isn't that kind of person.

110
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,440
I...

111
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,720
But it doesn't make sense!

112
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
Who could've leaked it then?

113
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,270
Honestly,

114
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,470
I'm not the only one who's curious, am I?

115
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,890
That's enough.

116
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,050
Hey...

117
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,810
Are you that curious about it?

118
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,370
What's with th-that glare?

119
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,750
You're no longer in the company,
but still...

120
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,810
Doha, I'm your senior.

121
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,300
You don't care about manners a-anymore?

122
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,950
That's right.
I'm no longer in the company.

123
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,080
What seniority are you talking about?

124
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,960
Did I leak it?

125
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,130
No, I didn't! It wasn't me!

126
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,880
The company needed a fall guy...

127
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,820
so I, the pushover, was fired.

128
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,420
What farewell party is this?

129
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Why did you even call me here?

130
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,430
I can't believe you guys.

131
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,950
Good luck with your lives.

132
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,350
I'll take my leave.

133
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,700
Doha...

134
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,170
Wait.

135
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,780
That's not what I meant.

136
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,660
Gosh.

137
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,140
I thought you were just one to take it.

138
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,740
So you know how to fight back.

139
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,680
Thank you.

140
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,120
Do you always cry a lot?

141
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,370
When did I cry?

142
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,600
You were just crying.

143
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,390
And don't you remember that time?

144
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,050
You cried in the elevator too.

145
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,300
I got it. Please stop.

146
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,540
I know you're innocent.

147
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,680
Mr. Jeon.

148
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,990
Why do you trust me?

149
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,480
Because I've been watching you.

150
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,680
You were in my team.

151
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,670
Drink slowly.

152
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,940
Mr. Jeon...

153
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,510
I thought you hated me.

154
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,280
You were always cold to me
and gave me one-word responses.

155
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,450
You only talk more when you scold me.

156
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,870
I scolded you
because I had high hopes for you.

157
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,170
Finish this and go home.

158
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,720
Right, I got fired.

159
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,859
It's nice that I don't have to go to work.

160
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,510
Please show some mercy, Master.

161
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,090
You've improved a lot.

162
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,850
This is Yoo Doha. Over.

163
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,560
You just woke up?

164
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,020
Yeah, why?

165
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,580
What do you mean "why"?

166
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,760
Did you not see

167
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,960
all my calls and texts since yesterday?

168
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,120
Calls and texts?

169
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,350
Are you home?

170
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,330
Where are you?

171
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,210
Are you drunk?

172
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,540
Yoo Doha, reply!

173
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,990
Over!

174
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,720
Hey.

175
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,150
Did you black out from all the drinking?

176
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,480
Call me when you wake up.

177
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,380
Sorry, I just saw them.

178
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,110
Come exercise if you're awake.

179
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,480
Hey, my body's stuck to my bed right now.

180
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,280
Already sounding so unemployed.

181
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,130
Exercising and sweating
is the best hangover cure.

182
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,590
Well, you wouldn't understand that anyway.

183
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,360
What? Unemployed? Just you wait.

184
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,930
Wow, it's been ten years,
but he still reacts the same way.

185
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,840
Hurting me and then healing my wound?

186
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,790
Anyway, thanks.

187
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,530
I'm no longer in the company.
What seniority are you talking about?

188
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,370
No, I didn't! It wasn't me!

189
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,070
I thought you hated me.

190
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,740
You were always cold to me
and gave me one-word responses.

191
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,970
You only talk more when you scold me.

192
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,340
Hello, Mr. Jeon.

193
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,330
Yes.

194
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,930
Sorry? Today?

195
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,920
Why isn't he here yet?

196
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,470
I'm sorry.

197
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,660
I was drunk and offended you yesterday.

198
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,670
I didn't call you here to scold you.

199
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,230
Then why...

200
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,520
Are you going to stay standing?

201
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,470
Oh, right.

202
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,890
What do you want to drink?

203
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,010
Uh, no! I'll order it myself.

204
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,420
Ice latte, less ice. Am I right?

205
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,640
Today's drink is free.

206
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,490
No, you shouldn't.

207
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,140
Oh, come on, just take it.

208
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,210
Why haven't you been here for so long?

209
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,620
Thank you. I was busy...

210
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,330
This is my number.

211
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,920
I kind of missed you
when I didn't see you around.

212
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,130
Sorry?

213
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
Can we be friends?

214
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,900
Oh... Okay, I'll contact you.

215
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,660
Enjoy your drink.

216
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,980
Oh?

217
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,860
Lucky color, green.

218
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,030
Are you close to him?

219
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
I came here often when I was working.

220
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,190
He's really friendly.

221
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,240
He wasn't friendly to me.

222
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,650
Anyway, I have an offer for you.

223
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,190
What's taking him so long?

224
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,780
The number you've dialed
is not available...

225
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,780
I'll be right back.

226
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,790
Wait, I know that look of yours...

227
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,780
Pissed off mode.

228
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,150
For me?

229
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,920
Is there anyone else here I'm talking to?

230
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,410
Well, this is so sudden...

231
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,390
What I mean is...

232
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,150
If you're wondering why
I'm providing a job offer

233
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,670
to someone who was fired
for breaching company policy,

234
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,210
I don't think you leaked the proposal,

235
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,920
and I'm confident in your competence.

236
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,870
Yoo Doha!

237
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,450
[Peach Trap]

238
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,540
Young man.

239
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,340
You were framed and fired, right?

240
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,000
Sorry?

241
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,220
With work,
things will work out in the end.

242
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,050
But...

243
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,850
work isn't your
greatest concern right now.

244
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,870
What do you mean?

245
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,530
There's something else
you should worry about.

246
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,120
Heard about
the fortune of fatal attraction?

247
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,430
But I've been single all my life.

248
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,420
Exactly.

249
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,080
The peach tree of attraction
has blossomed now.

250
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:05,350
Peach blossoms and sparks flying
everywhere.

251
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,330
Do you know what flowers attract?

252
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,670
Bees... or butterflies?

253
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,000
Sure, they attract bees and butterflies,

254
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,520
but they also attract pests.

255
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,340
Be careful.

256
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,330
I'm not buying your fan.

257
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,810
It's about to be a sea of peach blossoms!

258
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,870
What a strange person.

259
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,830
It's about to be a sea of peach blossoms.
