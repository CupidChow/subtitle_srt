Last month.

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,850
I got it when I changed my phone.

A colleague like me is more reliable,
don't you think?

You're no longer colleagues.

Also, are you sure you're reliable?

Who will send him back?

Walk in the back if you don't like it.
Or just go home.

how about we drink at your place?

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,770
Yeah, Doha-hyung?

61

get awkward between us.

186
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,700
Who am I?

187
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,850
Someone who likes Yoo Doha.

188
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,900
Did someone confess to you?

189
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,400
How do you feel?

190
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,950
I'm a little scared.

191
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,850
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

192
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,420
Does it not bother Gyeon at all?

193
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
That person...

194
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,970
is you, Doha.

195
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,920
I want to try something
I've never done before.

196
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,270
Yoo Doha, I really like you.
