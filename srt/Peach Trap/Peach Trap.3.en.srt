I'm sorry.

63
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,070
Should I ask him what I did?

64
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,500
But even if I do,
it won't change anything.

65

Sure you won't regret it?

87
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,300
Of course.

88

Why do you keep dodging me?
Scared to lose?

89

117
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,120

00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,300
[Team leader, Jeon Yeonsang]

187
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,780
[Team leader, Jeon Yeonsang]

188
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,920
Mr. Yoo Doha.

189
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,270
Yes.

190
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,570
Am I doing the right thing?

191
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,120
Yes, Mr. Jeon.

192
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,620
Oh, is that so?

193
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,620
I'm sorry, Mr. Jeon.

194
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,930
You took the time
to arrange the interview for me,

195
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,200
but I didn't show up.

196
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,770
It's okay.

197
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,500
I apologize if it inconvenienced you.

198
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,320
No!

199
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,450
It's nothing like that.

200
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,930
I'm the one who should be sorry.

201
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,010
I'll really treat you to a meal next time.

202
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,600
Okay, you have to keep your promise.

203
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,750
Okay, goodbye.

204
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,900
He was looking out for me, but I...

205
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,070
Ugh.

206
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
Messed up the interview?

207
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,520
You scared me. When did you get here?

208
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,980
You're the weird one,
sighing in front of the house gate, okay?

209
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,100
What now? Did the interview not go well?

210
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,670
No, it's not that.

211
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,060
I feel bad for missing the interview
that Mr. Jeon arranged for me.

212
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,480
Do you regret it?

213
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,150
A little.

214
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,050
So it's not a lot.

215
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,800
I'm hungry.

216
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,610
Have you eaten?

217
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,750
Not yet.

218
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,070
Let's go eat.

219
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,410
You must be exhausted.

220
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,350
Here's your fried chicken.

221
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,700
Thanks.

222
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,950
It's been a long time since you came.

223
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,300
I've been busy.

224
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,970
-I want plain fried chicken.
-Welcome.

225
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's have the sweet and sour.

226
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,020
But I want the plain one.

227
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,570
Take a seat wherever you want.

228
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,600
What about half-and-half?

229
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,850
Sure, sounds good.

230
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,550
Sit.

231
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,920
Oh? Mr. Jeon.

232
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,950
This is my friend's shop.

233
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,220
I just dropped by.

234
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,480
Enjoy your meal.

235
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,510
What are you waiting for? Sit.

236
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,520
Mr. Jeon!

237
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,700
I'm sorry for letting you down.

238
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,420
I didn't make myself clear previously.

239
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
I know it's highly likely that

240
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,650
I'd pass the interview
you arranged for me.

241
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,070
But...

242
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,650
this is the company
I've dreamed of working at

243
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,880
ever since I decided
to get into advertising.

244
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,150
So even if I regret it later,

245
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,500
I thought I should
go for it at least once.

246
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,080
I'm proud of you.

247
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,800
Sorry?

248
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,200
You're way more mature

249
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,630
and more resilient
than I thought you are, Doha.

250
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,120
Well, I'm not a kid...

251
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,980
You did the right thing.

252
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,110
I guess I was worried for nothing.

253
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,250
You're just fine on your own.

254
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,100
Thank you.

255
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,600
By the way, if you're here for dinner,

256
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,100
why don't you join us?

257
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,430
It seemed like
you haven't even had a bite.

258
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,180
I don't think your friend would like that.

259
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,320
No, he's very social. Hang on.

260
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,070
No!

261
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,070
He's cool with it.

262
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,750
If you're fine with it.

263
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,900
You two must be really close.

264
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,820
We've been friends our whole lives.

265
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,700
Friends?

266
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,250
Let's go in.

267
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,650
Maybe I shouldn't have invited him.

268
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,350
Do you want some?

269
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,420
Here you are.

270
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,270
You can't have...

271
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,620
fried chicken without beer.

272
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,070
The beer is on the house. Enjoy.

273
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,820
Let's drink.

274
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,420
Cheers!

275
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,770
The girls' heads never dropped.

276
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,620
Totally just staring at his face.

277
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,320
That's right.

278
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,000
So for the second round,
we have to go... there.

279
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,850
Let's go.

280
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,420
Yeon Haram, what are you waiting for?
Come on.

281
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,700
No, I think I have something to do.

282
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,200
Huh?

283
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,620
What do you mean you think?

284
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,890
I know what I have to do now.

285
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,200
All of a sudden?

286
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,730
It's a long story. Go ahead.

287
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,150
Well, he's popular.
That's not surprising. Let's go.

288
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,200
Really?

289
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,730
-Let's follow him and join in the fun.
-No, no.

290
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,570
Doha-hyung.

291
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,400
Can I join you?

292
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,200
What?

293
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,670
I'll drink for you
so you don't get drunk, Doha-hyung.

294
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,970
Won't you two join me in a drink?

295
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,850
Just going to leave me hanging?

296
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,980
It's embarrassing.

297
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,150
When did you start wearing this watch?

298
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:45,610
