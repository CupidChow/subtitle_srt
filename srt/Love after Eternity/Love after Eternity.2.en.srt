1
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,050
Turns out,

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,770
no matter in the dragon clan

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,170
or on earth,

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,130
you two always have each other,

5
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,530
then what about me?

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,530
What does that make me?

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,770
Who are you taking to?

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,490
Dear,

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,850
it's getting late,

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,170
we should get rest.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,530
How dare you listen to what happened
to the Dragon Sovereign on earth?

12
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,930
What is this place?

13
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,690
Looks like

14
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,370
I haven't fully recovered.

15
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,530
What the hell happened here?

16
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,970
How did I spend ten years

17
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,330
with Dragon Xian.

18
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,410
How did you get up so early today?

19
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,130
I,

20
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,010
Looks like he hasn't found his memories.

21
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,050
I'd better not tell him.

22
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,050
What's wrong with Yingluo?

23
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,850
You?

24
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,970
What happened to you?

25
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,610
I, I have a stomachache,

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,690
I didn't sleep so well last night,

27
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,490
and I ate bad things yesterday.

28
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,770
No, you,

29
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,530
Ah, my stomach hurts again.

30
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,010
I need to go to the,

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,330
mission complete.

32
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,810
I can't let Dragon Xian finds out that
there's something wrong with me.

33
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,730
But,

34
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,730
if he recovered his memories too,

35
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,210
it would be so awkward.

36
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,610
Never mind,

37
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,050
I spent so many years with him anyway,

38
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,090
it's good.

39
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,090
Why haven't you sleep yet?

40
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,770
I, I just feel that

41
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,010
today is so hot,

42
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,570
why don't I sleep outside?

43
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,930
Why are you acting so strange today?

44
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,210
I,

45
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,490
it's just so hot here,

46
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,530
it's cooler in the yard.

47
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,770
You're not sick, are you?

48
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:13,850
I,

49
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,170
If you feel too hot,

50
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,330
I could sleep on the ground,

51
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,090
I can fan you.

52
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,370
She has such a big reaction,

53
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,810
does she remember all?

54
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,210
Seems that she's recovering a little slowly.

55
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,930
I can't tease her.

56
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,210
Lord celestial sovereign,

57
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,330
it's really them?

58
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,330
They're so clever,

59
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,450
hiding their memories and go on earth.

60
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,130
But unfortunately,

61
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,090
both of them has remembered all,

62
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,330
the power on them will be not hidden anymore.

63
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,970
Then, lord celestial sovereign,

64
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,570
should we

65
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,770
get them back?

66
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,570
The two of them didn't take their
primordial spirit with them.

67
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,330
We still need to push them to a dead end,

68
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,010
wait until their spirit back on their body,

69
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,970
then we can catch them.

70
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,450
We can take these to the eastern road

71
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,210
till these are finished.

72
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:31,930
Okay,

73
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,130
I'll go with you.

74
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,970
Long time no see,

75
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,130
so you've been hiding here.
﻿1

76
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,030
Tiger with wings,

77
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,510
Dragon Xian.

78
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,510
Yingluo,

79
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,230
you,

80
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,670
you remembered it all.

81
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,710
You remembered too.

82
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,390
I'm going to kill you today.

83
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,990
Be serious.

84
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,150
The primordial spirit and Qi

85
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,030
haven't recovered for both us,

86
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,390
we can't beat him.

87
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,430
I can't believe

88
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,990
a nobody in the wings clan

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,990
could make me coming to this situation.

90
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,150
No,

91
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,590
there's not only

92
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,390
the energy of the wings clan on him,

93
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,430
but the Celestial Sovereign behind him.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,310
What the hell did you say to me?

95
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,350
You're quite a good talker.

96
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,950
I said, I'm going to kill you,

97
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,110
what,

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,230
you don't recognize me?

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,150
Sikong Yuan,

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,790
so you're the one take one thousand for one question.

101
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,750
And you're the hunter in chaos.

102
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,630
You two haven't

103
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,790
recovered your memories,

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,230
what I did was to show you a path, that's all.

105
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,030
You treacherous man,

106
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,630
give back my money.

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,550
Relax,

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,710
I haven't told you that I have an after-sales service,

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,150
I'm here to save you, aren't I?

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,150
Stop talking nonsense,

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,950
give back my money.

112
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,670
It's bad,

113
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,070
I can't let them run away.

114
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,590
Keep calm,

115
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,830
there's indeed the power of Celestial Sovereign

116
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,230
on his body,

117
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,190
and we can't beat him at the moment.

118
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,110
Looks like

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,150
he traded it with the life and dignity

120
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,910
of all the people in the clan for this.

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,910
What are you still doing here?

122
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,430
Now that you two have

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,150
found your memories,

124
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,790
and you spent a lot in my place,

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,790
I'll now give you a big present.

126
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,990
Fighter the Dragon Sovereign,

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,390
now the immortal spirit has come back to your body,

128
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,950
please in position.

129
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,310
I'm finally going to be back.

130
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,070
Dragon Sovereign,

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,630
the ancestor jade of dragon
has restored its power in the pond,

132
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,110
please you should in position.

133
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,870
Our Dragon clan

134
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,630
has no intention to fight with the heaven,

135
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,190
however, you came after us over and over again.

136
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,270
They're trying to kill us all

137
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,310
with all the power they've got.

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,670
Now they won't even let Yingluo go.

139
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,390
Our dragon clan has never backed down.

140
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,150
we won't let this go

141
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,910
so simply.

142
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,110
Actually,

143
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,390
I've been meaning to tell you one thing.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,390
Do you know who I really am?

145
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,110
I've found that out long time ago.

146
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,390
I was a spirit stone existed when the world was created.

147
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,350
When the Celestial Sovereign

148
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,990
expanding the heaven clan,

149
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,470
he found out that

150
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,190
this stone was about to become a human form,

151
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,990
so he put it in the Nine-story Tower,

152
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,790
he used his own energy to speed up its transform,

153
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,990
finally,

154
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,590
this stone became his fighter,

155
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,230
that's me.

156
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,070
The stone can never die,

157
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,590
that's why

158
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,270
a thousand years ago,

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,230
when you've put in the Jade Sword,
the Celestial Sovereign recreated me.

160
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,350
No wonder

161
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,150
there's rumor that the fighter was
unstoppable around the celestial clan,

162
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,710
was the trump card of the lord sovereign,

163
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,070
and had the ancient war fighter's power.

164
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,430
The Celestial Sovereign

165
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,470
doesn't believe anything,

166
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,590
that's why he put his own thoughts

167
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,390
in the stone when it transformed,

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,870
making me his most loyal fighter.

169
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,790
I myself even don't know

170
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,110
how much bad things I've done for him

171
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,270
over these years.

172
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,430
It's not your fault,

173
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,510
he doesn't understand that everything has its power.

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,150
Don't forget,

175
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,550
over a thousand years ago, you saved me with your sword,

176
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,630
and saved the dragon clan.

177
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,230
You're never a stone,

178
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,590
just be yourself,

179
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,990
no matter it's thousand years ago

180
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,470
or now,

181
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,910
you're the one I choose,

182
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,910
I'm willing to make all the dragon clan

183
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,030
your world.

184
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,750
Today, I asked all of you here

185
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,190
because I want to discuss the matter of
dealing with Celestial Clan.

186
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,310
Everyone, please sit,

187
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,990
Yingluo is one of us,

188
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,550
everyone free to talk

189
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,990
your revenge plan.

190
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,350
Yingluo,

191
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,550
I think it's time you tell us that

192
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,950
what the hell is the Celestial Sovereign trying to do?

193
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,910
At first,

194
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,070
because there's no successor of the Celestial Sovereign,

195
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,350
and the dragon clan became stronger and stronger,

196
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,790
the dragon Xian

197
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,510
has the blood of Celestial Sovereign,

198
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,830
he is the

199
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,550
most suitable one.

200
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,790
And sending me here,

201
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,670
because they tried to
destroy the dragon clan as quick as possible,

202
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,590
forcing dragon Xian to return heaven

203
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,150
and become the next celestial sovereign.

204
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,990
Why did the celestial sovereign
trying to find his successor so earnest.

205
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,710
I don't know that,

206
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,710
but there's indeed no successor of the heaven,

207
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,150
and the young ones are not talented enough.

208
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,950
But even the heaven is weak enough,

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,430
it's still gonna be hard

210
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,430
for the dragon clan

211
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,430
to fight them.

212
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,270
That's why

213
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,390
we can't just sit here,

214
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,870
we need to contact all the power that we've got,

215
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,910
and let them help us to against the heaven.

216
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,630
The celestial sovereign,

217
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,030
dragon Xian and Yingluo,

218
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,150
how dare they bring the dragon clan together
to expand like crazy,

219
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,910
and they make friends with

220
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,150
the moon clan and the chaos clan.

221
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,830
That's right,

222
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,510
I guess they've long thought about how to deal with them.

223
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,230
To become the enemy of the celestial clan,

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,870
even the chaos who's only doing things for money

225
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,550
are now help them.

226
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,270
Dragon Xian,

227
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,710
Yingluo, it's indeed that I took you too light before.

228
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,590
Since you cherish her so much,

229
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,710
don't blame me for not being polite.

230
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,350
Lord celestial sovereign,

231
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,070
what do you want me to do?

232
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,230
Bring me back the traitor.

233
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,390
Yes.

234
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,390
Dragon Xian,

235
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,030
it's the celestial sovereign,

236
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,670
he has the sovereign's power on his body.

237
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,670
Since you're going to betray the celestial sovereign,

238
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,070
then you should

239
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,310
give back my power.

240
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,670
You've controlled me for so many years,

241
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,230
and brutalizing the dragon clan.

242
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,870
Shut up,

243
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,430
let her go.
﻿1

244
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,520
What the hell are you trying to do exactly?

245
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,600
I can make you alive,

246
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,120
I can too make you dead.

247
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,160
It's you who's trying to use me,

248
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
I shouldn't get involved

249
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,200
with you.

250
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,640
Around the four Seas and eight Wastelands,

251
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,800
I can get

252
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,280
whatever I want.

253
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,000
You egomaniac,

254
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,400
you're being ridiculous.

255
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,400
I give you your life,

256
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,840
and the supreme honor and glory of the heaven,

257
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,840
while not only you show me no gratitude,

258
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,400
but betray me.

259
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,080
Have you ever give me any other choice?

260
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,720
You clearly know that

261
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,800
I want to get my grandson's help,

262
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,600
yet you make me his enemy.

263
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,960
Why don't you think about

264
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
what you've done

265
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,240
to him,

266
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,560
to the dragon clan.

267
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,400
Since you're still so obsessive,

268
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,720
what's the use of keeping you here?

269
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
You were born in this tower,

270
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,520
now you can die in here.

271
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,040
Wait after seventy-seven forty-nine days,

272
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,240
even the spiritual stone

273
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,440
will vanish under this tower

274
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,080
and become ashes.

275
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,960
Since Dragon Xian cares about you so much,

276
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
I'd like to see

277
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I'd like to see when will he be back to save you.

278
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,440
Come, the Dragon Sovereign's breath is a bit disordered.

279
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,040
It's still no use.

280
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,240
The Dragon Sovereign,

281
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
you're too hurry,

282
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,920
he put Yingluo under the Nine-Story Tower.

283
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,080
What's that place?

284
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,800
In the ancient times,

285
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,800
there are

286
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,160
a lot of auras that can not be controlled,

287
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,920
while the tower

288
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,000
can tame them or destroy them.

289
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,800
Why did he lock Yingluo up there?

290
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,360
He knows that he can't control Yingluo,

291
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,040
so he's trying to destroy her

292
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,160
through the power of the tower.

293
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,440
I have to save her.

294
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,240
You can't go there.

295
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,080
If this is what you said,

296
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,360
it could be a trap that

297
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,800
the celestial sovereign set up.

298
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,600
So what?

299
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,800
We're running out of time,

300
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
even if it's a trap,

301
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,520
I don't want Yingluo

302
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,440
to be a tortured bait.

303
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,240
Yingluo,

304
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,760
are you in there?

305
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Yingluo,

306
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,160
can you hear me?

307
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,480
Dragon Xian,

308
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,480
go,

309
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,240
this is all a trap.

310
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,480
He's trying to torture me to death

311
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,040
to make you surrender.

312
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,120
So what?

313
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,040
I can't just stand here and watch you dead.

314
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,440
If you want to keep the dragon clan and you alive,

315
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
you should go now.

316
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,120
I won't leave you here.

317
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,520
I know what is the Nine-Story Tower,

318
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,360
even you're a spiritual stone,

319
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,800
you can't stand it.

320
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,120
If you beg the celestial sovereign

321
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,320
for me,

322
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,040
I won't forgive you

323
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,600
even I go out.

324
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,720
If you're one of the dragon clan,

325
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
you should listen to me.

326
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,600
Then from today,

327
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,160
I have nothing to do

328
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,440
with the dragon clan,

329
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,280
with you.

330
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,320
Yingluo,

331
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,720
look at me.

332
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,400
Say that again.

333
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,680
Just go,

334
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,880
and never come back.

335
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,640
If I am now in there,

336
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,960
and you're out here,

337
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,440
what would you do?

338
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,240
Still no news from Yingluo?

339
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,640
She is a fighter,

340
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,960
you know that,

341
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
she won't give in.

342
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,720
She didn't even say a word,

343
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,760
and she didn't ask help for my grandson.

344
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,960
No.

345
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,560
That's good for her.

346
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,200
With all due respect,

347
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,760
but your concern for dragon Xian and Yingluo

348
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,240
has far exceeded the concern

349
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
for the celestial clan.

350
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,040
The immortal Chilian, what did you mean by that?

351
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,080
You opened up the Nine-Story Tower to kill Yingluo,

352
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
that's just so,

353
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,480
Are you questioning my decision?

354
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,920
I dare not.

355
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,080
You should know,

356
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,560
I know what are you all thinking about,

357
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,240
I just want my untrained grandson to be back,

358
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,760
and give the responsibilities
of the celestial clan to him,

359
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,000
what's wrong with that?

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,360
But you're the lord of the celestial clan,

361
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
there are so many excellent people in the heaven,

362
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,840
why do you have to be so obsessed

363
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,360
towards one mixed with the bloodline of the three tribes

364
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
and won't give in?

365
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,840
You have some point,

366
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,600
what you mean is

367
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,640
I should choose one talent

368
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,840
around the young people.

369
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,000
I dare not to

370
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,760
influence your decision.

371
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,560
About the successor,

372
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,240
if you have no intention to make one,

373
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,680
you can still

374
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,240
rule the celestial

375
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,640
for thousand years.

376
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,640
You're right,

377
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,600
I am so upset

378
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
because I can't find

379
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
a suitable one successor.

380
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,520
You can leave now.

381
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,360
The immortal Chilian,

382
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,400
the celestial sovereign is determined

383
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,600
to make Dragon Xian his successor,

384
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,320
he's getting confused.

385
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,720
Mother,

386
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,320
why don't we think of a way

387
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,160
to increase it a bit.

388
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,040
No way,

389
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,480
I said too much today,

390
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,240
he's starting to suspect me.

391
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,960
The celestial sovereign suspects you?

392
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,120
What I've done is all for the celestial clan.

393
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,760
The sovereign killed his own kid,

394
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,560
now he has no successor,

395
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,840
it should be one suitable from the clan

396
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,800
to take up the responsibility,

397
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
but

398
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,160
he's determined to bring dragon Xian back,

399
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,400
that's so ridiculous.

400
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,360
So what should we do?

401
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,840
We don't need to afraid of the celestial sovereign.

402
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,040
All these years,

403
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,520
I've been using drugs to confuse his head,

404
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,720
and grinding his will,

405
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,520
he can't live long.

406
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,600
I will keep my mother's plan

407
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,800
to deploy in the celestial clan.

408
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,880
Blame it for the stupidity of the sovereign,

409
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,000
he pushed away all the people around him,

410
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,600
in the past, he had Yingluo,

411
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,040
and now,

412
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,160
he has no one.
﻿1

413
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:11,324
So many days have passed,

414
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:12,764
yet you still haven’t begged for mercy.

415
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:15,804
Do you want to hear me beg,

416
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,524
or do you want me

417
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,004
to beg Dragon Xian to save me?

418
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:21,164
Yingluo,

419
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,564
you’ve followed me for so many years

420
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:25,524
without making any grave mistakes.

421
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,444
I’m not completely heartless.

422
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:32,084
As long as you promise me

423
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:33,364
never to help Dragon Xian again,

424
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:34,804
I...

425
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:36,404
can spare you.

426
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:38,844
Never.

427
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,084
What on earth has Dragon Xian given you,

428
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:56,204
that you’d risk your life to protect him?

429
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:08,444
Stop.

430
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:11,484
I promised her peace in her later years,

431
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:13,684
to share the Four Seas and Eight Wastelands with me—

432
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,164
is that not enough?

433
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:26,644
Dragon Xian has taken the bait.

434
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:28,644
He’s gone to the Nine-story Tower to rescue her.

435
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,604
For us,

436
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,804
this is a great opportunity.

437
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:34,884
But didn’t you say

438
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:37,124
the Celestial Sovereign would never kill Dragon Xian?

439
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:40,604
That’s only if Dragon Xian doesn’t oppose him directly.

440
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,524
If he angers the Celestial Sovereign,

441
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:44,604
even his own daughter

442
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:46,484
wouldn’t be spared.

443
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,004
Mother has planned it all.

444
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:51,524
The Celestial Sovereign will never let Yingluo go.

445
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:53,644
When clams fight,

446
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,244
the fisherman gains.

447
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:56,604
By then,

448
00:24:56,885 --> 00:24:58,004
the entire Celestial Clan

449
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,564
will be mine for the taking.

450
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:04,604
Why are you here again?

451
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:06,604
Truly disobedient.

452
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:08,844
I told you not to come.

453
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,444
You’ve never listened to me anyway.

454
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,324
Since everyone’s here,

455
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:17,764
the show can begin.

456
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:19,404
My dear grandson,

457
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,244
let me see how long you can endure.

458
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:33,804
What are you trying to do?

459
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:35,924
If it's power you need,

460
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:37,604
I can give it to you.

461
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:40,084
I’ll inject all of my power

462
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:41,484
into Yingluo’s body,

463
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:43,204
make her expand,

464
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,764
until her body can no longer withstand it,

465
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,964
and she explodes into pieces inside the Nine-story Tower,

466
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:51,924
disappearing forever from the Four Seas and Eight Wastelands.

467
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:52,804
Let her go.

468
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:54,244
Whatever you want, I’ll give it to you.

469
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:00,484
Father, I beg you, don’t kill him.

470
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:01,524
Don’t kill him!

471
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:11,924
You really do

472
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:14,124
look like your mother.

473
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:16,204
Her eyes, her face—

474
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,644
even

475
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:20,044
her deep affection.

476
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:21,444
You’re not worthy to mention her.

477
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:23,644
You never saw her as your daughter.

478
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:26,404
What a pity—

479
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:29,884
you carry that repulsive Dragon Clan blood.

480
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,564
If not for the fact that you inherited my blood,

481
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,124
would I have let you live until now?

482
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:41,164
The Celestial Clan's army has breached the gates.

483
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:42,044
Run!

484
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:44,884
The Celestial Sovereign will never spare us.

485
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:45,884
Father, Mother—

486
00:26:45,885 --> 00:26:47,604
I want to be with you!

487
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,644
Don’t leave me behind!

488
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:51,924
Xian，

489
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,764
run!

490
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:56,764
Someday, you must restore the Dragon Clan’s glory for your father!

491
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,084
Run!

492
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:03,124
Whether it’s Mother or me,

493
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:05,724
we were just tools for your use.

494
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:06,484
How dare you!

495
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:08,084
Is this how you speak

496
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:08,644
to your elders?

497
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,164
I never saw you as an elder.

498
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:15,284
Don’t you want to

499
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,964
inherit the Four Seas and Eight Wastelands,

500
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:18,604
the strongest Celestial Clan,

501
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:21,244
and sit on the revered throne of the Celestial Sovereign?

502
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,444
You think the Celestial Clan now

503
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:25,284
is the same as the one from before?

504
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:27,404
I want no entanglements with you,

505
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,484
nor involvement in Celestial Clan affairs.

506
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,324
I only ask you to release Yingluo.

507
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:32,124
From now on,

508
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:33,044
the Dragon Clan

509
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:34,484
will have no dealings

510
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:36,284
with the Celestial Clan.

511
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:38,164
If you don’t believe me,

512
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:40,804
I’m willing to give you all the bloodline I carry

513
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:41,804
that belongs to you.

514
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,444
You think that by getting Yingluo,

515
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:47,804
a little dragon seed with Celestial Clan blood,

516
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,124
you’re worthy to contend with the Celestial Clan?

517
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,324
Have you forgotten

518
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,844
how you gained the position

519
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:56,004
of Celestial Sovereign back then?

520
00:27:57,965 --> 00:27:59,124
What do you know?

521
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,604
Back then,

522
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,700
you used your daughter,

523
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,500
in exchange for the Dragon Clan’s assistance.

524
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:05,244
But feared them too—

525
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,444
feared they'd remember you in your most disgraceful state.

526
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:08,844
So

527
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:10,604
you slaughtered them all.

528
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:12,324
Even when your daughter stepped in to protect them,

529
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:14,164
you felt no pity.

530
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:15,484
You ruined her.

531
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:15,964
Silence!

532
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,124
I gave her a chance.

533
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:21,244
She just didn’t live up to it.

534
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:31,684
Are you all right?

535
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:32,684
Yingluo...

536
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:35,684
Her body

537
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:37,444
can’t withstand such immense power

538
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,404
and the suppression of the Nine-story Tower.

539
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:40,684
Of course she’s like this.

540
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:44,084
What will it take for you to let her go?

541
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:45,164
It’s too late.

542
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:47,244
The God of War now

543
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:49,044
has only two paths.

544
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,380
One

545
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,084
Continue expanding,

546
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,604
until her body is torn apart,

547
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:58,044
reduced to ashes, gone forever.

548
00:28:58,205 --> 00:28:59,244
What’s the other path?

549
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:00,524
That is,

550
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,204
abandon the divine power of the Spirit Stone of the Heaven and Earth,

551
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:04,564
and live the rest of her days

552
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:07,524
as a worthless mortal.

553
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:09,844
Why are you so obsessed

554
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,164
with destroying her?

555
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,484
Isn’t this the fate

556
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:15,804
of a traitor?

557
00:29:16,645 --> 00:29:17,604
Besides,

558
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:20,244
her power itself is a threat.

559
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,084
She did so much for you,

560
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:23,724
yet for your own gain,

561
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,004
you kept her by your side,

562
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:26,044
used her for your purposes.

563
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:27,924
Now that she has her own will,

564
00:29:28,325 --> 00:29:29,284
you want to destroy her?

565
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,284
Without my permission,

566
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:32,644
that’s betrayal.

567
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:44,284
Yingluo,

568
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:45,524
listen to me.

569
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:47,524
Release all the power in your body.

570
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:48,644
Let it all out.

571
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:52,604
You still don’t understand her.

572
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:54,644
If she becomes powerless,

573
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:57,404
she might stay by your side for a day or two,

574
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,540
If this goes on for too long,

575
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,660
I’m afraid...

576
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,964
you may not remain as accepting

577
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:04,564
as you are now.

578
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:05,404
I am not you.

579
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:06,524
I won’t be like that.

580
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:09,164
You’re still too young.

581
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:12,324
I know

582
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:14,964
Yingluo has a third path.

583
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,084
I’m willing to make a deal with you.

584
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:19,564
Let her go.

585
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:20,964
No!

586
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,084
Dragon Xian,

587
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:23,484
don’t!

588
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,764
You truly live up to your title as the Dragon Sovereign.

589
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:30,004
Even when begging, you don’t lower your head.

590
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:32,364
What more do you want?

591
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:34,404
I am your elder.

592
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:36,644
Kneel and kowtow to me.

593
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:38,924
That’s not too much to ask, is it?
﻿1

594
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,559
I am your elder.

595
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,799
Kneel and kowtow to me.

596
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,376
That’s not too much to ask, is it?

597
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,456
Dragon Xian begs the Celestial Sovereign

598
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,136
to spare Yingluo.

599
00:31:48,177 --> 00:31:50,376
So, for Yingluo,

600
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,056
you’re willing to yield.

601
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:53,576
Celestial Sovereign,

602
00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:56,216
I hope you will let Yingluo go.

603
00:31:57,537 --> 00:31:58,576
It seems

604
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:01,816
you truly are unfit to be my heir.

605
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:03,656
You are so weak,

606
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:06,176
you cannot possibly lead the Celestial Clan.

607
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,616
As long as you release Yingluo,

608
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,016
return her to the Dragon Clan,

609
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:10,936
she’ll be powerless—

610
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:12,216
no threat to you at all.

611
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:14,416
You still don’t understand.

612
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,896
If you’re of no use to me,

613
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:18,856
and Yingluo poses no threat,

614
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:21,256
what leverage do you have to negotiate with me?

615
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:21,896
I…

616
00:32:23,537 --> 00:32:24,616
Or rather—

617
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:25,776
is there

618
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,176
anything else on you

619
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,416
that might interest me?

620
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:30,856
Does the Celestial Sovereign believe

621
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:33,856
there’s still something on me worth taking?

622
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:38,536
What if I have you submit to the Celestial Clan,

623
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:40,016
and obey its command?

624
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:50,656
I will ensure the Dragon Clan

625
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:53,816
belongs to the Celestial Clan forever.

626
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:56,096
Very good.

627
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:58,576
Then tell me, how can I trust you?

628
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:12,896
From now on,

629
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:14,856
half the power of the Dragon Clan

630
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,256
is at the disposal of the Celestial Sovereign.

631
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:31,856
You’ve protected the Dragon Clan for so many years—

632
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,496
Just for one Yingluo?

633
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:35,456
Is it really worth it?

634
00:33:37,497 --> 00:33:38,536
I promised her

635
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:40,576
I would protect her with my life.

636
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:43,616
She gave everything for our Dragon Clan—

637
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:45,296
how could I betray her?

638
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:46,936
Stubborn fool.

639
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:49,936
One more thing—

640
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,576
I made this trade with the Dragon Clan on the line,

641
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:55,456
but I don’t want Yingluo to know.

642
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:21,416
Yingluo…

643
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:33,216
You fool.

644
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,180
Don't worry.

645
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,020
From now on,

646
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,980
you will no longer be threatened by the Celestial Clan.

647
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:43,176
I’ll take you home.

648
00:34:45,457 --> 00:34:46,416
Dragon Xian,

649
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:49,296
I’m so tired.

650
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:51,136
I just want…

651
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,336
a good,

652
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:55,456
long sleep.

653
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:39,976
This time,

654
00:35:41,657 --> 00:35:42,696
it’s my turn to wait for you.

655
00:35:50,577 --> 00:35:51,776
That old man

656
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,096
actually let

657
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:54,216
Yingluo and Dragon Xian go so easily?

658
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:55,256
The Celestial Sovereign

659
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:57,336
personally unlocked the Nine-story Tower.

660
00:35:57,857 --> 00:35:58,696
The two of them

661
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:00,376
have already returned to the Dragon Clan.

662
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:02,656
As long as Yingluo and Dragon Xian remain,

663
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:04,376
the threat will never be gone.

664
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:05,856
It’s said

665
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:07,656
the Dragon Clan has submitted to the Celestial Clan.

666
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,736
The terms Dragon Xian offered…

667
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:11,056
were indeed

668
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:12,976
hard to refuse.

669
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,656
At least Yingluo is powerless now.

670
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:21,656
Dragon Xian won’t be making

671
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,016
any moves for a while.

672
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:25,336
Mother,

673
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,456
the Celestial Sovereign now has

674
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,380
no one he can rely on.

675
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:31,096
The poison in him

676
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:32,976
has already built up enough.

677
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:34,936
As soon as you give the order,

678
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:36,376
we can use the Gu toxin

679
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:37,736
to control his actions.

680
00:36:54,857 --> 00:36:55,656
Yingluo,

681
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:57,416
starting today,

682
00:36:58,457 --> 00:36:59,976
I’ll stay with you here at the Spiritual Energy Pool.

683
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:03,736
With its nourishing waters day and night,

684
00:37:05,497 --> 00:37:07,256
I believe you’ll soon wake up.

685
00:37:45,177 --> 00:37:46,696
Do you really not regret it?

686
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,256
Of course I don’t.

687
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:51,376
Because I know

688
00:37:51,977 --> 00:37:53,216
you are the one person in this world

689
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:54,816
who has treated me the best.

690
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:07,496
Yingluo, oh Yingluo…

691
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:09,576
Why are you giving up on yourself?

692
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:10,776
I’m saving you,

693
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:12,016
just like you saved me.

694
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:13,816
No reason is needed.

695
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,780
I know you're faking it.

696
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:28,416
Wake up—

697
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:30,016
wake up!

698
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:46,376
The flowers have all bloomed.

699
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:48,416
Yingluo,

700
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:50,616
why are you still not awake?

701
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,016
If you don’t wake up soon,

702
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:55,616
all the memories of the days we spent together—

703
00:38:56,977 --> 00:38:57,976
I’ll have finished painting them all.

704
00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:10,016
I don’t think so.

705
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:23,857
I don't think so.

706
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:32,817
We still have a lot of time.

707
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:34,217
Your paintings

708
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,457
will never be finished.

709
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:37,777
It's been a long time.

710
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:38,977
Dragon Xian.

711
00:39:49,658 --> 00:39:50,257
On that day,

712
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:52,337
what exactly happened inside the Nine-story Tower?

713
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:53,977
How could I

714
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:56,297
return to the Dragon Clan unharmed?

715
00:39:56,538 --> 00:39:58,017
You call that unharmed?

716
00:39:58,698 --> 00:39:59,257
You almost...

717
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:00,737
The Celestial Sovereign wanted to annihilate me.

718
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,697
But why did he suddenly change his mind?

719
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:07,937
Based on my understanding of him,

720
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:09,697
he would never let me go.

721
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:11,937
What did you exchange with him?

722
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,897
As long as you're safe now.

723
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,097
If you don't tell me,

724
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:19,857
I'll find out sooner or later.

725
00:40:20,578 --> 00:40:21,657
I don't want to owe you.

726
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:24,977
That truly hurts me.

727
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:26,857
What do you mean you don't want to owe me?

728
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:28,257
I just don't want to drag you down.

729
00:40:28,658 --> 00:40:29,497
Now,

730
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:32,057
I have no magical power at all.

731
00:40:32,378 --> 00:40:33,017
At best,

732
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,137
I'm just a mortal who can live a little longer.

733
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:35,937
Fine.

734
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:37,297
I...

735
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:39,817
Don't worry.

736
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,337
You still have me.

737
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:42,697
And the Dragon Clan.

738
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:45,337
But.

739
00:40:46,218 --> 00:40:47,817
For these three thousand years,

740
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:50,177
why does the Dragon Clan seem so decrepit?

741
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:53,697
You're right.

742
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:57,297
I did shrink the Dragon Clan's forces.

743
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:58,697
Hidden our traces,

744
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:01,457
and lurked in the human world.

745
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:03,697
At the border of the world.

746
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:09,217
Waiting for that Celestial Sovereign

747
00:41:09,578 --> 00:41:10,537
to bring about his own downfall.

748
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:13,017
He has already eliminated his crew members

749
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,217
one by one.

750
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:15,977
Naturally, someone couldn't hold back

751
00:41:16,618 --> 00:41:17,417
and would attack him.

752
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:19,617
Are you talking about

753
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,337
the immortal Chilian?

754
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:25,377
After sleeping for three thousand years,

755
00:41:26,178 --> 00:41:28,097
your mind still works quickly.

756
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:29,937
So you hid your edge,

757
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:32,697
waiting for the Celestial beings to kill each other.

758
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:35,137
If that's the case,

759
00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:37,537
does your sense of guilt lessen a bit?

760
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:41,777
It seems

761
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:44,977
the infighting within the Celestial Clan is fierce.

762
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:46,937
Hardly can someplace

763
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:49,457
in the world has such peaceful view.

764
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:52,577
No wonder you have the leisure for this.

765
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:56,377
I wonder how long

766
00:41:57,738 --> 00:41:58,577
this peace will last.

767
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:09,897
Why have you come to the Dragon Clan

768
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:11,457
to find me?

769
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:14,657
Someone heard you woke up

770
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:16,457
and urgently sent me to check on you.

771
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:18,017
Who?

772
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:22,617
The Moon Clan.

773
00:42:22,618 --> 00:42:24,057
The new Moon Sovereign,

774
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:25,697
Dongfang Ruo.

775
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:27,097
How could he

776
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:31,457
become the Moon Sovereign?

777
00:42:34,378 --> 00:42:36,057
Over the past three thousand years,

778
00:42:36,218 --> 00:42:37,697
not only has the Celestial Clan been unstable,

779
00:42:38,378 --> 00:42:39,617
the Moon Clan has also been  having a civil war.

780
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:42,817
Countless people died in open and covert struggles.

781
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:45,057
Unexpectedly, in the end,

782
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,057
the one least favored by everyone,

783
00:42:48,058 --> 00:42:48,857
Dongfang Ruo,

784
00:42:49,018 --> 00:42:50,217
took advantage of the situation

785
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:51,697
and became the Moon Sovereign.

786
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:53,537
Then what does he

787
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:55,897
want you to do here?

788
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,697
To see how you're doing.

789
00:43:00,898 --> 00:43:02,577
And want you to help the Moon Clan.

790
00:43:03,098 --> 00:43:04,537
Isn't he being ridiculous?

791
00:43:06,258 --> 00:43:07,537
Don't you know his intentions?

792
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:10,297
He wants to take you back to the Moon Clan.

793
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:11,577
What if I refuse to go?

794
00:43:11,898 --> 00:43:12,617
Does he plan

795
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:14,737
to cause trouble in the Dragon Clan?

796
00:43:16,338 --> 00:43:16,897
Yingluo.

797
00:43:17,858 --> 00:43:18,257
Dragon Sovereign!

798
00:43:18,818 --> 00:43:19,737
The Dragon Sovereign is injured.

799
00:43:20,538 --> 00:43:21,177
What?

800
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:25,217
Dragon Xian,

801
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:29,017
where are you hurt?

802
00:43:29,698 --> 00:43:30,497
I said

803
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:31,497
it's a minor injury.

804
00:43:31,938 --> 00:43:32,817
You don't need to know that.

805
00:43:33,138 --> 00:43:33,697
Are you sure

806
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:34,817
it's a minor injury?

807
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:38,817
Some spellcasters

808
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:40,177
mixed into the crowd.

809
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:42,897
To avoid mortals,

810
00:43:43,378 --> 00:43:44,377
I couldn't fend them off in time.

811
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:46,857
Who did this?

812
00:43:48,218 --> 00:43:49,457
Why are you as alarmed

813
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:50,977
as they are?

814
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:54,537
It's Dongfang Ruo.

815
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:57,537
You already knew?

816
00:43:59,098 --> 00:43:59,977
What did he want?

817
00:44:00,378 --> 00:44:01,537
Why did he attack you?

818
00:44:03,818 --> 00:44:04,817
What else could it be for?

819
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:06,297
That bastard

820
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:08,457
thought he's now the powerful Moon Sovereign

821
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:09,657
that he could demand you from me.

822
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,657
He even offered me three choices.

823
00:44:13,178 --> 00:44:14,097
What choices?

824
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:15,097
First,

825
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:18,417
let him take you away from me.

826
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:19,297
Second,

827
00:44:20,778 --> 00:44:22,537
you leave me and go to him.

828
00:44:22,778 --> 00:44:23,457
Third,

829
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:26,937
you leave the Dragon Clan and go to the Moon Clan.

830
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:28,497
This jerk

831
00:44:29,098 --> 00:44:30,337
was clearly pestering us.

832
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:32,577
So I fought with him.

833
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:35,697
That jerk

834
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:37,297
with the power of the Moon Sovereign,

835
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:38,897
can't be underestimated.

836
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:42,817
He made you suffer losses.

837
00:44:43,258 --> 00:44:44,617
He's indeed not to be trifled with.

838
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:46,817
Are you sure you're okay?

839
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:48,497
Don't worry,

840
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:49,617
I'm really fine.

841
00:45:18,058 --> 00:45:19,417
Immortal Chilian.

842
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:25,377
You're so weak.

843
00:45:26,778 --> 00:45:28,817
Don't struggle to get up.

844
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:35,897
You want to seize the Celestial Clan from me.

845
00:45:40,978 --> 00:45:42,377
Since you already know,

846
00:45:42,898 --> 00:45:44,577
there's no need to keep you alive.

847
00:45:45,178 --> 00:45:47,337
So it's been you behind this all along.

848
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:59,017
The supreme position of the Celestial Clan

849
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,297
should be replaced long ago.

850
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:05,177
The Celestial Sovereign has passed away!

851
00:46:05,418 --> 00:46:06,697
Ring the mourning bell

852
00:46:07,058 --> 00:46:09,537
to announce the world!

853
00:46:21,498 --> 00:46:22,737
The mourning bell of the Celestial Clan.

854
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:27,697
We've been waiting so long for this moment.

855
00:46:35,938 --> 00:46:37,777
All the world, hear my word!

856
00:46:41,938 --> 00:46:42,817
The Celestial Sovereign

857
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:44,537
has passed away.

858
00:46:45,258 --> 00:46:46,377
The Celestial Clan

859
00:46:46,578 --> 00:46:48,177
cannot be without a leader.

860
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:51,137
All affairs of the Celestial Clan

861
00:46:51,538 --> 00:46:53,337
will be entrusted to me.

862
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:55,137
Now...

863
00:47:01,978 --> 00:47:03,177
This old man...

864
00:47:05,418 --> 00:47:07,057
Celestial beings, hear my order.

865
00:47:07,498 --> 00:47:09,337
I've chosen my heir.

866
00:47:10,378 --> 00:47:12,137
I'll bestow the Celestial Sovereign's power

867
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,697
and the Gods' calling to govern the Celestial Clan

868
00:47:15,778 --> 00:47:18,337
upon my chosen heir.

869
00:47:19,178 --> 00:47:20,057
Dragon Xian.

870
00:47:33,658 --> 00:47:34,457
This old man.

871
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:36,577
even in death, you haunt me like a curse.

872
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:38,777
He's truly insane.

873
00:47:39,978 --> 00:47:41,057
Trouble is really coming.

874
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:42,257
Yingluo.1

875
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:47,699
Damn it!

876
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,699
The Celestial Sovereign left this move.

877
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,379
The Gods' calling and the Celestial Sovereign's power

878
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,179
are now in your hands.

879
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,659
The world

880
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,059
can't deny it, right?

881
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,059
The world.

882
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,739
That old bastard spread the news

883
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,379
just to let public opinion block us.

884
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,299
Then what should we do?

885
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,339
Should we...

886
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,539
I spent tens of millions of years to kill him.

887
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,539
I won't let all these

888
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,379
all into other's hands.

889
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,539
If Dragon Xian dies,

890
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,699
everything would start again.

891
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,939
Chi Jin.

892
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,219
You're right.

893
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,699
We dared to plotted the Celestial Sovereign.

894
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,899
There is no way

895
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,819
that we can't defeat the puny Dragon Xian.

896
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,459
What's your plan?

897
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,099
Dragon Xian.

898
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,339
What are you here for again?

899
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,899
It's not too late for me to come

900
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,259
and congratulate you, is it?

901
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,139
Although the Celestial Sovereign announced to the world

902
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,859
that you shall be the new Celestial Sovereign.

903
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,379
But the Celestial Sovereign's power and the God’s calling

904
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,059
have never been seen.

905
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,219
I'm afraid you're no better off

906
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,499
than me now, are you?

907
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,939
Are you here to laugh at me?

908
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,619
I think the Celestial Sovereign was also kind.

909
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,739
He originally wanted the world

910
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,499
to celebrate for his grandson,

911
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,899
but unexpectedly...

912
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,859
It seems that before the Celestial Sovereign died,

913
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,539
he already knew that immortal Chilian was the wirepuller.

914
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,939
He didn't want the position of Celestial Sovereign

915
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,139
to fall into the hands of others,

916
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,499
so he resorted to this last resort.

917
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,299
I don't know whether

918
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,059
he really wanted to compensate you

919
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,659
or wanted to take revenge on you.

920
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,459
Such an action could kill you.

921
00:49:59,340 --> 00:49:59,939
Clam down.

922
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,299
It's not the first time

923
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,459
you and I have been hunted for our lives.

924
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,459
Trust our luck.

925
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,419
Are you two

926
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,139
even listening to me?

927
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,379
Dragon Xian.

928
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,099
Let me be honest with you.

929
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,579
I came here this time just to

930
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,259
take Yingluo away.

931
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,259
It's too dangerous here.

932
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,219
You can't protect her here at all.

933
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,859
Then let's take a gamble.

934
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,219
Yingluo

935
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,099
doesn't need anyone's protection.

936
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,859
I wanted to wait until she was completely recovered

937
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,099
before trying.

938
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,979
I don't know if her body

939
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,499
can withstand it.

940
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,779
What do you want her to do?

941
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,539
Yingluo was originally a Spirit Stone of the Heaven and Earth.

942
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:42,899
Back then,

943
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,579
the Celestial Sovereign injected power into her,

944
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,459
so he turned her into the God of War

945
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,539
and also sealed the prehistoric power between her and the Spirit Stone.

946
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,299
Now the hope is

947
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,939
to use this Spiritual Pool Water

948
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,739
to stimulate the original power in her body.

949
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,459
This is too risky.

950
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,219
If she were in the Moon Clan,

951
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,379
even if I exhausted the power of the entire clan,

952
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,539
I would protect her comprehensively.

953
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,339
You still don't understand her.

954
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,539
I'm glad to hear that.

955
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,539
What do you mean?

956
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,899
Dragon Xian is right.

957
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,739
I don't need anyone's protection.

958
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,019
Are you sure

959
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,619
this method can work?

960
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,019
The Spiritual energy pool has nourished her primordial spirit.

961
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,619
If she can withstand its power,

962
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,339
she will definitely be able to stimulate

963
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,099
the power of the Spirit Stone in her body.

964
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:56,539
Yingluo.

965
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,779
You're gonna hurt her!

966
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,699
Hiding her

967
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,699
and making her a protected

968
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,299
and powerless person is hurting her.

969
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,139
You!

970
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,539
Yingluo.

971
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,539
How do you feel?

972
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,699
Are you okay?

973
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,499
It's all Dragon Xian's fault.

974
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,619
If you can't get better,

975
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,219
our Moon Clan

976
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,699
will protect you.

977
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,819
You won the bet.

978
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,499
Before the Celestial Sovereign took action,

979
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,739
the whole world

980
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,539
has already started attacking

981
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,699
the Dragon Clan's territory.

982
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,259
The Celestial Sovereign suddenly did this,

983
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,179
putting the Dragon Clan in the open,

984
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,699
and there are enemies

985
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,259
everywhere in the dark.

986
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,739
Even if I'm fully armed,

987
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,899
I may not be able to escape.

988
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,299
Yingluo.

989
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,219
none of us are willing to suffer losses.

990
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,339
So.

991
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,739
Have you thought about it?

992
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,179
Are you going to fight back?

993
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,099
What?

994
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,459
Do you think I and the Celestial Clan

995
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,139
will always draw a clear line?

996
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,699
I just

997
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,379
worry that this is too risky.

998
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,099
I won't let them use the Dragon Clan to threaten me.

999
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,699
If we don't resist this time,

1000
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,139
next time,

1001
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,659
what they use to threaten me

1002
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,259
will be you.

1003
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,579
You used to

1004
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,379
never care about these things.

1005
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,139
Now,

1006
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,259
you are forced by them to fight.

1007
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,579
They want to give the Celestial Clan to me,

1008
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,379
so why should I be polite?

1009
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,499
It's easy.

1010
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,779
Accept the gift.

1011
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,699
And destroy the Celestial Clan.

1012
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,539
Completely end the fight.

1013
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,739
This journey will be full of dangers.

1014
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,019
The immortal Chilian

1015
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,419
won't let you get what you want.

1016
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,979
You must be careful.

1017
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,459
Don't worry.

1018
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,379
With you waiting for me,

1019
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,419
I will definitely come back safely.

1020
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,619
We will definitely get through this.

1021
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:10,939
Thank you.

1022
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,379
Yingluo.

1023
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,179
Something is wrong, Ying...

1024
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,899
What?﻿1

1025
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,093
Bad news! Yingluo

1026
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:49,693
What's wrong?

1027
00:55:49,694 --> 00:55:51,293
I had been tasked with guarding the Dragon Sovereign from behind.

1028
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:52,413
Who would have thought that our movements were discovered

1029
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:53,373
and we were attacked by a group of people.

1030
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,053
I tried to step in and protect the Dragon Sovereign

1031
00:55:55,054 --> 00:55:56,613
But it was all a setup.

1032
00:55:57,494 --> 00:55:58,173
Where's Dragon Xian?

1033
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:00,253
The enemy took the Dragon Sovereign and vanished

1034
00:56:00,254 --> 00:56:01,213
without a trace.

1035
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:02,613
It's clear they came with a plan.

1036
00:56:02,614 --> 00:56:04,053
Outrageous!

1037
00:56:04,334 --> 00:56:04,893
Where do you go?

1038
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:06,853
I just want to know where he is now

1039
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:08,093
whether he's still alive,

1040
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:09,453
and whether he's safe.

1041
00:56:09,854 --> 00:56:10,893
Calm down, Yingluo.

1042
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:14,613
No matter the cost

1043
00:56:15,254 --> 00:56:17,013
But we don't even know where the enemy is.

1044
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,173
Go to the tribes.

1045
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:23,093
Ask quietly.

1046
00:56:23,854 --> 00:56:25,013
Find the Dragon Xian, Now.

1047
00:56:25,374 --> 00:56:26,133
It can't wait.

1048
00:56:27,654 --> 00:56:28,213
Yes

1049
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:29,973
I'll send someone to investigate right away.

1050
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:38,493
Dragon Xian

1051
00:56:39,414 --> 00:56:41,533
You promised me you'd come back safe.

1052
00:56:57,454 --> 00:56:58,893
Did you find something about Dragon Xian?

1053
00:56:59,574 --> 00:57:00,293
I guessed

1054
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:02,293
you might need some help here.

1055
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:05,093
I can pretend he's not my enemy

1056
00:57:06,094 --> 00:57:07,333
If he ends up in trouble,

1057
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:08,853
I'm guessing

1058
00:57:09,614 --> 00:57:10,653
you won't like that one bit.

1059
00:57:15,654 --> 00:57:17,093
I've asked everyone I could.

1060
00:57:17,694 --> 00:57:18,573
SiKong Yuan

1061
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:20,533
also sent out the Chaos Hunters

1062
00:57:20,534 --> 00:57:21,853
to track him down.

1063
00:57:22,574 --> 00:57:23,213
Yet

1064
00:57:23,814 --> 00:57:25,173
not a single soul could be found

1065
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:27,693
in the world.

1066
00:57:29,454 --> 00:57:30,213
Actually

1067
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,653
That's a good thing.

1068
00:57:32,334 --> 00:57:33,613
Look at it this way

1069
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:36,133
at least no one's come to you with the Dragon Xian’s head

1070
00:57:36,254 --> 00:57:37,413
asking for a ransom.

1071
00:57:39,774 --> 00:57:40,493
So

1072
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:42,693
Dragon Xian is safe.

1073
00:57:43,534 --> 00:57:45,093
But then again…

1074
00:57:45,414 --> 00:57:46,933
who benefits most from its disappearance?

1075
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:49,333
The immortal Chilian

1076
00:57:51,574 --> 00:57:52,533
I have some clues that

1077
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:53,853
might be of help to you.

1078
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:57,813
Based on the clues,

1079
00:57:58,414 --> 00:58:00,333
The force of the celestial sovereign is in the Celestial Clan

1080
00:58:00,494 --> 00:58:01,413
And Gods' calling

1081
00:58:01,814 --> 00:58:03,493
may already be in the immortal Chilian’s possession.

1082
00:58:04,374 --> 00:58:04,973
Why hasn't

1083
00:58:06,294 --> 00:58:07,013
he claimed the

1084
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,733
position directly?

1085
00:58:09,734 --> 00:58:11,133
That's the strange part.

1086
00:58:14,614 --> 00:58:15,493
Let me see.

1087
00:58:17,254 --> 00:58:18,493
Why did she capture

1088
00:58:18,774 --> 00:58:19,613
the Dragon Xian?

1089
00:58:22,214 --> 00:58:22,773
As for you,

1090
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:24,693
It's time to rest now.

1091
00:58:25,254 --> 00:58:26,493
She's wearing you down.

1092
00:58:27,014 --> 00:58:29,133
If you fall before the negotiations even begin,

1093
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:31,413
then you've already lost.

1094
00:58:35,214 --> 00:58:35,853
Don't worry.

1095
00:58:36,374 --> 00:58:37,493
When Dragon Xian returns

1096
00:58:37,934 --> 00:58:39,813
I'll face him in a fair duel.

1097
00:58:40,574 --> 00:58:41,613
I won't just walk away from this.

1098
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:03,093
This kid's got real strength

1099
00:59:03,854 --> 00:59:06,413
He's been using his inner energy to protect his heart all this time.

1100
00:59:06,414 --> 00:59:07,733
Should we increase the dosage?

1101
00:59:08,014 --> 00:59:08,813
Sure!

1102
00:59:09,694 --> 00:59:11,813
I don't believe he can hold on much longer.

1103
00:59:14,814 --> 00:59:15,653
But don't go too far.

1104
00:59:17,134 --> 00:59:18,853
We still need him alive for now.

1105
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:23,733
Mother

1106
00:59:25,614 --> 00:59:26,533
Now that he's in our hands,

1107
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:27,853
Why not just

1108
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:30,213
kill him?

1109
00:59:33,614 --> 00:59:35,813
It'll be better than dead.

1110
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,773
I want him to formally and legitimately pass

1111
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:40,333
the position of Celestial Sovereign to me.

1112
00:59:40,854 --> 00:59:42,253
We must give an account to

1113
00:59:42,814 --> 00:59:46,053
all the realms if we wish to succeed to the position.

1114
00:59:47,414 --> 00:59:48,253
These past few days,

1115
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:50,253
Yingluo has been searching relentlessly for the whereabouts of Dragon Xian.

1116
00:59:50,694 --> 00:59:52,093
She will surely bring people from the Dragon Clan

1117
00:59:52,094 --> 00:59:52,933
to rescue him.

1118
00:59:56,294 --> 00:59:57,613
In that case,

1119
00:59:57,814 --> 00:59:59,533
You go and contact Yingluo.

1120
01:00:11,854 --> 01:00:12,653
Where is Dragon Xian?

1121
01:00:13,854 --> 01:00:15,693
Do you really have to resort to such despicable methods?

1122
01:00:18,654 --> 01:00:19,613
God of War

1123
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,573
You came here to mourn the Celestial Sovereign.

1124
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:25,853
You used Dragon Xian to lure me here.

1125
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:28,253
Surely it wasn't just to mock me, was it?

1126
01:00:28,854 --> 01:00:30,333
What exactly have you done to Dragon Xian?

1127
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:32,613
Take it easy

1128
01:00:33,414 --> 01:00:35,573
After all, he is the heir to the Celestial Clan.

1129
01:00:35,854 --> 01:00:37,533
I naturally wouldn't treat him poorly.

1130
01:00:38,294 --> 01:00:38,813
Tell me

1131
01:00:39,494 --> 01:00:40,053
Your conditions

1132
01:00:40,894 --> 01:00:41,613
And purpose

1133
01:00:42,854 --> 01:00:44,533
I'm not a bad person.

1134
01:00:45,334 --> 01:00:47,133
I just wanted to test

1135
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:49,973
the willpower and endurance of the future heir

1136
01:00:49,974 --> 01:00:50,893
of the Celestial Clan.

1137
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:51,453
You

1138
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:54,733
It seems

1139
01:00:55,414 --> 01:00:57,573
he's quite enjoying the process, isn't he?

1140
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:00,413
I'm warning you

1141
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:02,013
If you dare harm Dragon Xian,

1142
01:01:02,414 --> 01:01:03,933
I will make sure you pay the price.

1143
01:01:04,734 --> 01:01:06,573
Indeed, as the rumors suggest,

1144
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:08,813
The bond between you two is genuine.

1145
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:12,173
No wonder the Celestial Sovereign could not prevail against

1146
01:01:12,174 --> 01:01:13,853
the two of you back then, no matter how hard he tried.

1147
01:01:14,454 --> 01:01:15,613
Then what role did

1148
01:01:15,974 --> 01:01:17,733
you play in all of this?

1149
01:01:19,454 --> 01:01:21,053
The immortal Chilian

1150
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:34,133
How dare you speak to me like that?

1151
01:01:34,494 --> 01:01:36,253
You're truly playing the simpleton to catch the tiger.

1152
01:01:36,974 --> 01:01:38,053
You're actually this powerful.

1153
01:01:39,694 --> 01:01:41,173
The two of you are evenly matched in strength.

1154
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:42,293
Fighting would

1155
01:01:42,734 --> 01:01:44,213
bring no benefit to anyone.

1156
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:46,333
Then what do you want?

1157
01:01:47,294 --> 01:01:48,693
If you dare lay a hand on Dragon Xian,

1158
01:01:49,174 --> 01:01:50,253
I can guarantee you

1159
01:01:50,934 --> 01:01:52,933
There's no way you'll get what you want.

1160
01:01:55,614 --> 01:01:56,733
It sounds like

1161
01:01:57,094 --> 01:01:59,893
You already know what it is I want.

1162
01:02:02,214 --> 01:02:03,133
Honestly

1163
01:02:04,174 --> 01:02:06,413
You two have stirred up chaos across the realms

1164
01:02:06,694 --> 01:02:08,653
Now that Dragon Xian has ascended as Celestial Sovereign,

1165
01:02:09,014 --> 01:02:10,413
How can I possibly sit idly by?

1166
01:02:13,214 --> 01:02:13,733
Okay

1167
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:17,173
I can negotiate terms with you.

1168
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:18,173
But

1169
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:20,453
you must let me see Dragon Xian first,

1170
01:02:20,894 --> 01:02:22,293
So I can make sure he's safe.

1171
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:28,053
You really are a tough one to deal with.

1172
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,253
You only have half an hour.

1173
01:02:45,294 --> 01:03:00,893
Dragon Xian

1174
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:06,133
It's an illusion.

1175
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:09,333
They sent you to see me.

1176
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:12,533
Are you

1177
01:03:13,054 --> 01:03:13,813
alright now?

1178
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,213
I'm fine.

1179
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,453
I can handle it.

1180
01:03:20,294 --> 01:03:21,493
I'm the toughest one

1181
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:23,093
in the realm.

1182
01:03:24,254 --> 01:03:25,293
Where...where are

1183
01:03:25,574 --> 01:03:26,493
you now?

1184
01:03:27,334 --> 01:03:28,133
Yingluo

1185
01:03:28,814 --> 01:03:29,493
Don't worry.

1186
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:32,293
They don't dare to do anything to me.

1187
01:03:33,574 --> 01:03:34,253
Take it easy.

1188
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:36,533
As long as you're waiting for me,

1189
01:03:37,574 --> 01:03:38,813
I will definitely return.

1190
01:03:39,854 --> 01:03:40,893
Is this

1191
01:03:41,414 --> 01:03:42,453
a promise?

1192
01:03:44,974 --> 01:03:46,733
Then you must promise to keep yourself safe.

1193
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:48,373
I'll find a way to

1194
01:03:48,654 --> 01:03:49,853
rescue you as soon as possible.

1195
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:51,693
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

1196
01:03:58,974 --> 01:03:59,653
How is it?

1197
01:04:00,534 --> 01:04:01,653
Is he alive?

1198
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:03,613
What does it take for you to let him go?

1199
01:04:05,214 --> 01:04:07,293
I've gotten what I want.

1200
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:08,813
He'll back

1201
01:04:09,694 --> 01:04:11,613
in three days.
﻿1

1202
01:04:29,938 --> 01:04:30,537
What did

1203
01:04:31,858 --> 01:04:33,537
they do to you?

1204
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:35,457
These are nothing but flesh wounds.

1205
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:37,577
They can't break me.

1206
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:39,497
Don't lie to me.

1207
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:42,297
They don't want to kill me.

1208
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:45,417
They want to break me.

1209
01:04:53,178 --> 01:04:55,177
I've already played out

1210
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,537
every worst-case scenario in my head

1211
01:05:01,658 --> 01:05:03,257
I can't bear to go on thinking.

1212
01:05:06,018 --> 01:05:06,817
Sorry

1213
01:05:09,178 --> 01:05:10,657
I made you worry.

1214
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:42,297
Dragon Xian

1215
01:05:42,778 --> 01:05:43,937
What's wrong?

1216
01:05:44,618 --> 01:05:45,577
Look at me, Dragon Xian.

1217
01:05:45,938 --> 01:05:46,537
Tell me

1218
01:05:46,978 --> 01:05:48,497
What did they do to you?

1219
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:51,577
Dragon Xian

1220
01:05:53,378 --> 01:05:54,057
Drug!

1221
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:54,777
Drug!

1222
01:05:54,978 --> 01:05:55,617
Give me drug!

1223
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,177
Dragon Xian

1224
01:05:56,178 --> 01:05:57,257
Calm down, Dragon Xian

1225
01:05:57,378 --> 01:05:57,937
Dragon Xian

1226
01:05:58,218 --> 01:05:59,657
Calm down!

1227
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:01,017
Dragon Xian

1228
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:03,097
Calm down, Dragon Xian!

1229
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:20,857
This must be a secret technique from the Celestial Realm.

1230
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:22,657
Do you know what it is?

1231
01:06:35,178 --> 01:06:35,737
Dragon Xian

1232
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,577
I'll be fine.

1233
01:06:45,578 --> 01:06:46,777
Jerk!

1234
01:06:47,218 --> 01:06:47,737
It seems

1235
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:49,817
Chilian deliberately led you to Dragon Xian.

1236
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:51,457
Just to make him let his guard down,

1237
01:06:52,018 --> 01:06:53,657
So the poison could seep into his vital meridians.

1238
01:06:55,138 --> 01:06:56,537
The dose was precise

1239
01:06:57,538 --> 01:06:59,017
Not enough to kill him

1240
01:06:59,138 --> 01:07:01,337
But just enough to drive him slowly into madness

1241
01:07:02,578 --> 01:07:04,137
It won't be long now

1242
01:07:04,738 --> 01:07:05,937
Another uncontrollable

1243
01:07:06,258 --> 01:07:07,457
force of madness

1244
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:08,857
is about to rise in the realm.

1245
01:07:16,938 --> 01:07:17,497
Dragon Xian

1246
01:07:18,578 --> 01:07:19,817
What's wrong, Dragon Xian?

1247
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:22,217
Sorry, it's all my fault.

1248
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,297
You must survive this, Dragon Xian.

1249
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:26,657
Dragon Xian

1250
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:29,217
Can we stop this before it gets worse?

1251
01:07:31,178 --> 01:07:32,137
Shouldn't you know more

1252
01:07:33,498 --> 01:07:34,777
about the affairs of the Celestials?

1253
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:36,937
He'll only feel more pain

1254
01:07:37,978 --> 01:07:39,177
And get worse.

1255
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:40,657
Right

1256
01:07:42,298 --> 01:07:43,577
If this keeps up…

1257
01:07:45,058 --> 01:07:46,497
His mind won't hold.

1258
01:07:47,258 --> 01:07:47,937
And eventually,

1259
01:07:49,018 --> 01:07:50,457
even his soul will

1260
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:51,817
start to unravel.

1261
01:07:52,338 --> 01:07:53,817
They want to control Dragon Xian

1262
01:07:54,258 --> 01:07:56,377
But he cannot endure the pain brought by the secret arts,

1263
01:07:57,058 --> 01:07:59,137
so he will seek help from immortal Chilian.

1264
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:03,977
Shameless!

1265
01:08:08,298 --> 01:08:10,457
Dragon Xian

1266
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:12,977
You must stay safe, Dragon Xian.

1267
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:15,537
Dragon Xian

1268
01:08:19,618 --> 01:08:20,377
Alright

1269
01:08:21,258 --> 01:08:22,177
Even though I don't have a cure,

1270
01:08:23,218 --> 01:08:24,457
The pills from the Moon Clan can

1271
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,257
help contain his soul,

1272
01:08:26,658 --> 01:08:27,617
ease his pain

1273
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:29,457
and keep his spirit from dispersing

1274
01:08:29,978 --> 01:08:31,137
into nothingness.

1275
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:34,017
Take it.

1276
01:08:49,578 --> 01:08:50,297
Dragon Xian

1277
01:08:50,818 --> 01:08:51,337
You wake up

1278
01:08:53,938 --> 01:08:54,937
From now on

1279
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:57,377
I'll stay right here with you.

1280
01:08:58,458 --> 01:08:59,617
I've known everything

1281
01:08:59,938 --> 01:09:01,017
The immortal Chilian

1282
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:02,777
used a Celestial Clan secret technique on you.

1283
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:06,057
I know you could have resisted it.

1284
01:09:06,658 --> 01:09:07,577
It's all because of me

1285
01:09:08,218 --> 01:09:09,777
I distracted you,

1286
01:09:10,418 --> 01:09:11,937
That's why the poison entered your body.

1287
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:14,537
Across the nine provinces and eight wastelands

1288
01:09:14,978 --> 01:09:15,977
You're the only one

1289
01:09:16,258 --> 01:09:17,817
who can break through

1290
01:09:18,138 --> 01:09:19,177
my defenses.

1291
01:09:20,818 --> 01:09:22,657
Are you praising me

1292
01:09:22,938 --> 01:09:23,857
or blaming me?

1293
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:27,577
Come on

1294
01:09:27,938 --> 01:09:29,577
This isn't the time for jokes.

1295
01:09:33,698 --> 01:09:34,697
This secret art

1296
01:09:34,698 --> 01:09:36,817
makes every attack more painful than the last.

1297
01:09:37,578 --> 01:09:39,777
I don't even know what pain

1298
01:09:40,138 --> 01:09:41,417
you've been through these past few days.

1299
01:09:42,258 --> 01:09:43,537
They seek to destroy me

1300
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:46,177
so that all the four Seas and eight Wastelands may witness

1301
01:09:46,978 --> 01:09:48,537
my inability to lead the Celestial Clan

1302
01:09:49,258 --> 01:09:50,097
Thus justifying their

1303
01:09:50,418 --> 01:09:52,377
claim to take it from me.

1304
01:09:55,778 --> 01:09:56,337
No

1305
01:09:57,058 --> 01:09:57,857
I'll be with you.

1306
01:09:58,618 --> 01:09:59,417
Yingluo

1307
01:10:01,658 --> 01:10:02,937
Forget the Celestials

1308
01:10:03,778 --> 01:10:05,577
I don't want the Dragons getting dragged into this too.

1309
01:10:06,778 --> 01:10:07,617
If things keep going like this,

1310
01:10:08,418 --> 01:10:10,137
They're gonna end up wiped out because of me.

1311
01:10:11,058 --> 01:10:12,057
You won't give up

1312
01:10:12,778 --> 01:10:13,417
Will you?

1313
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:16,937
First of all, the fewer people

1314
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:18,377
who know about this, the better.

1315
01:10:19,218 --> 01:10:20,657
Otherwise, the Dragon Clan will fall into chaos first.

1316
01:10:24,978 --> 01:10:25,697
Why not

1317
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:26,697
retreat to the

1318
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:27,777
realm of the dragon deep world?

1319
01:10:27,778 --> 01:10:29,857
You once said no outsiders know about it.

1320
01:10:34,058 --> 01:10:34,857
Yingluo

1321
01:10:35,738 --> 01:10:36,457
I don't know

1322
01:10:37,898 --> 01:10:39,297
if we can win this battle.

1323
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:42,217
I'll be with you.

1324
01:10:43,058 --> 01:10:43,937
You won't lose.

1325
01:10:44,818 --> 01:10:45,937
We won't lose.

1326
01:11:04,698 --> 01:11:05,417
Dragon Xian

1327
01:11:09,738 --> 01:11:10,657
You should go out.

1328
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:12,777
No. I want to stay here with you.

1329
01:11:16,698 --> 01:11:21,977
Just out

1330
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:23,817
I don't want you to see me like this.

1331
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:24,417
No

1332
01:11:24,898 --> 01:11:25,817
We promised we'd

1333
01:11:25,818 --> 01:11:28,137
face this together, Dragon Xian.

1334
01:11:29,778 --> 01:11:31,017
I don't want you to see me

1335
01:11:31,018 --> 01:11:32,177
like this.

1336
01:11:32,698 --> 01:11:33,617
Leave, please.

1337
01:11:34,258 --> 01:11:45,497
I don't want you to see me

1338
01:11:50,738 --> 01:11:51,897
Don't let me go, please.

1339
01:11:52,738 --> 01:11:54,657
I just want to be with you.

1340
01:11:55,818 --> 01:11:56,777
You'll definitely

1341
01:11:57,578 --> 01:11:59,057
overcome it.

1342
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:18,697
Listen, Dragon Xian

1343
01:12:18,938 --> 01:12:21,137
Be reality or illusion

1344
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:22,977
You must not

1345
01:12:22,978 --> 01:12:25,097
give your soul to anyone but me.
﻿1

1346
01:12:48,134 --> 01:12:49,093
Dragon Xian, listen.

1347
01:12:49,334 --> 01:12:51,533
Whether it's reality or illusion,

1348
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,373
you are never to entrust your soul

1349
01:12:53,374 --> 01:12:55,493
to anyone but me.

1350
01:13:45,614 --> 01:13:46,573
I suppose…

1351
01:13:47,334 --> 01:13:48,493
we’ve won a battle.

1352
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:50,373
That was a hard-fought war.

1353
01:13:52,214 --> 01:13:54,053
I don’t know when it will end.

1354
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:04,533
Oh no!

1355
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,693
Dragon Xian,

1356
01:14:09,414 --> 01:14:10,613
Dragon Xian, wake up!

1357
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:07,373
Lu Shui, how are you so badly hurt?

1358
01:15:07,694 --> 01:15:08,573
The Dragon Clan is in trouble.

1359
01:15:08,894 --> 01:15:10,813
It’s in chaos, almost on the brink of collapse—

1360
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:12,653
this has been going on for days.

1361
01:15:13,094 --> 01:15:14,533
We thought we could contain it,

1362
01:15:14,654 --> 01:15:15,413
but

1363
01:15:15,414 --> 01:15:17,133
the enemy knows us inside out.

1364
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:18,693
If Dragon Xian doesn’t come forward soon,

1365
01:15:18,774 --> 01:15:19,973
the Dragon Clan will fall.

1366
01:15:20,134 --> 01:15:21,453
What’s really happening?

1367
01:15:22,374 --> 01:15:23,213
It’s Yun Jing.

1368
01:15:24,094 --> 01:15:25,453
No one knows

1369
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:26,773
when he allied with the immortal Chilian from the Celestial Clan.

1370
01:15:27,134 --> 01:15:28,293
Now they’re launching a counterattack—

1371
01:15:28,294 --> 01:15:29,533
every strike hits our weak spots.

1372
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:31,893
The Dragon Clan can’t withstand it.

1373
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:33,573
Striking at this exact moment…

1374
01:15:34,534 --> 01:15:36,053
they clearly want him dead.

1375
01:15:36,534 --> 01:15:37,693
What’s wrong with him?

1376
01:15:37,774 --> 01:15:38,893
Why is he hiding here?

1377
01:15:42,934 --> 01:15:44,133
You stay and look after him.

1378
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:45,693
I’ll check on the situation outside.

1379
01:15:58,574 --> 01:15:59,453
All this time,

1380
01:16:00,134 --> 01:16:02,453
I’ve never seen Dragon Xian give his heart to anyone.

1381
01:16:03,694 --> 01:16:04,613
I used to think

1382
01:16:05,574 --> 01:16:07,893
I could be the one beside him.

1383
01:16:08,574 --> 01:16:09,453
But that…

1384
01:16:10,574 --> 01:16:12,133
was just my foolish wish.

1385
01:16:13,814 --> 01:16:14,493
Now,

1386
01:16:15,494 --> 01:16:17,173
let me do something for him.

1387
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:19,653
Even if he owes me nothing,

1388
01:16:20,894 --> 01:16:21,893
I want him to know—

1389
01:16:22,734 --> 01:16:23,653
there is someone

1390
01:16:24,654 --> 01:16:26,653
who would give her life to love him.

1391
01:16:39,454 --> 01:16:40,773
Don’t force me.

1392
01:16:42,294 --> 01:16:44,333
Get out of my way!

1393
01:16:54,654 --> 01:16:55,693
This is Dragon Xian!

1394
01:16:55,894 --> 01:16:57,333
Are you going to attack him?

1395
01:16:57,734 --> 01:16:59,093
You’re no match for me.

1396
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:00,973
Lu Shui, move!

1397
01:17:15,934 --> 01:17:16,733
Yingluo!

1398
01:17:21,214 --> 01:17:22,293
You saved me.

1399
01:17:22,694 --> 01:17:24,653
If Dragon Xian owes you another life,

1400
01:17:25,094 --> 01:17:25,653
then I…

1401
01:17:25,934 --> 01:17:27,733
will never be able to match you.

1402
01:17:28,094 --> 01:17:29,093
Go back.

1403
01:17:29,374 --> 01:17:30,453
Protect the Dragon Clan.

1404
01:17:31,534 --> 01:17:33,173
You still care about the Dragon Clan?

1405
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:34,973
Don’t you want to know

1406
01:17:35,294 --> 01:17:36,533
why I betrayed you?

1407
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:37,933
I have no time

1408
01:17:38,094 --> 01:17:39,493
for people I misjudged.

1409
01:17:39,734 --> 01:17:41,053
If you dare make a move,

1410
01:17:41,294 --> 01:17:42,333
I will kill you.

1411
01:17:42,694 --> 01:17:44,573
It was you and the Dragon Sovereign who destroyed the Dragon Clan.

1412
01:17:44,774 --> 01:17:45,733
I did nothing wrong.

1413
01:17:45,854 --> 01:17:47,493
What did Dragon Xian ever do to wrong you?

1414
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:49,093
Don’t you know—

1415
01:17:50,614 --> 01:17:53,093
to get you released from the Nine-story Tower,

1416
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,373
the Dragon Sovereign gave up half the power of the Dragon Clan?

1417
01:17:55,694 --> 01:17:57,973
Now the Celestial Clan can almost fully control the Dragon Clan.

1418
01:17:59,854 --> 01:18:01,173
Knowing the Celestial Sovereign like I do,

1419
01:18:01,574 --> 01:18:03,133
he would never let me live.

1420
01:18:03,694 --> 01:18:05,493
What did you give him in exchange?

1421
01:18:06,774 --> 01:18:08,293
As long as you’re safe, it doesn’t matter.

1422
01:18:09,254 --> 01:18:10,333
Dragon Xian would never—

1423
01:18:15,734 --> 01:18:18,893
This secret medicine suppresses the power of the Spirit Stone.

1424
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:20,653
Coat it on a sword,

1425
01:18:21,534 --> 01:18:23,133
one strike is enough.

1426
01:18:26,774 --> 01:18:27,573
Stop!

1427
01:18:37,294 --> 01:18:38,893
Look at him now—

1428
01:18:39,534 --> 01:18:40,973
he has no strength left.

1429
01:18:41,494 --> 01:18:42,933
If not for you,

1430
01:18:42,974 --> 01:18:45,093
he’d have already unified the Four Seas and Eight Wastelands.

1431
01:18:46,094 --> 01:18:47,173
Who will you choose—

1432
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:49,053
Dragon Xian,

1433
01:18:49,854 --> 01:18:50,573
or

1434
01:18:51,294 --> 01:18:52,853
that supreme being?

1435
01:19:05,934 --> 01:19:07,453
Whoever blocks my path…

1436
01:19:07,574 --> 01:19:08,773
must die.

1437
01:19:57,414 --> 01:19:58,333
Yingluo,

1438
01:19:59,014 --> 01:20:00,053
do you remember this place?

1439
01:20:10,454 --> 01:20:11,213
That day,

1440
01:20:12,054 --> 01:20:13,453
we reunited here.

1441
01:20:20,574 --> 01:20:21,373
Today,

1442
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:23,853
I’ll stay here with you.

1443
01:20:26,414 --> 01:20:28,413
Let’s leave behind this chaos together.

1444
01:20:35,534 --> 01:20:36,173
Dragon Xian!

1445
01:20:37,054 --> 01:20:38,893
The immortal Chilian is about to take control of the Celestial Clan.

1446
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:41,293
There’s chaos outside.

1447
01:20:41,894 --> 01:20:42,973
What are you doing in here?

1448
01:20:44,934 --> 01:20:45,933
Yingluo is gone.

1449
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:47,933
Life or death,

1450
01:20:48,694 --> 01:20:49,573
victory or defeat—

1451
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,093
what meaning do they hold?

1452
01:20:56,294 --> 01:20:57,293
Without her,

1453
01:20:57,894 --> 01:20:59,973
even if I rule all the Four Seas and Eight Wastelands,

1454
01:21:01,054 --> 01:21:02,053
what’s the point?
﻿1

1455
01:21:13,052 --> 01:21:13,651
Dong Fangruo!

1456
01:21:14,092 --> 01:21:14,851
What are you doing?

1457
01:21:16,052 --> 01:21:18,211
I’m exercising my final right as the Moon Sovereign.

1458
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,451
You haven’t even inherited the position of Celestial Sovereign,

1459
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:32,851
so let me

1460
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:34,251
take the spotlight this time.

1461
01:21:36,532 --> 01:21:37,771
I hereby pass the title of Moon Sovereign

1462
01:21:38,892 --> 01:21:39,891
to Yingluo,

1463
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:41,411
so that she may be revived.

1464
01:21:48,692 --> 01:21:49,211
We shall meet again

1465
01:21:50,652 --> 01:21:52,731
in our next life.

1466
01:21:55,532 --> 01:21:56,771
Dragon Xian, remember this—

1467
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,531
it was my life that gave you Yingluo.

1468
01:22:00,852 --> 01:22:01,771
You will never

1469
01:22:01,972 --> 01:22:02,931
be better than me.

1470
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:10,131
Dragon Xian,

1471
01:22:11,212 --> 01:22:12,171
it’s time

1472
01:22:12,892 --> 01:22:13,931
to end all of this.

1473
01:22:58,172 --> 01:22:59,211
This place—

1474
01:22:59,732 --> 01:23:00,731
looks familiar, doesn’t it?

1475
01:23:01,132 --> 01:23:02,171
Immortal Chilian,

1476
01:23:02,732 --> 01:23:03,931
you have no chips left

1477
01:23:03,932 --> 01:23:05,811
to stand against us.

1478
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,411
You’ve obtained the power of the Moon Sovereign?

1479
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:13,051
Dragon Xian,

1480
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:14,691
how does the secret art taste?

1481
01:23:15,492 --> 01:23:17,171
I’ve never heard a conscious person

1482
01:23:17,172 --> 01:23:18,171
describe it to me.

1483
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:19,971
Must be excruciating, right?

1484
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:22,171
If that thing were used on you,

1485
01:23:22,572 --> 01:23:23,411
you’d surely lose—

1486
01:23:23,692 --> 01:23:24,371
I guarantee it.

1487
01:23:24,812 --> 01:23:25,451
That’s right.

1488
01:23:26,092 --> 01:23:27,971
No one in the Four Seas and Eight Wastelands could withstand it.

1489
01:23:28,132 --> 01:23:29,771
That’s why I gave up

1490
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:30,971
resisting you.

1491
01:23:32,452 --> 01:23:33,131
Really?

1492
01:23:33,612 --> 01:23:34,531
You don’t look like

1493
01:23:34,852 --> 01:23:36,291
someone that generous.

1494
01:23:37,892 --> 01:23:40,051
I never had to fight for the supreme throne.

1495
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:42,091
Back then, I and he—

1496
01:23:42,652 --> 01:23:44,491
we were no different from you two.

1497
01:23:45,372 --> 01:23:46,451
But unfortunately...

1498
01:23:49,172 --> 01:23:50,131
Dragon Xian

1499
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,331
I lost.

1500
01:24:04,852 --> 01:24:06,371
But that doesn’t mean you two will win.

1501
01:24:07,372 --> 01:24:08,771
Isn’t he seeking the power of the Celestial Sovereign?

1502
01:24:09,572 --> 01:24:11,091
Now he is the Celestial Sovereign,

1503
01:24:11,372 --> 01:24:12,291
and you are the Moon Sovereign.

1504
01:24:13,012 --> 01:24:15,291
But the meridians of Heaven and Moon repel one another—

1505
01:24:15,892 --> 01:24:16,971
let’s see

1506
01:24:17,372 --> 01:24:18,971
how you deal with that.

1507
01:24:37,692 --> 01:24:40,371
Moon Sovereign and Celestial Sovereign can't be together.

1508
01:24:41,732 --> 01:24:42,971
One of you

1509
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:45,931
must make a choice.

1510
01:25:14,892 --> 01:25:15,691
Yingluo,

1511
01:25:18,052 --> 01:25:19,651
we’ve been entangled for tens of thousands of years.

1512
01:25:20,732 --> 01:25:21,571
In the first life,

1513
01:25:22,612 --> 01:25:24,291
you came under the Celestial Sovereign’s command to kill me,

1514
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:26,331
but spared me,

1515
01:25:26,772 --> 01:25:28,171
nailing me to the Jade Platform

1516
01:25:28,412 --> 01:25:29,411
for over ten thousand years.

1517
01:25:32,452 --> 01:25:33,211
In the second life,

1518
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:35,651
you were revived by the power of the Celestial Sovereign,

1519
01:25:36,892 --> 01:25:38,131
though you had lost all memories,

1520
01:25:39,812 --> 01:25:41,051
you still stayed with me

1521
01:25:41,612 --> 01:25:42,691
in the Dragon Clan.

1522
01:25:45,252 --> 01:25:46,091
In the third life,

1523
01:25:46,812 --> 01:25:48,051
we wandered the mortal realm.

1524
01:25:48,932 --> 01:25:50,531
You didn’t remember who you were,

1525
01:25:50,532 --> 01:25:51,531
but were still willing to

1526
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:53,451
waste your life for me.

1527
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:57,091
This life, we’ve overcome everything—

1528
01:25:58,172 --> 01:25:59,651
yet now must part forever.

1529
01:26:00,212 --> 01:26:00,931
Dragon Xian,

1530
01:26:02,892 --> 01:26:04,131
what are you trying to do?

1531
01:26:05,212 --> 01:26:06,651
I’m merging the bloodlines

1532
01:26:07,052 --> 01:26:07,971
of the Dragon Clan and Celestial Clan—

1533
01:26:08,932 --> 01:26:09,651
from now on,

1534
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:11,171
there shall be no Celestial Clan.

1535
01:26:12,252 --> 01:26:14,091
Think of it as my revenge

1536
01:26:14,652 --> 01:26:15,371
for my parents and people.

1537
01:26:15,972 --> 01:26:16,651
Dragon Xian,

1538
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:19,491
I won’t allow you to vanish like this.

1539
01:26:20,892 --> 01:26:22,651
We share memories of three lifetimes—

1540
01:26:23,092 --> 01:26:24,571
I’ve finally recalled them all.

1541
01:26:25,412 --> 01:26:26,251
And now you’re willing

1542
01:26:27,452 --> 01:26:28,891
to leave me just like that?

1543
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:38,051
Yingluo,

1544
01:26:39,412 --> 01:26:40,811
these tens of thousands of years of memories

1545
01:26:42,332 --> 01:26:43,291
are too heavy.

1546
01:26:46,172 --> 01:26:47,091
This time,

1547
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,060
you be the one to remember me.

1548
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,060
Is that OK?

1549
01:26:53,252 --> 01:26:55,291
No!

1550
01:26:57,172 --> 01:27:05,931
Dragon Xian!

1551
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:08,540
No!

1552
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:10,251
Let go!

1553
01:27:13,172 --> 01:27:14,020
Dragon Xian!

1554
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,420
Dragon Xian

1555
01:27:25,692 --> 01:27:27,051
I will inject your soul

1556
01:27:27,052 --> 01:27:28,851
into the Jade Sword for cultivation.

1557
01:27:29,572 --> 01:27:30,771
Ten thousand years from now,

1558
01:27:31,092 --> 01:27:32,811
you will return.

1559
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:51,451
Dragon Xian!

1560
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:53,411
No!

1561
01:27:59,492 --> 01:28:00,700
Dragon Xian!

1562
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,380
Dragon Xian!

1563
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:19,140


1564
01:28:40,172 --> 01:28:41,291
Tell me…

1565
01:28:42,212 --> 01:28:43,851
ten thousand years have passed,

1566
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:46,291
yet there’s still no sign of you.

1567
01:28:48,092 --> 01:28:48,891
Did you forget

1568
01:28:49,412 --> 01:28:50,891
your promise of three lifetimes?

1569
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:55,491
Let me tell you—

1570
01:28:56,092 --> 01:28:57,011
today

1571
01:28:57,012 --> 01:28:58,451
is the grand feast of the Chaos Clan.

1572
01:28:59,732 --> 01:29:01,331
Not only do I have to tend to the Moon Clan,

1573
01:29:01,852 --> 01:29:03,771
but also care for the Celestial Clan and Dragon Clan.

1574
01:29:04,692 --> 01:29:06,571
I’m completely swamped!

1575
01:29:10,492 --> 01:29:11,651
If only

1576
01:29:13,972 --> 01:29:16,251
you were here…

1577
01:29:17,172 --> 01:29:18,051
I could finally

1578
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:20,571
take a vacation for a thousand years,

1579
01:29:21,932 --> 01:29:22,931
maybe travel the mortal realm,

1580
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,691
visit the places we once stayed.

1581
01:29:42,492 --> 01:29:43,451
Excuse me,

1582
01:29:44,092 --> 01:29:45,291
Lady—

1583
01:29:47,092 --> 01:29:48,091
where is this place?
