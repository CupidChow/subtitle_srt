1
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,919
The weather has been fine recently.

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,519
I'd like to invite the Dragon Sovereign.

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,759
Would you come?

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,119
Since the invitation is from you.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,159
I, Dragon Xian,

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,519
won't let you down.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,839
Our Clans, the Dragon and the Celestial,

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,439
have always been enemies.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,879
Aren't you afraid of

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,599
been entangled with me?

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,639
Here.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,759
This flower blooms once every 100 years.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,119
It's connected to our Dragon bloodline.

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,719
Can I exchange it for wine?

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,479
I like it.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,599
Please.

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,839
So fragrant.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,879
This wine,

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,119
it name is Forget Worries.

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,679
Forget Worries.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,879
Yes.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,519
Forget Worries.

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,679
Wait.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,039
Something happened to the Dragon Clan!

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,919
You.

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,879
What should come

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,719
has finally come.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,279
The Celestial Sovereign has rule his clan for tens of thousands of years.

29
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,239
The Four Seas and Eight Desolations

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,599
have successively submitted to the Celestial Clan.

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,559
The only exception

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,759
is the Dragon Clan.

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,799
The increasingly powerful Dragon Clan

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,999
has not only aroused the Celestial Sovereign's alert,

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,799
but also brought about

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,559
a fatal disaster for itself.

37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,119
Yingluo, God of War, hear my order!

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,999
Kill Dragon Xian, the leader of the Dragon Clan, now!

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,959
They shall not be our concern anymore.

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,199
Yes, Sovereign.

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,759
Why is it you?

42
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,999
It is the Celestial Sovereign's command.

43
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,599
I dare not disobey.

44
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:13,971
I'm Yingluo, the God of War of the Celestial Clan.

45
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:16,531
In a great war between the Celestial and Dragon Clans,.

46
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:17,731
I turned into a spirit stone

47
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,891
and slept for ten thousand years before awakening

48
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,971
Though I lost my past memory during reborn,

49
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,011
I'm still the Celestial Sovereign's

50
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:27,931
most trusted God of War.

51
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:00,011
You're really lucky

52
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:01,011
to meet me.

53
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,451
I saved you.

54
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,011
From now on,

55
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:05,291
you're free.

56
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:08,331
Go.

57
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,091
You're free.

58
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,051
And so am I.

59
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:18,211
So it's this person

60
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:19,811
who broke into the Celestial Clan's territory.

61
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:21,411
Who are you!

62
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:26,371
Where are you going?

63
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:33,211
Speak!

64
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:34,611
The Yunsu Forest in our domain.

65
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,011
What are you doing here?

66
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:37,891
Sister, please forgive me.

67
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,811
You're so beautiful.

68
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:41,571
You're honest.

69
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,571
So confess yourself.

70
00:06:43,972 --> 00:06:45,611
Since I'm pretty and kind,

71
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:47,411
maybe I can spare you.

72
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:50,251
If you fall into the hands of immortal Chilian,

73
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:52,251
you'll be in for a hard time.

74
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,051
Sister.

75
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:54,891
You tied me too tightly.

76
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,251
I can't think.

77
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:00,171
I don't think you can escape anyway.

78
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:09,611
You.

79
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:11,171
What did you do to me!

80
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:12,411
Nothing else.

81
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:13,811
You're beautiful and dashing.

82
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,371
I just want to get close to you.

83
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:16,651
You don't mind it, right?

84
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:45,291
The Dragon Name Sword.

85
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:46,691
Where are you taking me to?

86
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:51,531
Sister, I got to go.

87
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:52,531
See you later.

88
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:53,651
Watch out.

89
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:22,891
Weird.

90
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:24,491
That person

91
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:25,731
gave me a strange feeling,

92
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:27,011
like I've met him before.

93
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,011
Who are you,

94
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:30,891
dare to provoke the Dragon Clan?

95
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,011
The Dragon Clan？

96
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:36,651
Didn't they perish

97
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:37,771
ten thousand years ago?

98
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,291
How did you manage to survive?

99
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:43,771
Take a good look.

100
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:44,971
Here.

101
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,931
The territory of the Celestial Clan!

102
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:48,771
Wherever I stand

103
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,611
is under the Dragon Clan's jurisdiction.

104
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:55,691
So arrogant.

105
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:12,171
Ouch, that hurt!

106
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:16,891
Thanks for the help.

107
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:17,811
See you another day!

108
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:20,451
Hey, sister.

109
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:21,451
Remember to miss me.

110
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:26,851
You two are a gang?

111
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,691
You can lift this sword?

112
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,451
It's just an ordinary thing.

113
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,291
What's so special about it?

114
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:50,451
This sword and I share a connection.

115
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:52,011
It's the most precious treasure of the dragon clan.

116
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:53,891
You, a Celestial being,

117
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:55,091
is not qualified to touch it!

118
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:57,251
Fine then.

119
00:09:57,252 --> 00:09:59,011
I've been needing a suitable weapon.

120
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:00,811
Don't even think about it!1

121
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:30,178
Yingluo.

122
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:32,418
Get back, now.

123
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:36,978
I'll let you off the hook today.

124
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:40,098
Who the hell are you?

125
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:53,818
Celestial Sovereign.

126
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:00,058
Took you long enough to show up.

127
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,578
You realize how much crap you've stirred up?

128
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:04,258
I don't know

129
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,298
where I went wrong.

130
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,098
So, how'd that job I gave you went on?

131
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,218
By the time I got there,

132
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,338
the guy was already gone.

133
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:20,338
Ow!

134
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,538
Can't you be a little bit more gentle?

135
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,298
You know who my mom is?

136
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,498
Listen carefully.

137
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:31,578
My mother is...

138
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:38,458
Sister!

139
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,258
Here!

140
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,658
I came to play with you again!

141
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,178
Heard your name while I was outside.

142
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:45,538
You're, uh...

143
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:46,818
Yingluo, right?

144
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:52,418
Dongfang Ruo...

145
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:54,778
This little creep

146
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,098
is from the Moon Clan.

147
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,378
Not just that—

148
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,618
he's the Moon Sovereign's youngest son.

149
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:02,698
Having affairs with Moon Clan

150
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,578
is strictly forbidden here.

151
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:05,498
You better stay away from him.

152
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:08,578
Dongfang Ruo,

153
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:12,298
The Celestial Clan and the Moon Clan have always had Inter-restriction.

154
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,258
Let's keep outta each other's business.

155
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,818
I'll take you back myself.

156
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:19,178
Please tell the Moon Sovereign

157
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,258
if any of you come sniffing around,

158
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:24,218
we won't hold back.

159
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:26,378
I know.

160
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,698
I'll tell my mother.

161
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,538
Sister.

162
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,418
Easy.

163
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:37,298
Celestial Sovereign.

164
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:38,818
I confess.

165
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:41,018
It's too early for that.

166
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,498
I have another mission for you

167
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,258
to make up for it.

168
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,378
Who is she, really?

169
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:26,378
Dragon Sovereign.

170
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:27,818
Like you said,

171
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,378
all the spies we caught

172
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:30,338
were Celestial lackeys.

173
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:31,978
We've killed them all

174
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,058
and sent the bodies back.

175
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:34,378
Good.

176
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,098
Sovereign, what's wrong?

177
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:40,658
Lu Shui.

178
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:43,738
That's impossible.

179
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:45,898
This sword woke up when you did.

180
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:47,298
You're linked.

181
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,058
Only you can touch it.

182
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:51,898
But some Celestial member

183
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,298
just picked it up.

184
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:56,858
If she can control the sword,

185
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:59,618
does that mean she can control me too?

186
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,098
You know anything

187
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:03,018
about that guy?

188
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,778
Sovereign, the Celestial Clan sent a note.

189
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,738
Heard you have an ancestor ring of the dragon clan.

190
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:32,458
An interesting masterpiece.

191
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,538
I thought I'd like that.

192
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,218
Prepare yourself.

193
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:37,418
I'm coming for it.

194
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,658
Since you're such generous,

195
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:41,298
you won't let me leave empty-handed, will you?

196
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:43,218
Yingluo...

197
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:46,058
So you're about to bring the muscle

198
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:47,058
since your sneaky stuff failed.

199
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:48,178
Dragon Sovereign.

200
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:49,698
Yingluo's the Celestial God of War.

201
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,658
We can't underestimate her.

202
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,218
I'll tell the guards

203
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,018
to tighten security.

204
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:53,938
Don't bother.

205
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:55,618
The Dragon Clan's

206
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,058
only just bouncing back

207
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:58,498
since I woke up

208
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,698
The Celestial Clan has rule the world for so long.

209
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,898
Time to find a way and take them down.

210
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,418
Do you remember Dragon Xian?

211
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:10,978
The leader of the Dragon Clan.

212
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,298
He survived big war

213
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:14,978
ten thousand years ago.

214
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:16,738
Now he's back,

215
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,978
and the Dragons are making a comeback.

216
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:23,298
They'll cause trouble for sure.

217
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,578
So you want me to kill him?

218
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,018
No.

219
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:28,338
Though he's the Dragon Sovereign,

220
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:29,938
he has my bloodline.

221
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:31,578
He's my grandson.

222
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,138
I want you to take him back

223
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,778
to take over as Celestial Sovereign.

224
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,258
Why is this place dead empty?

225
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:59,538
Did everyone bail when they heard

226
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:00,898
I was coming?

227
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,978
I don't understand.

228
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,218
With their relationships,

229
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:09,738
why bother all these troubles?

230
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:21,178
The ancestor ring of the dragon clan.

231
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,538
He's wearing the ring.

232
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:29,578
So he must be Dragon Xian.

233
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:00,938
That was close.

234
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,578
Luckily I turned invisible.

235
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:52,938
Stop digging.

236
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:54,618
There's no eggs left.

237
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,418
Show yourself.

238
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,258
That feeling...

239
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,018
It's him. That's her?1

240
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,601
So the God of War finally shows up.

241
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:29,241
It's you?

242
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:35,121
Never thought

243
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:37,241
the great God of War of the Celestial Clan

244
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:39,601
would be a thief targeting for trash.

245
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:43,521
My only target is you.

246
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:45,441
Can I take that as

247
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:46,961
you just admitted that

248
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:48,841
you're the 'trash'?

249
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,681
You came to the Dragon Clan

250
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:56,241
just for this?

251
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:01,281
I don't think so.

252
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:03,361
Actually.

253
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:06,041
I'm here on behalf of the Celestial Sovereign

254
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:07,721
to bring you back to the Celestial Clan for a cushy life.

255
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,001
What's that supposed to mean?

256
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:12,321
Don't you know

257
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,161
your relationship with the Celestial Sovereign?

258
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,801
What she said was true.

259
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:26,801
How could the Celestial Sovereign be your...

260
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:29,481
She's not lying.

261
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,921
My mother was

262
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:32,281
the Celestial Sovereign's daughter.

263
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:41,321
He didn't even spare his daughter.

264
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:42,561
Run!

265
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:45,001
He wiped out the Dragon Clan.

266
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:47,601
None of us survived.

267
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,121
Ten thousand years later, the Dragon Name Sword brought me back.

268
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:53,081
The Celestial Clan and Dragons

269
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:54,481
are sworn enemies.

270
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:57,321
I'm the only descendant of the Dragon Clan.

271
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:59,161
I'll never betray

272
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,441
the Dragon Clan's destiny.

273
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:02,401
Though I don't remember

274
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:03,921
how the Celestial Clan defeated me,

275
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:06,401
I won't let what happened before

276
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:07,801
happen again.

277
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,121
Then Yingluo is the biggest threat.

278
00:21:12,402 --> 00:21:14,081
She doesn't look that tough.

279
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,441
If the Dragon Clan attacks together,

280
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,721
maybe we can kill her.

281
00:21:19,522 --> 00:21:21,041
Once I was practicing in the forest.

282
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:22,681
I fought with her.

283
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:23,801
She's way more

284
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:26,081
powerful than you thought.

285
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:27,561
If someone like her

286
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:29,921
stands by our side,

287
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,241
the revival of our Dragon Clan

288
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:34,601
may stand a chance.

289
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,681
This is Flower elixir, the Dragon Clan's Highly toxic elixir.

290
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,041
Take it.

291
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:56,161
And we'll talk.

292
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:57,841
Is this how

293
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:00,641
the Dragon Sovereign treats guests?

294
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:01,441
No.

295
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:04,601
It's for special guest.

296
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,161
Interesting.

297
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:11,761
Treating guests with poison.

298
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:13,321
I want to partner with you.

299
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,641
I have a score to settle with the Celestial Sovereign.

300
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:17,001
I'll never go back.

301
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:18,961
But you can stay here.

302
00:22:19,682 --> 00:22:21,001
As for that old man,

303
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:22,681
I'll explain to him

304
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:24,521
that you want to stay with me.

305
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:26,201
Keeping me here

306
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:27,521
won't be that easy.

307
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,201
I'll offer you the position of

308
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:33,121
Left or Right Protector.

309
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:34,481
Protectors

310
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,921
are second only to me.

311
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:38,521
Not bad.

312
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:40,081
Cooperations

313
00:22:40,602 --> 00:22:41,801
need sincerity‌.

314
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,041
Sounds reasonable.

315
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:47,441
That could be an interesting deal.

316
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,601
My target

317
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:52,281
is just you.

318
00:22:53,442 --> 00:22:54,281
Easy enough.

319
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:57,881
Didn't expect the God of War

320
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:00,481
to have so much

321
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,401
interest in me.

322
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:12,721
What do you want to do?

323
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:16,961
Yingluo.

324
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:18,921
I know your Primordial spirit isn't here.

325
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:22,721
I have another mission for you

326
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:24,401
to make up for it.

327
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:26,481
But before that,

328
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,081
I need to take your Primordial spirit out.

329
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:32,521
To ensure your loyalty,

330
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:34,841
that old man took your Primordial spirit.

331
00:23:35,322 --> 00:23:35,881
Now

332
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:38,241
I want it in the Dragon Clan.

333
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:39,521
Reasonable.

334
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:43,601
I'll replace

335
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,441
the one there with a fake.

336
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:46,561
They won't notice

337
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,001
for a while.

338
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:54,921
Your "invitation"

339
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,441
is rude as hell.

340
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,441
You started with the trust issues.

341
00:23:58,922 --> 00:23:59,841
Doesn't the Dragon Clan

342
00:23:59,842 --> 00:24:01,201
deserve your real spirit core?

343
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,361
My physical form

344
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:06,121
has done many things.

345
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:08,721
But no one in the world

346
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,001
has seen through it.

347
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:12,721
Your sense

348
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:14,681
is sharp indeed.

349
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:16,601
After all, I fought with you.

350
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:18,561
If that were your real self,

351
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:21,601
I couldn't have bested you.

352
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:26,481
Rude.

353
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:30,721
This physical form is cuter anyway.

354
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:33,121
Too scared to show your Primordial spirit?

355
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:35,281
Are you afraid of staying alone with me

356
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:37,281
would got you killed?

357
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:48,361
We'll see

358
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:49,521
who dies first.

359
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:57,841
Interesting.

360
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:03,841
I have a sword.

361
00:25:04,282 --> 00:25:06,601
Wanna check it out, Lady Yingluo?

362
00:25:21,162 --> 00:25:22,481
It's nothing special.

363
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,041
This sword and I are bonded.

364
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,921
No one else

365
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,001
in the world

366
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:40,241
has ever wielded it.

367
00:25:41,562 --> 00:25:43,081
I do feel familiar with it.

368
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,961
After the Dragon Clan fell,

369
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:47,641
only me and this sword remained.

370
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,481
Maybe you had a link

371
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:51,601
to the Dragons ten thousand years ago.

372
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:53,401
Me?

373
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:55,641
Impossible.

374
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:10,521
I don't remember.

375
00:26:11,682 --> 00:26:13,161
I don't even remember who I am.

376
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:16,761
Maybe the Dragon Clan

377
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:19,281
is the key to unlocking your memories.

378
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:21,481
Are you saying

379
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:23,241
my destiny is

380
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:24,841
tied to the Dragon Clan?

381
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:26,041
If so.

382
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:28,401
The strongest warrior in the world

383
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:31,001
who swears loyalty to the old man,

384
00:26:31,402 --> 00:26:32,401
will Yingluo waver?

385
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:34,161
What do you mean?

386
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:36,321
I'm betting on you.

387
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:37,801
The old man

388
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:39,041
wants you.

389
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,681
And so do I.

390
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:44,521
If this is just about your competitive desire,

391
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:46,841
I'm not interested in your fight.

392
00:26:46,842 --> 00:26:47,441
No.

393
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:48,681
I'm betting that

394
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:50,601
once you get to know me,

395
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:52,881
you'll leave the old man.

396
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:55,681
The only thing valuable about me

397
00:26:56,642 --> 00:26:58,201
is my loyalty, right?

398
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:00,121
Fighting for that old man

399
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:02,241
won't bring you a good ending.

400
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,241
Serving me might be a better choice.

401
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,401
Why?

402
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:07,401
Because you're tough.

403
00:27:07,802 --> 00:27:09,321
Because you can lift the Dragon Name Sword.

404
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:10,361
Maybe

405
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,161
you're the Dragon Clan's last hope.

406
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:15,081
You don't have to answer me now.

407
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:16,961
Take you time and think about it.

408
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,361
All clans in the realm depend on

409
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,641
the mortal world for power.

410
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,761
Controlling mortal territories

411
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:33,681
equals power.

412
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:35,361
This book

413
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:38,121
maps all Dragon Clan territories on Earth.

414
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,041
Take it.

415
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:41,441
Consider it as my good faith.

416
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:45,121
Aren't you afraid I'll destroy everything?

417
00:27:45,602 --> 00:27:46,281
After all,

418
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,641
I haven't agreed to partner yet.

419
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,721
That cheap trick doesn't suit your position

420
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:52,401
as the God of War, right?

421
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,521
Yingluo.

422
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:57,921
I'll think about it.

423
00:27:58,442 --> 00:27:59,641
I'll learn more about the Dragon Clan.

424
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:09,041
If she can be mine,

425
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:10,961
maybe...

426
00:28:15,282 --> 00:28:15,921
Dragon Sovereign!

427
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:16,881
Trouble in the Market!

428
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:50,371
Dumplings.

429
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:07,411
Dragon Sovereign!

430
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,331
Trouble in the Market!

431
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:09,451
Some thugs are causing a ruckus.

432
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:11,131
We had oath to

433
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,731
not to drag the mortals into our conflicts.

434
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:14,571
But these guys are breaking the truce.

435
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:16,851
They even killed kids.

436
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:18,291
It's beyond brutal.

437
00:29:19,772 --> 00:29:20,811
Let's check it out.

438
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:21,851
Yes.

439
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:31,851
Why risk coming to me?

440
00:29:31,852 --> 00:29:32,331
How's your mission?

441
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:34,331
Did you bring Dragon Xian back

442
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:35,811
to report to the Celestial Sovereign?

443
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:38,211
Dragon Xian refused to return with me.

444
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,091
He wants me to stay in the Dragon Clan

445
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:41,811
and even offered me a Protector position.

446
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:42,811
What?

447
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:44,371
I need more time.

448
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:47,371
Dragon Xian is really hard to deal with.

449
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:48,931
Who does he think is showing him kindness?

450
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,451
It's the Celestial Sovereign!

451
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:51,411
How dare he refused?

452
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:54,571
Though they're relatives,

453
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:58,571
the hate between them is too deep.

454
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:01,371
What's Dragon Xian's game here?

455
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,651
Be careful. This smells like a trap.

456
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:05,691
But don't worry.

457
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:07,571
Maybe

458
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:09,251
it won't take you long to come back.

459
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:10,851
What does that mean?

460
00:30:11,452 --> 00:30:12,331
The Dragon Clan

461
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:14,171
recently took over more

462
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:15,691
Celestial territories in the mortal world.

463
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:17,571
immortal Chilian is raged

464
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:20,211
and decided to let them suffer.

465
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:21,971
What's her plan?

466
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:24,211
If she can't have it, she'll destroy it.

467
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:27,371
I came to warn you.

468
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,611
The Dragon Clan is in for a rough ride.

469
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:31,331
You must be careful.

470
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:55,291
Candied haws!

471
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:18,251
Great.

472
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:19,571
What a stunning painting.

473
00:31:19,572 --> 00:31:21,171
Wonder who'll get lucky to have it

474
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:22,571
and how much it'll go for.

475
00:31:23,012 --> 00:31:24,171
I bid 3 taels of silver.

476
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:27,531
25 taels!

477
00:31:27,572 --> 00:31:28,971
100 taels of gold!

478
00:31:35,332 --> 00:31:36,011
100 taels?

479
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:36,971
How about

480
00:31:37,572 --> 00:31:38,651
sell it to me?

481
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,451
100 taels of gold.

482
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:44,611
You do surprised me.

483
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:45,771
It's a charity sale.

484
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:47,731
No need to go that far.

485
00:31:48,052 --> 00:31:48,851
It's fine.

486
00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:51,051
She is rich.

487
00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:52,731
Sell it to her.

488
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:56,491
But the price is too high.

489
00:31:59,012 --> 00:31:59,931
God of War.

490
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:01,811
You sure spend

491
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,171
like a king.

492
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:05,171
You came to the Market

493
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:07,531
without using Vital Qi to protect yourself.

494
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:10,371
Do you know how many eyes are on you?

495
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:11,171
Perfect.

496
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:13,051
I'm baiting them

497
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,051
to come to me.

498
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,771
You're risking your life.

499
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:18,011
Listen.

500
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:19,371
If you run into trouble,

501
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,371
don't go alone.

502
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:21,531
This is a Celestial Clan trap.

503
00:32:30,172 --> 00:32:31,131
You're right,

504
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:33,011
but a little late.

505
00:32:36,172 --> 00:32:37,011
Who are they?

506
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:38,651
The Wing Clan.

507
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:40,291
I just don't know

508
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,571
why have some people

509
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:42,451
causing troubles

510
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:44,571
in Dragon territories lately?

511
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:46,371
You want to investigate.

512
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:47,971
But you can't just

513
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:49,211
come to mortal world unguarded.

514
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:52,651
With the God of War here, what do I need to fear?

515
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,051
Don't let them escape.

516
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:02,291
Your Clan killed so many of my brothers.

517
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:04,331
Now you fall into my hands.

518
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:05,771
The Dragon Sovereign.

519
00:33:06,492 --> 00:33:07,651
You're nothing special.

520
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:09,611
Take them to the poisonous jail!

521
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:17,851
Doesn't your Dragon Clan want to rule the world?

522
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:19,971
Now that you are here,

523
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:23,211
the Dragon Clan should face its end.

524
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:25,211
Are you here for revenge

525
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:27,171
or for justice?

526
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:30,531
I'm here to kill you.

527
00:33:30,772 --> 00:33:32,051
The Dragon and Wing Clans

528
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,571
never had any conflicts.

529
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:36,731
Why start a new feud?

530
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:38,011
New feud?

531
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:40,411
You massacred my brothers!

532
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:43,051
You must die today.

533
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:46,611
You can't even figure out your real enemy.

534
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:48,611
No wonder your brothers died.

535
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,371
What did you say?

536
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,331
Today,

537
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:55,091
I'll revenge for my brothers' lives.

538
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:57,371
Little by little.

539
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,651
Bring that woman here.

540
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,171
Since you're after me,

541
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:13,051
let her go.

542
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:16,131
You're in no position to bargain.

543
00:34:20,052 --> 00:34:20,891
Poison them.

544
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:23,131
福

545
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:24,011
This poison

546
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:26,491
is extra potent, kids.

547
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:28,451
Enjoy it slow.

548
00:34:28,772 --> 00:34:29,931
And I'll take over

549
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:31,851
the marketplace outside.

550
00:34:35,852 --> 00:34:37,171
You knew it was a trap.

551
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:39,171
Why came here to find me?

552
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:41,651
If I don't

553
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:43,931
stand with you now,

554
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:45,651
how can we partner later?

555
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:47,611
So you'll stay in the Dragon Clan?

556
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:50,451
I need to know

557
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:51,771
who I am

558
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:53,811
and my link to the Dragon Clan.

559
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:00,811
Save the talking for now.

560
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,211
The poison is getting thicker.

561
00:35:04,492 --> 00:35:05,171
No.

562
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:07,331
We must find a way to get out.

563
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,211
This poison can weaken one's Vital Qi.

564
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:10,731
We can't fight back.

565
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,731
When's your backup coming?

566
00:35:13,132 --> 00:35:13,771
Looks like

567
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,571
we're on our own.

568
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:17,251
Who gave you the courage?

569
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:19,171
Knowing that the Wing Clan had an ambush,

570
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:21,491
yet you let down your guard and walked right in it.

571
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:22,851
The Wing Clan

572
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,251
is no threat.

573
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:31,811
Dragon Xian.

574
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:33,691
Hold on.

575
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:34,611
I'll find a way our,.

576
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:40,651
Water.

577
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:41,651
That's it.

578
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,971
Dragons are born to master water.

579
00:35:43,372 --> 00:35:44,091
Maybe

580
00:35:44,372 --> 00:35:45,411
this can save you.

581
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:46,411
Let's go.

582
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:32,971
Your Qi is fading.

583
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,331
I'll transfer my Qi to you.

584
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:37,771
Don't resist.

585
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:39,691
The Qi of our Clans are mutually contradictory

586
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,211
You may die!

587
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:45,491
No time to care about that.﻿1

588
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,919
Your Qi is getting weaker.

589
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,288
I’ll transfer my Qi to you.

590
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:58,728
Don't resist.

591
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:23,540
Dragon Sovereign.

592
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,700
Dragon Sovereign.

593
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,300
Dragon Sovereign.

594
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:51,968
We caught a few of the Winged Clan’s minions.

595
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,048
But the Tiger with wings escaped.

596
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:55,048
A mere Tiger with wings is nothing to fear.

597
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,128
You had it all planned from the start.

598
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:00,208
You used your life to save me.

599
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:01,568
For now,

600
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,408
I’ll forgive you for keeping the truth from me.

601
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:04,368
You—

602
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:06,488
You schemed against me.

603
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,408
If you want to talk about scheming,

604
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:10,968
wasn’t it the Celestials

605
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:12,368
who plotted against us Dragons first?

606
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:14,328
How do you know that?

607
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,408
That old man, the Celestial Sovereign,

608
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,900
has been running wild across the realms using our Dragon Clan's name!

609
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:20,968
Lured the Tiger with wings to take revenge on me.

610
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,808
I thought the God of War was acting under the Celestial Sovereign’s orders.

611
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,808
Turns out,

612
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:27,728
You are not so obedient after all.

613
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:29,128
I—

614
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:32,528
I’ll leave this to you.

615
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:34,448
I’m going back to bathe and change.

616
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,208
You’re not hurt, are you?

617
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:51,008
Those bastards from the Winged Clan

618
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:52,368
have no idea how to hold back.

619
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:53,928
Is Dragon Xian okay?

620
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:56,288
If such a small wound counted as serious,

621
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:57,768
he would’ve died a hundred times already.

622
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:01,928
Your Qi is unstable—

623
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:03,448
You don't look too well.

624
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:04,728
That—

625
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,368
That’s because I saved Dragon Xian.

626
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:07,528
Don’t be foolish.

627
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,448
What does Dragon Xian’s life have to do with you?

628
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:11,568
If Dragon Xian dies,

629
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:14,168
do you think the Celestial Sovereign will spare me?

630
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:16,568
Even so, you can’t risk your own life to save him.

631
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:21,608
The immortal Chilian orchestrated this,

632
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:23,768
making the Winged Clan hate the Dragons.

633
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,808
Dragon Xian is also my mission.

634
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:28,768
I knew it would be dangerous for him.

635
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,608
But how could I let him walk into the lion’s den alone?

636
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,208
But you, Yingluo,

637
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:35,128
you’ve always solved problems with your fists.

638
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:37,048
Look at you now.

639
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,008
How did you become like this?

640
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:42,528
Yu Jing,

641
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,608
I’ve decided to take a risk.

642
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:46,768
I’m planning to stay with the Dragon Clan.

643
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:48,768
You’re going to defy the Celestial Sovereign’s decree?

644
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:50,968
I just want to block his control—temporarily.

645
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:52,528
What do you mean by that?

646
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,008
I just want

647
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,248
to get to know Dragon Xian again,

648
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,168
and get to know myself again.

649
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:07,488
To figure out

650
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:09,408
who I really am.

651
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,248
That idea is far too dangerous.

652
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:14,568
If I don’t truly let down my guard,

653
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:16,648
how can Dragon Xian trust me?

654
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:17,688
How can I

655
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:20,128
find out everything I want to know?

656
00:40:26,649 --> 00:40:27,848
You're recovering quite well.

657
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:29,248
Tough, as expected.

658
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:32,168
Had I known, I wouldn’t have saved you that day.

659
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:36,008
The Dragon Clan’s Protector Assembly is in a few days.

660
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:37,848
Be sure to attend.

661
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:40,288
What are you planning now?

662
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,968
I heard you risked your life for Dragon Xian in the poison prison.

663
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:46,928
You’ve really changed my opinion of you.

664
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:48,568
Are you alright?

665
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:50,048
Nothing serious.

666
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:56,048
This is a Mystique of the Dragon Clan.

667
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,968
You can study and learn it more.

668
00:40:58,609 --> 00:40:59,488
Don’t overthink it.

669
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:00,848
It’s my thank-you gift,

670
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:02,848
and also a condition of our cooperation.

671
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:08,008
Why—

672
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:10,208
Have you suddenly dropped all your defenses?

673
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:19,648
After all,

674
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:22,808
Now my body

675
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:25,728
Carries your Qi too.

676
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:09,608
Seems like you’ve become familiar with the Dragon Clan.

677
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,248
I’m curious—

678
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,688
Why did you say you’re sworn enemies with the Celestial Sovereign?

679
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:23,848
Do you know

680
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:26,088
the Dragon Clan has a unique technique—

681
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:27,848
The Finish Touch of the Dragon.

682
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:34,008
I’m curious, too.

683
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:35,648
The God of War of years past—

684
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:39,328
what was her true identity?

685
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,208
This technique

686
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:55,248
lets the sword wielder peer into the past.

687
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:58,048
If you want to know your connection to the Dragon Clan,

688
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:01,728
you may as well give it a try.

689
00:43:54,329 --> 00:43:55,368
What exactly did you see?

690
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:17,528
Dragon Xian.

691
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:51,888
Yingluo.
﻿1

692
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,359
Why did Yingluo disrupt the Winged Clan’s affairs?

693
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,559
Celestial Sovereign, please quell your anger.

694
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,839
The God of War would never dare betray you.

695
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,439
What is she doing?

696
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,519
Everything—

697
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,799
Everything is to gain Dragon Xian’s trust

698
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,439
to better complete the mission.

699
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,039
Bring her back.

700
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,639
I will question her myself.

701
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,799
You scared me to death.

702
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,559
Your Qi is extremely chaotic.

703
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,159
What exactly did you see?

704
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,519
I...

705
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,839
I think I saw

706
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,959
the fall of the Dragon Clan,

707
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,119
and I saw—

708
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,839
you being pierced by a sword.

709
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,839
That’s all in the past.

710
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,159
Look at me now—

711
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,159
I’m just fine, aren’t I?

712
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,799
It must have hurt terribly.

713
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,420
It was that sword that killed me.

714
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,340
And also that sword—

715
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,340
remade me.

716
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,020
I was wondering...

717
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,860
What kind of feelings

718
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,079
did the swordbearer hold that day,

719
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,159
to destroy me,

720
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,359
yet also grant me hope?

721
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,439
You don’t know who that person was?

722
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,199
No idea.

723
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,719
I only know—

724
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,039
Ten thousand years ago, it was the Celestial Clan that sought to wipe out my Dragon Clan.

725
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,519
Before that,

726
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,359
I did many unclear and confused things.

727
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,679
If this really is

728
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,879
the Celestial Sovereign’s scheme,

729
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,599
sending you back

730
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,559
to serve your enemy,

731
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,079
then I will never allow it to continue.

732
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,439
They’ve summoned me to return.

733
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,879
I cannot defy it.

734
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,079
These matters—

735
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,239
I will question the Celestial Sovereign myself.

736
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,239
Do you believe me?

737
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,639
I’ll wait for your return.

738
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,359
You truly suspect Yingluo?

739
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,319
If you kill her,

740
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,479
it would also be a loss for the Celestial Clan.

741
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,439
Yingluo has willingly fallen,

742
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,959
colluding with the rebellious Dragon Clan.

743
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,359
This defies the order.

744
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,679
If we don’t deal with it in time,

745
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,479
she will surely become

746
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,399
a calamity to the four Seas and eight Wastelands.

747
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,439
Celestial Sovereign!

748
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,039
So this is your doing.

749
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,159
Do you truly not know—

750
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,319
the Winged Clan is just a tool to harass the Dragons?

751
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,799
Calm yourself, my lord.

752
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,119
You are one of the Celestial Clan’s

753
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,599
strongest forces,

754
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,119
and the God of War I trust the most.

755
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,879
I sent you to bring back Dragon Xian,

756
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,959
not to aid the Dragons.

757
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:02,879
Celestial Sovereign,

758
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,959
Dragon Xian is no ordinary foe—

759
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,639
This I am well aware of.

760
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,519
Give me a bit more time.

761
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,559
At the very least,

762
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,599
Dragon Xian has agreed

763
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,759
to let me take the position of Protector.

764
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,359
He’s allowing you

765
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,919
to meddle in Dragon Clan internal matters.

766
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,519
Then perhaps he still finds me useful.

767
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,079
I came today to ask you one thing:

768
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,719
Who am I, really?

769
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,279
Why, ten thousand years ago,

770
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,079
did you annihilate the Dragon Clan,

771
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,039
yet now wish for Dragon Xian

772
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,079
to inherit the Celestial Sovereign’s position?

773
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,999
How dare you!

774
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,079
Are you questioning me?

775
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,359
What else do you wish to know?

776
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,439
Who was it back then

777
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,759
that pinned Dragon Xian on the Jade Platform?

778
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,959
What is that sword’s connection to me?

779
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,479
Was it the Dragons who were arrogant,

780
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,279
or the Celestials who were rotten?

781
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,439
You want to know who killed Dragon Xian ten thousand years ago?

782
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,559
Then I shall tell you.

783
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,159
Why is the sky raining fire?

784
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,479
Could Yingluo be in danger?

785
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,239
Dragon Clan bloodline commands—

786
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,279
Everyone,

787
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,039
form ranks and prepare for battle!

788
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,199
Yingluo—

789
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,759
You're back.

790
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,919
Weren’t you curious

791
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,439
why I can wield the Jade Sword?

792
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,420
Because

793
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,839
It was mine to begin with.

794
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,079
Your life—

795
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,879
is also mine.

796
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,359
This wine is called “Forget Worries.”

797
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,319
Dragon Xian—

798
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,639
I’m sorry.

799
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,039
I couldn’t stop the Celestial Sovereign,

800
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,799
nor disobey his command.

801
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,359
Let me take you away.

802
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,399
He won’t let me go.

803
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,879
If I want to save you,

804
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,519
there’s only one way.

805
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,559
I’ll use all of my power

806
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,399
to seal you within the Jade Sword.

807
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,039
Ten thousand years from now,

808
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,879
this sword will bring you back to life.

809
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,239
Ten thousand years later,

810
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,119
I’ll be waiting for your return.

811
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,599
So that’s how it is.

812
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,079
You remembered everything.

813
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,959
You know it all now.

814
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,399
So

815
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,879
the one who killed me ten thousand years ago,

816
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,319
destroyed me,

817
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,439
and gave me hope.

818
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,959
Dragon Xian.

819
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,159
Yingluo.

820
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,799
You’re awake.

821
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,439
Since you’re awake,

822
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,759
I will return the sword to you.

823
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,380
What happened?

824
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:17,900
You’re not hurt?

825
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,159
If you want to know—

826
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,919
agree to one thing first.

827
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,639
What is it?

828
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,919
Stay in the Dragon Clan.

829
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,519
Help me.

830
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,839
Build up the Dragon Clan.

831
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,719
That’s what you owe me.

832
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,839
I saved you back then!

833
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,719
I promise you—

834
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,239
I will use my life

835
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,159
to protect you.

836
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,799
Besides that,

837
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,999
whatever power I have in the Dragon Clan,

838
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,199
you will have the same.

839
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,799
You really dare make demands.

840
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,639
You have one incense stick’s time to consider.

841
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:53,999
If you agree,

842
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,639
I’ll tell you everything.

843
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,599
I agree.

844
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,319
Speak.
﻿1

845
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,931
I trusted her too much after all.

846
00:54:26,532 --> 00:54:27,931
Yingluo has always been loyal to you.

847
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:29,131
Maybe...

848
00:54:29,412 --> 00:54:30,651
something dangerous happened.

849
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:32,771
Don’t you know how strong she is?

850
00:54:33,972 --> 00:54:36,731
Even if she faced a war across the four Seas and eight Wastelands alone,

851
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,780
she’d still come back alive.

852
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,540
Celestial Sovereign, calm your wrath.

853
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:41,971
Don’t forget Yingluo’s identity.

854
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:44,331
She and Dragon Xian must not be allowed to join forces.

855
00:54:45,132 --> 00:54:45,891
Why not

856
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:47,171
bring her back first,

857
00:54:47,812 --> 00:54:48,811
then make plans?

858
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:00,731
This Ancestor Jade of Dragon

859
00:55:00,852 --> 00:55:02,371
has been connected to me since birth.

860
00:55:02,772 --> 00:55:04,131
It represents the power of the Dragon Clan—

861
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:06,331
it grants control over all Dragon affairs.

862
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:08,691
Now,

863
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,131
I’m splitting it in two.

864
00:55:10,612 --> 00:55:11,491
I’ll give you the other half.

865
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:15,731
Take it.

866
00:55:27,412 --> 00:55:28,291
I just worry…

867
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:30,931
am I worthy of it?

868
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:34,011
With the bond between us,

869
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:36,891
who else but you deserves it?

870
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:38,891
Once inside your body,

871
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:40,131
this jade

872
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:42,811
will erase all Celestial Qi from you.

873
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:44,211
It will also remove

874
00:55:44,412 --> 00:55:46,091
the binding lock that old man placed on you.

875
00:55:46,532 --> 00:55:47,531
How did you know?

876
00:55:48,132 --> 00:55:49,131
If it weren’t for that,

877
00:55:49,732 --> 00:55:51,531
why else would you still feel distant from me

878
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:53,411
after all this time?

879
00:55:57,132 --> 00:55:59,011
I clearly struck you with my sword that day—

880
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:00,380
so why

881
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,940
are you now completely unscathed?

882
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:04,411
Have you forgotten—

883
00:56:05,692 --> 00:56:06,931
my greatest strength

884
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:08,171
is enduring pain.

885
00:56:08,772 --> 00:56:09,531
Besides,

886
00:56:09,972 --> 00:56:11,731
you once made me coexist with the Jade Sword.

887
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:13,411
How could it possibly hurt me?

888
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:15,211
I see...

889
00:56:19,812 --> 00:56:20,371
Dragon Sovereign,

890
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:22,571
The Messenger of the Celestial Clan is outside asking for Yingluo.

891
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:24,011
It should be Yu Jing.

892
00:56:24,892 --> 00:56:26,851
I destroyed Qing Yu, my link to the Celestials.

893
00:56:27,412 --> 00:56:28,411
The Celestial Sovereign is suspicious.

894
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:29,731
I’m guessing…

895
00:56:30,252 --> 00:56:31,731
he’s already figured everything out.

896
00:56:32,452 --> 00:56:34,131
So he sent Yu Jing to take me back.

897
00:56:34,772 --> 00:56:36,011
Then let’s eliminate him.

898
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,011
No.

899
00:56:37,612 --> 00:56:39,371
I’ll handle this myself.

900
00:56:39,812 --> 00:56:41,611
Yu Jing is just following orders.

901
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:43,771
Staying with the Dragons

902
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:45,171
was my decision—

903
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:46,931
it has nothing to do with him.

904
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:57,371
Why was Qing Yu destroyed?

905
00:56:57,732 --> 00:56:58,971
Why did you lose contact?

906
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,371
Do you know

907
00:57:00,612 --> 00:57:02,171
how furious the Celestial Sovereign is?

908
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:04,131
Did he send you here to capture me?

909
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,771
He wants you to end your mission

910
00:57:07,332 --> 00:57:08,331
and return to his side.

911
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:09,731
Yu Jing,

912
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:11,531
we’ve worked together for years—

913
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:12,731
you know me well.

914
00:57:12,732 --> 00:57:13,611
Rest assured,

915
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:15,731
I’ve said plenty of good things about you to the Celestial Sovereign.

916
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:17,531
As long as you cut ties,

917
00:57:17,732 --> 00:57:19,331
he won’t hold it against you.

918
00:57:20,932 --> 00:57:21,931
Later,

919
00:57:21,932 --> 00:57:23,131
I’ll “attack” and injure you.

920
00:57:24,332 --> 00:57:25,691
It might hurt for a bit,

921
00:57:25,772 --> 00:57:27,291
but if you go back with those injuries,

922
00:57:27,532 --> 00:57:28,931
he won’t trouble you.

923
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,731
Do you know

924
00:57:31,092 --> 00:57:32,331
what you’re doing?

925
00:57:33,652 --> 00:57:34,731
This is my choice—

926
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:35,691
I don’t want to drag you down.

927
00:57:36,012 --> 00:57:36,931
Are you really

928
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:39,571
going to surrender to Dragon Xian?

929
00:57:39,812 --> 00:57:40,931
That has nothing to do with you.

930
00:57:41,372 --> 00:57:42,731
The less you know, the safer you’ll be.

931
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:44,971
Yingluo, wake up!

932
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:46,891
You’re the God of War of the Celestial Clan!

933
00:57:47,412 --> 00:57:49,971
What kind of spell did Dragon Xian put on you?

934
00:57:52,212 --> 00:57:53,331
God of War,

935
00:57:53,812 --> 00:57:54,931
come with me.

936
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:12,691
Where is this place?

937
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:15,691
This is the Moon Clan.

938
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:17,291
The Moon Clan?

939
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:18,251
The Celestial and Moon Clans

940
00:58:18,252 --> 00:58:19,691
have never interfered with one another.

941
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:21,051
Why would they capture us?

942
00:58:21,252 --> 00:58:22,131
Keep your voice down.

943
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:23,891
Here, in Moon Clan territory,

944
00:58:24,332 --> 00:58:26,531
our Celestial powers are suppressed.

945
00:58:27,412 --> 00:58:29,171
Be careful, we might not be able to fight them off.

946
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:33,531
Why did they capture me?

947
00:58:35,932 --> 00:58:36,731
That’s…

948
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,131
a long story.

949
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:41,611
Let’s just hope we make it out of this alive.

950
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:50,411
Have you found Yingluo?

951
00:58:51,372 --> 00:58:52,171
We searched everywhere.

952
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:54,411
Wasn’t there a Celestial messenger who came?

953
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:55,531
Could it be…

954
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,811
the Celestials took her back?

955
00:59:00,012 --> 00:59:01,771
Unless that old man came himself,

956
00:59:02,412 --> 00:59:04,371
It’s nearly impossible for anyone

957
00:59:05,092 --> 00:59:05,971
to forcibly take Yingluo away.

958
00:59:06,572 --> 00:59:07,171
Dragon Sovereign,

959
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:09,291
aren’t you worried Yingluo went back

960
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:10,051
willingly?

961
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:11,371
With her strength,

962
00:59:11,372 --> 00:59:12,811
how could she just vanish like that?

963
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:14,891
No—

964
00:59:15,812 --> 00:59:16,571
Maybe

965
00:59:16,892 --> 00:59:18,771
she wanted to confront the Celestial Sovereign.

966
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:20,571
Then she’s a fool.

967
00:59:20,852 --> 00:59:22,851
The Celestial Sovereign would rip anyone

968
00:59:23,212 --> 00:59:24,531
who betrays him to pieces on the spot.

969
00:59:25,372 --> 00:59:26,331
No matter what,

970
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:28,531
I’ll go to the Celestial Clan myself.

971
00:59:29,652 --> 00:59:31,051
I cannot bear

972
00:59:31,372 --> 00:59:32,611
the pain of losing Yingluo again.

973
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:42,171
This Moon Clan place is chilling—

974
00:59:42,692 --> 00:59:43,931
cold to the bones.

975
00:59:44,492 --> 00:59:46,211
I hope it doesn’t leave lasting effects.

976
00:59:46,772 --> 00:59:48,331
You should focus on getting out

977
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:50,491
before worrying about side effects.

978
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:51,931
What?

979
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:53,371
Would the Moon Clan

980
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:54,651
really dare kill two Celestial beings?

981
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:55,531
No—

982
00:59:55,852 --> 00:59:57,611
Two noble Celestial elites.

983
00:59:58,292 --> 00:59:59,691
Who knows

984
01:00:00,252 --> 01:00:01,331
we were abducted?

985
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,340
If they attacked us

986
01:00:05,612 --> 01:00:07,171
and dump us in the wilderness…

987
01:00:07,692 --> 01:00:08,731
no one will know.

988
01:00:09,932 --> 01:00:10,931
Are you still hoping

989
01:00:11,332 --> 01:00:13,411
the Celestial Sovereign will avenge you?

990
01:00:13,972 --> 01:00:15,011
If he knew,

991
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:16,531
he’d probably thank the Moon Clan.

992
01:00:16,532 --> 01:00:17,571
One less problem—you.

993
01:00:24,572 --> 01:00:26,451
Is that an assassin?

994
01:00:27,812 --> 01:00:28,691
Sister Yingluo,

995
01:00:31,372 --> 01:00:32,171
long time no see.

996
01:00:36,372 --> 01:00:37,131
What is going on here?

997
01:00:39,812 --> 01:00:40,931
This is…

998
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:42,971
your little follower?

999
01:00:44,332 --> 01:00:45,251
You…

1000
01:00:45,972 --> 01:00:47,051
You came to see me—

1001
01:00:47,052 --> 01:00:48,211
dressed like that.

1002
01:00:48,652 --> 01:00:50,011
Must be something important.

1003
01:00:51,892 --> 01:00:53,731
I hope you don’t confront my mother.

1004
01:00:53,732 --> 01:00:55,131
I’ll talk to her properly.

1005
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:56,931
Back then, I let you go in good faith.

1006
01:00:56,932 --> 01:00:58,571
I didn’t know you were Moon Clan.

1007
01:00:58,892 --> 01:01:00,531
And I never did anything to harm you.

1008
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:03,171
Didn’t expect

1009
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:04,251
you still cared about me.

1010
01:01:04,892 --> 01:01:06,891
You’ve got a strange way of interpreting things.

1011
01:01:08,652 --> 01:01:10,131
My mother was just really angry—

1012
01:01:10,132 --> 01:01:11,331
so she had you kidnapped.

1013
01:01:11,772 --> 01:01:12,571
Angry?

1014
01:01:13,012 --> 01:01:14,811
I never did anything to harm the Moon Clan.

1015
01:01:15,332 --> 01:01:16,291
What’s this all about?

1016
01:01:18,932 --> 01:01:19,771
Actually—

1017
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:21,731
the moment I saw you that day,

1018
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:23,211
I fell for you.

1019
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:23,971
So,

1020
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,011
I used just

1021
01:01:25,012 --> 01:01:26,371
a tiny bit of trickery…

1022
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,651
I stole your pill body

1023
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:30,651
and secretly nurtured a spirit form.

1024
01:01:30,652 --> 01:01:31,411
Dong Fangruo!

1025
01:01:31,652 --> 01:01:32,491
You’ve gone too far!

1026
01:01:32,972 --> 01:01:34,611
I, Yingluo, am pure and proud—

1027
01:01:35,732 --> 01:01:36,531
Someone’s coming!

1028
01:01:36,972 --> 01:01:38,531
Don’t worry, sister—

1029
01:01:38,732 --> 01:01:40,011
I’ll take responsibility.

1030
01:01:40,452 --> 01:01:42,171
Come here.

1031
01:01:45,892 --> 01:01:46,691
I like you.

1032
01:01:51,652 --> 01:01:52,571
Bring her up.

1033
01:02:06,372 --> 01:02:07,011
Moon Sovereign—

1034
01:02:07,212 --> 01:02:08,131
this is her.

1035
01:02:08,132 --> 01:02:10,011
The Celestial God of War—Yingluo.

1036
01:02:12,172 --> 01:02:13,931
Since my son is lovesick,

1037
01:02:14,532 --> 01:02:16,931
you will stay in the Moon Clan

1038
01:02:17,332 --> 01:02:18,531
and become one of us.

1039
01:02:18,732 --> 01:02:19,531
What?!

1040
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,011
I never intended

1041
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:25,691
to have anything to do with the Moon Clan!

1042
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:29,171
Dong Fangruo—

1043
01:02:37,732 --> 01:02:39,091
You heard that, didn’t you?

1044
01:02:39,812 --> 01:02:41,571
She doesn’t like you at all!

1045
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,051
I know.

1046
01:02:43,612 --> 01:02:44,891
I’ve known from the start.

1047
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:48,931
Mother Moon,

1048
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:50,651
please spare them.

1049
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:53,571
This

1050
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:55,931
has nothing to do with them.

1051
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:57,491
I didn’t bring her here

1052
01:02:58,172 --> 01:02:59,971
to facilitate your romance!
﻿1

1053
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:23,618
We’ve looked into it.

1054
01:03:23,939 --> 01:03:25,218
It was the Moon Clan.

1055
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:27,418
As expected—it was the Moon Sovereign.

1056
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:29,298
In that case,

1057
01:03:29,459 --> 01:03:31,538
should we demand her return from the Moon Sovereign，

1058
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:33,138
and deal with her ourselves?

1059
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:36,258
The God of War defied my will—

1060
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,180
and forcibly joined the Dragon Clan.

1061
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,058
She’s brought about her own destruction.

1062
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:43,858
And if the Moon Clan dares kill my Celestial God of War,

1063
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:46,658
they’ll earn my wrath.

1064
01:03:47,859 --> 01:03:51,218
That’s the way of the world.

1065
01:03:51,779 --> 01:03:53,018
You mean…

1066
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:54,818
to use the Moon Clan’s hand?

1067
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:56,538
Report!

1068
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:02,298
Celestial Sovereign—

1069
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,338
The Dragons sent messenger for peace talks.

1070
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:07,580
They’re willing to relinquish a few disputed human territories.

1071
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:09,058
Withdraw voluntarily.

1072
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,300
Yes.

1073
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,620
But...

1074
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:12,858
But?

1075
01:04:13,259 --> 01:04:14,818
They think the God of War is in our hands.

1076
01:04:15,259 --> 01:04:16,858
They want her back.

1077
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:21,258
Delusional.

1078
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:27,018
Yingluo is not with them.

1079
01:04:27,339 --> 01:04:28,578
She was taken by the Moon Clan.

1080
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:30,898
We’ve never had dealings with them.

1081
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:32,178
What should we do?

1082
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:35,018
Fortunately...

1083
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,058
if that old man had taken her,

1084
01:04:38,539 --> 01:04:40,018
she’d be as good as dead.

1085
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:41,858
The Moon Clan is troublesome,

1086
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:43,698
But at least they can be reasoned with.

1087
01:04:46,499 --> 01:04:47,298
Yun Jing,

1088
01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:49,858
you and Lu Shui stay and protect the Dragon Clan.

1089
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:51,298
Wait for my signal.

1090
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:53,458
You’re going to the Moon Clan for Yingluo again?

1091
01:04:57,459 --> 01:04:58,298
No choice.

1092
01:04:58,659 --> 01:04:59,698
I promised her,

1093
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:02,458
I’d protect her with my life.

1094
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:12,618
I’m sorry.

1095
01:05:13,259 --> 01:05:14,498
It’s all because of me—

1096
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:16,498
that things have come to this.

1097
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,538
I haven’t even cried yet.

1098
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:19,818
Why are you crying?

1099
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,138
I’ll talk to Mother and Sister.

1100
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:24,018
I’ll ask them to spare you.

1101
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:26,458
Sister Yingluo’s been so good to me.

1102
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:28,858
I didn’t mean to hurt you.

1103
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:31,018
It’s alright.

1104
01:05:31,899 --> 01:05:33,338
There are plenty who want to capture me.

1105
01:05:33,979 --> 01:05:35,018
If not your Moon Clan,

1106
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:36,658
I’d have been caught by the Celestial Sovereign.

1107
01:05:37,259 --> 01:05:38,138
At least

1108
01:05:38,459 --> 01:05:40,498
your methods are more straightforward.

1109
01:05:41,499 --> 01:05:43,138
I’ll figure something out.

1110
01:05:45,499 --> 01:05:47,018
Is he always like this?

1111
01:05:47,899 --> 01:05:48,898
If I’d known,

1112
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:50,978
I wouldn’t have cared if he lived or died back then.

1113
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:54,458
Don’t cry.

1114
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:06,018
You finally showed up.

1115
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:10,138
Storming into the Moon Clan alone—

1116
01:06:10,459 --> 01:06:12,258
I guess you really don’t take me seriously.

1117
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:13,418
Cut the chatter.

1118
01:06:13,819 --> 01:06:14,898
I’m here for her.

1119
01:06:15,259 --> 01:06:16,258
Name your terms.

1120
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:24,338
Ruo, what are you doing?!

1121
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:25,338
Sister—

1122
01:06:25,579 --> 01:06:27,458
if you hurt them again,

1123
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,258
I’ll kill myself in the most painful way possible!

1124
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:30,058
You—

1125
01:06:32,419 --> 01:06:33,458
Go to your room.

1126
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:16,138
Dragon Xian,

1127
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:18,218
Why are you here?

1128
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:19,338
Not bad.

1129
01:07:20,259 --> 01:07:21,098
You’re in good spirits.

1130
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:22,658
All limbs intact—

1131
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:24,098
better than I expected.

1132
01:07:24,259 --> 01:07:25,938
Didn’t expect you and Dragon Sovereign

1133
01:07:25,939 --> 01:07:27,658
to be so close.

1134
01:07:28,059 --> 01:07:29,818
Closer than me and my own brother.

1135
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:30,858
Enough nonsense.

1136
01:07:32,059 --> 01:07:33,338
Yingluo is Dragon Clan.

1137
01:07:34,419 --> 01:07:35,418
Name your terms.

1138
01:07:35,939 --> 01:07:38,138
Though the Dragons have no feud with us,

1139
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:39,898
you still carry Celestial blood.

1140
01:07:40,459 --> 01:07:42,178
If you want to take her back,

1141
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,258
you’ll have to bleed.

1142
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:52,698
Celestials and Moon Clan—

1143
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:53,978
our bloodlines clash by nature.

1144
01:07:54,259 --> 01:07:56,378
If you dare take this Moon Clan elixir

1145
01:07:57,059 --> 01:07:59,098
and survive the chaos of clashing Qi within,

1146
01:07:59,419 --> 01:08:01,298
then you may take her.

1147
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:02,458
No need.

1148
01:08:03,419 --> 01:08:04,938
Trading one life for another

1149
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:06,018
isn’t worth it.

1150
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:07,458
Relax.

1151
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:09,018
It won’t kill the Dragon Sovereign.

1152
01:08:09,459 --> 01:08:11,418
But his power and cultivation

1153
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:13,178
will be stripped back ten thousand years.

1154
01:08:13,539 --> 01:08:14,818
He did nothing to offend you.

1155
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:16,858
The Dragon Clan has never interfered with Moon Clan affairs.

1156
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,418
I’m the one who offended you.

1157
01:08:18,499 --> 01:08:19,738
Why target him?

1158
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:21,498
You are nothing.

1159
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:23,058
I set this trap

1160
01:08:23,619 --> 01:08:25,538
for Dragon Xian.

1161
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:27,858
Making the Celestial Sovereign lose his heir.

1162
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:29,698
His last heir—

1163
01:08:30,059 --> 01:08:31,138
this is the opportunity

1164
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:33,018
I’ve waited for.

1165
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,218
You knew about me and Dragon Xian.

1166
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:37,858
So—

1167
01:08:39,099 --> 01:08:40,018
You used me as bait.

1168
01:08:40,419 --> 01:08:41,738
Well then, Dragon Sovereign,

1169
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:43,458
my condition is simple:

1170
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:45,378
Swallow this elixir,

1171
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:47,258
and I’ll return you and Yingluo

1172
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:49,458
safely to the Dragon Clan.

1173
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:52,458
I will never become the Celestial Sovereign’s heir.

1174
01:08:53,139 --> 01:08:54,418
Whether you cripple me or not,

1175
01:08:54,419 --> 01:08:55,378
I refuse.

1176
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:56,818
You know full well

1177
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:57,818
what the Celestial Sovereign is like.

1178
01:08:58,619 --> 01:09:00,258
The Celestial Clan shines bright—

1179
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:01,738
but without a successor,

1180
01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:03,378
it’s doomed.

1181
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:05,978
Dragon Sovereign—wise as expected.

1182
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:07,858
But I can’t take that risk.

1183
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,498
The grudge I bear against him

1184
01:09:11,099 --> 01:09:11,858
is no less than yours.

1185
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,060
But you two share the same bloodline.

1186
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:16,258
Erasing—

1187
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:17,658
a chosen heir

1188
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:19,898
will shake the Celestials to their core.

1189
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:21,978
But my Moon Clan thrives endlessly.

1190
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:23,578
If it comes to it—

1191
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,898
I’ll wear the Celestial Sovereign down.

1192
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:27,338
Why not talk alliance?

1193
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:29,898
The Dragon Clan

1194
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:32,458
might be stronger than you think.

1195
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:34,258
No need. I know the Celestial Sovereign.

1196
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:35,658
The stronger you are,

1197
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:39,458
the more he’ll see you as prey.

1198
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:40,618
Mother Moon—

1199
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:42,498
everything you did…

1200
01:09:42,499 --> 01:09:43,538
wasn’t for me?

1201
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:44,378
Ruo,

1202
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:45,738
don’t be foolish.

1203
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:46,938
If I stay in the Moon Clan,

1204
01:09:47,739 --> 01:09:48,818
let Dragon Xian go.

1205
01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:50,658
Pretend none of this happened.

1206
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:51,418
How about that?

1207
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:52,458
Yingluo—

1208
01:09:53,059 --> 01:09:53,698
Don’t say another word.

1209
01:09:55,219 --> 01:09:55,818
Yingluo!

1210
01:09:56,419 --> 01:09:58,178
You think that if Dragon Xian didn’t show up today,

1211
01:09:58,419 --> 01:09:59,858
I’d let you go?

1212
01:10:00,139 --> 01:10:00,898
Mother Moon, no!

1213
01:10:02,099 --> 01:10:02,618
Stop!

1214
01:10:03,019 --> 01:10:03,658
Don’t hurt her!

1215
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:05,698
Mother Moon,

1216
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:07,338
please spare Yingluo.

1217
01:10:08,019 --> 01:10:09,018
The blame lies

1218
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:10,018
With me alone.

1219
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:12,218
Ruo,

1220
01:10:14,259 --> 01:10:16,098
take this elixir to Dragon Xian.

1221
01:10:16,939 --> 01:10:18,218
If he swallows it,

1222
01:10:18,699 --> 01:10:19,738
I’ll release Yingluo.

1223
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:30,738
God of War—

1224
01:10:31,139 --> 01:10:32,938
you owe the Dragon Sovereign your life.

1225
01:10:33,219 --> 01:10:35,018
If I didn’t have plans for him,

1226
01:10:35,339 --> 01:10:36,978
you wouldn’t survive the day.

1227
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:40,578
Dragon Xian—

1228
01:10:41,059 --> 01:10:41,858
don’t believe her.

1229
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:43,338
The Dragon Clan still needs you.

1230
01:10:43,659 --> 01:10:44,658
The Dragon Clan and I

1231
01:10:46,299 --> 01:10:47,418
exist because of you.

1232
01:10:48,059 --> 01:10:49,338
The Celestial Sovereign’s words can’t be trusted.

1233
01:10:49,939 --> 01:10:51,818
And the Moon Sovereign’s can?

1234
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:55,058
The Dragon Clan

1235
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:56,858
is still waiting for you.

1236
01:10:56,859 --> 01:10:57,578
Don’t forget—

1237
01:10:58,059 --> 01:10:59,098
you belong to them.

1238
01:10:59,379 --> 01:11:00,658
That’s why I’m stopping you.

1239
01:11:01,099 --> 01:11:02,138
I promised—

1240
01:11:03,059 --> 01:11:04,138
I’d protect you

1241
01:11:04,419 --> 01:11:05,298
with my life.

1242
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:06,658
Who asked for your promise?

1243
01:11:07,419 --> 01:11:08,458
I chose to stay with the Dragons—

1244
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:10,058
not because you protected me.

1245
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:11,538
Yingluo,

1246
01:11:12,339 --> 01:11:13,098
from now on,

1247
01:11:13,699 --> 01:11:14,778
maybe I’ll need your protection.

1248
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,740
If I lost all my cultivation ,

1249
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,100
Will you take care of me?

1250
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:19,138
No.

1251
01:11:20,619 --> 01:11:21,658
I’ll torment you.

1252
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:22,898
I’ll abuse you.

1253
01:11:23,459 --> 01:11:24,618
I’ll humiliate you.

1254
01:11:25,659 --> 01:11:26,098
I

1255
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:27,218
I believe you.

1256
01:11:30,139 --> 01:11:30,658
Moon Sovereign—

1257
01:11:31,379 --> 01:11:33,298
make sure you send us back to the Dragon Clan.

1258
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:35,178
Don’t let others take advantage.

1259
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:36,338
Understood.

1260
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:38,778
No wonder the Celestial Sovereign is so obsessed with you.

1261
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:40,898
If you were my heir,

1262
01:11:41,379 --> 01:11:42,138
I’d fight

1263
01:11:42,658 --> 01:11:44,058
to keep you too.

1264
01:11:48,059 --> 01:11:48,658
No—

1265
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:50,058
don’t, Dragon Xian!

1266
01:11:50,579 --> 01:11:51,178
Don’t—

1267
01:11:52,259 --> 01:11:53,258
don’t listen to her.

1268
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:55,098
We’re going home.

1269
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:56,418
Don’t be afraid.

1270
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:57,300
I

1271
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:00,258
I’m not worth your sacrifice.

1272
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:01,298
Trust me—

1273
01:12:01,939 --> 01:12:02,858
I’ll be fine.

1274
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:04,058
You forget—

1275
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:05,698
I’ve always been hard to kill.

1276
01:12:06,699 --> 01:12:10,018
Dragon Xian…

1277
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:13,458
Dragon Xian, don’t!

1278
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:14,858
Dragon Xian!
﻿1

1279
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:25,221
Dragon Xian

1280
01:12:26,182 --> 01:12:27,181
Look at me

1281
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,181
Cry

1282
01:12:29,862 --> 01:12:31,701
No. Not pretty.

1283
01:12:36,182 --> 01:12:37,701
Come on, help him.

1284
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:48,701
How is he?

1285
01:12:50,502 --> 01:12:51,461
There is a strange energy

1286
01:12:51,662 --> 01:12:53,021
within him intertwined with

1287
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,221
the yin and yang energies.

1288
01:12:55,422 --> 01:12:56,341
It seems

1289
01:12:56,822 --> 01:12:57,861
to be protecting him.

1290
01:12:58,382 --> 01:12:59,101
By the way

1291
01:12:59,622 --> 01:13:00,541
He carries

1292
01:13:00,782 --> 01:13:02,181
both Celestial and

1293
01:13:02,222 --> 01:13:03,501
Dragon bloodlines.

1294
01:13:04,102 --> 01:13:05,981
What exactly did the Moon Sovereign feed him?

1295
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:07,981
This is a rare pill even among the Moon Clan

1296
01:13:08,662 --> 01:13:10,061
It contains the purest yin energy of the clan

1297
01:13:10,422 --> 01:13:11,981
and is a secret treasure they use for cultivating their spiritual energy.

1298
01:13:12,302 --> 01:13:13,261
A single pill

1299
01:13:13,462 --> 01:13:14,821
grants a thousand years of cultivation power.

1300
01:13:15,822 --> 01:13:16,781
So

1301
01:13:17,662 --> 01:13:19,021
Now, three forces

1302
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:21,141
are intertwining within him.

1303
01:13:23,382 --> 01:13:24,461
He's really something,

1304
01:13:25,102 --> 01:13:26,301
surviving this long.

1305
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,061
How long will the effect last?

1306
01:13:28,182 --> 01:13:29,381
How much time does he have left?

1307
01:13:29,942 --> 01:13:30,661
The pill

1308
01:13:30,942 --> 01:13:32,341
carries a powerful invasive essence.

1309
01:13:33,022 --> 01:13:34,981
It greatly amplifies the Moon Clan's bloodline energy within him,

1310
01:13:35,862 --> 01:13:37,581
while simultaneously eroding the blood force of other clans.

1311
01:13:37,822 --> 01:13:38,941
It's a very domineering

1312
01:13:39,142 --> 01:13:40,421
and unreasonable pill.

1313
01:13:41,862 --> 01:13:42,621
Protect him

1314
01:13:43,342 --> 01:13:44,061
Let me help him

1315
01:13:44,342 --> 01:13:45,821
Are you sure... Shut up!

1316
01:13:46,062 --> 01:13:46,861
Hold him up!

1317
01:14:10,462 --> 01:14:11,381
What are you doing?

1318
01:14:11,582 --> 01:14:12,381
Help you

1319
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,301
How could you abandon yourself

1320
01:14:15,022 --> 01:14:16,221
after all these years of practice?

1321
01:14:16,462 --> 01:14:18,901
Just as you saved me

1322
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:20,621
No reason needed

1323
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,941
Yingluo secretly colluded with the Dragon Clan to

1324
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:36,301
betray the Celestial Clan

1325
01:14:36,822 --> 01:14:38,021
and was also involved with the Moon Clan.

1326
01:14:39,022 --> 01:14:40,541
To dare defy the laws of heaven…

1327
01:14:40,902 --> 01:14:42,141
Hear the command!

1328
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,821
Slay Yingluo at once — no mistakes permitted!

1329
01:14:44,822 --> 01:14:45,821
No delays, no mercy!

1330
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:56,381
Who are you?

1331
01:14:57,022 --> 01:14:58,421
How dare you act recklessly here!

1332
01:15:07,742 --> 01:15:08,581
After all

1333
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:11,061
Now, my body

1334
01:15:11,502 --> 01:15:12,701
carries your energy.

1335
01:15:18,342 --> 01:15:19,221
I promised you

1336
01:15:19,502 --> 01:15:20,501
I will protect your safety

1337
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:21,901
with my life.

1338
01:15:29,862 --> 01:15:31,501
I'll take the risk

1339
01:15:32,102 --> 01:15:32,741
because I believe that

1340
01:15:33,222 --> 01:15:34,941
once you understand who I really am,

1341
01:15:35,982 --> 01:15:37,301
you won't want him anymore.

1342
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:42,141
I’m finally here with you

1343
01:15:43,462 --> 01:15:44,901
How can you fall?

1344
01:15:46,462 --> 01:15:47,181
Dragon Xian

1345
01:15:48,022 --> 01:15:48,981
Wake up!

1346
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:00,741
Dragon Xian

1347
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,021
This can't be happening…

1348
01:16:07,982 --> 01:16:08,741
Why wasn't

1349
01:16:10,062 --> 01:16:11,901
my inner energy destroyed?

1350
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:15,261
You were lucky your blood wasn't pure.

1351
01:16:15,662 --> 01:16:17,181
When the yin and yang energies collided,

1352
01:16:17,822 --> 01:16:19,461
the Dragon essence balanced the force

1353
01:16:20,502 --> 01:16:21,621
just in time.

1354
01:16:31,262 --> 01:16:32,061
Something's wrong!

1355
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:34,061
The Celestial Sovereign knows about the two of you

1356
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:35,821
and has already issued a death order on Yingluo.

1357
01:16:36,582 --> 01:16:37,621
The Dragon Clan is to be driven out

1358
01:16:39,102 --> 01:16:40,261
from all corners of the world.

1359
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:43,741
While the Empress is too busy to notice you

1360
01:16:43,862 --> 01:16:44,461
Leave now!

1361
01:16:45,342 --> 01:16:45,861
Otherwise

1362
01:16:46,062 --> 01:16:47,501
Once they know Dragon Xian is safe,

1363
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:48,541
They won't spare any of you.

1364
01:16:49,662 --> 01:16:50,301
Thank you

1365
01:16:50,662 --> 01:16:51,541
This time

1366
01:16:51,782 --> 01:16:52,861
Stealing your body core

1367
01:16:53,182 --> 01:16:54,301
has caused so much trouble.

1368
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:56,421
It's none of your business.

1369
01:16:57,142 --> 01:16:57,821
I know

1370
01:16:58,062 --> 01:16:59,541
You saw it as mercy.

1371
01:16:59,902 --> 01:17:00,821
I felt

1372
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:03,101
it as salvation.

1373
01:17:06,462 --> 01:17:07,381
But now things are better.

1374
01:17:07,942 --> 01:17:09,501
This guy is willing to risk his life for you.

1375
01:17:09,502 --> 01:17:11,781
You'll be safe with him.

1376
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:13,061
Alright

1377
01:17:13,622 --> 01:17:14,741
She was always mine.

1378
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,621
Don't speak as though

1379
01:17:17,142 --> 01:17:19,061
you've made a sacrifice.

1380
01:17:19,862 --> 01:17:20,901
Don't get too full of yourself.

1381
01:17:21,662 --> 01:17:22,701
I don't believe

1382
01:17:22,902 --> 01:17:24,421
the two of you will never have any misunderstandings.

1383
01:17:24,862 --> 01:17:25,861
You can protect her for your life

1384
01:17:26,102 --> 01:17:26,701
Sure

1385
01:17:27,182 --> 01:17:27,981
Listen

1386
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:29,541
If you dare hurt her,

1387
01:17:30,022 --> 01:17:31,381
I'll find her

1388
01:17:31,822 --> 01:17:32,901
to the ends of the earth.

1389
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:34,981
I'm afraid you won't get that chance.

1390
01:17:35,222 --> 01:17:37,221
Stop arguing!

1391
01:17:38,462 --> 01:17:40,501
Dragon Xian

1392
01:17:41,222 --> 01:17:42,381
You're not healed yet.

1393
01:17:42,502 --> 01:17:43,421
Head back to the Dragon Clan.

1394
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:44,901
Dongfang Ruo and I will go save him.

1395
01:18:13,782 --> 01:18:14,501
Yingluo

1396
01:18:15,702 --> 01:18:17,741
Long time no see

1397
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:20,461
It's you

1398
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:22,621
I saved you

1399
01:18:23,142 --> 01:18:24,381
Is this how you repay me?

1400
01:18:25,142 --> 01:18:27,141
I can't go against the Celestial Sovereign's orders.

1401
01:18:27,342 --> 01:18:29,141
And he promised not to harm you.

1402
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,701
Bullshit

1403
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,861
Yingluo

1404
01:18:35,862 --> 01:18:37,541
The Sovereign gave you your life.

1405
01:18:37,742 --> 01:18:39,501
How dare you betray him?

1406
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:41,621
I'll go with you.

1407
01:18:42,742 --> 01:18:44,341
But the Dragon Clan is innocent.

1408
01:18:45,182 --> 01:18:46,221
Let them go.

1409
01:18:46,582 --> 01:18:47,701
When do you

1410
01:18:47,702 --> 01:18:49,861
have to step in and decide for the Celestial Sovereign?

1411
01:18:50,902 --> 01:18:54,021
You and Dragon Xian really do share a bond of mutual respect.

1412
01:18:54,222 --> 01:18:56,621
He was in danger, and you came to his aid.

1413
01:18:57,062 --> 01:18:58,381
Now that you're in danger,

1414
01:18:59,422 --> 01:19:00,381
I wonder if

1415
01:19:00,662 --> 01:19:02,301
he'll return the favor?

1416
01:19:03,382 --> 01:19:04,781
I guess it was all in my head.

1417
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:06,901
He won't come.

1418
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:08,421
Who would

1419
01:19:08,942 --> 01:19:10,381
care for an enemy?

1420
01:19:11,022 --> 01:19:12,261
And who would truly welcome

1421
01:19:12,262 --> 01:19:13,621
someone who slaughtered their entire clan?

1422
01:19:14,422 --> 01:19:15,901
Who would ever trade their

1423
01:19:16,342 --> 01:19:17,861
own life for that of an enemy?

1424
01:19:18,742 --> 01:19:19,381
Do you

1425
01:19:19,902 --> 01:19:21,501
remember now?

1426
01:19:21,742 --> 01:19:23,981
He used me before to take down the Dragons.

1427
01:19:24,902 --> 01:19:26,581
Now he's trying the same play?

1428
01:19:27,302 --> 01:19:29,061
You think he'll get fooled by the

1429
01:19:29,062 --> 01:19:30,101
same person twice?

1430
01:19:30,942 --> 01:19:31,821
Look

1431
01:19:32,782 --> 01:19:35,301
A war god forged by Tianzun himself,

1432
01:19:35,622 --> 01:19:37,501
yet you betray those who made you.

1433
01:19:38,222 --> 01:19:39,901
I suppose it falls to me to

1434
01:19:40,062 --> 01:19:42,021
remind you of your place!

1435
01:19:42,022 --> 01:19:42,821
The immortal Chilian

1436
01:19:43,582 --> 01:19:44,741
Didn't the Celestial Sovereign promise not to

1437
01:19:45,622 --> 01:19:46,501
kill the God of War?

1438
01:19:47,262 --> 01:19:48,341
He's right.

1439
01:19:55,222 --> 01:19:57,021
It sounds like the Dragon Sovereign

1440
01:19:57,142 --> 01:19:59,181
didn't come here with saving in mind.

1441
01:19:59,702 --> 01:20:00,861
There seems to be no one here

1442
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:02,581
that I wish to save.

1443
01:20:04,142 --> 01:20:04,821
Perhaps I

1444
01:20:05,102 --> 01:20:06,581
should take action in place of the immortal Chilian.

1445
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,421
I've been waiting for this day

1446
01:20:08,822 --> 01:20:09,661
for a long time.
﻿1

1447
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,719
I've been waiting for this day

1448
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,131
for a long time.

1449
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:23,731
Yingluo

1450
01:20:24,212 --> 01:20:25,211
Ten thousand years ago,

1451
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:27,011
You pretended to love me,

1452
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:28,451
But in truth,

1453
01:20:28,452 --> 01:20:29,531
You served the Celestial Clan

1454
01:20:29,932 --> 01:20:31,411
And destroyed Dragon Clan

1455
01:20:31,692 --> 01:20:33,931
Then, you had me nailed to the Jade Platform of the Immortals for ten thousand years.

1456
01:20:34,892 --> 01:20:35,691
Dragon Xian

1457
01:20:36,012 --> 01:20:36,971
Now

1458
01:20:37,612 --> 01:20:39,051
it's your turn to

1459
01:20:39,932 --> 01:20:41,291
know the pain of betrayal.

1460
01:20:41,932 --> 01:20:43,051
Between heaven and earth,

1461
01:20:43,492 --> 01:20:45,051
I am utterly alone.

1462
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:47,011
It's me.

1463
01:20:48,612 --> 01:20:52,691
I have failed the Dragon Clan.

1464
01:20:56,572 --> 01:20:57,291
The immortal Chilian

1465
01:20:59,812 --> 01:21:01,251
Tell that old man

1466
01:21:01,772 --> 01:21:03,331
I won't be

1467
01:21:04,332 --> 01:21:05,731
controlled by him,

1468
01:21:05,732 --> 01:21:07,531
no matter what he does.

1469
01:21:07,732 --> 01:21:09,091
He gave you

1470
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:12,091
the ultimate power

1471
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:15,531
But now that it's useless,

1472
01:21:16,212 --> 01:21:17,971
What else does he think can control me?

1473
01:21:21,492 --> 01:21:22,491
One day

1474
01:21:23,572 --> 01:21:24,971
You will pay.

1475
01:21:25,732 --> 01:21:26,691
All of you will.

1476
01:21:30,972 --> 01:21:32,331
Ungrateful!

1477
01:21:33,092 --> 01:21:34,971
If it weren't for the Celestial Sovereign's will to spare you…

1478
01:21:41,412 --> 01:21:42,451
Got it now?

1479
01:21:43,452 --> 01:21:45,171
Dragon Xian knows it all.

1480
01:21:46,012 --> 01:21:47,691
Now that your memories have returned

1481
01:21:47,972 --> 01:21:49,731
let us speak plainly.

1482
01:21:50,692 --> 01:21:52,451
Running to the Dragons

1483
01:21:52,452 --> 01:21:53,771
won't save you.

1484
01:21:54,012 --> 01:21:55,171
Without the Celestial Clan,

1485
01:21:55,812 --> 01:21:56,931
you're nothing

1486
01:21:56,932 --> 01:21:59,131
but a lost mutt.

1487
01:22:08,732 --> 01:22:09,371
Yingluo

1488
01:22:10,812 --> 01:22:11,851
It's all my fault.

1489
01:22:12,972 --> 01:22:13,811
I'm the one who destroyed you.

1490
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:18,371
Told you so.

1491
01:22:20,172 --> 01:22:21,011
How could

1492
01:22:21,412 --> 01:22:23,411
Dragon Xian make the same mistake

1493
01:22:23,852 --> 01:22:25,051
twice?

1494
01:22:28,012 --> 01:22:42,571
Yingluo

1495
01:22:50,892 --> 01:22:53,091
Yingluo was already weakened from giving you her breath

1496
01:22:53,332 --> 01:22:54,331
during the Moon Clan ritual.

1497
01:22:55,132 --> 01:22:57,251
Just now, the immortal Chilian nearly killed her

1498
01:22:57,492 --> 01:22:58,291
I didn't expect

1499
01:22:58,292 --> 01:22:59,731
You almost got Yingluo killed.

1500
01:23:01,612 --> 01:23:02,251
I

1501
01:23:05,412 --> 01:23:07,091
I had no choice.

1502
01:23:07,572 --> 01:23:08,731
If I hadn't intervened,

1503
01:23:08,932 --> 01:23:10,051
Do you really think the immortal Chilian

1504
01:23:10,772 --> 01:23:11,771
would've let her go so easily?

1505
01:23:11,772 --> 01:23:12,491
What?

1506
01:23:13,692 --> 01:23:14,651
Was it all just an act?

1507
01:23:23,092 --> 01:23:23,811
Yingluo

1508
01:23:25,812 --> 01:23:26,691
Wake up

1509
01:23:28,732 --> 01:23:30,531
I'll explain everything to you.

1510
01:23:33,612 --> 01:23:34,611
She's fading fast.

1511
01:23:34,812 --> 01:23:36,611
We need to anchor her soul and spirit now!

1512
01:24:19,612 --> 01:24:20,891
Our souls are bound to

1513
01:24:21,412 --> 01:24:23,131
The ancestor jade of dragon.

1514
01:24:23,812 --> 01:24:24,851
The ancestor jade of dragon

1515
01:24:25,212 --> 01:24:26,651
will be placed in the Spirit Energy Pool for healing,

1516
01:24:27,132 --> 01:24:28,611
until Yingluo is fully restored.

1517
01:24:29,452 --> 01:24:30,371
I'll be with Yingluo

1518
01:24:30,892 --> 01:24:32,011
as she faces her

1519
01:24:32,132 --> 01:24:33,331
mortal tribulations.

1520
01:24:33,972 --> 01:24:34,691
Yingluo

1521
01:24:35,452 --> 01:24:36,451
Our memories

1522
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:38,171
have been sealed within this amulet.

1523
01:24:38,852 --> 01:24:39,731
It will also

1524
01:24:40,452 --> 01:24:41,771
hide our presence.

1525
01:24:42,572 --> 01:24:44,491
So that old man won't find us.

1526
01:24:46,932 --> 01:24:49,051
May all go as planned.

1527
01:25:43,532 --> 01:25:44,411
So

1528
01:25:44,852 --> 01:25:46,771
Madame Li sent you here

1529
01:25:47,132 --> 01:25:48,851
did she tell you anything

1530
01:25:49,092 --> 01:25:50,491
about my family?

1531
01:25:52,692 --> 01:25:53,491
Well

1532
01:25:54,212 --> 01:25:55,411
You agreed to marry me

1533
01:25:56,052 --> 01:25:57,291
the first time we met

1534
01:25:59,532 --> 01:26:00,891
It's kind of embarrassing, actually.

1535
01:26:04,132 --> 01:26:05,091
I may not be rich

1536
01:26:06,332 --> 01:26:08,051
but I'll work hard and take care of you

1537
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,451
So from now on,

1538
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:11,131
You'll carry water

1539
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:12,291
Plow the fields

1540
01:26:12,812 --> 01:26:13,571
Weave cloth

1541
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:15,491
And water the garden, how does that sound?

1542
01:26:20,412 --> 01:26:21,571
I don't ask for much

1543
01:26:22,652 --> 01:26:23,531
Us two...

1544
01:26:32,012 --> 01:26:33,171
Why won't you talk to me?

1545
01:26:34,132 --> 01:26:35,331
You're not… mute,

1546
01:26:35,892 --> 01:26:37,731
are you?

1547
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:52,251
My fairy

1548
01:26:55,772 --> 01:26:56,811
Aaaaaaah! It hurts!

1549
01:26:56,932 --> 01:26:58,051
You're the mute!

1550
01:27:00,492 --> 01:27:00,931
Tell me

1551
01:27:01,412 --> 01:27:02,731
Who's in charge of our home?

1552
01:27:03,532 --> 01:27:04,571
You, you, you!

1553
01:27:04,572 --> 01:27:05,531
You're the boss!

1554
01:27:36,492 --> 01:27:37,131
Honey

1555
01:27:38,532 --> 01:27:39,891
Seriously, you can't do anything?

1556
01:27:41,372 --> 01:27:42,091
I have

1557
01:27:42,372 --> 01:27:43,611
my own mission.

1558
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:44,971
You

1559
01:27:44,972 --> 01:27:46,531
just handle your part.

1560
01:27:46,772 --> 01:27:47,731
That's all

1561
01:27:48,332 --> 01:27:49,251
you need to know.

1562
01:27:49,772 --> 01:27:50,531
But I

1563
01:27:50,772 --> 01:27:51,531
Save it!

1564
01:27:53,252 --> 01:27:54,491
Done.

1565
01:27:55,052 --> 01:27:56,611
You know what to do with the rest.

1566
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,211
Well then,

1567
01:27:58,212 --> 01:27:59,131
I've got some prep

1568
01:27:59,132 --> 01:28:00,691
to do before tonight's cultivation.

1569
01:28:01,092 --> 01:28:01,851
Cultivation?

1570
01:28:02,732 --> 01:28:03,811
Just do as I say.

1571
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:05,971
And

1572
01:28:06,292 --> 01:28:07,971
Chop the wood, then boil some water.

1573
01:28:08,812 --> 01:28:09,491
After all

1574
01:28:09,772 --> 01:28:11,371
Cultivation takes time.

1575
01:28:11,692 --> 01:28:12,891
But I don't know how!

1576
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:15,891
Don't?

1577
01:28:19,092 --> 01:28:20,131
It hurts!

1578
01:28:20,132 --> 01:28:21,611
I...I will! I'll learn!

1579
01:28:26,692 --> 01:28:27,491
Honey

1580
01:28:28,332 --> 01:28:29,251
Can you

1581
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,611
stop being so violent already?

1582
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:45,691
What are you doing?

1583
01:28:46,492 --> 01:28:47,851
Leave me alone

1584
01:28:47,932 --> 01:28:48,931
I've called for help.

1585
01:28:49,132 --> 01:28:49,851
Go ahead

1586
01:28:50,412 --> 01:28:51,491
let's see who comes running for you.

1587
01:28:53,972 --> 01:28:54,531
What's this?

1588
01:28:54,972 --> 01:28:55,771
What are you looking at?

1589
01:28:56,092 --> 01:28:57,611
This is a new formation I just learned!

1590
01:28:58,612 --> 01:29:00,091
Do you know why I married you?

1591
01:29:00,932 --> 01:29:02,251
It's because this book said that

1592
01:29:02,692 --> 01:29:04,331
For practical cultivation

1593
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:06,771
I need someone

1594
01:29:06,772 --> 01:29:08,771
with a strong body.

1595
01:29:09,612 --> 01:29:10,891
You're not bad.

1596
01:29:12,692 --> 01:29:14,251
Let me go

1597
01:29:14,972 --> 01:29:15,771
Fine

1598
01:29:17,212 --> 01:29:17,851
Don't move.

1599
01:29:18,452 --> 01:29:19,771
Show me a miracle.

1600
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:23,811
No reaction at all?

1601
01:29:24,412 --> 01:29:25,011
One more time.

1602
01:29:28,972 --> 01:29:30,411
Show me a miracle.

1603
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:32,491
The force

1604
01:29:32,932 --> 01:29:34,131
just wasn't enough, that's all.

1605
01:29:34,132 --> 01:29:34,611
Again

1606
01:29:35,892 --> 01:29:36,531
Show me

1607
01:29:36,892 --> 01:29:37,771
a miracle.
﻿1

1608
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,399
Why didn't

1609
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,643
the last plan work?

1610
01:29:46,524 --> 01:29:47,963
The text is

1611
01:29:48,364 --> 01:29:49,403
never wrong.

1612
01:29:50,044 --> 01:29:51,043
It must be me.

1613
01:29:51,924 --> 01:29:52,923
Let me try another way.

1614
01:29:57,324 --> 01:29:59,003
I was once a deity in the heavens

1615
01:29:59,244 --> 01:30:00,083
but somehow,

1616
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:01,803
I've fallen to the mortal world and lost my memories.

1617
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:04,403
Gods of everywhere,

1618
01:30:04,684 --> 01:30:05,803
If you hear my call,

1619
01:30:06,164 --> 01:30:07,443
I beg you, answer me.

1620
01:30:08,124 --> 01:30:08,803
You called for me?

1621
01:30:14,484 --> 01:30:15,363
Did you do that on purpose?

1622
01:30:16,044 --> 01:30:16,643
No

1623
01:30:16,724 --> 01:30:17,723
It's not like that.

1624
01:30:21,364 --> 01:30:22,003
Be honest

1625
01:30:22,444 --> 01:30:24,163
How much do you really know about me?

1626
01:30:24,524 --> 01:30:25,483
Was it you who

1627
01:30:25,484 --> 01:30:26,363
caused me to end up like this?

1628
01:30:26,524 --> 01:30:27,443
I swear

1629
01:30:27,804 --> 01:30:29,243
I had nothing to do with it!

1630
01:30:29,804 --> 01:30:30,923
I'm just getting old.

1631
01:30:30,924 --> 01:30:32,203
And I wanted a pretty bride, okay?

1632
01:30:32,644 --> 01:30:33,483
From West Street.

1633
01:30:33,764 --> 01:30:35,403
Old Matchmaker Li told me about you.

1634
01:30:36,444 --> 01:30:37,043
Really?

1635
01:30:37,244 --> 01:30:37,803
I swear.

1636
01:30:38,044 --> 01:30:39,843
If I brought you to ruin,

1637
01:30:40,044 --> 01:30:40,683
let lightning

1638
01:30:41,484 --> 01:30:42,163
strike me now.

1639
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:47,483
Still denying it?

1640
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:48,083
It hurts!

1641
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:49,363
Let me go

1642
01:30:49,364 --> 01:30:50,203
Allow me to explain

1643
01:30:52,324 --> 01:30:54,723
If you trapped me here…

1644
01:30:55,524 --> 01:30:57,563
Watch yourself.

1645
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:33,003
Then

1646
01:31:33,684 --> 01:31:35,363
I'll tell you a secret.

1647
01:31:35,964 --> 01:31:36,923
Actually

1648
01:31:37,684 --> 01:31:38,843
I'm not human.

1649
01:31:40,364 --> 01:31:41,803
I'm a god from the heavens.

1650
01:31:44,324 --> 01:31:45,483
I've just lost my memory.

1651
01:31:46,204 --> 01:31:47,523
Help me get back

1652
01:31:48,084 --> 01:31:49,443
When I remember who I am

1653
01:31:49,444 --> 01:31:51,723
I'll grant you anything

1654
01:31:51,844 --> 01:31:52,963
you want.

1655
01:31:54,164 --> 01:31:54,763
Hmm...

1656
01:31:54,764 --> 01:31:56,123
That's not the key.

1657
01:31:57,004 --> 01:31:58,403
I've lost my memories.

1658
01:31:58,404 --> 01:31:59,683
That's all.

1659
01:33:58,964 --> 01:34:00,563
No way!

1660
01:34:02,764 --> 01:34:04,163
I didn't finish.

1661
01:34:04,524 --> 01:34:06,723
Two silver coins for one try.

1662
01:34:07,004 --> 01:34:08,363
You're seriously trying to renege on this?

1663
01:34:12,364 --> 01:34:13,403
Two silver coins!

1664
01:34:34,764 --> 01:34:36,083
Impossible!

1665
01:34:37,364 --> 01:34:38,363
Jesus!

1666
01:34:38,404 --> 01:34:39,403
You got it again!

1667
01:34:40,724 --> 01:34:41,803
You're playing dirty!

1668
01:34:42,084 --> 01:34:42,563
Hey!

1669
01:34:43,084 --> 01:34:43,963
Are you out of your mind?

1670
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:18,483
Go ahead, take a few throws

1671
01:35:19,684 --> 01:35:21,363
Here's your ring!

1672
01:35:30,644 --> 01:35:31,723
One more, one more.

1673
01:35:31,724 --> 01:35:33,043
Okay, fine.

1674
01:35:57,604 --> 01:35:59,203
Place your bets, big or small! Final call!

1675
01:35:59,204 --> 01:35:59,723
Win!

1676
01:36:01,204 --> 01:36:01,683
Come!

1677
01:36:02,324 --> 01:36:03,963
Small

1678
01:36:04,164 --> 01:36:05,443
Small! Small!

1679
01:36:05,644 --> 01:36:06,563
Eight! Small!

1680
01:36:09,364 --> 01:36:09,763
Big!

1681
01:36:17,364 --> 01:36:17,843
Bravo!

1682
01:36:19,564 --> 01:36:20,363
Wow!

1683
01:36:21,644 --> 01:36:22,643
Jackpot!

1684
01:36:29,964 --> 01:36:30,523
Wait a sec

1685
01:36:31,644 --> 01:36:32,123
Are you

1686
01:36:33,124 --> 01:36:34,403
actually handing over the shop?

1687
01:36:34,724 --> 01:36:35,403
But

1688
01:36:35,964 --> 01:36:36,963
At this rate

1689
01:36:37,964 --> 01:36:38,843
I'm worried you'll anger the gods.

1690
01:36:39,524 --> 01:36:40,283
I think

1691
01:36:40,404 --> 01:36:41,843
I'll take a statue home.

1692
01:36:42,404 --> 01:36:43,603
Just in case I need to pray for your safety.

1693
01:36:44,404 --> 01:36:44,923
What would

1694
01:36:45,444 --> 01:36:46,443
you like to worship today?

1695
01:36:47,444 --> 01:36:48,243
Fortune?

1696
01:36:48,964 --> 01:36:49,763
Luck?

1697
01:36:50,764 --> 01:36:51,443
Marriage?

1698
01:36:52,084 --> 01:36:53,203
Or for peace?

1699
01:36:53,484 --> 01:36:54,043
All of these

1700
01:36:54,764 --> 01:36:55,243
Great!

1701
01:36:56,924 --> 01:36:57,683
Oh, I've got

1702
01:36:57,684 --> 01:36:59,363
a few powerful ones right here.

1703
01:36:59,764 --> 01:37:01,363
Look! This is a real celestial deity!

1704
01:37:01,764 --> 01:37:03,923
Only the heavens could match its power.

1705
01:37:08,564 --> 01:37:09,123
Boss

1706
01:37:09,604 --> 01:37:11,123
This thing's falling apart!

1707
01:37:11,684 --> 01:37:12,563
No way

1708
01:37:14,324 --> 01:37:15,163
Look this one.

1709
01:37:15,724 --> 01:37:16,883
Trust me, it's solid.

1710
01:37:23,444 --> 01:37:24,083
Oops!

1711
01:37:24,084 --> 01:37:24,923
What's wrong?

1712
01:37:25,284 --> 01:37:26,243
My statue!

1713
01:37:27,004 --> 01:37:27,763
You broke it!

1714
01:37:28,044 --> 01:37:29,243
Let go! Let go! Let go!

1715
01:37:29,564 --> 01:37:31,043
Your statue's quality is so poor

1716
01:37:31,324 --> 01:37:32,523
How is it our fault it broke?

1717
01:37:32,524 --> 01:37:34,363
There's definitely something off about you two.

1718
01:37:34,644 --> 01:37:36,163
I've been running this stall for years

1719
01:37:36,164 --> 01:37:37,443
And I've never seen anything like this.

1720
01:37:37,564 --> 01:37:38,283
Alright then,

1721
01:37:38,844 --> 01:37:40,043
How do you think we should handle this?

1722
01:37:41,804 --> 01:37:43,483
You damaged two statues.

1723
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:44,563
Ten taels

1724
01:37:45,564 --> 01:37:46,723
Then we're done.

1725
01:37:47,044 --> 01:37:47,843
What?!

1726
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:50,643
These two statues are just mud and wood, they fall apart at a touch.

1727
01:37:51,004 --> 01:37:52,283
You want ten taels of gold?!

1728
01:37:52,564 --> 01:37:55,043
This is a noble celestial deity

1729
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:56,043
God from the heavens!

1730
01:37:56,444 --> 01:37:58,283
You two must’ve picked up something foul

1731
01:37:58,884 --> 01:38:00,403
Even the gods don't want to get involved with you.

1732
01:38:00,604 --> 01:38:02,643
And I haven’t even said anything about how unlucky you are!

1733
01:38:02,644 --> 01:38:04,203
I'm a person of the heavens too!

1734
01:38:04,364 --> 01:38:05,763
You're just trying to rip me off!

1735
01:38:06,004 --> 01:38:07,803
We're not exactly rolling in gold right now.

1736
01:38:19,204 --> 01:38:22,802
Is that enough?

1737
01:38:23,124 --> 01:38:23,802
Enough
﻿1

1738
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:29,722
Thank you

1739
01:40:01,483 --> 01:40:03,002
Only when I figure all this out

1740
01:40:03,403 --> 01:40:04,562
will my life truly have meaning.

1741
01:40:06,123 --> 01:40:07,002
If that's the case,

1742
01:40:07,803 --> 01:40:09,402
I'll find a way to earn the money

1743
01:40:10,443 --> 01:40:11,202
and send you back.

1744
01:40:15,523 --> 01:40:16,522
Tea is ready

1745
01:40:17,323 --> 01:40:18,722
Enjoy your tea.

1746
01:40:19,483 --> 01:40:20,122
Boss

1747
01:40:20,603 --> 01:40:21,482
Can I ask you something?

1748
01:40:21,843 --> 01:40:22,282
Sure

1749
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:23,362
Is there any

1750
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:25,122
good way to make money in this city?

1751
01:40:25,483 --> 01:40:26,242
Good way?

1752
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:28,042
You think

1753
01:40:28,043 --> 01:40:29,362
I'd still be here if I knew better?

1754
01:40:31,883 --> 01:40:32,562
Note it

1755
01:40:32,563 --> 01:40:34,202
No profit in tea.

1756
01:40:36,003 --> 01:40:36,762
What?

1757
01:40:37,443 --> 01:40:39,402
Dragon paintings, that's where the gold is

1758
01:40:39,923 --> 01:40:40,762
Everyone's

1759
01:40:40,763 --> 01:40:42,362
after them.

1760
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:43,682
Rarer than gold.

1761
01:40:44,003 --> 01:40:44,802
Dragon painting?

1762
01:40:45,163 --> 01:40:45,682
Right

1763
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:47,322
Dragons bring luck.

1764
01:40:47,483 --> 01:40:49,162
Hang a dragon painting,

1765
01:40:49,163 --> 01:40:50,722
and you'll have good weather

1766
01:40:50,723 --> 01:40:51,562
and a great harvest next year.

1767
01:40:53,883 --> 01:40:55,002
Let's go for a look.

1768
01:40:55,123 --> 01:40:56,162
Go

1769
01:41:05,683 --> 01:41:07,122
Now now, everyone!

1770
01:41:08,523 --> 01:41:09,882
the dragons I paint are not mere beasts,

1771
01:41:10,323 --> 01:41:12,002
but true celestial beings.

1772
01:41:12,643 --> 01:41:15,322
Only for nobles and high officials.

1773
01:41:15,643 --> 01:41:17,082
You think this kind of money

1774
01:41:17,723 --> 01:41:19,202
can buy a dragon scroll?

1775
01:41:19,203 --> 01:41:20,562
Who do you take me for?

1776
01:41:28,163 --> 01:41:30,602
That fat shopkeeper's always picking on common folk.

1777
01:41:31,363 --> 01:41:32,442
It's just a dragon painting.

1778
01:41:32,803 --> 01:41:33,562
Anyone can do it.

1779
01:41:35,443 --> 01:41:36,602
You can draw a dragon?

1780
01:41:49,483 --> 01:41:50,722
This is the real dragon.

1781
01:41:54,683 --> 01:41:55,482
You've seen a real dragon?

1782
01:41:55,482 --> 01:41:56,923
Nope

1783
01:41:56,923 --> 01:41:57,882
But I'm certain

1784
01:41:58,323 --> 01:41:59,122
This is the real dragon.

1785
01:42:01,603 --> 01:42:02,402
Stay here. x

1786
01:42:02,963 --> 01:42:04,162
I'll be back after a quick round at the market.

1787
01:42:14,363 --> 01:42:15,402
Why did it take you so long?

1788
01:42:16,323 --> 01:42:18,082
We're gonna rich.

1789
01:42:19,163 --> 01:42:20,322
What happened?

1790
01:42:21,163 --> 01:42:21,922
Listen

1791
01:42:21,923 --> 01:42:23,322
Your dragon painting

1792
01:42:23,483 --> 01:42:25,682
Made people go nuts for it the second I showed it

1793
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,922
Bids soared higher and higher

1794
01:42:28,123 --> 01:42:29,402
Finally, the shop owner paid

1795
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,322
a hundred gold taels for it!

1796
01:42:32,723 --> 01:42:33,522
What?

1797
01:42:34,163 --> 01:42:35,562
No way!

1798
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:37,562
As long as your hand

1799
01:42:38,243 --> 01:42:39,602
can still paint,

1800
01:42:39,923 --> 01:42:40,602
we're going to

1801
01:42:40,923 --> 01:42:42,442
get rich!

1802
01:42:44,643 --> 01:42:45,282
Bravo!

1803
01:42:45,563 --> 01:42:46,442
Then starting tomorrow,

1804
01:42:46,643 --> 01:42:47,842
I'll paint you as many dragons as you want.

1805
01:42:56,923 --> 01:42:57,882
Find them!

1806
01:42:58,323 --> 01:42:59,802
Daring to mess with me?

1807
01:42:59,803 --> 01:43:01,202
I guess he's got a death wish.

1808
01:43:01,203 --> 01:43:01,762
Search!

1809
01:43:03,723 --> 01:43:05,682
Who the hell sold me a dragon painting at the market yesterday?

1810
01:43:05,883 --> 01:43:06,842
Come out now!

1811
01:43:08,923 --> 01:43:11,362
Who's that?

1812
01:43:12,123 --> 01:43:13,602
It's her! Move!

1813
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:14,522
Watch out!

1814
01:43:14,523 --> 01:43:15,082
Go away!

1815
01:43:21,483 --> 01:43:22,922
I've gotten so powerful now

1816
01:43:24,523 --> 01:43:26,442
You actually dared to mess with my man?

1817
01:43:26,723 --> 01:43:28,002
You have grown tired of this life.

1818
01:43:28,163 --> 01:43:29,602
You want a fight? Take me on.

1819
01:43:30,523 --> 01:43:31,122
Go!

1820
01:43:39,203 --> 01:43:40,242
A piece of cake.

1821
01:43:42,763 --> 01:43:43,802
Are you alright, Dragon Xian?

1822
01:43:44,883 --> 01:43:45,762
No. no, no.

1823
01:43:45,763 --> 01:43:46,362
Don't come any closer.

1824
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:49,522
I guess you're tired of living.

1825
01:44:05,643 --> 01:44:06,162
Come here.

1826
01:44:07,523 --> 01:44:08,122
Kneel down

1827
01:44:10,403 --> 01:44:11,122
Say sorry to him

1828
01:44:11,403 --> 01:44:12,962
Sorry, bro.

1829
01:44:13,203 --> 01:44:14,882
Forgive my ignorance

1830
01:44:14,883 --> 01:44:15,842
We were only

1831
01:44:16,203 --> 01:44:17,922
following orders!

1832
01:44:17,923 --> 01:44:18,922
Who told you to do this?

1833
01:44:20,763 --> 01:44:21,962
It was

1834
01:44:21,963 --> 01:44:23,682
all set up by the nobles

1835
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:25,402
in the city.

1836
01:44:25,683 --> 01:44:26,402
What do you mean — a setup?

1837
01:44:26,723 --> 01:44:27,602
Originally,

1838
01:44:27,603 --> 01:44:29,042
painting dragons was just a tradition

1839
01:44:29,043 --> 01:44:31,922
where the people showed gratitude to heaven.

1840
01:44:32,603 --> 01:44:33,882
Yet when the nobles

1841
01:44:33,883 --> 01:44:35,882
declared them auspicious

1842
01:44:36,443 --> 01:44:39,482
and suddenly everyone's losing their mind over scrolls.

1843
01:44:39,723 --> 01:44:41,082
Painting a dragon? That's easy

1844
01:44:41,403 --> 01:44:42,362
If you want them,

1845
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:43,242
I can paint

1846
01:44:43,563 --> 01:44:45,242
dozens in a single day.

1847
01:44:45,883 --> 01:44:48,562
Absolutely not!

1848
01:44:48,603 --> 01:44:49,402
Why?

1849
01:44:49,723 --> 01:44:52,562
There used to be many dragon painters in the city,

1850
01:44:53,283 --> 01:44:55,042
but…they all died

1851
01:44:55,043 --> 01:44:56,642
under mysterious circumstances.

1852
01:44:57,203 --> 01:44:59,122
That's why the art of painting dragons

1853
01:44:59,123 --> 01:45:01,002
has nearly been lost over time.

1854
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:02,522
Then who exactly painted all those

1855
01:45:03,603 --> 01:45:04,602
dragon scrolls in the city?

1856
01:45:04,603 --> 01:45:07,842
Of course it's the nobles who are painting them now.

1857
01:45:08,643 --> 01:45:11,362
They're the only ones who still know how… and dare to.

1858
01:45:11,603 --> 01:45:13,402
With a single dragon scroll so hard to find,

1859
01:45:13,403 --> 01:45:14,882
Everyone's desperate

1860
01:45:14,883 --> 01:45:17,402
to pay more for one.

1861
01:45:17,763 --> 01:45:18,722
Could it be

1862
01:45:19,883 --> 01:45:20,882
that the painters

1863
01:45:21,483 --> 01:45:22,322
were...

1864
01:45:22,603 --> 01:45:25,122
were killed by them?

1865
01:45:26,723 --> 01:45:27,722
That's outrageous!

1866
01:45:28,283 --> 01:45:30,522
I'm just giving you a friendly warning

1867
01:45:30,763 --> 01:45:34,002
if you start painting dragons like crazy,

1868
01:45:34,403 --> 01:45:35,842
everyone will have one.

1869
01:45:35,843 --> 01:45:37,682
And then who's going to pay extra for it?

1870
01:45:40,963 --> 01:45:42,922
It's not worth much to begin with.

1871
01:45:43,483 --> 01:45:44,322
The people

1872
01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:46,162
just want a little good luck

1873
01:45:46,763 --> 01:45:48,922
hoping for peace and prosperity in the coming year.

1874
01:45:50,723 --> 01:45:52,242
Since that’s the case

1875
01:45:53,403 --> 01:45:54,082
I

1876
01:45:55,323 --> 01:45:57,082
might as well use this chance

1877
01:45:57,683 --> 01:45:59,402
to teach them a lesson.

1878
01:46:02,123 --> 01:46:03,962
If his words hold truth

1879
01:46:05,243 --> 01:46:06,522
wouldn't us painting dragons again

1880
01:46:06,923 --> 01:46:09,002
just anger those people?

1881
01:46:09,523 --> 01:46:10,362
Are you afraid?

1882
01:46:10,763 --> 01:46:11,602
Afraid?

1883
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:12,962
So what

1884
01:46:13,523 --> 01:46:14,322
if they do?

1885
01:46:14,683 --> 01:46:15,722
I'm tough.

1886
01:46:16,523 --> 01:46:17,322
and heal fast.

1887
01:46:22,723 --> 01:46:24,122
You really can take a beating.

1888
01:46:25,163 --> 01:46:26,322
Got another plan, huh?

1889
01:46:27,763 --> 01:46:28,562
Exactly!

1890
01:46:29,203 --> 01:46:30,362
That's a chance

1891
01:46:30,963 --> 01:46:32,322
to help the people

1892
01:46:32,763 --> 01:46:34,762
and make some real money!
﻿1

1893
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:45,600
Alright,

1894
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,160
Are you sure

1895
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,920
this is the place?

1896
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,280
This is the place SiKong Yuan told me,

1897
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,520
it won't be wrong.

1898
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,200
That person looks a little scary.

1899
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:21,600
You two are finally here,

1900
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,760
I've been waiting for you.

1901
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:26,360
Hunter in Chaos,

1902
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:28,600
has the power to solve any problems

1903
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,160
around the four Seas and eight Wastelands.

1904
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,560
If you have any problems,

1905
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:33,560
go ahead and ask me.

1906
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,760
I want to know

1907
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:38,520
who I am,

1908
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,880
why I am here,

1909
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,560
and how can I get back to where I belong?

1910
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,560
A thousand pieces of gold.

1911
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:46,480
Pay first, answer later.

1912
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,320
You just asked me three questions,

1913
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:49,840
that will be three thousand gold.

1914
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:50,920
That's too expensive,

1915
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:55,440
can it be cheaper?

1916
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,680
Is he frozen?

1917
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,560
who I am.

1918
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,040
I'll find it out right now.

1919
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,600
You're indeed not a mortal person.

1920
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:41,080
You were the thing born when the world was created,

1921
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:42,840
and later you become

1922
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:44,880
the strongest fighter

1923
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,800
around the four Seas and eight Wastelands.

1924
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,680
Are you sure?

1925
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,440
So how can I get back?

1926
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:51,960
A thousand gold for one question.

1927
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,920
Pay first, answer later.

1928
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,880
Are you crazy?

1929
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:56,840
You're a total treacherous man.

1930
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:58,680
He's frozen again.

1931
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:01,960
Is he lying?

1932
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:05,200
Never mind,

1933
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:06,320
let's

1934
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,280
go home.

1935
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:12,920
I'll paint more dragons,

1936
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,960
this is enough for me.

1937
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:19,160
You're really leaving now?

1938
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,480
You don't want to ask me any more questions?

1939
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:28,760
Actually, I want to say that,

1940
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,800
we can just wait for the perfect moment.

1941
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:44,840
You're gonna go out?

1942
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:46,840
I need to do something.

1943
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,120
I see your dress,

1944
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,400
are you planning to go to the earth and find them?

1945
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,920
Is it that obvious.

1946
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,080
Please,

1947
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,040
the two of them keep their memories and hide from the earth

1948
01:51:58,040 --> 01:51:59,480
to not let the celestial sovereign finds out.

1949
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:00,840
If you go just like this

1950
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,120
and stimulate them to think of something,

1951
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,640
you're going to expose them.

1952
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:05,240
I know,

1953
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,160
I'm just worried.

1954
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,840
What if they have any problems or dangerous

1955
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,200
on earth?

1956
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,440
But he will have his experience
and toughening sooner or later.

1957
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,720
I'll go check them in secret,

1958
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:16,160
I won't let them spot me.

1959
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,400
There's a messenger from the heaven

1960
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,120
in the room waiting for you to call.

1961
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,160
I'll leave the dragon clan to you,

1962
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:22,560
I need to go, bye bye.

1963
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,560
No one is trustworthy.

1964
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,960
Are you really not going to take another try?

1965
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:49,840
Maybe live here all my life

1966
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:51,760
is my fate.

1967
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,760
You don't have any regrets?

1968
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,600
Not at all,

1969
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:02,080
I am from heaven,

1970
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,280
if I know how to go back,

1971
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,680
you'll be the only one left here.

1972
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,080
You're staying here, for me?

1973
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:17,040
You don't have much time all your life,

1974
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,720
let's just say I give you my time.

1975
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:29,720
You really don't regret this?

1976
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,080
No,

1977
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:33,760
because I know

1978
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:35,600
you're the people who treat me best

1979
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:37,400
in the world.

1980
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:26,480
Come and taste,

1981
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,000
I learned a new dish for you,

1982
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,880
is it good?

1983
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:34,960
Looks like the life on earth

1984
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:37,240
is not so bad,

1985
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,160
if Dragon Xian is not the Dragon Sovereign,

1986
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,040
does he can also have this

1987
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,400
peaceful and easy life?

1988
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:30,760
Dragon Xian,

1989
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,240
wake up.

1990
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:35,560
I always feel

1991
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,560
somebody's watching us.

1992
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,360
You're an immortal,

1993
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:46,240
don't be scared.

1994
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,280
Dragon Xian.
﻿1

1995
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,390
I don't know what's wrong with me lately,

1996
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:11,450
I always feel that someone is watching me

1997
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:12,490
in the dark.

1998
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:15,050
It makes me so messed.

1999
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:17,210
Since I know who you really are,

2000
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:19,210
I feel that there's nothing could

2001
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:21,010
scare me anymore in the world.

2002
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:23,610
No way,

2003
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:26,170
we still need to find a good master to help me.

2004
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:27,210
What are you scared of?

2005
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:28,930
Nothing could be

2006
01:56:29,290 --> 01:56:30,290
even more scary than you.

2007
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:34,930
What the hell is going on here?

2008
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:53,410
I've heard that you guys are trying to find a good master,

2009
01:56:53,890 --> 01:56:54,810
what do you think of me?

2010
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:07,170
Lord celestial sovereign,

2011
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:08,770
you've been watching a lot

2012
01:57:08,770 --> 01:57:10,410
this little town on the earth,

2013
01:57:10,730 --> 01:57:12,010
what's wrong with this place?

2014
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:13,770
Although nothing special,

2015
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:17,690
the energy of the dragon clan keeps happening here,

2016
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:20,090
it makes me wondering.

2017
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:25,490
Good master,

2018
01:57:26,530 --> 01:57:27,930
my wife lately has always felt that

2019
01:57:28,330 --> 01:57:29,610
somebody is watching over her

2020
01:57:29,890 --> 01:57:31,770
in the dark,

2021
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:33,250
is she encounter

2022
01:57:33,730 --> 01:57:34,570
some bad energy?

2023
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:37,410
I always feel that

2024
01:57:37,930 --> 01:57:39,770
there's someone watching me in the dark,

2025
01:57:41,410 --> 01:57:42,450
could some freak ghost

2026
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:43,970
has his eyes on me?

2027
01:57:45,770 --> 01:57:47,010
Maybe it's someone

2028
01:57:47,010 --> 01:57:48,930
who cared about you.

2029
01:57:49,690 --> 01:57:50,410
How about this?

2030
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:53,490
I'll give you a very top quality treasure,

2031
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:56,290
as long as you make a wish to this with devotion,

2032
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:58,170
the heaven will listen to you.

2033
01:57:58,730 --> 01:57:59,770
Is this thing can

2034
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:01,490
contact with the heaven?

2035
01:58:01,490 --> 01:58:02,290
Of course,

2036
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:03,290
this is made

2037
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:05,130
by the green birds' wings,

2038
01:58:05,490 --> 01:58:07,930
every wish will come true

2039
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:09,130
as long as you two do not be too greedy.

2040
01:58:09,130 --> 01:58:09,530
This,

2041
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:12,090
this looks very high quality.

2042
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:12,770
Of course.

2043
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:14,210
Then it should be very useful.

2044
01:58:15,170 --> 01:58:15,930
Then,

2045
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:16,810
we wish to be rich.

2046
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:17,610
No,

2047
01:58:17,930 --> 01:58:18,530
we need to be safe and sound,

2048
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:19,570
it's more important,

2049
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:21,050
to be safe.

2050
01:58:21,050 --> 01:58:21,690
To be rich.

2051
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:22,010
No, safe.

2052
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:22,650
I want to be rich.

2053
01:58:22,890 --> 01:58:25,010
It's so good that you two have lost your memories.

2054
01:58:25,370 --> 01:58:26,570
If you make a wish for something like

2055
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:29,370
unifying the four Seas and eight Wastelands.

2056
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:40,250
I wish the two of us

2057
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:41,330
will grow old together,

2058
01:58:41,730 --> 01:58:43,490
and I can be her husband forever long,

2059
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:45,330
we could a family forever.

2060
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:48,130
I wish him to be safe and sound

2061
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:49,290
all his life,

2062
01:58:50,010 --> 01:58:52,250
and the two of us will support each other,

2063
01:58:52,650 --> 01:58:53,810
we can be together forever long.
