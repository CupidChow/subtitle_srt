CLEANING DUTY
AHN SU-HO, YEON SI-EUN, OH BEOM-SEOK

2
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,312
Our science teacher is nuts.

3
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,816
His voice is like a sleeping pill.

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,860
Hell, I was falling asleep.

5
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,656
While he was talking,

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,242
I was thinking
Si-eun could teach it better.

7
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,160
No way.

8
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,370
He's not much of a talker.

9
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,831
I doubt it.

10
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,001
Is there any subject you find interesting?

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,878
You're always sleeping.

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,255
What do you know?

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,759
You always have your eyes to the front
and a pen behind your ear.

14
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:51,760
Whatever.

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,929
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

16
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,306
I need to go to work.

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,640
Filling in for Yeong-i.

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,767
See you tomorrow.

19
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,603
I have to go too.

20
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,813
I have stuff to do at home.

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,648
Let's all eat together tomorrow.

22
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,233
I'm off.

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,226
Do you understand the situation?

24
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,019
Yes.

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,105
Send someone quickly.

26
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,664
Detectives will arrive soon.
Just do as you're told. Okay?

27
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,165
Okay.

28
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,588
Okay.

29
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,175
What's the story?

30
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,012
So…

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,306
<i>We were working out.</i>

32
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,935
<i>He took a break by himself</i>
<i>and suddenly passed out.</i>

33
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,147
<i>What else?</i>

34
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,901
<i>We have to make sure</i>
<i>the other kids won't talk about this.</i>

35
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,446
<i>If it goes wrong,</i>
<i>we're all going to juvie.</i>

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,408
<i>Have you deleted the videos?</i>

37
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,535
<i>Yes.</i>

38
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,870
<i>Let's check the CCTV.</i>

39
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,082
WHERE ARE YOU?

40
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,835
I'M WORKING OUT. I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:22,053
WEAK HERO:

42
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,111
Piece of shit.

43
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,364
Fucker, how do you live with yourself?

44
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,248
I'll have you killed
the second you land in the Philippines.

45
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,759
How's Su-ho?

46
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,013
Son of a bitch. Are you serious?

47
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,350
Hey.

48
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,020
Watch him 24/7 until he's on that plane.

49
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,313
Is that understood?

50
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,522
Absolutely, sir.

51
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,648
Shit!

52
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,317
You son of a bitch.

<i>Go home. You have exams tomorrow.</i>

I'M WORKING OUT. I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

58
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,603
Don't think about cheating.

59
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,106
Just do your best
with what you've studied, okay?

60
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,941
Yes.

61
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,508
I messed up my test,
so don't brag about your score.

62
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,138
- I'll end up at night school.
- Phones!

63
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,599
Come get your phones.

Yeong-i.

67
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,341
Did you call?

68
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,969
<i>Poor Su-ho.</i>

69
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,932
<i>How could this happen?</i>

70
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,652
<i>Beom-seok is fucking crazy.</i>

71
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,570
<i>Those bastards did it.</i>

72
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,658
<i>Some people came by</i>
<i>and offered to pay the hospital bills.</i>

73
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,619
<i>They had his grandma sign a contract.</i>

74
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,931
Si-eun.

75
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,980
Su-ho is…

76
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,823
Su-ho… won't wake up.

77
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,762
You're Su-ho's friend?

78
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,767
Yes.

79
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,857
You must be Si-eun.

80
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,388
Go back to school.

81
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,432
You have tests to take.

82
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,355
I'll stay, so you can go.

83
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,779
Get some rest.

84
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:31,917
Take a shower.

85
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,631
You'll stop by the school
with your father.

86
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,426
To say goodbye to your teachers.

87
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,154
Hey.

88
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,200
What about Su-ho?

89
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,996
He's still alive.

90
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,543
If you want to keep him alive,

91
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,504
you'd better do as your father said.

92
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,640
<i>In the survey,</i>
<i>48.7% of the respondents said</i>

93
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,600
<i>they didn't get enough sleep.</i>

94
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,977
<i>The reasons given</i>

95
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,064
<i>were private classes, tutoring,</i>
<i>homework, and online classes,</i>

96
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,733
<i>showing that students spend</i>
<i>too much time studying.</i>

00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,386
The door was all broken…

99
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,974
Which class is Jeon Yeong-bin in?

100
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,078
What is it?

101
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,140
Where is that bastard?

102
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,060
Who?

103
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,371
The athlete.

104
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,541
- Your friend.
- In the gym.

105
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,919
Probably in the gym.

106
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,212
He's the one, right?

107
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,632
What?

108
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,927
Did he do it?

109
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,179
I wasn't there. I swear.

110
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,933
I've only seen the video they sent.

111
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,852
What video?

112
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,024
Answer me.

113
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,821
I had nothing to do with it.

114
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,907
Oh Beom-seok.

115
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,451
He did this shit himself.

116
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,836
I don't care.

117
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,145
<i>Fuck you. Keep my name out of your mouth.</i>

118
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,025
<i>Fucking bastard.</i>

119
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,076
Shit.

120
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,830
What is it?

121
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,878
You did this to Su-ho, didn't you?

122
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,676
I knew it. Get the fuck out of the car!

123
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,386
Get out! Fucking bastard!

124
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,431
Who do you think you are,
fucking up the boys' lives like that?

125
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,933
What the fuck did Su-ho do
to deserve this?

126
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:58,934
Fucking coward!

127
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,270
- Aren't you sorry?
- Worthless trash.

128
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,397
Come out, you fucking asshole!

129
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,816
Beg for fucking forgiveness!

130
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,568
Come out, you son of a bitch!

131
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,362
Fucking coward.

132
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,748
This all got fucked up
because you got between us.

133
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,128
We got on so well before you came along.

134
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,590
Hey!

135
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,717
What are you doing?

136
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,635
Let's go.

137
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,013

- Deal with her.

Hey.

140
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,573
I can see your petty tricks.

141
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,662
Your arms must always protect your chin.

142
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,331
<i>Remember. Your chin.</i>

143
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,962
What?

144
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,255
You want to fight?

145
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,591
<i>Let's say you're facing some punk.</i>

146
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,386
If that happens,
don't look them in the eyes.

147
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,554
Watch the shoulders.

148
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,975
<i>When the shoulder is coming at you…</i>

149
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,529
I told you
I could see all your petty tricks.

150
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,452
You

151
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,370
can't

152
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,497
fucking beat me.

153
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,921
<i>And then you just… you fucking just…</i>

154
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:34,965
Run.

155
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,551
Don't look back.

156
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,638
<i>Don't fight and get hurt.</i>

157
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,434
No way.

158
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,355
What?

159
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,430
You fucker!

160
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,952
Wait a minute.

161
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,371
Ahn Su-ho.

162
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,083
It was because
Beom-seok kept kicking his head.

163
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,794
I had nothing to fucking do with it!

164
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,421
Is that so?

165
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,048
- I got it.
- No!

166
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,759
Fuck, we were just sparring!

167
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,136
Please, let's stop this.

168
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,764
I'm sorry. Yeah?

169
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,269
Don't apologize to me.

170
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:31,415
SCHOOL WHERE THE STUDENTS
AND THE TEACHERS ARE HAPPY

171
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,777
You were waiting?

172
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:05,032
Thank you for taking your precious time
to visit us, sir.

173
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,492
It's no problem.
I should have come sooner.

174
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,077
I was just so busy.

175
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,579
- These are our teachers.
- I see.

176
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,039
<i>Was it a few days ago?</i>

177
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,752
I heard one of the students here
was badly injured.

178
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,379
Yes.

179
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,676
Apparently, he was training at the gym
with his friends.

180
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,429
He took a break by himself,

181
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,098
and he suddenly passed out.

182
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,560
It was an accident.

183
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,520
Oh dear. Is that so?

184
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,848
What is it, Si-eun?

185
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,184
What happened to your uniform?

186
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,689
Si-eun.

187
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,816
What's all that blood?

188
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,905
Fuck!

189
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,742
Oh shit. Hey!

190
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,370
Hey. Just calm down, okay?

191
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,206
Let's just talk. Fuck! We can talk!

192
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,794
What the fuck?

193
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,802
Stay back!

194
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,596
Stay back!

195
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,389
Go away!

196
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,932
Oh fuck!

197
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:51,990
You bastard!

198
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,200
Fuck!

199
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,748
I asked you not to.

200
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,294
I said stop.

201
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,672
Just hit me.

202
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,262
We were friends.

203
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,101
I said do it.

204
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,118
Fuck.

205
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,037
Why?

206
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,415
Why did you do it?

207
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,339
I don't really know.

208
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,060
You should understand me, Si-eun.

209
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:49,983
Yeah.

210
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,110
I understand.

211
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,989
So you should…

212
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,784
also understand me.

213
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,037
Why are you all out here?

214
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,832
What's with him?

215
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,917
Get him to stop.

216
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,377
- Yeon Si-eun!
- Go stop him.

217
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,795
Hey, Yeon Si-eun!

218
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,046
Si-eun, come here.

219
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,589
- Si-eun!
- Hey!

220
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,634
- Si-eun!
- Yeon Si-eun!

221
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,053
Yeon Si-eun!

222
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,141
What the fuck do you want?

223
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,883
Si-eun.

224
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,802
Taking a nap? Seriously?

225
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:23,947
Yeah.

226
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,741
I was sleepy.

227
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,915
You really are

228
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,168
a total lunatic.

229
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,920
You know that?

230
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,467
I'm sorry.

231
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,595
What for?

232
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,642
For everything.

233
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,150
Me too.

234
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,073
I'm sorry.

235
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,196
<i>As for Beom-seok…</i>

236
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,955
<i>I heard he went to study abroad.</i>

237
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,552
<i>Yeong-i said it was her fault.</i>

238
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,305
<i>She apologized before she left.</i>

239
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,185
<i>I heard she checks up</i>
<i>on Su-ho's grandmother.</i>

240
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,188
<i>But I can't reach her.</i>

241
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,238
<i>Beom-seok's father tried</i>
<i>to send me to juvie</i>

242
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,617
<i>but said I could transfer schools instead</i>
<i>as long as I kept quiet.</i>

243
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,499
<i>But thanks to his power,</i>

244
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,085
<i>none of the schools</i>
<i>in Seoul would take me.</i>

245
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,089
<i>But then Eunjang High School</i>
<i>in Yeongdeungpo accepted me.</i>

246
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,723
EUNJANG HIGH SCHOOL

247
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,366
Si-eun.

248
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,954
I said we'd come with you.

249
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,540
I want to meet your teacher.

250
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,293
It's fine.

251
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:48,920
I'll go alone.

252
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,470
You did the right thing.

253
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,521
You did nothing wrong.

254
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,782
Be quiet!

255
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,699
Go on, fight!

256
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,205
That's it!

257
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,540
Hey!

258
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,086
- I said hit him!
- Hey!

259
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,424
To your seats now.

260
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,801
Go on. Sit down.

261
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,845
Sit down!

262
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,849
Hey! Can't you see I'm here?

263
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,481
He's a transfer student.

264
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,067
Say hello.

265
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,321
I'm Yeon Si-eun.

266
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,073
Nice to meet you.

267
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,121
Si-eun. Sit over there.

268
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,183
Hi.

269
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,865
Yeon Si-eun?

270
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,658
It's a pretty name.

271
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,243
What?

272
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,244
Are you a girl?

273
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,251
What's that look, bitch?

274
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,630
It makes me feel fucking offended.
Fuck, it's like…

275
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,840
It's giving me a chill.

276
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,885
God, it's cold!

277
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,850
You're our slave now.

278
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,896
How come you guys

279
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,566
are always so predictable?

280
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,319
What?

281
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,532
Do you do this…

282
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,744
for your ego?

283
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,373
What did you say, asshole?

284
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,501
Should I rip out your tongue?

285
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,081
This is the new student at Eunjang.

286
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,209
He beat Kang Woo-yeong, a Union candidate.

287
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,715
What should we do?

288
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,157
ALL NAMES, PLACES, AND EVENTS SHOWN
ARE FICTIONAL

289
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,743
ANY SIMILARITY TO REALITY IS COINCIDENTAL
