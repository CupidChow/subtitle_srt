00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,253
<i>Do you know why you don't get math?</i>

00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,838
FINAL EXAM
IN 16 DAYS

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,923
Because you don't know the logic.

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,760
You memorize everything
without knowing the reason behind it.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,184
Oh Beom-seok.

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,645
Class is almost over.

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,313
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,358
Anyway,

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,904
everyone should think hard
about why I told you this today.

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,614
Class president.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,324
Attention. Bow.

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,577
Thank you.

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,375
Beom-seok.

14
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,879
Did you go drinking?

15
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,131
Beom-seok!

16
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,175
You good?

17
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,307
Your head killing you?

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,226
Yeah, and my guts aren't too good either.

19
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,813
Hey.

20
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,357
I can't remember how it ended.

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,652
You were fucking funny last night.

22
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,697
And that punk Yong-jin
definitely banged that girl.

23
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,115
Seriously?

24
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,700
Yeah! Don't you remember?

25
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,952
You paid for the motel.

26
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,621
- I paid for it?
- Yeah!

27
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,706
- Dude!
- He really doesn't remember.

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,792
Let's go for a smoke.

29
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,794
Thanks for the drinks.

30
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,838
Seriously, last night was really fun.

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:01,412
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 1

32
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,388
What group are we in?

33
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,266
Group six.

34
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,185
The seat at the end is mine.

35
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,277
Oh Beom didn't come to school yet?

36
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,408
- He came.
- He did?

37
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,118
When?

38
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,997
Beom-seok, that girl couldn't keep
her hands off your legs last night!

39
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,753
Man, I was wondering.

40
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,004
- About what?
- Hey.

41
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,256
You rapped in English at karaoke.

42
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,716
It was fucking wild.

43
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,010
You got some pent-up rage or what?

44
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:39,928
Let's go again.

45
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,763
Just us without Yong-jin.

46
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,849
Yeah. Yong-jin totally stole
that girl from you.

47
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,187
Let's have a chat.

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,734
<i>What is this?</i>

49
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,445
What's what?

50
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,074
Why did you ignore my calls?

51
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,037
I didn't know you called.

52
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,291
What's with them?

53
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,213
Why are you suddenly friends
with Jeong-chan and Tae-hun?

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,178
It's none of your business.

55
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,395
You, Su-ho, and I should talk.

56
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,605
I have nothing to say.

57
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,154
That bastard Su-ho looked down on me
from the start.

58
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,075
The bastard never saw me as a friend.

59
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,160
I was just a lackey to him.

60
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,969
You're talking behind my back now?

61
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,769
So what?

62
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,548
Drink!

63
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,259
Great job!

64
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,597
What's up?

65
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,515
Beom-seok.

66
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,559
Long time no see.

67
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,730
Yeah, it's been a while.

68
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,649
- Come here.
- Sit here, Beom-seok.

69
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,327
This is Oh Beom-seok,
a friend from my old school.

70
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,745
Assemblyman Oh Jin-won's son.

71
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,662
Who's that?

72
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,374
You know, that National Assembly guy.

73
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,460
Oh, really?

74
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,378
Awesome!

75
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,463
Meet Seo-hyeon, Ji-an, and Su-a.

76
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,715
Friends from my new school.

77
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,133
And Kang Woo-yeong.

78
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,219
A future UFC fighter and my friend.

79
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,847
You know Physical Therapist Woo-yeong?

80
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,433
What physical therapy?

81
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,559
Look it up later.

82
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,146
It's an online channel where he spars
with dumbass posers.

83
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,356
It's fucking funny.

84
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,108
Hey, man.

85
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,153
Yeah, nice to meet you.

86
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,741
Oh, right.

87
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,285
I heard you split from those fuckers,
Si-eun and Su-ho.

88
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,247
- Yes.
- What happened?

89
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,082
You guys were tight.

90
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,962
Su-ho thinks he's the fucking king.

91
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,714
Yeah, that guy fucking sucks.

92
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,717
He looks down on everyone.

93
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,346
I need to beat the hell
out of that fucker someday.

94
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:13,975
Anyway,

95
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,310
sorry about before.

96
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,234
Let's drink!

97
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,277
Drink!

98
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,279
- Drink up!
- Cheers!

99
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,072
Fuck, I want to transfer too.

100
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,077
Isn't he your type?

101
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,206
Some experts…

102
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,127
What did they estimate?

103
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,590
DAESUNG ACADEMY

104
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,010
Hey, Si-eun!

105
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,856
What is it?

106
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,399
It's Friday!

107
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,943
Let's ride all night.

108
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,653
Get on.

109
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,372
It's cute.

110
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,525
Apartment 901.

111
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,361
Think of it as training. Take the stairs.

112
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,739
Are you making me work?

113
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,076
It's not like that.
I'm just helping you get stronger.

114
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,039
I'll be back soon.

115
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,837
Cheers!

116
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,386
Killer, right?

117
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,692
How is Yeong-i's new job going?

118
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah, she's actually quite smart,
and she's friendly with people.

119
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:41,914
I think that…

120
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,086
Jeong-chan and Tae-hun
are taking advantage of Beom-seok.

121
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,340
And?

122
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,261
I think he's buying them
shoes and clothes.

123
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,806
He pays for all their drinks too.

124
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,643
He always reeks of booze.

125
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,315
Maybe Oh Beom's using them.

126
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,611
It's just

127
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,488
he wanted that from the start.

128
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,700
That's why he latched on to us.

129
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,036
He wanted to be popular.

130
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,915
He thought
we made him look like a big shot.

131
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,006
Do you really think so?

132
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,189
Had a fun weekend?

133
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,399
Yeong-bin brought some hotties.

134
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,984
Fucking traitors!

135
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,737
- I'll go out with one.
- For real?

136
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,823
Stop daydreaming, you fucking moron!

137
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,743
It's true love.
Her eyes sparkled when she looked at me.

138
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,662
'Cause you look old for high school!

139
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,080
You look like a little kid.

140
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,540
- Want to take this outside?
- Bring it on.

141
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,168
Seo-hyeon messaged me.

142
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,295
- No way, man.
- Seo-hyeon?

143
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,880
- Knock it off!
- Why would she?

144
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,465
She slid into my DMs.

145
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,926
She messaged me first and asked me out.

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,469
- For real?
- Yeah.

147
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,179
- Yeah, right.
- Can we come meet her?

148
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,889
- What about me?
- Not this guy.

149
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,057
No way!

150
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,226
- Ask her to bring Su-a.
- What about us?

151
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,143
I'll ask her.

152
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,521
- Ji-an! No, not Ji-an.
- What about us?

153
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,314
- Ask Su-a for me.
- Three is enough.

154
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,149
- And us too?
- Her pics are hot!

155
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,195
- Message her!
- Nah, later.

156
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,156
Seriously?

157
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,700
Are you coming over here now?

158
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:42,952
Fine!

159
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,963
- Beom-seok.
- I'm fed up!

160
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,005
What?

161
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,257
- Su-a, again?
- Yeah.

162
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,217
Of course! Please message her.

163
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,635
Nice seat, isn't it?

164
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,554
It's awesome.

165
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,140
The rent is 100 million won.

166
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,434
Buy me something big.

167
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,061
- I'll treat you this weekend.
- Bet!

168
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,646
But not Tae-hun.

169
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,481
I won't go then.

170
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,859
Come on. We need you for the ugly girl.

171
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,695
Stop using Beom-seok.

172
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,238
What?

173
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,324
Don't take advantage of him.

174
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,786
What is this bullshit?

175
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,372
School is so scary now.

176
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,167
You buy shoes and drink alcohol

177
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,669
using Beom-seok's cash.

178
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,046
Fuck, you say that
like we're the bad guys.

179
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,964
Hey.

180
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,675
If he wants to pay, what's the problem?

181
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,845
I've said my piece.

182
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,901
Let's go eat.

183
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,044
Don't worry about Beom-seok.

184
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,297
What?

185
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,050
You've done enough. You tried.

186
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,598
I think Beom-seok…

187
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,977
is just lonely.

188
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,190
I'm not sure.

189
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,943
Just a feeling.

190
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,157
What's for lunch?

191
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,868
Shit, perilla leaves?

192
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,954
Who wants to feed them to me?

193
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,626
Hey!

194
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,298
Hey!

195
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,556
What are you doing?

196
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,599
There's a line.

197
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,947
Get in line.

198
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,907
I don't get it.

199
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,581
Get in line, Beom-seok.

200
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,383
I don't want to.

201
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,063
Enough.

202
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,614
Goddamn it.

203
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,635
Let's go.

204
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,733
Are you fucking serious?

205
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,445
Fucking hell! That asshole has no respect.

206
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,367
Hey.

207
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,870
Do you know anyone who can waste him?

208
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,664
- What?
- I can pay.

209
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,749
Can anyone kill that bastard?

210
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,795
Oh fuck!

211
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,256
- What?
- Woo-yeong.

212
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,592
I watched some of his videos
on his channel.

213
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,802
He's fucking good.

214
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,098
PHYSICAL THERAPIST WOO-YEONG

215
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,142
- That's it.
- Fuck, this could work.

216
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,143
He could do it.

217
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,063
He throws good punches.

218
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,818
How much can you pay?

219
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
Is a million won enough?

220
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,668
When?

221
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,549
This Saturday.

222
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,428
Su-ho's birthday.

223
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,806
All right.

224
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,977
I'll live stream it. Unedited.

225
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,777
- Where are you going?
- The gym.

226
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,196
That's diligence.

227
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,116
Hold on.

228
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,205
Didn't Ahn Su-ho waste him
a while back in a competition?

229
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,624
Hey, that was a long time ago.

230
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,668
Su-ho retired. Woo-yeong still fights.

231
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,004
- No problem.
- Hey.

232
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,508
Make him fight with a handicap
if you're so worried.

233
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,179
Am I wrong?

234
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,003
Hey, isn't this it?

235
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,424
I think this is it. Let me see.

236
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,677
Here we go. Fuck.

237
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,971
It's hard to cut!

238
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,269
I hope that's the one.

239
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,022
Fuck, couldn't this really kill him?

240
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,358
Don't know. Don't care.

241
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,834
Shit!

242
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,725
Look out!

243
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,606
What was that?

244
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,989
Hey, are you all right?

245
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,867
- Please call an ambulance.
- I'm calling now.

246
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,911
Can you move?

247
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:05,996
Hey.

248
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,415
Let's go before we get screwed.

249
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,004
Hey, Beom-seok!

250
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,505
Hurry up!

251
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,062
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

252
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm all right.

253
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,650
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

254
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,154
Now, what did I tell you
about <i>Song of the Green Mountain</i>?

255
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,621
You just got here?

256
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,082
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,835
Eyes up here!

258
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,256
I'll go over it one last time.

259
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,177
A trimeter song with stanzas and a chorus.

260
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,056
This song demonstrates
the most basic elements

261
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,724
of the Goryeo period…

262
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,161
What happened?

263
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,329
It's no big deal.

264
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,499
Hey.

265
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,171
Don't look at me.

266
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,008
You make me sick.

267
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,095
Get lost.

268
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,144
What was that?

269
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:54,980
Nothing.

270
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,241
Shit, that fucking scared me.

271
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,994
Do you think he knows it was us?

272
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,537
How could he?

273
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,457
I hope not. I mean, there's no way.

274
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,625
Is his birthday the day after tomorrow?

275
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,128
It's done!

276
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,718
If Su-ho hadn't gotten hurt,
we would've gone to Yangyang.

277
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,012
Take pictures.

278
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,349
Take nice ones.

279
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,144
People will think it's your birthday.

280
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,150
Hurry up.

281
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,384
Still no answer?

282
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,469
No.

283
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,392
Maybe he blocked you.

284
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,727
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>cannot be reached…</i>

285
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,029
What's your problem?

286
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,158
Nothing.

287
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,041
Hey.

288
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,211
He won't be here for 30 minutes.

289
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,005
Why are you cooking seaweed soup already?

290
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,883
I heard it tastes better
if you cook it longer.

291
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,386
Says who?

292
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,054
MY BUDDY SI-EUN, LOOK HERE

293
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,933
BEOM-SEOK: ARE YOU AT THE PARTY ROOM?

294
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,355
ARE YOU AT THE PARTY ROOM?

295
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,150
I'M NEARBY. CAN I SEE YOU A MINUTE?

296
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,110
Hey.

297
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,363
Didn't you cut ties with Beom-seok?

298
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,785
Su-ho said that?

299
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,579
IT'S SU-HO'S BIRTHDAY TODAY

300
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,997
No, he didn't.

301
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,792
Why are you suddenly asking about him?

302
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,962
DON'T TELL SI-EUN OR SU-HO

303
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,673
COME OUT FOR A MINUTE
SO I CAN GIVE YOU HIS PRESENT

304
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,679
Oh? It's nothing.

305
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,141
I'm going to the shop.

306
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,068
It's been a while.

307
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:48,987
How's it going?

308
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,782
Good, I guess.

309
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,244
How about you?

310
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,246
Fine.

311
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,998
Sorry about before.

312
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,252
I caused problems by answering your phone.

313
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,506
Si-eun was so worried about you.

314
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,385
Su-ho will be here soon.
So come to the party with me.

315
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,970
I'll help you guys make up.

316
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,437
Hey.

317
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,564
First of all,

318
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,484
you didn't cause problems.

319
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,404
And what can you do?

320
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,452
And why would we make up?

321
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,582
Is he for real?

322
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,302
What is this?

323
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,185
If you go that way…

324
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,647
Don't play so methodically. Look.

325
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,233
This isn't studying. It's a game.

326
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,902
Okay, my turn.

327
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,118
Hey, is Yeong-i crawling or something?

328
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,953
Why's it taking so long? I'm starving.

329
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,373
We can have the cake later.

330
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,708
Let's just eat first.

331
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,713
You seriously…

332
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,758
had a great idea. I mean it.

333
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,010
I like it.

334
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,431
- I'll try calling Yeong-i.
- Okay.

335
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,817
<i>The number you called cannot be reached.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

336
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,903
Did you know
reheated leftover pizza is hella tasty?

337
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,821
Get ready.

338
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,489
It'll blow your mind.

339
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,424
BEOM-SEOK
18-3 BAMGOGAE-RO, GANGNAM, SEOUL

340
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,968
STOP IGNORING MY CALLS AND GET OVER HERE

341
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,062
Don't look at me. You make me sick.

342
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,691
Hey, now Yeong-i isn't a problem.

343
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,319
Hey. Didn't you cut ties with Beom-seok?

344
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,528
<i>I'm going to the shop.</i>

345
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,115
Hurry up and take a seat.

346
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,868
This smells great. Holy shit.

347
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,288
YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT LOL

348
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,624
Hell yeah, check out this cheese.

349
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,754
So good.

350
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,880
Start without me.

351
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:56,966
Okay.

352
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,846
I also want chicken, but I'll resist.

353
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,598
You know what I mean?

354
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,768
ON MY WAY. WAIT FOR ME

355
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,605
DELETE 6 MESSAGES

356
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,025
BEOM-SEOK IS BLOCKED

357
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,944
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

358
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,870
- I'm going to the shop.
- Right now?

359
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,455
Hey.

360
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,460
Hurry up.

361
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,463
I can't wait more than five minutes.

362
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,258
Be right back.

363
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:39,843
Go ahead and eat.

364
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,357
Damn, I need a smoke.

365
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,904
Su-ho wouldn't answer my calls,

366
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,657
but he's coming now
after seeing your picture.

367
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,033
Hey. Shut up.

368
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,745
Your breath smells like shit.

369
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,710
Hey.

370
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,670
I'm curious.

371
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,589
Are you dating Su-ho?

372
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,716
Fuck, what's this bullshit?

373
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,051
I mean, that's how relationships work.

374
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,429
There's always give and take.

375
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,265
Su-ho lets you stay at his house.

376
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,641
He gets you a job.

377
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,020
So what did you give him in return?

378
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,564
Don't be ridiculous.

379
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,432
<i>The Battle of Thermopylae.</i>

380
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,269
<i>To defeat a much larger army,</i>

381
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,606
<i>Sparta fought them in a narrow pass.</i>

382
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,987
<i>To fight against many opponents,</i>
<i>you need to utilize the terrain.</i>

383
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,733
What's this?

384
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:05,947
Si-eun!

385
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,078
Fuck, it's been a while, Yeon Si-eun.

386
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,831
Why are you here? Where's Su-ho?

387
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,250
It's fucking good to see you.

388
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,793
Let's go.

389
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,713
Fuck!

390
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,423
What are you doing? Grab him!

391
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,385
What's going on? Where's Ahn Su-ho?

392
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,265
God!

393
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:39,981
You go first!

394
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:42,984
I'll get the police!

395
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,614
Son of a bitch!

396
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,075
Hurry up!

397
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,285
Get them!

398
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,162
Please come right away.

399
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,831
They're going to fuck us up!

400
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,626
- Hey!
- Yes, they're coming after me!

401
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,794
Where are you going?

402
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,630
Yeon Si-eun!

403
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,936
Son of a bitch!

404
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,941
You fucker.

405
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,706
That hurts!

406
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,430
Hey. Wait a minute.

407
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,725
Hey, hold on.

408
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,935
Wait a minute!

409
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,729
Hell yeah!

410
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:07,902
Who are you?

411
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,320
The Foul King?

412
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,787
Are you Yeong-bin's friend?

413
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,876
That won't help you.

414
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,526
You're using a tool, you son of a bitch?

415
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,864
Fucking coward.

416
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,210
Enough.

417
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,050
Just let him go.

418
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,387
- What?
- Si-eun isn't involved.

419
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,805
I said let him go.

420
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,974
I only need Su-ho.

421
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,642
That's your business.

422
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,812
This is mine.

423
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,238
Fuck! I told you to stop.

424
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,242
You crazy fucker.

425
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:42,955
Hey.

426
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,625
What?

427
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,794
We're all here to help you, asshole.

428
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,547
So he's your friend.

429
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,009
What about us?

430
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,988
Didn't I tell you

431
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,783
to know your place?

432
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,159
You fucker.

433
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,208
Hit that fucker more!

434
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,961
You son of a bitch.

435
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,633
You fucking dog!

436
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,427
Just pound him.

437
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,352
Hey, Beom-seok.

438
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,029
Let's reschedule the Ahn Su-ho fight.

439
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,033
I've already promoted it
a lot on my channel.

440
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,582
Transfer the money for today, okay?

441
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,375
I got you one punk.

442
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,804
Fuck!

443
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,182
Fuck, did you think we were pushovers?

444
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,391
My jaw still hurts.

445
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,310
My jaw! You son of a bitch.

446
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,853
Hit him more. Fuck.

447
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,234
Hey!

448
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,777
The bitch called the cops!

449
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,988
Hurry up!

450
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,240
Fuck! Let's go!

451
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,867
Let's get out of here!

452
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,504
Hey.

453
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,132
You thought you won, didn't you?

454
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,246
Hey, Yeon Si-eun.

455
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:32,959
Si-eun.

456
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,759
ALL NAMES, PLACES, AND EVENTS SHOWN

457
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,302
