- Move it more!
- Like that.

66
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,667
Thank you.

67
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,130

Sorry.

79
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,219
Be careful next time.

80
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,939
It was an accident.

81
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,777
So how can I be more careful next time?

82
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,987
Trying to show me up?

83
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,197
It was an accident.

84
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,492

Everyone hates you.

89
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,559
Even if we say the same thing,
the way you say it is annoying.

- Just my type!
- Why introduce <i>him</i>?

168
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,145
Don't be like that.

169
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,065
- Look at your face, idiot.
- Look at your body, idiot.

170
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,066
I've got muscles!

171

- My dick is a muscle!
- Hey!

I'll introduce both of you.

174

What? Missing something?

179
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,343
I could fold you in half.

Let's go.

181
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,891
You call that a muscle?

182
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,434
Not as muscular as my dick.

183

Why is it always dicks with you, dumbass?

Six minutes, twelve seconds.

186
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,088
Make it five seconds faster.

187
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,592
You should go to a sports college.

188
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,260
You're good enough.

189
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,387
I'm no Olympic athlete,
so what's the point?

190
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,432
If I beat Bolt's record,
I'd think about it.

191
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,392
Who is that?

192
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,519
Bolt is Bolt.

193
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,104
Usain Bolt.

194
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,357
- Good job today.
- Punk!

195
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,613
- Six minutes, forty-five seconds.
- What?

196
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,131
Not far now! You can do it!

197
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,841
Look at him run.

198
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,721
Fuck, is he a zombie? What is this?

199
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,766
It'd be faster to run like this.

200
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,018
That's not it.

201
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,981
You assholes!

202
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,743
Bring it here.

203
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,414
Let it go.

204
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,792
Just do it.

205
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,806
What's your name?

206
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,893
Lee Jeong-chan.

207
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,319
Nice job.

208
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,702
9 minutes, 48 seconds.

209
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,204
Yeon Si-eun.

210
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,416
You need more stamina.

211
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,335
Don't you need stamina to study?

212
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,173
Take him to the nurse's office.

213
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,051
No, I'm fine.

214
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,429
I'm fine.

215
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,849
<i>I'm fine.</i>

216
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,643
I'm fine.

217
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,521
Fine, my ass. He didn't sound fine at all.

218
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,357
We need to beat the hell out of him soon.

219
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,608
Those eyes…

220
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,610
- "Be careful next time."
- Right!

221
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,947
"Be careful to avoid another accident."
Fuck those eyes…

222
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,167
Damn, what's that smell?

223
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,003
Man, he reeks of sweat!

224
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:28,839
Stop it.

225
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,216
Do me a favor.

226
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,094
What?

227
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,096
Stop bothering me.

228
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,072
What are you talking about?

229
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,367
I told you.

230
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,421
I knew it!

231
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,049
Acting like he's somebody
when he's fucking nobody.

232
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,634
Let go.

233
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,302
Now, that's not

234
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,222
how you ask for a favor, is it?

235
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,435
Try it again. Politely.

236
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:25,979
Let me go.

237
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,025
Should we get the teacher?

238
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,402
Hey, Yeong-bin.

239
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,445
Don't let go.

240
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,906
You let go, you die.

241
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,413
Hey! What are you doing?

242
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,209
It's nothing, Teach! Just playing around.

243
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,627
Si-eun, are you okay?

244
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,174
Tae-hun, what is this?

245
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,552
- Hey.
- Just playing around.

246
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,428
You don't want penalty points for this.

247
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,639
Gotta get into college, right?

248
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,309
Si-eun, speak up.

249
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,728
Were you really messing around?

250
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,276
Yes, that's right.

251
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,735
Don't do it again.

252
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,070
- Okay?
- Yes.

253
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,732
<i>What were those merchants called?</i>

254
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,567
<i>They were called "Gongin."</i>

255
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,862
<i>Gongin were important.</i>
<i>If you see this term in the paper…</i>

256
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,120
<i>When you see "Gongin,"</i>
<i>look for "Daedongbeop."</i>

257
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,540
<i>The local currency was distributed</i>
<i>like this--</i>

258
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:13,962
Who is it?

259
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,006
Delivery.

260
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,051
I didn't order anything.

261
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,345
You didn't? But this is the address.

262
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,313
What? The nerd?

263
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,315
Why are you here?

264
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,486
I didn't order it.

265
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,403
Really?

266
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,073
Building 102, apartment 902?

267
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,785
This is 101.

268
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,205
This is for 102.

269
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,169
My bad. Got it.

270
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,715
Can I have some water?

271
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,761
- Why?
- We're classmates, right?

272
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,930
It's not a big deal.

273
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,183
Can't you just give me one glass of water?

274
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm getting dehydrated.

275
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,524
It'll be your fault if I faint.

276
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,652
It's not much. Just some water.

277
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,362
Don't just stand there.

278
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,447
I'll collapse. I'm dying, really!

279
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,201
Now I'm losing my voice.

280
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,635
What a ridiculous prick.

281
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,058
Thanks. I'll buy you
three bottles of water tomorrow.

282
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,477
Study hard.

283
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,521
See you tomorrow.

284
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,483
Listen to your mom.

285
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,028
Which one is it?

286
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,628
<i>We have a new student.</i>

287
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,255
<i>Say hello.</i>

288
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,764
Hi. I'm Oh Beom-seok.

289
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,980
Everyone, please make
Beom-seok feel welcome.

290
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,115
Let's go.

291
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:54,915
Hi.

292
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,878
- Oh Beom-seok?
- Yeah.

293
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,797
Where are you from?

294
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,841
Mungang High School.

295
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,387
Born with a silver spoon.

296
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,015
You know Ji-won at Mungang?

297
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,600
We're best buds.

298
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,771
I don't really know him.

299
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,689
You don't know Ji-won?

300
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,942
How come you don't know him?

301
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,071
Maybe I've heard the name,

302
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,489
but I don't know him.

303
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,421
Move.

304
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,174
That's my seat.

305
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,719
I don't want to.

306
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,729
I said move.

307
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,985
Are you fucking crazy?

308
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,540
Why are you so chatty these days?

309
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,167
I'm trying to sleep.

310
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,961
Do you mind?

311
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,301
Watch it.

312
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,787
Cheers!

313
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,834
Yeong-bin, you're not drinking?

314
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,753
Yeah, why won't you drink?

315
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,547
The mock test is next week, idiots.

316
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,676
Study hard and get a good job!

317
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,096
Hey, Yeong-bin.

318
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,017
It's like Si-eun's going insane,
acting all high and mighty.

319
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,436
What the fuck was he doing with that pen?

320
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,897
The way that fucker was staring at me.

321
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,609
He was giving me the death stare,
and I was seriously going to kill him.

322
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,985
You didn't do anything.

323
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,696
I really wanted to break his neck.

324
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,907
What should we do about Si-eun?

325
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,952
Nothing we do bothers him.

326
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,831
We can't seem to break him down.

327
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,753
His studies?

328
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,425
He's nuts about his grades.
What if we mess with that?

329
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,262
It would break him
'cause it matters too much.

330
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,014
What the hell are you talking about?

331
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,100
Don't you get it, dumbass?

332
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,395
What is the speaker feeling here?

333
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,522
Anyone?

334
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,567
It's anxiety.

335
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,153
Anxiety.

336
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,366
"Each and every rustling leaf
comes to me."

337
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,423
- Hey, bro.
- Hello.

338
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,632
Hello.

339
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,845
- He's really here?
- It's from Cheonan.

340
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,179
It costs more.

341
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,809
- Fentanyl, I've been waiting for you!
- Hee-ji, there's just you left to pay.

342
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,894
The transportation fee too.

343
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,688
- Just 100,000 won more?
- Yeah.

344
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,607
Here you go.

345
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,447
Bro.

346
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:56,990
Count it.

347
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,076
It's fine.

348
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,705
Hey, let's go together.

349
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,040
Got something to ask you.

350
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,335
Yeong-bin, where are you going?

351
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,544
A private lesson.

352
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,338
Go on, then.

353
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,424
- Have fun.
- Yes, sir!

354
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,593
- You're going?
- Really?

355
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,803
- Where to?
- Why do you work so hard?

356
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,680
That jerk's always like this.

357
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,349
That asshole, seriously.

358
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,566
Hey.

359
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,906
Auntie came to our place.

360
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,616
Said you hadn't come home.

361
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,702
Get to the point.

362
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,788
What I want to ask is…

363
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,207
That fentanyl.

364
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,210
What if you put it on your skin?

365
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,795
Like on your neck?

366
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,091
Well, it'd be weaker.

367
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,010
But since it's a painkiller,

368
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,305
you'd get dizzy and sleepy.

369
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,558
Worst case, you'd vomit.

370
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,226
Why?

371
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,230
No reason. I'm just curious.

372
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,901
Yeong-bin.

373
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,445
Yeah?

374
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,196
Watch yourself.

375
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,617
What are you talking about?

376
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,040
Bye.

377
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,838
Fuck, what a worthless asshole.

378
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,729
Ji-won, what's up?

379
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,822
FATHER:
EVERYTHING OKAY?

380
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,955
YES

381
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:07,931
You…

382
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,227
We usually just drop it off.

383
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,021
No direct handoffs next time.

384
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,692
Yeah?

385
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,110
FENTANYL PATCH

386
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,113
It's not for him. The buyer's a girl.

387
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,453
Oh shit, my bad.

388
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,498
Move it.

389
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,835
What?

390
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,337
I said move it.

391
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:40,922
Out of the way.

392
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,466
Well, that's fucking rude.

393
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:44,968
You want to die?

394
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,763
I sure as shit don't like that look.

395
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,311
Hey.

396
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,647
Quit staring.

397
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,736
Stop fucking staring,
or I'll chop your head off.

398
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,574
Bro?

399
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:09,868
Go.

400
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,336
You need to read people better.

401
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,505
He was going to stab you.

402
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,050
MOCK TEST IN ONE DAY

403
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,232
Hey.

404
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,035
Hey, the teacher wants to see you.

405
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,331
The homeroom teacher.

406
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,558
Take it.

407
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,728
Thanks.

408
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,739
Hey, man.

409
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,575
Seems like you had a hard time at Mungang.

410
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,998
I called Ji-won yesterday.

411
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,001
What?

412
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,880
He said you got beaten up so fucking bad.

413
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,220
Is that why you transferred?

414
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,972
Like a fucking loser?

415
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,687
I mean,

416
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,523
I'm not gonna do anything.

417
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,692
Let's just be friends.

418
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,779
Sit.

419
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,866
Okay.

420
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,291
Aren't you grateful?

421
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,840
I'll keep your secret,
and we can be friends.

422
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,094
Yeah.

423
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:34,762
Thanks.

424
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,973
If you're grateful,

425
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,934
do me a small favor.

426
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,065
What is it?

427
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,319
Take it.

428
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,121
You know that the Korean test
takes longer?

429
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,331
Yes.

430
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,666
So watch your time.

431
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,501
- Yep!
- Yes.

432
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,420
No cheating!

433
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,172
Yes.

434
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,757
Yes!

435
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,641
There was a bug right here.

436
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,602
Hey!

437
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,812
What are you doing?

438
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,730
Turn around.

439
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,414
<i>Well, it'd be weaker.</i>

440
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,625
But since it's a painkiller<i>,</i>

441
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,669
<i>you'd get dizzy and sleepy.</i>

442
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,921
<i>Worst case, you'd vomit.</i>

443
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:47,186
<i>In literature, an idea can be represented</i>
<i>by other related concepts or objects.</i>

444
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,856
<i>The attributes can represent the object,</i>

445
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,984
<i>or part of it can represent the whole.</i>

446
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,403
<i>These methods can be mixed…</i>

447
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,624
Hey, where are you going?

448
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,043
Hey, what are you doing?

449
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,476
Hey, why are you doing that?

450
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,857
It's nothing.

451
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,030
- Two.
- Okay!

452
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:03,948
Five.

453
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,783
- I got three!
- Five.

454
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,827
Next is social studies.

455
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,457
One.

456
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,626
One.

457
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,254
Five. Four.

458
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,714
Five.

459
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,257
Five.

460
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:22,967
Three.

461
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:24,969
Two.

462
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,513
- What? Two? Why?
- Five.

463
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,598
Four.

464
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,475
Three.

465
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,519
One.

466
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,146
Four.

467
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,049
Yeon Si-eun.

468
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,843
It's not what you think.

469
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,326
<i>Newton's second law.</i>

470
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,661
<i>Force equals mass times acceleration.</i>

471
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:39,585
<i>Using centrifugal force,</i>
<i>you get a much greater impact.</i>

472
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,886
You're fucking crazy!

473
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,812
Hey, wait!

474
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,890
I asked you.

475
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,102
I told you to stop.

476
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,783
Don't cross the line, all right?

477
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,826
Know when to stop.

478
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,248
What?

479
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:03,335
Me? I'm like your guardian angel
who just woke up from a nap.

480
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,049
Is this funny?

481
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,595
A little bit.

482
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,217
ALL NAMES, PLACES, AND EVENTS SHOWN
ARE FICTIONAL

483
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,011
ANY SIMILARITY TO REALITY IS COINCIDENTAL
