 ♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,290

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,170

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,130

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,790
   

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,130
   

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:58,010


16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,860
 Peter Kwon, racing division's chief design director at Genus Motors, 

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,030
 was the first Korean student in England's Royal Academy of Arts in 1999, 

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,960
 Auto Design Awards' youngest grand prize winner, 

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,730
 and the first Asian chief design director of F1 Design Team. 

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,310
 His last win was 15 years ago, values honor over money, fiercely competitive, 

21
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,100
 quick temper, hates losing, 
   

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,540
 values results over process, doesn't avoid angry debates. 

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,970
 Where are you needed the most? 

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,320
 The domestic racing market declines. 

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,680
 There was no F1 race for over 10 years. 

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,110
 Genus Motors decreased its racing business. 

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,070
 Don't delay and be direct. 

28
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,760
 Provoke his ego yet lift his confidence. 

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,800
 Say he's number one. 

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,180
 Spark his competitiveness. 

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,050
Director.

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,070
Hello. I'm Kang Ji Yun from Peoplez.

33
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,780
   

34
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,640
Have you pondered my proposal?

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,890
How impressive, you came all the way here.

36
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,980
Let me repeat myself.

37
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,710
I don't wish to switch my job.

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,810
What's the reason for declining the offer?

39
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,640
Would such a proposal really suit me?

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,120
It seems you don't know me well.

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,370
I heard your team lags financially lately.

42
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm sure managers also nitpick your designs.

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,100
I hear the company gave you significant conflict lately.

44
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,030
Who do you think you are?

45
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,660
They unofficially pressure you to resign, don't they?

46
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,600
What is this about now?

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,100
So what? Leave before they oust me?

48
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,490
Even if I retire, it'll be at this circuit.

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,630
By chance...

50
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,990
do you remember Designer Peter Kwon's beginnings?

51
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
   

52
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,410
You got a hold of this.

53
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,300
Your Auto Design submission 22 years ago

54
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,480
created an exciting new concept for family cars

55
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,700
using aerodynamic design,

56
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,480
and you were the youngest grand prize designer.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,320
This was so long ago.

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,340
The world has changed since then.

59
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,000
Your old idea is the newest trend for electric cars.

60
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,050
   

61
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,450
My client creates a new line of electric cars,

62
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,140
such a car that will spark brand-wide innovation.

63
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,480
They seek an executive project leader.

64
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,230
There's only one thing my client wants:

65
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,530
to become number one.

66
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,170
Of course, you're guaranteed full authority and autonomy in design.

67
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,430
I've walked too far

68
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,710
in the opposite direction of a new path.

69
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,130
So you're back at square one.

70
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,850
Race track is a loop.

71
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,960
Why not begin a new starting line?

72
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,750
To recoup your former glory,

73
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,370
change is always scary.

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,840
But if you fear new challenges, you fall behind.

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
I'll wait for your call.

76
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,210
 Innovation in urban driving, 

77
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,500
 a car becomes one with the driver, 

78
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,960
 Chief Design Director of Pamir 30, 

79
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,810
 introducing Peter Kwon! 

80
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,940
   

81
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,580
   

82
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,800
 A new vehicle entered the Korean car market. 

83
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,290
 Peter Kwon garnered interest after his unconventional move 

84
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,140
 and unveiled his newest vehicle since his move. 

85
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,100
 The Pamir 30 is a new Korean electric vehicle series 

86
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,990
 and boasts dynamic design from former race car designer Peter Kwon. 

87
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,630
 His exceptional Korean engineering 

88
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,020
 is lauded for shifting the pattern. 

89
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,010
   

90
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,690
We're here with CEO Kang Ji Yun from Peoplez. 
    

91
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,050
The deeper we get into the conversation, the more curious I get

92
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,730
about the world of CEO Kang Ji Yun and headhunters.

93
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,110
What are your criteria to recommend talent?

94
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,160
A person worth the salary.

95
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,590
Try putting a price on yourself.

96
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,970
How much is my  worth?

97
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,050
Do I earn my salary?

98
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,680
Isn't that vulgar?

99
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,870
Do you really think a person's worth can be measured in money?

100
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,610
If worthwhile work is vulgar in a capitalist society,

101
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,490
what does not worth the salary mean?

102
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,300
It's criminal.

103
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,820
   

104
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,970
I'd rather be vulgar than rob employers.

105
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,530
It's not easy to be a successful CEO.

106
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,210
Go to the office.

107
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,090
Who...

108
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,730
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,500
Who are you?

110
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,850
What is this?

111
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,510
You startled me.

112
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,110
Mr. Kim.

113
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,880
You're gifted.

114
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,450
   

115
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,330
That was embarrassing!

116
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,880
I told you to hire me an assistant, right?

117
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,770
Why can't you recognize the car you ride daily?

118
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,640
You remember all the candidates so well.

119
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,930
Those people are my clients. I'm the car's client.

120
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,420
Why spend my energy on a car?

121
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,580
So when is my new assistant starting, Director Seo?

122
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,200
I'd love to find one quickly.

123
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,470
But few apply for the job.

124
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,950
Do you know how many quit just this year? (talks informally)

125
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,410
Two?

126
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,650
Three? 
 (30)

127
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,800
I ran out of fingers.

128
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,620
But still, we're a search firm yet can't hire one?

129
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,450
CEO.

130
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,030
Newcrack's AI developer job has reopened. What do we do?

131
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,730
Weren't they an agony last time?

132
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,870
We can't do it in a month.

133
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,000
For a quality candidate, extend the time and it's ours exclusively.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,870
- Understood. 
 - CEO.

135
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,790
I updated Seyoung Pharmaceuticals list of candidates.

136
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,190
- Trim it to this and pass final candidates to the client. 
 - Okay.

137
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,490
CEO, I posted the checklist on the wall.

138
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,050
 Yes! 

139
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,680
 Spring Apparel hired Daniel for fashion goods. 

140
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,800
 It's confirmed. Yes! 

141
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,660
We did it!

142
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,100
   

143
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,130
   

144
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,420
   

145
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,540
   

146
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,410
 Team Leader, Yang Ho Jin, wireless division, 

147
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,650
 first in Hansu Electronics to start the semiconductor 

148
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,420
 team as a senior developer, 

149
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,800
- now leads the wireless division. 
 - The packaging is...

150
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,470
 He developed the Hansu Electronics smartphone 

151
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,030
 from third-to-fifth generation mobile system 

152
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,440
 and enhanced nine series. 

153
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,220
He is a key talent.

154
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,180
I understand why our client offers a huge signing bonus.

155
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,890
This is an important project where we must succeed.

156
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,180
So is he interested in a new job offer?

157
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,600
 What if Team Leader Yang Ho Jin already decided to leave? 

158
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,000
Did you find out who contacted him?

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,090
We're still looking into it.

160
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,850
How could that be?

161
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,920
We've lost many key talents. 
    

162
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,390
I apologize.

163
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,410
Can anyone ensure Team Leader Yang doesn't leave?

164
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,160
Anyone?

165
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,930
Why not give Manager Yu the task?

166
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,930
Manager Yu Eun Ho?

167
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,510
Yes.

168
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,300
Thank you.

169
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,040
Hey, is he the manager you mentioned?

170
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,330
- Wow, he's so handsome. 
 - Totally my type!

171
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,310
How did you know I craved caffeine? Thank you!

172
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,700
It's not for you. Buy your own.

173
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,530
- Then? 
 - I'm going to Team Leader Yang.

174
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,660
Wh-What? Did you get Team Leader Yang's case?

175
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,470
Did Chief Song burden you?

176
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,870
You really...

177
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,310
Happy? Bye.

178
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,360
Hey, hey!

179
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,200
Hello.

180
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,580
Good day.

181
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,470
Hi there.

182
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,020
Hello.

183
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,990
- Excuse me. Hello. 
 -  Hello. 

184
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,430
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

185
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,780
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

186
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,190
Isn't Team Leader Yang at work yet?

187
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,720
I guess Team Leader took the day off.

188
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,890
- "Took the day off"? 
 - Yes.

189
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,750
- I'll leave the coffee in case. 
 - Sure.

190
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,860
   

191
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,200
   

192
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,980
   

193
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,680
   

194
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,030
March 6.

195
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,430
Today?

196
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,260
 The customer cannot answer your call right now. 

197
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,130
   

198
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,620
   

199
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,190
- Where do you go? 
 - Tell Chief I'll find Team Leader Yang.

200
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,080
You said you didn't find him. Where will you go?

201
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,780
I have a hunch.

202
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,720
Don't strike out; just stay put.

203
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,610
If he's off today to meet a headhunter, he's already gone.

204
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,750
Chief Song put it on you so you'll fail, to mess with you.

205
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,840
It's more reason I will make him stay.

206
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,190
So where do you go?

207
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,470
I'm sorry I called you all the way here.

208
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,900
It's nice and quiet here.

209
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,990
Thank you, it's cool here. 
    

210
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,910
You have much on your mind.

211
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,290
What most concerns you?

212
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,670
I've spent 22 years in this company.

213
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,390
It's not easy to start anew at my age.

214
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,230
I know.

215
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,150
Changing companies is hard,

216
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,760
especially for people who stayed with a company a long time.

217
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,350
But...

218
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,790
no company lasts a lifetime.

219
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,570
No one can predict changes.

220
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,950
They promoted another director now.

221
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,760
So Hansu Electronics won't invest as much in hardware.

222
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,660
Finally, who rules App Processors will rule the mobile market.

223
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,600
The answer is research into packaging technology. (QR codes, scanning)

224
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,700
My client will support your research and resource the technology needed.

225
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,290
It's rare to research freely with support

226
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,290
of your values and ideals.

227
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,660
Here are my client's proposed terms.

228
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,920
I am confident in this industry top-level offer.

229
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,320
All that's left is your decision.

230
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,720
I know this challenge is worth facing bravely.

231
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,570
Whom you face it with matters more than where.

232
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,620
Manager Yu.

233
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,630
I apologize for interrupting.

234
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,550
How did you know to come here?

235
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,250
It's your spot to think things over.

236
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,920
I'm Yu Eun Ho from Hansu Electronics.

237
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,610
I'm sorry to interrupt.

238
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,260
Team Leader Yang is vital to our company.

239
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,230
Please have a good chat, and let's talk when you're done.

240
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,370
I'll be waiting.

241
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,490
- Team Leader. 
 - CEO Kang.

242
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,730
I'm afraid today isn't the time.

243
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,790
Let's continue our talk later.

244
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,310
Take this...

245
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,880
Let's...

246
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,880
reconnect at the office. I-I'll call you.

247
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,230
You successfully interfered.

248
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,430
   

249
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,280
Manager Yu Eun Ho.

250
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,500
Team Leader Yang is our company's long-time dedicated member.

251
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,750
Stop shaking things up.

252
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,480
If you want to hold onto him, pay his worth.

253
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,950
A move worth your value to expand your career,

254
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,190
that's the market's logic.

255
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,020
Values can't be explained by market logic alone.

256
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,930
You can't understand since you steal key talent and make chaos.

257
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,390
I doubt Team Leader stayed all this time just for money.

258
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,890
An organization's loyalty and ethics

259
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,860
far exceed short-term personal gain.

260
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,950
How old-fashioned.

261
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,060
I'm sure you'll see it differently soon.

262
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,590
Companies never take responsibility for individuals.

263
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,000
   

264
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,800
   

265
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,910
   

266
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,470
Let's never meet again.

267
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,130
   

268
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,550
   

269
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,590
"Yu Eun Ho, Hansu Electronics."

270
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,610
   

271
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,070
Who's this?

272
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,960
What's up?

273
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,460
How did you all get together?

274
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,660
Here's more beer.

275
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,140
You came.

276
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,010
Team Leader Yang is finally here!

277
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,100
Enjoy the night. All the legendary developers are here.

278
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,020
- Have a seat. 
 - Sit down.

279
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,850
I'll bring more beer.

280
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,570
Great!

281
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,080
Fill your glasses!

282
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,500
Everyone! Cheers!

283
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,320
 Cheers! 

284
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,970
No one leaves early tonight.

285
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,080
Manager Yu, you're amazing.

286
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,970
Well, anyway... tell me what you want to say.

287
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,780
Sunbaenim.

288
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,260
Do you remember this?

289
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,240
Gosh, how could I forget this one?

290
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,410
It's the first phone I made for the company.

291
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,100
Was it version 6? Developers stayed up all night fixing the bugs.

292
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,880
Don't mention it. Just thinking of it...

293
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,340
It was absurd.

294
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,300
I thought this is it, and it would never launch.

295
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,350
This one's already second grade (8 years).

296
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,070
You can ensure it makes middle school and high school.

297
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,110
The company wants to write more history with you.

298
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,230
Please make hardware for the new series too.

299
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,720
If you're not fully sure of leaving,

300
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,210
please reconsider.

301
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,250
I'm sorry. I forgot I have an important appointment today.

302
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,930
Just a second.

303
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,300
Hello?

304
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,480
Yes! Of course, Daddy's on the way. It's my Eo Jin's first game.

305
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,970
Yes, yes. I'm almost there. Be there soon.

306
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,740
All right.

307
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,580
I'll give you a ride. Let's chat on the way.

308
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,530
Would you?

309
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,270
You're doing me favors when I broke my promise.

310
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,090
I just can't lose more points with my son.

311
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,250
It's okay.

312
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,980
Take a look while I drive. It's a new offer.

313
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,780
Thank you.

314
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,230
 Children love the food and pop your workplace sent. 

315
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,160
 - Dad, you're the best! 
 - Thank you! 

316
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,650
 - Dad, love you! 
 - We won, thanks to you! 

317
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,040
 Thanks, Dad! 

318
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,260
 - Uncle Eun Ho! 
 - Uncle! It's so fun! 

319
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,160
 Uncle, you're awesome! 

320
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
 Love you! 

321
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,320
 Uncle is the best! 

322
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,480
   

323
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,960
 - Thank you, CEO Kang. 
 - Yes. 

324
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,790
- I'll reach out. 
 - Yes, drive safely.

325
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,430
Yes.

326
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,470
 Eo Jin! 

327
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,900
Dad!

328
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,060
Dad!

329
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,200
- Dad! 
 - Aigoo, I'm sorry I'm late.

330
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,990
Thank you, Manager Yu.

331
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,080
 CEO Kang, let's forget the offer. 

332
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,530
 Cheers! 

333
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,960
Great work!

334
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,830
Great work!

335
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,140
Good job!

336
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,090
Thanks to Manager Yu, our HR department has an achievement.

337
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,310
How did you change Team Leader Yang's mind?

338
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,130
Sincerity always prevails. He really did great this time.

339
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:25,200
Is this the end of Yu Eun Ho's suffering?

340
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,700
I mean, I teared up when Manager Yu gathered

341
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,920
- all of Team Leader Yang's peers. 
 - Don't exaggerate.

342
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,870
I really cried!

343
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,290
Me, too.

344
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,260
Shall we drink to that?

345
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,090
 All right! 

346
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,920
- Cheers! 
 - Great work!

347
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,390
Aigoo, you're having so much fun.

348
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,420
It's great.

349
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,300
Why not put all this passion into work?

350
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,670
Sit.

351
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,420
So much chatter for nothing.

352
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,440
Yu Eun Ho didn't hang onto him.

353
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,900
Team Leader Yang gained a win.

354
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,960
Our company gave a very generous counteroffer.

355
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,480
You have no idea.

356
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,830
You've had plenty of rest. You should repay with hard work.

357
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:23,220
Do you recall how all worked overtime while Manager Yu was gone?

358
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,460
In any case, some people put in all the work,

359
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,510
and others just leech off the company.

360
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,720
Get your glasses. Let me pour.

361
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,290
Yes.

362
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,640
All right...

363
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,800
Thank you.

364
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,970
Thank you, my foot. Here.

365
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,410
- Thank you! 
 - Here.

366
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,830
Thank you.

367
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,730
Here.

368
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,930
Manager Kim, take some.

369
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,660
Y-Yes.

370
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,600
Chief Song.

371
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,130
I'll pour you a glass.

372
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,730
Here.

373
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,750
Yes.

374
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,930
Now our glasses are full; let's toast.

375
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,170
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

376
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,710
Good work.

377
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,400
- This one? 
 - Yes.

378
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,250
Careful.

379
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,500
Take care, Chief.

380
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,440
Hey, Eun Ho. Hey, Manager Yu!

381
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,770
Am I being unfair?

382
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,650
You knew what you would get when you returned.

383
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,130
Don't think you'll smooth things over somehow.

384
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,990
I'm barely getting started.

385
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,780
Let's go.

386
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,570
Goodbye.

387
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,800
He's gone. Stand up.

388
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,580
Want to drink more?

389
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,140
Right! We stayed out late tonight.

390
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,910
I'm leaving.

391
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,610
Okay, leave, Man.

392
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,560
You see her every day, and you still love it?

393
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,290
- You're here. 
 - I'm a little late.

394
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,000
It's okay.

395
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,780
- What about Byeol? 
 - She's just playing.

396
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,800
Byeol, Dad's here. Seo Jun, your uncle!

397
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,050
Seo Jun!

398
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,490
- Dad! 
 - Byeol!

399
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,820
Rock, paper, scissors! 
    

400
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,300
Aigoo, you got it.

401
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,570
Daddy!

402
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,040
Gosh, what a spectacle.

403
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,660
They say babysitting is a thankless job.

404
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,260
People would think I yell at them all day.

405
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,970
Gosh, Grandma.

406
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,240
I'm so thankful. I know childcare is tough.

407
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,750
Thank you for today.

408
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,760
- Byeol's dad, you're the only one who knows. 
 - What's this?

409
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,870
This is for Seo Jun.

410
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,040
You must be tired. Go on home and take this.

411
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,520
I'm thankful you watch Byeol, and we get side dishes every time.

412
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,020
You pay me. I'm just doing as much you pay me.

413
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,440
Then I'll enjoy these.

414
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,910
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

415
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,800
 See you later. 

416
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,450
See you!

417
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,850
Byeol, your bag.

418
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,610
Aigoo, see her carrying her stuff.

419
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,300
Okay.

420
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,380
Bye!

421
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,660
- Bye, Byeol! 
 - Bye bye!

422
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,870
- Good night! 
 - Thanks.

423
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,600
- Okay... bye! 
 - Goodbye!

424
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,220
Don't eat it all.

425
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,500
He's so kind.

426
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,540
Yes, he's a good dad.

427
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,330
A good dad could be a good husband.

428
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,900
Stop with the nonsense, Mom.

429
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,270
Seo Jun, let's brush your teeth.

430
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,400
"Nonsense"?

431
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,120
It'd be perfect if they'd rely on each other, not live alone.

432
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,430
So why does Chief Song hate Manager Yu so much?

433
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,100
He's the best in HR Dept.

434
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,220
Not just anyone could be the youngest manager.

435
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,660
Is it really because he took a parental leave?

436
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,590
In this day and age?

437
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,620
Chief is so old-fashioned.

438
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,990
It's not for parental leave.

439
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,650
Chief takes revenge.

440
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,730
Before his leave, they prepared an HR system overhaul.

441
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,390
The Chairman personally ordered it. Chief put a ton of effort into it.

442
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:47,000
   

443
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,150
Hey. They move forward with the HR management system we prepared!

444
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,740
- Chief! 
 - Eun Ho!

445
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,030
 Chief thought he'd finally be 

446
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,500
 the Chairman's favorite, not Director Kim. 

447
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,490
- Just a second, I have a call. 
  - But Manager Yu went on leave, 

448
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,660
 and it all fell apart. 

449
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,890
 Yes, Principal. What is it? 

450
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,230
What?

451
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,900
Today Seo Jun's mom led an art exercise with the children.

452
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,720
And...

453
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,670
Byeol's drawings...

454
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,880
Excuse me, Mr. Yu.

455
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,060
Byeol has almost stopped talking.

456
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,460
Did you know?

457
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,820
Are you in your right mind?

458
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,980
This was ordered by the Chairman himself!

459
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,130
Ours over Chief Kim's!

460
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,570
I'm sorry. I'll make sure I transition out perfectly.

461
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:06,330
I put all my faith in you with this project.

462
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,200
Yu Eun Ho, make the right decision.

463
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,730
Do you know what you're throwing away right now?

464
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,010
If we wrap this up neatly, it'll be an easy life for us.

465
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,410
You can take a parental leave later.

466
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,780
Chief, actually...

467
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,040
Byeol is sick.

468
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,060
See this scoundrel thinks he's so special.

469
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,250
Are you the only parent in the world?

470
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:45,050
So what if your child is sick? Is only your child precious?

471
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,960
She is precious.

472
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,440
Hey, Yu Eun Ho!

473
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,960
You swine, if you leave now, never come back!

474
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,310
As long as I'm at this company, you'll never belong here!

475
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,940
He relied fully on Manager Yu and wanted to go along,

476
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,960
but he was found to be a phony.

477
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,930
Director Kim became the executive at the end.

478
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,820
Chief's promotion was postponed.

479
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,610
Wow, it was a mess.

480
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,740
It seems he waits for a chance to get back at Manager Yu.

481
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,540
Aigoo, Yu Eun Ho's life... is so dynamic.

482
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,590
Why did Manager Yu have to get married so young?

483
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:38,440
I mean, how is his child already aged seven? With his good looks.

484
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,600
It makes no sense. He's totally my type!

485
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,170
Gosh, here we go again.

486
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,050
Why do we always get a new employee like her?

487
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,660
Seriously, Yu Eun Ho's face is guilty.

488
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,960
It's his face's fault,

489
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,210
guilty for having a face like that.

490
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,750
   

491
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,260
   

492
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,670
   

493
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,050
Byeol, let's eat.

494
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,190
Madam Byeol, what hair do you want today?

495
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,550
Whatever you want, Daddy.

496
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,260
Whatever I want?

497
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,060
In that case, number three?

498
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,640
Wow, you look so pretty.

499
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,070
Okay, let's go!

500
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,350
Rock, paper, scissors!

501
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,210
 I won't lose tomorrow. 

502
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,150
 Let's go! Wait, Seo Jun... wait. 

503
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,040
Listen to the teacher. Got it? Let's go.

504
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,390
Don't run, Seo Jun!

505
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,500
 Don't run! 

506
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,610
- Good morning! 
 - Good morning!

507
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,430
Hello.

508
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,950
- Bye bye! 
 - Bye!

509
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,070
Fighting!

510
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,010
Bye!

511
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,740
My Woo Rim woke up early to see Ju Mi.

512
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,750
- So diligent! 
 - Gosh, he knows she's pretty.

513
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,090
Look, look. Byeol's dad.

514
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,850
Where? Where?

515
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,420
Hello.

516
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,480
Byeol's dad, hello.

517
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,040
Hello.

518
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,510
Byeol, fighting!

519
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,880
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Byeol's dad.

520
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,740
- Hi, Seong Jin. 
 - Hello!

521
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,690
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry!

522
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,300
Are you okay?

523
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,740
Yes...

524
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,810
Thank you.

525
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,570
Thank you. See you again.

526
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,260
Are you okay?

527
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,950
   

528
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,700
 I don't want to do this. 

529
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,100
Hello, everyone! Ciao, hi, aloha!

530
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,270
What?

531
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,020
What's wrong? What's with the vibe?

532
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,770
What is it?

533
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,210
What? What's going on?

534
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,320
Jeong Nam made a candidate recommendation with falsified records.

535
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,300
- Aigoo... 
 - I think it'll be a crime drama.

536
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,890
- What do you think? 
 - Oh no.

537
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,290
- I think it's horror. 
 - Horror...

538
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,150
There will be screaming today.

539
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,270
I'm really innocent. I really didn't know.

540
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,380
If you didn't know the candidate's résumé was a lie, you're incompetent.

541
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,130
If you proceeded knowing, you're disqualified as a headhunter.

542
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,800
Which is it?

543
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,530
Hey, Go.

544
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,520
 Go Jeong Nam. 

545
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,590
   

546
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,560
It's Go Jeong Nam.

547
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,630
Fine. To be honest,

548
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,670
if we didn't say it, Hankook Group would have never known.

549
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,440
I didn't falsify the whole thing.

550
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,340
I just inflated it here and there.

551
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,450
So you're not qualified.

552
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,130
You told us to step up.

553
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,050
You kept grilling us about our performance!

554
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,990
Jeong Nam!

555
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,630
You closed one placement last month.

556
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,810
You've been here for six months, and you're still adjusting?

557
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,770
A headhunter for five years, strategy specialist, 
    

558
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:05,730
makes many placements annually, excels at client relations.

559
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,190
Where's this guy I hired?

560
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,570
Did you build this résumé the same as you inflated the candidate's?

561
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,110
Go Nam Jeong!

562
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,660
Go Jeong Nam.

563
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,820
It's Go Jeong Nam.

564
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,910
Go Jeong Nam.

565
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:41,520
You've never once said my name correctly.

566
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,800
I don't work with unqualified people.

567
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,120
Let's end this then,

568
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,910
here or at another search firm.

569
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,900
Director Seo, handle his termination.

570
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,740
Deputy...

571
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,250
Take over his work and find a new candidate.

572
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,210
Review the job description accurately, make a new list,

573
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,940
and clean the crap the ex-team member left behind.

574
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,430
Director Woo, see me.

575
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,270
Shall we?

576
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,030
Did you check the candidate list sent to Hankook Group?

577
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,970
I believe you were in charge, Director Woo.

578
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,320
I tend to leave it up to them.

579
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,250
They're not children, after all.

580
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,330
They should learn to handle things.

581
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,780
So that's why he inflated the candidate's résumé.

582
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,870
They were left to their own devices.

583
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,680
I feel such pity.

584
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,590
He must have wanted the project to succeed so badly. Don't you think?

585
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,720
Don't you know Hankook Group is one of our key clients?

586
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,220
If we lose their trust and their contract, are you accountable?

587
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,420
They already opened the task to other firms. It used to be ours exclusively!

588
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,340
If we don't hit this month's sales target...

589
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,320
Failing the sales target this month...

590
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,130
will mainly be due to missing

591
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:38,950
Team Leader Yang of Hansu Electronics.

592
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,880
It was a sure thing. Who lost him again?

593
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,020
That scared me!

594
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,450
You know I grew up like royalty and get scared easily.

595
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,140
What's with you?

596
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,510
Please treat me with care.

597
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,920
Why did I agree to take Director Woo?

598
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,200
Money talks, money talks.

599
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,310
Thanks to that, CEO Kang got investment, and I got freedom.

600
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,170
Right? Noona?

601
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,010
This is hard.

602
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm so tired.

603
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,690
I want to go home.

604
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,420
What? You got a paper cut?

605
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,470
Gosh, you should be careful.

606
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,370
Lost candidate, sales drop, a paper cut...

607
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,940
seems nothing goes as planned.

608
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,500
What? Did you and Director Woo conspire?

609
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,360
Here. 
    

610
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,020
It's a new draft of this month's sales plan.

611
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:04,050
We will earn the target if we really work hard.

612
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,760
I'm leaving.

613
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,860
   

614
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,400
   

615
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,030
This thing here brings me bad luck.

616
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,640
   

617
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,780
Isn't the company-wide meeting at four?

618
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,800
Better start preparing for the meeting.

619
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,280
- Yes. 
 - Yong Hee,

620
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,500
I just sent you an email. Please take a look.

621
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,360
Excuse me, Manager Yu...

622
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,620
Well, Chief said you do the meeting prep, Manager Yu.

623
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,490
Oh, hand it over. I'll do it.

624
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,490
I was the photocopy god when I first started.

625
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:36,010
   

626
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,420
Manager Yu, you can leave.

627
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,310
You don't need to attend this meeting.

628
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:54,910
You don't get it anyway.

629
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:59,290
You're out of the loop since you took a long time off.

630
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:06,840
Manager Kim Dong Hwi, what's the status of the task force now?

631
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,680
Did you find any external experts?

632
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,100
Oh, that's...

633
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,230
Hastily bringing in external experts could entirely erase the brand's identity.

634
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,150
It's far more effective to gather skilled internal talent to build the team.

635
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,340
For instance,

636
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,100
Product Development Team 2's Ahn Hyeon Soo might not be a perfect fit—

637
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,930
Manager Yu.

638
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,060
I'm going crazy.

639
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,280
What are you doing?

640
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,470
Do you think I want your opinion?

641
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,610
Geez...

642
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:07,000
Manager Kim says he will showcase his talents.

643
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,600
Manager Kim will continue the presentation.

644
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,840
Let's start the meeting.

645
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:36,740
I'll take an iced blended double chocolate,

646
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,350
lots of cream, salt bread, a streusel,

647
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,710
- and a financier too. 
 - Yes.

648
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,640
Are you a child? Look how much cream...

649
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,340
Speak for yourself.

650
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,170
I quit smoking. I need to get married.

651
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,800
Wow, all grown up.

652
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,620
You got married, had a baby, then divorced all in your twenties.

653
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,240
I should at least try one of those.

654
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,260
But are you okay?

655
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,440
I seriously can't take this. I really need to turn this in today.

656
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,870
You won't even hold me back anymore?

657
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,860
Hurry and spit it out.

658
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,640
Byeol's tuition, living expenses,

659
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,340
debt payments, retirement,

660
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,970
cost of the babysitter, savings...

661
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,180
Want me to keep going?

662
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,630
Yes, if I quit now, I'd be crazy.

663
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,410
Yes! You're a crazy one.

664
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:49,280
You really love to be first to try anything.

665
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,370
Of our friends, you've done it all first:

666
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,340
first marriage, first child,

667
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:56,750
first divorce, first promotion, first parental leave.

668
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,460
Amazing, so amazing.

669
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:03,230
Don't be first to get fired.

670
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,510
I didn't even do anything wrong.

671
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,990
But why do I feel I messed up?

672
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,250
Just a second.

673
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,170
CEO Kang, the company you mentioned the other day...

674
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,180
Oh, let me call you back.

675
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,390
- Manager Yu, are you doing all right? 
 - Yes.

676
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:39,350
I'm running to an appointment. Sorry.

677
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,500
I told you over and over again

678
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,860
that a CEO who stays late isn't too attractive.

679
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,120
Let's go. I'm hungry.

680
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,550
I'm not hungry.

681
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,630
Here's why you don't feel hunger.

682
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:50,940
Is this food? How many coffees have you had today?

683
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,490
Why are you nagging so much?

684
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,960
Do you want to die early?

685
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,740
Unnie.

686
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,750
Why do you obsess that I eat? It's no big deal.

687
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,510
You need regular meals for health.

688
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:09,800
You need to be healthy to work for a long time.

689
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,560
So then I can make money.

690
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,720
I have so much debt to pay.

691
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,110
Till then, don't get sick or die.

692
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,850
Jeong Nam's resignation was processed.

693
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,720
Jeong Nam? Who?

694
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,460
Gosh, go easy on the employees.

695
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,510
Call them by their right names, too.

696
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,310
You read a candidate's résumé once to remember it.

697
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,140
Why can't you recall our employees?

698
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,020
What's with that? Is it intentional?

699
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,060
I lack energy to care. I have too much to focus on already.

700
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,850
Oh my. Listen.

701
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:56,250
Interest and care for employees keeps a company running smoothly.

702
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,230
Do you want to oust staff and work alone?

703
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,350
Not everyone is like you.

704
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,960
People err, but if you trust and wait for them...

705
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,740
Trusting and waiting only sets you back.

706
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,080
No wonder our staff are lazy with a softie director.

707
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,430
- I should fire you first. 
 - Kang Ji Yun.

708
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,950
I don't run a company to nurture staff.

709
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,220
- Keep it simple and work. 
 - You—

710
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,100
I thought you had loans to pay.

711
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,790
Keep this up, and everyone will leave you.

712
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,150
- I'll have money left. 
 - What's the point of all money?

713
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,480
Do I need a point?

714
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,330
The more money, the better.

715
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,360
   

716
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,500
 Ji Yun. 

717
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,400
 Kang Ji Yun. 

718
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,540
Hey, Yu Eun Ho. You really didn't know?

719
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,920
Team Leader Yang pulled a fast one on us!

720
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,400
He resigned and left for a Chinese company!

721
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,060
A new project, the bonus, and counteroffer!

722
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,980
He ate up everything!

723
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:24,900
Didn't he intentionally drag time to leak new project data?

724
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,780
Hey. Find which company Team Leader Yang moved to. Hurry!

725
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,810
Hey, Yu Eun Ho. You really don't know anything?

726
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,050
What do you mean?

727
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,770
Did you conspire with Team Leader Yang

728
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:40,320
for time to leak data?

729
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,640
If by any chance,

730
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,510
any data was leaked,

731
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,100
you won't escape responsibility.

732
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,210
Brace yourself.

733
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,680
 Your call cannot be connected. After the tone... 

734
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:13,810
Team Leader, this is Yu Eun Ho. Please call me back.

735
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,830
 CEO Kang, the company you mentioned the other day... 

736
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:26,240
 Oh, let me call you back. 

737
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,730
Dong Hwi, the search firm that tried to scout Team Leader Yang,

738
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:35,160
what company was it? Can you text me their address?

739
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,070
Thank you.

740
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,860
   

741
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:24,830
Gosh, I got confused again.

742
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,480
Why is he here?

743
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,140
CEO.

744
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,130
CEO Kang!

745
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,340
Did you do that?

746
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,250
Moving Team Leader Yang to China—

747
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,600
Where is he right now?

748
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,780
Are you saying I sent Team Leader Yang to China?

749
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,070
Don't you care about your candidates' reputations?

750
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:04,570
You make money switching people's jobs? How much is your commission anyway?

751
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:07,740
It's not small coins. I earn it by managing people's lives.

752
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,540
CEO!

753
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,820
If Team Leader Yang moves to China,

754
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,350
his career is ruined, and he can't work in Korea again.

755
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,770
Is this how headhunters operate?

756
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:19,990
Have you any conscience?

757
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,800
Look here, Yu Eun Ho.

758
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,180
Don't dare talk nonsense.

759
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,580
 I'm at the airport, Manager Yu. 

760
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,240
 I'm sorry about this. 

761
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,460
Hey, look—

762
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,880
I'm not done talking—

763
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,250
Yu Eun Ho!

764
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,250
Manager Yu Eun Ho...

765
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,990
Hey!

766
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,720
 No, Team Leader. 

767
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,700
 I don't recommend it. 

768
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,340
 You should protect the career you've built. 

769
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,320
 Moving to China now might cast doubt on your reputation. 

770
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,210
 Don't choose what shames a developer. 

771
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:09,310
 I should have listened to CEO Kang back then. 

772
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:11,140
 Hang in there even if you are in hard times. 

773
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,750
 That's how opportunities come around again. 

774
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,050
 CEO Kang, the company you mentioned the other day... 

775
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,200
 Oh, let me call you back. 

776
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,390
How far did she go this time?

777
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,220
She's an embarrassment to all headhunters.

778
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,280
There are a million reasons to switch jobs. 
    

779
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,040
A cornered mouse bites a cat.

780
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,030
Survive first when there's no escape route.

781
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,200
Yes.

782
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,690
   

783
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:55,500
Not all headhunters are the same.

784
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,130
Yes.

785
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,690
Team Leader...

786
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,510
Team Leader!

787
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,760
Team Leader!

788
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,720
Team Leader.

789
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,750
I'm sorry.

790
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,780
Manager Yu?

791
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,420
   

792
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,130
   

793
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,220
Leaking the technology?

794
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:37,260
I never saw the technology to leak it.

795
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,280
I was taken off the project instantly.

796
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,120
I thought they kept and needed me,

797
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,390
but was labeled a traitor

798
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,370
who tried to switch to a competitor.

799
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:51,550
They thought it was better to keep me than let me go,

800
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:54,060
even if I end up doing nothing.

801
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,230
I'm going because I want to work.

802
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:03,590
Being paid for doing nothing while living in dread,

803
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:07,310
I couldn't be my son's role model.

804
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,440
I can't help if people misunderstand me.

805
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,700
I don't...

806
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,370
plan to work in Korea again.

807
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,340
I'm sorry.

808
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,180
I had no idea.

809
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:33,150
It's okay. You obeyed orders without knowing.

810
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:38,160
I worry you'll bear the impact due to me.

811
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,910
 Don't work too hard, Manager Yu. 

812
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:56,640
 In the company's view, we're just 

813
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,720
 disposable. 

814
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:03,420
 We are discarded when no longer useful. 

815
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,870
 There's no shortage of 

816
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,400
 new replacements. 

817
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,560
- Hey. 
 - Where are you, Man?

818
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:24,700
The Audit Team is tearing apart your computer and your desk to investigate.

819
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,610
 What's going on? 

820
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:28,840
Did you see Team Leader Yang?

821
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:36,140
Team Leader Yang went to China.

822
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:41,520
Eun Ho.

823
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,830
I think you've really fallen into Chief Song's trap.

824
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,730
That Chief Song

825
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:49,170
wanted a reason to take you down now.

826
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,330
 Eun Ho. Yu Eun Ho. 

827
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:04,100
 Are you listening? Yu Eun Ho! 

828
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,600
   

829
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,260
   

830
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:49,050
   

831
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,530
 Director Seo. 

832
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,100
 Director Seo. 

833
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,720
 Director Seo! 

834
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,170
It's wrong. You should have checked before emailing me. 
    

835
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,590
 Director Seo. 

836
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,090
 - Before sending it to me, please review it again. 
 - Director Seo. 

837
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:12,100
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Hey. 

838
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,160
   

839
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,160
O-Occupied.

840
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:29,400
 Director Seo, where did I put the IT client list I wrote last month? 

841
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,690
 Also, Director Seo, reprint this month's sales plan. Okay? 

842
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,450
- Open up. 
 - I'm not Seo Mi Ae.

843
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:38,630
Mi Ae. Seo Mi Ae!

844
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,790
Hurry!

845
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,950
 Director Seo. 

846
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:01,720
 Director Seo. 

847
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,930
 Director Seo Mi Ae. 

848
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,780
Unnie.

849
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:14,830
Yes.

850
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:22,260
Stop calling me. I can't get work done due to you. I'm dying!

851
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,010
What's up this time? What?

852
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:26,450
Where's my cell phone?

853
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:35,540
Where is it? I hear it. Where?

854
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:38,110
- Where is it? 
 - It's vibrating.

855
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,730
Hey. Why is it in here?

856
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:50,880
Crazy...

857
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:55,850
The CEO of SP Securities will be dismissed.

858
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:58,680
We need to act fast before it's a public open call.

859
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,840
Call Director Kim and—

860
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,770
Call Director Kim and arrange a meeting at once.

861
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,260
- Unnie, my purse. 
 - Your purse is right here.

862
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,750
Take it. I'll call...

863
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,690
   

864
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:18,130
 Oh, seriously! 

865
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:26,080
 I would end you if you weren't good at your job! 

866
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:31,160
Wait a second. That just ruined her schedule for the day.

867
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,990
Love it.

868
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:36,140
 So thrilling. 

869
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,730
Anyone with free time?

870
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:46,980
Today it is! I must see you today! Today!

871
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:49,860
It's today! Yes!

872
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,750
So no one.

873
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:02,510
I'll be working late again.

874
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:08,290
Gosh, my lovely Kang Ji Yun...

875
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:23,160
Gyeong Hwa, get it together.

876
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,820
My gosh. Let's see...

877
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,230
CEO Kang, let's not change this schedule. Please.

878
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,460
What? Wh-Why are you back?

879
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,190
- I need to review more materials. 
 - Hey.

880
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,340
You're a zombie right now. Go home.

881
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:15,260
Eat delicious food and get some sleep like the others.

882
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,440
Do those things like normal people.

883
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,900
Will you review them with me?

884
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,350
CEO, good luck.

885
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,900
Good luck.

886
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,900
I think I'm getting a cold.

887
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:34,650
I can't help it. I can't deal with it today.

888
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,180
Kang Ji Yun!

889
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,520
   

890
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,080
- CEO Kang! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

891
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,400
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

892
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,200
Where is she?

893
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:02,780
CEO Kang... No.

894
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,900
S-Sorry.

895
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,100
Where is she?

896
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:11,640
"Kim Ha Na," no.

897
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,560
No one.

898
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,120
"Kang Ji Yun."

899
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,830
Kang Ji Yun, Kang Ji Yun!

900
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:24,750
Director Seo? What happened?

901
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,780
Why are you here?

902
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:33,310
Let me see. I heard you fainted. But you look fine.

903
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,890
Don't overreact. I'm fine.

904
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,680
- Patient Kang Ji Yun? 
 - Yes.

905
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,300
- The doctor will see you now. 
 - Yes.

906
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:45,160
C-Cognitive overload? Mental fatigue?

907
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,790
It's simply central nervous system overload

908
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:51,860
that protests to its owner to stop it.

909
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:56,090
Protesting? Why is it so weak? How can the brain be so weak?

910
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:59,900
It's not weak. You've overtaxed your brain

911
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:04,330
and caused neural abnormalities due to stress.

912
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:06,960
Recently, you're confused about names,

913
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,460
have brain fog, or say things you don't mean.

914
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,020
- Do you have those symptoms? 
 - Exactly.

915
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,700
I suspect also severe insomnia.

916
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,040
Unbelievable! So it's because you're ill?

917
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,550
Don't overstress and work less.

918
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:27,000
What about me? Am I overloaded at all?

919
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,710
Honestly, I'm more stressed than she is right now!

920
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,630
- Sit down. 
 - You see how serious it is.

921
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:34,330
I know, let's talk later. Have a seat.

922
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,750
We're at the hospital.

923
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:43,390
 ­  

924
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:47,350
She hasn't budged today.

925
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,240
It's already been three hours.

926
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,020
Let her be. That's how she relieves stress since high school.

927
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,740
She needs to de-stress.

928
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,860
Is CEO Kang's health fine?

929
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,730
It's due time she got ill.

930
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:03,760
Laboring alone without a secretary...

931
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,900
She's not made of steel. She can't endure it.

932
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,120
Has she still not got a secretary yet?

933
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,570
No.

934
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,990
I can't entrust her to just anyone.

935
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:18,270
She's so particular, you know.

936
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:21,000
Can you gossip about me when I'm not here?

937
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,140
You can hear all that?

938
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:25,400
I'm leaving; feel free to gossip all you want.

939
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,850
You're leaving?

940
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:28,620
Let's grab dinner together.

941
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:30,570
Why would I? You're on a date with your wife.

942
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:33,910
It's not a date. We were invited to a Hoobae's house.

943
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:36,560
He's a great cook. Come with us.

944
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,490
Yes, come with us.

945
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:41,800
You know I don't go for stuff like that. I'm leaving.

946
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,650
Wait a second.

947
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,920
 Going up. 

948
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,640
   

949
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:46,340
 The door is closing. 

950
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,370
 Going up. 

951
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,570
 What? Why is he here? 

952
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,440
 The door is closing. 

953
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:28,690
 Going up. 

954
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,000
Hello, CEO.

955
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,780
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

956
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:52,380
You're here.

957
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,060
What? He's here, too.

958
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,940
Eun Ho.

959
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:49,950


960
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,260
Say hello. This is the CEO of Peoplez, Kang Ji Yun.

961
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,150
Hello.

962
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,240
I'm Yu Eun Ho.

963
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:13,630
Say hi. This is Yu Eun Ho, your secretary from now on.

964
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,030
- S-Secretary? 
 - Yes.

965
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:25,330
Good morning, CEO Kang.

966
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,760
♫  How are you feeling?  ♫

967
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,620
♫  How are you feeling?  ♫

968
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,910
   

969
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:51,240
♫  Yes, I'll dive in deep into your heart  ♫

970
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:56,720
♫  Babe, living inside of my heart  ♫

971
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:01,870
♫  I know you mean it's all right  ♫

972
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:06,720
♫  I heard your heart beating loud  ♫

973
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,440
♫  Because your whispers tickle my mind  ♫

974
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,080
 How is he my secretary? 

975
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,930
 Why the heck do you dislike Eun Ho? 

976
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:15,460
 - Coffee. 
 - He's here as my secretary. I should like him. 

977
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,090
 But I say I don't like him. 

978
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,900
 - Did I just get fired? 
 - Never! 

979
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:23,600
 When CEO Kang moves, pay attention to all directions. Got it? 

980
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,230
 So you'll really be my secretary, Yu Eun Ho? 

981
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,970
 Let's stop wasting time. 

982
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,700
 I hate to spend energy on useless things like this. 

983
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,370
 I can do anything you ask of me. 

984
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:40,280
 So please judge me as only your secretary.
