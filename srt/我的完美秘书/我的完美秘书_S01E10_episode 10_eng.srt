00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,320
    
 ♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,340
♫  I don't know why I'm being like this  ♫

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,180
    
 ♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,120
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,600
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,100
♫  Though it might be sudden  ♫

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,000
   

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,010
♫  So just test me, I'll tell you  ♫

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,930
♫  My sincere feelings for you  ♫

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,390
♫  Yes, whenever it is, just tell me  ♫

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,700
♫  Whatever it is, I can do it  ♫

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,010
    
 ♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,180
   

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,060
   

15
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,852
The child that...

16
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,637
your father saved...

17
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,919
that was me.

18
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,005
What...

19
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,092
are you saying right now?

20
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,930
There was a huge fire

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,517
in my childhood home.

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,688
My bedroom door was blocked so I couldn't get out.

23
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,524
Then someone came to save me.

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,600
Right before the building collapsed,

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,300
he handed me over to a firefighter.

26
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,582
I survived thanks to him.

27
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,297
I kept looking for his family,

28
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,966
and I learned his name recently,

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,900
Mr. Kang Gyeong Tae.

30
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,739
Are you certain?

31
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,328
Are you sure you checked properly?

32
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,707
It makes no sense.

33
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,880
Eun Ho, how can you be...

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,830
the one my dad...

35
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,443
This is impossible.

36
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,187
I need some rest.

37
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,232
Please go.

38
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,971
Why did it have to be you, Eun Ho? Why?

39
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,820
I resented my dad so much.

40
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,811
I hated him very much!

41
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,480
You shouldn't...

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,399
You shouldn't have told me.

43
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,901
You...

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,319
You should have kept it from me.

45
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,791
Eun Ho, how...

46
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,002
How am I...

47
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,508
How...

48
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,970
How can I be with you?

49
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,000
   

50
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,870
   

51
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:10,745
What with the sunglasses?

52
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,813
- Do you have a sty or something? 
 - It's sunny outside.

53
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,753
What? It's cloudy. 
    

54
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,004
Eun Ho!

55
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,830
Eun Ho, can we talk for a second?

56
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,716
Sure.

57
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,558
- One month? 
 - See?

58
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,627
I knew you wouldn't be paying attention.

59
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,855
You're too busy with romance to notice time passing, right?

60
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,274
Our initial agreement was six months.

61
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,860
You have a little more than a month left, to be exact,

62
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,196
but I'm sure you need some time to think.

63
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,756
I wanted to mention it ahead of time.

64
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,100
I see. Thank you.

65
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,331
And our initial agreement was to find a position for you.

66
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,800
If you want a position elsewhere, don't hesitate to let me know.

67
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,089
Of course, I want to hold on to you tightly and keep working together,

68
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,000
but that's what I want.

69
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Discuss it with Ji Yun and let me know.

70
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,306
Okay.

71
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,642
Let me think about it and let you know.

72
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,942
Maybe Ji Yun won't want to let you go and cling to you.

73
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,335
Let me know anytime.

74
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,204
Candidate Jang Seo Yeong with a legal background.

75
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,039
She used to be a prosecutor at Seoul Central

76
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,083
and was on the legal team at Haesun Electronics.

77
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,461
Now, she works as the CEO of an IT corporation.

78
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,173
She is known for excellence in risk management.

79
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,258
Lastly, candidate Oh Min Seok.

80
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,926
He went through a graduate program in law

81
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,971
and got his license at Herald Law School.

82
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,433
He was in charge of mergers and acquisitions at a large domestic law firm

83
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:59,479
and was hired as the youngest CEO ever at a game company three years ago.

84
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,565
Both have what we're seeking.

85
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,859
Let's meet with each of them.

86
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,028
Secretary Yu, please schedule those meetings.

87
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,451
Okay, understood.

88
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,894
- Meeting over. 
 - Meeting over!

89
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,687
Great work.

90
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,870
   

91
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,080
Go Jeong Nam!

92
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,165
Manager! Over here, over here.

93
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,900
How come you look younger since I last saw you?

94
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,628
I saw you in the distance and thought you were a college student.

95
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,839
I knew people were staring at me.

96
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,365
- Sit, sit. 
 - Please sit.

97
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:55,803
- You grilled the meat so well. 
 - That's right.

98
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,500
So how have you been?

99
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,101
After you left the company like that, I felt terrible.

100
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, I...

101
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,880
left the industry completely.

102
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,600
I doubt it was a good fit for me.

103
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,970
Now, I'm learning at a small company introduced to me.

104
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,739
Really? I see.

105
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,824
Right, the type of work doesn't matter.

106
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,410
It matters that you're working.

107
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,870
- Have a drink. 
 - Yes, Sir.

108
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,596
- Let me pour you a glass. 
 - Sure.

109
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,031
Long time, no see.

110
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,374
Thank you for making the time.

111
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,626
I should be thanking you.

112
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,640
- Have a glass. 
 - Yes.

113
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,423
How about you? Are you very busy these days?

114
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,966
I saw the article.

115
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,636
Peoplez is handling the Next CEO case, right?

116
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,931
Peoplez is still doing well, I see.

117
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,267
Have you started the candidate search?

118
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,645
If we were still looking, we wouldn't be Peoplez.

119
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,837
We're already contacting candidates.

120
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:49,048
- "Already"? 
 - Yes.

121
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,800
CEO Kang is so fast.

122
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,663
She's not just fast. She is a step ahead of everyone.

123
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:57,900
- I'm always surprised. 
 - Really?

124
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,643
This time, too, she didn't just find management specialists,

125
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,995
but lawyers, media people...

126
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,829
people like that...

127
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,918
No, no.

128
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,710
These are trade secrets.

129
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,500
Hyungnim! That's important, certainly.

130
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,262
Yes, CEO. Peoplez isn't focused just on management specialists,

131
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:25,001
but people with law or media backgrounds.

132
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,436
- You're sure this time? 
 -  Yes, I am. 

133
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,481
I confirmed it with a current Peoplez employee.

134
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,600
Okay.

135
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
Then from the Peoplez database you have,

136
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,824
list her possible lawyers and media aces for me.

137
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,492
Don't forget this is your last chance.

138
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,707
Wow, how scary.

139
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,668
No one would ever want to be your enemy.

140
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,588
But what did CEO Kang Ji Yun do to make you hate her so much

141
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,882
that you bully her at every angle? 
    

142
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,983
Why? Is what we prepare not enough?

143
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,763
If I'm taking it from her,

144
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,933
I might as well leave nothing behind.

145
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,400
Things are moving along, right?

146
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,895
Of course! We can't have any trouble.

147
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,439
We have a lot at stake.

148
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,705
Please come in.

149
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,458
Hello, I'm from Econic Bio.

150
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,585
- CEO Park Yeong Min. 
 - Nice to meet you.

151
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,211
- I'm Kang Ji Yun. 
 - Yes.

152
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,463
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay.

153
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,560
Wow. Nice office.

154
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,346
You're amazing.

155
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,516
I was recommended search firms, and everyone talked about Peoplez.

156
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,770
I heard you're in negotiations for the Next CEO position.

157
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,300
News travels fast.

158
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,357
You must be busy, but please take good care of our company.

159
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,359
It doesn't compare to Next,

160
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,779
but we have many future investments, contracts,

161
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,964
and great morale right now.

162
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:05,493
We struggled for years after getting the patent for the new drug compound.

163
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,600
We're finally seeing the light.

164
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,830
I heard you may sign a technology contract with a German pharmaceutical company.

165
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,790
Yes, with news of the contract, many want to invest.

166
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,168
It's overwhelming.

167
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,586
We had investment advisors too.

168
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,631
They said to build a strong foundation these days.

169
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,175
Until the new drug is commercialized,

170
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,943
we will focus on development.

171
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:26,138
Please recommend great researchers.

172
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,931
Sure.

173
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,800
   

174
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,323
Why aren't you going inside?

175
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:48,076
Please go ahead.

176
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,950
   

177
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,624
- What? Were you alone? 
 - Yes. Why?

178
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:58,003
Eun Ho left without coming in.

179
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,255
Oh, really?

180
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,924
You guys are so thorough.

181
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,726
In case people suspect something if you're in the break room together?

182
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,973
Have you talked to Eun Ho about his employment?

183
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,140
What did he decide?

184
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,392
- "Employment"? 
 - Yes.

185
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,800
Hasn't Eun Ho talked to you?

186
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,500
His contract ends soon. I told him to discuss it with you.

187
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,524
It's that time already.

188
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,822
Did you two fight?

189
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,948
Did something happen?

190
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,245
- Unnie. 
 - Yes?

191
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,329
Do you want to get some soju?

192
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,000
How can that person be Eun Ho?

193
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,600
Do we call this destiny or tragic fate?

194
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,544
My dad is so relentless.

195
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,273
It wasn't enough to leave me lonely like this.

196
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,319
I'm finally trying not to be alone,

197
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:08,589
and here Dad is again.

198
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:14,904
So what will you do?

199
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,924
Just keep dating him.

200
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,134
Keep dating him. What's the issue?

201
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,845
To be blunt, it's not Eun Ho's fault that your dad died.

202
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,300
Hey, isn't it a good thing that your dad saved Eun Ho?

203
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,708
I've resented Dad most of my life.

204
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,906
I still don't understand his choice.

205
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,617
Stop resenting him.

206
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,494
Stop hating him.

207
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,767
That Seo Mi Ae...

208
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,894
When you said

209
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,260
two people made you who you are today...

210
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Is one of them my dad?

211
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,204
"Don't give up."

212
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,959
"Survive, no matter what."

213
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,005
That's what your father told me that day, Ji Yun.

214
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,339
Those words stayed with me.

215
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,386
Every time I felt like crumbling,

216
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,513
I heard his voice and kept going.

217
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,293
That's why who I am today...

218
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,186
and Byeol...

219
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,206
can exist.

220
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,541
 Ji Yun. 

221
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,400
 Ji Yun. 

222
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,000
 To me, you're number one in this world, Ji Yun. 

223
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,227
 Not this one. 

224
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,939
Not this either.

225
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,109
Not this one!

226
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,196
Byeol, what outfit are you looking for?

227
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,365
You look pretty in the one you're wearing.

228
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,493
No, it's not good enough.

229
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,444
What do you mean by "not good enough"? You look like a princess to me.

230
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:27,081
A princess doesn't dress like this.

231
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,800
Byeol, you are so pretty, not due to your clothes.

232
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,257
Let's just wear this.

233
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,383
We're both late.

234
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,635
- All you care about is work. 
 - Pardon?

235
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,262
You don't know anything.

236
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,889
I hate you, Dad!

237
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,381
Wait...

238
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,435
Byeol.

239
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,520
Seol Ah, I like your outfit today.

240
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,107
- You look like a princess. 
 - Thanks.

241
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,984
Byeol,

242
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,195
is that what you're wearing today?

243
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,946
You don't look like a princess.

244
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,156
Aren't you coming to the party?

245
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,461
Today, it's Ji Yeong's birthday party.

246
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,297
- A princess party. 
 - I know.

247
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,633
Then are you going?

248
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,218
No, I won't.

249
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,236
Why not? All the girls are going.

250
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,602
It sounds boring.

251
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,813
I'll go to Uncle's bookstore to read.

252
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,606
I see.

253
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:47,692
 Kang Seok. 

254
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:50,167
- CEO Kang. 
 - Oh?

255
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,019
Unnie!

256
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,254
Hey, Byeol.

257
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,400
She seems excited to see you.

258
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,692
I don't know what happened, but Byeol seems sad today.

259
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,803
It's not like that.

260
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,888
Then why are you sighing so much

261
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,974
and not reading your favorite books?

262
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,326
What's wrong, Byeol? Did something upset you?

263
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,755
Let's talk over there.

264
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,007
What?

265
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,483
Is it a secret from me?

266
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,361
You're a boy. You won't understand.

267
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,656
Wow, I'm starting to get really sad.

268
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,242
Fine. Do some deep girl talk.

269
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,011
- Really? 
 - Yes.

270
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,379
Byeol, let's go!

271
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:21,573
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

272
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,893
♪  Happy birthday to you   ♪

273
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,789
♪  Happy birthday, dear Ji Yeong  ♪

274
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:31,058
B-Byeol...

275
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,392
I'm a little late.

276
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,019
Happy birthday, Ji Yeong.

277
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,021
Pardon? Oh...

278
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,856
Who...

279
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,624
Hello, I'm Byeol's close friend.

280
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,282
Do you want to give her your present?

281
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,114
Your birthday present.

282
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,040
Thank you for being born, Ji Yeong.

283
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,863
Thank you, Byeol!

284
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,456
Unnie, thank you so much for today.

285
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,600
You're the best!

286
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,902
You're welcome. We're friends.

287
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:43,422
Friends help each other.

288
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,632
If something like this happens again, tell me.

289
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,900
Really? I can?

290
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,222
Daddy doesn't get it.

291
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,765
Dads are like that.

292
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,309
Was your dad like that, too?

293
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,602
Yes.

294
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,438
My dad was worse.

295
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,148
He couldn't even tie my hair.

296
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,274
Really?

297
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,109
Yes, he always tied it too tightly

298
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,553
and pulled out hairs in a ponytail.

299
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:08,989
He couldn't even braid it like yours.

300
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,283
My dad does really good styles:

301
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,435
disco hair, twisty hair, caterpillar hair.

302
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:16,178
He's good at braids too.

303
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,278
Unnie, can I borrow your phone?

304
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:24,671
My phone?

305
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,798
I want to call my dad.

306
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,593
I think he might be sad.

307
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,412
I said I hated him this morning.

308
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:34,972
I want to say sorry.

309
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,466
Daddy!

310
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,775
- Did you eat something yummy? 
 - Yes.

311
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,520
- Did you have fun today? 
 - Yes.

312
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,608
- Daddy. 
 - Yes?

313
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:35,684
I missed you.

314
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,637
You said you hated me this morning.

315
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,939
That's because I like you that much.

316
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,300
Because you like me?

317
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,100
Unnie said the liking is as much as the hating.

318
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,839
   

319
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,257
I'm here, Dad.

320
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,886
It took so long...

321
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,281
for me to get here.

322
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,159
   

323
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,000
Dad,

324
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,100
it's been so hard for me.

325
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,697
After you left like that,

326
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,466
I didn't know what to do.

327
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,405
I hated you so much.

328
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,604
That felt like my only way to survive.

329
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,875
I guess I needed to resent someone.

330
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,800
I'm sorry, Dad.

331
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,939
I've never...

332
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:49,558
smiled for you, not even once.

333
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,422
I miss you.

334
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,619
I miss you, Dad.

335
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,070
   

336
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,137
Wait.

337
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,293
Why aren't you getting in?

338
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,639
Thank you, Eun Ho,

339
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,687
for...

340
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,225
turning out to be such a great person.

341
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,920
Will you hold my hand?

342
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,392
I won't...

343
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,521
ever let go of this hand.

344
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,420
So...

345
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,419
don't let go, either, Eun Ho.

346
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,351
Thank you.

347
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,686
Let's go, CEO.

348
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,020
♫  So just test me, I'll tell you  ♫

349
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,880
♫  My sincere feelings for you  ♫

350
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,460
♫  Yes, whenever it is, just tell me  ♫

351
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,510
♫  Whatever it is, I can do it  ♫

352
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,750
♫  Test me, I'll tell you  ♫

353
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,600
♫  My feelings whenever, wherever  ♫

354
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,220
♫  Right now my heart Is going straight to you  ♫

355
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,060
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

356
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,850
Good morning. 
 ♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

357
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,790
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

358
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:36,144
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

359
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,980
We can't go back from here.

360
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,565
Correct.

361
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,916
That's why I did it.

362
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,900
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

363
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,802
- Manager. 
 - What?

364
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,138
A bug will fly into your mouth.

365
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,890
I couldn't have imagined.

366
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,934
Why those two? How?

367
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,061
Am I the only one shocked?

368
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,729
I already knew.

369
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,898
Really? I had no idea.

370
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,067
Those two...

371
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,902
were really bad at hiding it.

372
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,112
 Yes, Deputy. I'm back at the office. 

373
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,431
 Let me call you once I find the materials. 

374
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,266
 Understood. 

375
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,500
Gyu Rim, if something like that happened, you should have reported it to me first.

376
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,247
How can you keep that to yourself?

377
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,807
And start a rumor?

378
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,367
- Give me your hand. 
 - No.

379
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,279
- There's so much romance at Peoplez suddenly. 
 - No, no, not right now.

380
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,875
- I said no, not right now! 
 - No, it's okay.

381
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,490
- No, no. 
 - I...

382
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,342
Is there another office romance?

383
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,455
Don't report that kind of stuff.

384
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,773
 Gyeong Hwa, this is the right timing for us. 

385
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,550
 Are you crazy? No! 

386
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,719
 Why is it "crazy"? I'm serious. 

387
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,954
 Can I lean on you? 

388
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:19,364
 Yes. Hold my hand too. 

389
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,562
The children must not be hot.

390
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,481
Is Seo Jun's mom not here yet?

391
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,124
She must be busy these days.

392
00:34:28,124 --> 00:34:30,526
His grandma is here more often.

393
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:34,936
Do you think Seo Jun looks less and less like his mom?

394
00:34:34,936 --> 00:34:37,658
Does he resemble his dad?

395
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,951
Don't you know?

396
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,813
Seo Jun's mom is not his biological mom.

397
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,914
Really?

398
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,708
I knew it! That's why he's a little—

399
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,784
A little what?

400
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,340
What about my Seo Jun? What about him?

401
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,309
Oh, there's just a little... darkness there.

402
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:57,637
What darkness?

403
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,100
There is no happier child than my Seo Jun.

404
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,852
My Seo Jun grew up with lots of love from his mom as much as any child.

405
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:05,978
Sure.

406
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,788
Of course, that's right.

407
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,621
It was your son who told our children they had "half families," wasn't it?

408
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,165
Of course, he copies his mom.

409
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,127
Children say stuff while they play.

410
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,361
He already apologized—

411
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,630
Some words shouldn't be said!

412
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,899
And it's the parent's job to teach that!

413
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,660
Are you saying I haven't raised my child properly?

414
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,600
Must you give birth to be a good mother?

415
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,600
You don't know what my daughter went through to raise Seo Jun.

416
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,898
She's a much better mother than people who just sit around and gossip!

417
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,051
Grandma, that's a little—

418
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,160
Stop it.

419
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,364
The children might hear you.

420
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,007
Should you let them find out?

421
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:33,430
Mom! Were you really upset today?

422
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:37,085
I have nothing to be upset about.

423
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,132
It's all for Seo Jun.

424
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,249
If he hears that he doesn't look like his mother...

425
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,543
he will be so hurt.

426
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,254
But Seo Jun didn't hear it.

427
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,632
He didn't hear it today,

428
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,817
but we can't guarantee other days.

429
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:10,184
Su Hyeon, it's time to tell Seo Jun.

430
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:13,030
- Mom... 
 - Don't let him hear it from someone else.

431
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,500
You tell him.

432
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,776
I think that's the better way.

433
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:21,061
Eventually, he will find out.

434
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,720
Why don't you have a picture book today?

435
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,738
Aren't we going to read?

436
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,908
Instead of reading a book, I have to tell you a story.

437
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:53,813
"A story"?

438
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,605
What is it?

439
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,900
Seo Jun, I had an older sister.

440
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,643
She was amazing, beautiful, kind,

441
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:10,100
and a very cheery person.

442
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,792
She married someone incredible and had a beautiful child.

443
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,660
Where are they now?

444
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,969
In Heaven, where only good people go.

445
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:30,421
They are watching Seo Jun and me from up there.

446
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,800
Those two left me a gift so I wouldn't be lonely.

447
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,088
That's you, Seo Jun.

448
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,995
I have a video.

449
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,896
Do you want to see it?

450
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,824
Yes.

451
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,008
 - So cute!  
 - Is that me?

452
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,002
 - So adorable! 
 - So tiny... 

453
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,379
Yes.

454
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:20,999
And this is your mom and dad.

455
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,029
 Hi, Seo Jun! 

456
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,530
 Welcome to our family! 

457
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,492
 - Welcome! 
 - Hi! 

458
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,892
 - Seo Jun! 
 - What is that? 

459
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:33,020
 - So Seo Jun can grow. 
 - Look at him eat. 

460
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,388
 I think he can stand! 

461
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,442
 Good job! 

462
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,753
 Walk! Walk! 

463
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,968
 Let's go to Daddy! 

464
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,903
 - Daddy! 
 - Come. 

465
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:52,889
 So cute! 

466
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,398
I haven't seen baby Seo Jun in such a long time.

467
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,899
What do you think?

468
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,276
- You three look alike, right? 
 - Yes.

469
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,615
Seo Jun.

470
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:15,526
Your mom and dad... loved you so much.

471
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:22,400
But... why did my mom and dad go to Heaven?

472
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,674
There was an accident.

473
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,551
They were hurt badly.

474
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,980
They went where they're not hurting anymore.

475
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,394
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

476
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,321
Does that mean I have two moms?

477
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,573
That's right.

478
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,825
Seo Jun, you have two moms.

479
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,826
You also have a dad.

480
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:57,788
If people aren't by your side,

481
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:02,858
but their love is in your heart, then they're with you.

482
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,700
Okay.

483
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,700
Mom, thank you for raising me.

484
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,808
Seo Jun...

485
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,900
I love you very, very much.

486
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,402
Yes. I love you, too, Mom.

487
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,900
Why are you still working at this time?

488
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,459
Hey. Why didn't you go home?

489
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,710
Did something happen?

490
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,547
Do I need an occasion to come see you?

491
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,840
I had a meeting nearby and thought of you.

492
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,425
Is everything really okay?

493
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,885
How are you and the Chairman?

494
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,900
Of course, same old.

495
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,900
He still doesn't like me.

496
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,726
Do you have much work?

497
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,347
Something happened at the kindergarten earlier. I was thinking.

498
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:50,670
Why? What happened?

499
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,889
That is "Rainbow Bingsu," Ms. Jeong's book.

500
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:57,408
Yes, Seo Jun's mother wrote it.

501
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,702
What? Do you know Seo Jun's mom?

502
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,165
Oh, yes...

503
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,267
I've met her a few times here and there.

504
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,714
Why?

505
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,257
Did something happen to Seo Jun?

506
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,615
Ms. Jeong must be upset again.

507
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,680
   

508
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,365
 What are you doing right now? 

509
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,940
What?

510
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,134
Are you okay?

511
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,261
Hey.

512
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,931
I'm sorry to text you suddenly.

513
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:05,059
I just...

514
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,785
don't have anyone to talk to.

515
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,525
How did you know? I'm a pro at this stuff.

516
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,611
You can discuss anything you want.

517
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm really good at listening.

518
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,500
I'm kind of a pro listener.

519
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,952
I miss my sister.

520
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:30,291
I just really miss my sister today.

521
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,456
Unnie,

522
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,051
I'm doing a good job, right?

523
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,473
What?

524
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,642
Did you hear that?

525
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,893
She said you're doing great.

526
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,113
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.

527
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,914
I apologize.

528
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,870
It's okay.

529
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,150
   

530
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,952
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
 - No problem.

531
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,800
It's best to make things clear.

532
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,300
The fact that you accepted me as a client means that my company is trustworthy.

533
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,921
You must be busy these days. I see many articles about Econic Bio.

534
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,600
Yes, it's overwhelming.

535
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,300
Since our company expands so suddenly,

536
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,600
I feel anxious, and it all seems a little surreal.

537
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,433
This is your reward for not giving up on the new drug research and development.

538
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,300
Speaking of...

539
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,000
What if Peoplez exclusively took on our company's hiring?

540
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,107
The company will get bigger,

541
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,151
but all I do is research in a lab.

542
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,200
I'm hopeless in this area.

543
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,400
I have no idea how many more employees I'll need to hire.

544
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,786
If Peoplez becomes our exclusive hiring consultant,

545
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,700
I will give you some shares.

546
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,200
If we go public, we can't predict how value will jump.

547
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,587
Please take it as a chance for mutual growth with a company that has potential.

548
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,900
I'm asking you.

549
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,801
Thank you for the offer. I'll consider it.

550
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,368
All right.

551
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,520
Manager!

552
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,271
Yes, Secretary Yu.

553
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,600
What's going on?

554
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,780
I'm not sure, but this feels so off to me.

555
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,040
  - I think it would be okay to go for vegetables... 
 - Gyeong Hwa, this coffee... 

556
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,440
 My friend works at Next. 

557
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,833
 Why are Jeong Nam and Seong Woong together? 

558
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,897
 - Manager, what are you doing? 
 - Yes, nothing. I'm coming. 

559
00:47:21,897 --> 00:47:24,508
 I wanted to see if you knew anything... 

560
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,953
 Jeong Nam and Seong Woong... are they close? 

561
00:47:27,953 --> 00:47:29,800
 Not sure. Why? 

562
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,891
 No, it's nothing. Let's go. 

563
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,627
He was an employee at our company?

564
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:37,062
Yes. Go Jeong Nam...

565
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,614
After the Next article came out, he asked me to meet.

566
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:43,318
He kept contacting me after that, asking me many questions.

567
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,305
I felt iffy about it so I haven't answered.

568
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:49,290
He said he left this field altogether.

569
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,580
But since he keeps meeting our staff, it seems he has an agenda.

570
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,200
- Right? 
 - Yes.

571
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,434
You said he contacted you after the Next article came out, right?

572
00:47:59,434 --> 00:48:02,628
Then those who need that information most are...

573
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,841
Career Way.

574
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:10,052
So every time their candidates overlapped with ours...

575
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,931
Let me look into it.

576
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,182
You didn't say anything else, right?

577
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,685
Of course not. I'm not stupid.

578
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:20,486
 I saw the article. Peoplez is handling the Next CEO case, right? 

579
00:48:20,486 --> 00:48:21,940
 She didn't just find management specialists, 

580
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,717
 but lawyers, media people... 

581
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:25,085
 people like that... 

582
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:26,987
 No, no. 

583
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,821
 These are trade secrets. 

584
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,784
Secretary Yu...

585
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,956
I think I made a mistake.

586
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,670
Dong Gi, it's me. I have a favor to ask.

587
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,355
Can you try to hire Career Way?

588
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,382
Like it's coming from Hansu Electronics.

589
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,408
Great. Thanks.

590
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,475
CEO, we confirmed that Go Jeong Nam works for Career Way.

591
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,936
Does that mean Jeong Nam has been

592
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,600
leaking our candidate information this whole time?

593
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,600
So he approached Manager Kim to extract information?

594
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,600
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

595
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,400
I know I shouldn't trust people so easily, but I never thought...

596
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,900
I was so good to Go Jeong Nam, yet he stabbed me in the back?

597
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,011
So when he left our company, did he take our candidate database?

598
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:27,698
Ms. CEO, we can't just let this go.

599
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,716
We need a new plan.

600
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,225
- Jeong Nam! 
 - Manager!

601
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,409
- Sorry, sorry. I'm late. 
 - Not at all.

602
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:43,046
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay.

603
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:46,024
The meeting ran longer than expected.

604
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,894
It's an important project so...

605
00:49:48,894 --> 00:49:51,904
it's not easy to confirm candidates.

606
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,518
So? Did you confirm the candidates?

607
00:49:56,518 --> 00:49:59,371
Yes, it's done.

608
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,414
- Manager. 
 - Yes?

609
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,807
Would you like something refreshing?

610
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:03,658
- Sure, I'll have something. 
 - It's on me.

611
00:50:03,658 --> 00:50:06,019
W-Wait. I need the restroom.

612
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:07,700
I may take some time.

613
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,633
I feared I'd be late, and I didn't get to the restroom.

614
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,001
I-I'll be back.

615
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,207
Okay, Manager!

616
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,100
Career Way has the candidate information.

617
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,699
So they think the list we slipped is our final candidate lineup?

618
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,826
Getting a taste of their own medicine.

619
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,200
This is quite satisfying.

620
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,205
Then let's start discussing our real candidates.

621
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,400
Yes.

622
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,300
Today, we will restart the candidate search from scratch.

623
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,592
"Next's employee turnover rate"? 
    

624
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,053
This field has many transfers and resignations.

625
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,013
Even taking that into account,

626
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,224
this graph of their turnover rate is worth noting.

627
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,102
The positions with the highest turnover rate at Next currently

628
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,797
are managers who have been there 5-10 years,

629
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,733
the most important middle belt of Next.

630
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,444
So the core workforce doing real work is leaving,

631
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,321
- and only rusty dregs remain? 
 - Yes.

632
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,000
Focus on a CEO with a developer background

633
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,200
alienated non-developers to resign.

634
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,900
The executives focused on power play and set aside vital work.

635
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,458
 Hey, whom do you think will be the new CEO? 

636
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,667
 Will they get a competent one this time? 

637
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,300
 Why does it matter who comes? 

638
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,197
 We'd be lucky if they didn't flee after seeing all the politicking. 

639
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:34,658
 - You know who's most pitiful right now? 
 - Who? 

640
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,219
 You and I, disdained for not being developers 

641
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,329
 yet staying, not quitting. 
   

642
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,935
 - Let's go. 
 - Let's go. 

643
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,147
 The employees talking like that 

644
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,625
means they're already rusting from the inside.

645
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,469
Maybe Next's real crisis won't come from the outside,

646
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:56,000
but it might be from inside.

647
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,759
So I think we should seek a candidate from the employees' perspective.

648
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:03,103
The people who can change a company

649
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:05,855
are the people who work there.

650
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,541
That's all.

651
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,587
Now, we will focus on Next's internal crisis

652
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,464
rather than its external one.

653
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,399
Let's find Next's real problem

654
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,500
from their employees' perspective at the start.

655
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,000
   

656
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,550
   

657
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,420
   

658
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,640
   

659
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,969
Everyone with actual talent got fired.

660
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:37,200
Flattery.

661
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,324
Only people good at kowtowing are filling the company.

662
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,070
Please find me a job elsewhere.

663
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,079
Collaboration?

664
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,290
I can't even talk to a developer.

665
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,500
I work as little as I'm getting paid.

666
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,320
They don't pay me more if I work harder.

667
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,800
Things will improve with a new CEO, right? 
    

668
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,429
If only they'd drain all the musty water, I'd die happy.

669
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,389
Deputy Jeong, you're so naive.

670
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,142
Want to know a secret?

671
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,503
I hear they already have a new CEO in mind,

672
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,897
someone to their liking.

673
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,316
It's a typical Next move. Let's just drink.

674
00:53:15,316 --> 00:53:18,200
 If you don't mind me asking, what do you think 

675
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,016
 is most important in running an organization? 

676
00:53:23,016 --> 00:53:24,409
 That's a hard question. 

677
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,119
 I don't know if this answers your question, 

678
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,905
 but there's one thing I always do on the first day of any job. 

679
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,995
CEO! How about this candidate?

680
00:53:36,995 --> 00:53:40,634
They have enough HR experience...

681
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,861
Not enough practical experience.

682
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:44,300
How about this candidate?

683
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,900
In the cross-check, the employees scored him the highest.

684
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,300
His flexible, careful leadership style is effective.

685
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,840
Gyu Rim's recommendation is well-known for competency.

686
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,508
But if I may suggest one more person,

687
00:53:56,508 --> 00:54:01,802
I think Next needs a tough candidate who can trim the rotting branches.

688
00:54:01,802 --> 00:54:04,200
 Peoplez 

689
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,152
I feel I can finally breathe.

690
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,907
Should we get some fresh air?

691
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,843
I just want to stay like this for 10 minutes.

692
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,222
We're almost done, right?

693
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,807
Yes.

694
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,809
You worked really hard.

695
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,269
You did intense work, too.

696
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,841
If this succeeds, should we go on a trip?

697
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:21,500
"A trip"?

698
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,361
Where?

699
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,488
Anywhere. Do you want to see any place?

700
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:28,992
The ocean!

701
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,286
It's very long since I've seen the ocean.

702
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,079
I love the ocean.

703
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,622
And anywhere else?

704
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,209
Tell me. Mountains...

705
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,128
Outer space is okay too.

706
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,279
- "Outer space"? 
 - Yes.

707
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,749
Ms. CEO, are you here?

708
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,679
 Yes, Gyu Rim. What's up? 

709
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,781
Oh, you're over there.

710
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,308
 Is Secretary Yu with you? 

711
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,144
No, I was alone.

712
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,000
Weren't you together?

713
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,024
Is he not at his desk?

714
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,218
No, he isn't. Where did he go?

715
00:56:03,218 --> 00:56:05,637
Maybe the restroom?

716
00:56:05,637 --> 00:56:08,921
That's weird. I thought I heard his voice over here.

717
00:56:08,921 --> 00:56:12,202
People are being so loud down there today.

718
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,271
Seriously.

719
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:16,314
I see.

720
00:56:16,314 --> 00:56:18,265
I'll go then.

721
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,669
Fighting, Gyu Rim.

722
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:29,499
I mean... she's so bad at hiding it.

723
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,184
Why did you say I wasn't here?

724
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,981
Do you want people to think we're on a date in the office?

725
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,191
I'll go first. Come out after five minutes. Got it?

726
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:46,569
What if I get caught?

727
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,530
I'll grab their attention in the conference room.

728
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,075
Just figure it out.

729
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,870
Just figure...

730
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,110
   

731
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,536
Thank you, both, for finding candidates

732
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:13,600
for the past month for Next's new CEO.

733
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,800
We are very eager to see what kind of candidates you have brought us.

734
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,438
The candidates you recommend today will be evaluated on paper first,

735
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,865
before they enter the second round of interviews.

736
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:32,656
 This is the final candidate list Peoplez will bring in, 

737
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,800
 all CEOs from legal or media backgrounds. 

738
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,609
 It's a solution to fix Next's external crisis quickly and efficiently. 

739
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:44,710
 And these... 

740
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,400
 are their liabilities. 

741
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,910
 This is how we will flip Kang Ji Yun's cart again. 

742
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,400
 When the candidates are announced, 

743
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,360
 you can use these materials to eliminate them during the screening. 

744
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,310
   
   

745
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,700
Starting with Peoplez,

746
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,706
please introduce your candidates,

747
00:58:11,706 --> 00:58:15,115
their experience, and why you recommend them.

748
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:25,042
These are the final candidates Peoplez recommends.

749
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
All three are top executives with professional HR backgrounds.

750
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,909
While others focus on the outside, they will solidify

751
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:36,220
the inside and prepare Next for its future.

752
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,727
That's good, but... I thought we said we needed a CEO

753
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:45,146
who can silence public opinion around Next's crisis.

754
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,065
During the last CEO's tenure,

755
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,600
there was discrimination between developers and non-developers.

756
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,331
Managers neglected vital work and wasted energy on power plays.

757
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,516
Distrust is rampant among employees

758
00:58:56,516 --> 00:58:58,500
and company morale is rock bottom.

759
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,454
The real crisis at Next 
    

760
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,800
is not external but internal.

761
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,000
I doubt anyone in this room can deny that. 
    

762
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:17,051
 The people who can change a company are the people who work there. 

763
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,800
What leads Next is not the outside's evaluations,

764
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,337
but the employees who are working on the inside.

765
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:28,006
If you truly care for Next,

766
00:59:28,006 --> 00:59:32,834
please carefully consider what kind of CEO is the right choice.

767
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,302
 Portal site, Next, has finally determined its new CEO. 

768
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,262
 Jeong Su Han, the newly appointed CEO, 

769
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,265
 has put internal stabilization as the company's top priority. 

770
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,268
 He added that a tight company culture 

771
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,800
 and employee growth is the key to Next's future. 

772
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,000
Meanwhile, it is known that the appointment of Next's CEO...

773
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,800
was facilitated by the search firm, Peoplez!

774
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,699
Hyungnim!

775
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,117
Good work!

776
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,593
Aigoo, good work.

777
01:00:22,593 --> 01:00:25,400
So we're Next's exclusive headhunters now, right?

778
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,833
The number of Next employees is around 4,000.

779
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,400
It's 4,000! For real?

780
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,554
Am I the only one who can't believe it?

781
01:00:32,554 --> 01:00:33,900
- Can't you believe it? 
 - No.

782
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,132
I can't believe it, either. Then what do we do?

783
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:39,010
We need a staff dinner to believe!

784
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,803
- A staff dinner! 
 - Manager.

785
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,680
You said all the right things, but...

786
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,940
What?

787
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,580
Staff dinner!

788
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,352
Staff dinner!

789
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,231
Wow, seriously...

790
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,324
Let's go!

791
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,452
It's a black card!

792
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,829
I have equity in this staff dinner.

793
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,856
- Okay, fine, Manager! 
 - What should I eat?

794
01:01:08,856 --> 01:01:11,542
If it's on the black card, beef?

795
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,902
I want chicken feet!

796
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:19,132
Enjoy! I'm not paying so enjoy!

797
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,021
Wow! Looks so good.

798
01:01:23,021 --> 01:01:25,915
- Manager, seriously? 
 - What?

799
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:29,268
That's your cue to FOQNRR and move over.

800
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,153
FOQ... what is that?

801
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:33,590
Manager, aren't you updating your notebook these days?

802
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,233
What? Am I the only one who doesn't get it?

803
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,693
In a moment like this...

804
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:40,388
"Figure Out and Quickly, Neatly Read the Room."

805
01:01:40,388 --> 01:01:42,448
So what am I supposed to do?

806
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,991
Just stand and change seats.

807
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,786
Secretary, come over here.

808
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,162
- You're crazy! 
 - Over here, Secretary.

809
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,330
- Secretary Yu! 
 - Come over here.

810
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,124
Secretary Yu, over here.

811
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,208
Manager, come over here.

812
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,750
All set.

813
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,963
This is my FOQNRR spot.

814
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,115
I'm jealous that you two can be public.

815
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,910
- Who wants soju? 
 - Me!

816
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,230
   

817
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:03,940
Here, Manager!

818
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,267
Have you tried this?

819
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,561
It looks good.

820
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,446
- How's it so tender? 
 - Gyeong Hwa.

821
01:02:13,446 --> 01:02:17,108
With soft meat like this, you need alcohol.

822
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:20,018
Let's have another glass.

823
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,242
The alcohol is going down so smoothly.

824
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,161
Gwang Hee, let's get the vibes up.

825
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,246
Let me pour some glasses.

826
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,706
Give it to me.

827
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,207
- We need to empty this. 
 - Sit.

828
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,110
- What? 
 - Sit down.

829
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,553
You want me to sit down.

830
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,384
She's doing something new.

831
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,238
Amazing!

832
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,367
What was that?

833
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,745
I don't like the ones that you make, Gwang Hee.

834
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:11,954
You could have told me.

835
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,208
Gyu Rim, who are you, exactly?

836
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,584
Here, here!

837
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,127
Everyone, pay attention!

838
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:22,300
Today, we are celebrating the success of our project,

839
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,500
as well as encouraging bonding among all employees.

840
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,304
It's a very, very special occasion.

841
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,931
So today...

842
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,140
One more time!

843
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,600
Why are you...

844
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,268
- Let's keep partying! 
 - Stop it.

845
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,594
Please.

846
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:37,900
And our CEO Kang.

847
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:42,819
Since this is the first staff dinner you joined voluntarily, please say a few words.

848
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,903
What? No.

849
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:44,987
- Ms. CEO! 
 - I don't want to.

850
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,239
- No, no. 
 - CEO!

851
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,600
- No! 
 - Wait, wait.

852
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,161
Everyone, as you know, CEO Kang is shy about such stuff.

853
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,538
Yes.

854
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,565
CEO Kang!

855
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,416
 - CEO Kang!  
 - So cool!

856
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:00,737
 CEO Kang! CEO Kang! 

857
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:02,780
Stop it!

858
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,526
Starting tomorrow, let's get back to work at full speed.

859
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,472
I don't think we can.

860
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,306
What is wrong with her?

861
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:21,020
The success of this project... is thanks to all of you.

862
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,983
Thank you.

863
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,195
What?

864
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,911
Enjoy the food tonight, and let's have fun.

865
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,680
- Cheers! 
 - Thank you, Sir!

866
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,740
 Cheers! 

867
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,803
- You've come a long way. 
 - Stop it and eat.

868
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,633
Have you thought of what to do next?

869
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,846
Was that bothering you the whole time?

870
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:52,972
Of course.

871
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,765
It concerns you, not anyone else.

872
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:04,680
I want you to work where your talent can shine some more.

873
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,737
Do I not shine here?

874
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,223
I feel a little sad.

875
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:12,574
You know that's not what I mean.

876
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,536
When we were working on the Next case,

877
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:18,300
I felt once again...

878
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:23,100
it would be selfish of me to hoard a talent like you.

879
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:27,298
So you finally acknowledge me, Ms. CEO.

880
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,624
Listen to you already.

881
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,847
Anyway, don't worry about me.

882
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,223
Eun Ho,

883
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:39,018
make the decision for you.

884
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,380
Okay?

885
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,342
All right.

886
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,276
I'll think about it.

887
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,989
Your hand is warm.

888
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,908
Your hands are so tiny.

889
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,409
Yours are just big.

890
01:06:31,596 --> 01:06:34,615
   

891
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,290
   
   

892
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:40,340
   

893
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,405
CEO Kang, is it true Peoplez is involved?

894
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,406
Did you know?

895
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,690
Please say a few words.

896
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,914
CEO Kang, is it true Peoplez is involved?

897
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,057
Did you really not know of the fraud?

898
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:27,043
They say you knew when you sent candidates. Is that so?

899
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,295
What happens to those who trusted Peoplez and moved jobs?

900
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,130
Did you not know until it got to this point?

901
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,382
 I changed jobs because I trusted the CEO! 

902
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,675
 Give me back my money! 

903
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:35,843
 How dare she? 

904
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,900
 - Shameless. How dare she show up here? 
 - She's a murderer. 

905
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,208
 Do you really not know where CEO Park Yeong Min is? 

906
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:43,834
 Have you anything to say to the fraud victims? 

907
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:13,810


908
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:16,800
   

909
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,140
♫  Just like forever moonlight  ♫

910
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:28,790
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

911
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:33,090
♫  Just like a forever starlight  ♫

912
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:40,310
♫  I'm always by your side  ♫

913
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:52,850
♫  Until that day when your light dims  ♫

914
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:55,640
 Okay, we will conduct search and seizure of your offices. 

915
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,430
 Why are they shutting the blinds? Is our CEO a criminal or something? 

916
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,320
 - Why do you do this to me? 
 - I just don't like you. 

917
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,910
 Peoplez will be acquired by Career Way. 

918
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:06,140
 - Did you do that, Father? 
 - I'm watching what happens. 

919
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,080
 If it's a loss for me, then I'll have to decide. 

920
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,410
 - Are you okay? 
 - Don't worry about Secretary Yu, either. 

921
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:13,760
 No, you, Jeong Hun. Are you okay, Jeong Hun? 

922
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,200
 Ji Yun, you're not alone, 

923
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,490
 all this time and going forward as well. 

924
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,250
 - I didn't like my life. 
 - Ms. CEO! 

925
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,910
 - Good morning. 
 - You're here early! 

926
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:23,350
 - But ever since I met you, Eun Ho... 
 - Hello! 

927
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,790
 I started liking myself.
