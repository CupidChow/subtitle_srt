{\an8}CEO LEE YONG-HOON

6
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,121
Where's Mr. Lee?

7
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,539
Did he really get fired?

8
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,168
- Why did he...
- That's why I told you to stay put.

9
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,630
If you had stayed quiet,

10
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,257
our company could've
also been considered the victim.

11
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,218
You stirred things up...

12
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,221
Listen, someone tried to kill themself.

13
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,890
Some people lost their jobs
and livelihood because of us.

14
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,225
We can't cover it up to save our skin.

15
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,186
We must find out the truth
and take responsibility…

16
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:48,733
Our investor made a paper company and
lied to us. It's not our responsibility.

17
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,152
Some of us were involved.

18
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,279
They even benefited from it...

19
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,280
Keep your mouth shut!

20
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,828
Sorry to interrupt.

00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,040
We're from Yeongpo PD.

23
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,959
What's the matter?

24
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,170
Early this morning, Mr. Lee Yong-hoon

25
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,215
jumped out of his apartment building.

26
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,558
- Father.
- Oh, no.

27
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,185
How could this happen?

28
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,857
Kang Ji-yun.

29
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,568
Is this what you wanted?

30
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,112
Do you feel relieved now?

31
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,283
You knew this would happen.

32
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,536
Don't deny it because it's disgusting.

33
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,541
It's you

34
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,835
who killed Yong-hoon.

35
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,947
Where are we going?

36
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,616
- To the hospital...
- Turn the car around.

37
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,952
Pardon me?

38
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,580
Let's go and eat. I'm hungry.

39
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,055
{\an8}Ms. Kang?

40
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,306
{\an8}Next time.

41
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,433
{\an8}I'll explain later.

42
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,894
{\an8}Let's just eat tonight.

43
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,034
Thank you… for today.

- Hi, ma'am.
- Oh, hi.

46
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,600
It's been a long time.

47
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,145
Same as usual? Level five?

48
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,025
For two, please.

49
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,196

00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,378
Thank you.

52
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,887
Wait a minute.

53
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,198
There you go.

54
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,130
Let's eat.

55
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,388
Isn't it spicy?

56
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,848
I can't lose to this.

57
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,767
Are you fighting with <i>tteokbokki</i>?

58
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,020
People eat this to see who wins.

59
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,981
Who gets competitive with food?

60
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,399
Me.

61
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,442
That's how I am.

62
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,286
Why aren't you eating?

63
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,871
Actually, I can't eat spicy food.

64
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,958
I have never tried spiciness that kills.

65
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,334
You should've told me during the order.

66
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,546
Do I forbid you from saying…

67
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,384
The secretary that I need
is one who only does what I ask.

68
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,469
Not being nosy like this.

69
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,186
It's all right. Okay.

70
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,605
It's your fault for not saying it.

71
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,357
Do whatever you want.

72
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,032
Please eat slowly.

73
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,410
Never mind.

74
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,751
See? It's spicy for you.

75
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,684
Tissue?

76
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,523
No, wait.

77
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,078
You hold grudges, don't you?

78
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,624
Was I being nosy again?

79
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,167
I shouldn't step over the line.

80
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,502
That's enough.

81
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,878
It's enough, right?

82
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,179
I was being harsh earlier.

83
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,933
So behave yourself.

84
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,476
Keep out of trouble.

85
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,191
I look forward to working with you.

86
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,863
Me too.

87
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,327
Are you really not going to eat?

88
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,539
A Korean should be
able to handle this much.

89
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,249
Try it.

90
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,293
Sure. Why not?

91
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,014
It's very good.

92
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,697
It's not that bad.

93
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,159
Why do you eat something so spicy?

94
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,829
We don't get along.

95
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,831
You don't get how good it is.

96
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,717
Thank you.

97
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,718
Hot!

98
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,803
It burns!

99
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,721
Ms. Seo.

100
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,097
<i>You aren't there yet, right?</i>

101
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,100
You won't have to go. It's all over.

102
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,815
That's good news.

103
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,651
I can avoid the traffic jam.

104
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,694
Bye.

105
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,909
It was spicier than usual today.

106
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,387
Thanks, ma'am.

107
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,305
- Take care.
- Thank you for the food.

108
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,058
May I take one?

109
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,477
Help yourself.

110
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,104
Okay, thank you.

111
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,230
It was quite spicy.

112
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,523
Thank you.

113
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,300
GREEN GRAPE CANDY

114
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,924
The Selim Group Project is over.

115
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,218
I should've reviewed it more thoroughly.

116
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,260
It was my mistake.

117
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:27,097
Career Way stole it from us
with full intention.

118
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,015
It was impossible.

119
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,850
Let's acknowledge our failure.

120
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,728
Focus more on each of your projects.

121
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,730
Are there any that need special attention?

122
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,982
Ganiel Hotel Executive Chef Project.

123
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,944
We're in contact with a candidate
selected by Ganiel Hotel,

124
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,196
and he has special conditions.

125
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,199
Could you join us at the meeting
and take a look?

126
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,450
Okay.

127
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,077
Get me relevant information by today.

128
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,497
- By today?
- Yes, today.

129
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,500
{\an8}Update the database.

130
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,168
{\an8}Make a list of candidates.

131
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,212
{\an8}Get a list of questions ready.

132
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,798
Can all other projects
do the same by today?

133
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,925
Meeting's over.

134
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,178
Well done.

135
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,097
But we aren't done yet.

136
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,641
Should I prepare the questions?

137
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,017
I can't.

138
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,769
- It's impossible.
- I can do it.

139
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,979
I really can't.

140
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,189
- Why should I? Why me?
- Let's get outta here.

141
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,440
You should work on it, too.

142
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,359
The day after tomorrow?

143
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,653
Yes, it's possible.

144
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,323
Ms. Kang has gotten very combative.

145
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,786
That's what makes her Kang Ji-yun.

146
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,163
Being strong suits her the best.

147
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,499
Where are you going?

148
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,667
What?

149
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,751
Places.

150
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,022
HANEUL KINDERGARTEN

151
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,693
She's not here.

152
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,119
Excuse me, sir.

153
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,790
Father!

154
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,876
Father.

155
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,253
Father?

156
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,089
Me?

157
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,217
Are you talking to me?

158
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,386
The children will be out soon.

159
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,180
You may wait over here, Father.

160
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,727
Father?!

161
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,607
Do I look like someone's dad?

162
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,400
Pardon?

163
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,278
What makes you think that I'm a father?

164
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,446
Have you seen a dad like me?

165
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,156
No wrinkles on my face yet.

166
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,493
It's not like men give birth to children.

167
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,162
That's true.

168
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,248
Still, this is wrong.
I'm not even married yet.

169
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,752
Have I been slacking on skin care?

170
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,836
It looks fine.

171
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,174
Then what brings you to the kindergarten?

172
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,010
My family member of mine is here.

173
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,013
- Sis!
- Ms. Park!

174
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,266
"Sister"?

175
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,436
Sister?

176
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,149
His sister…

177
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,287
Why do you run a kindergarten
of all things?

178
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,456
I didn't ask you to come.

179
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,376
And don't call "Sis" anymore.

180
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,253
Cheol-yong died a long time ago.

181
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,963
I can't keep calling you my sister-in-law.

182
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,506
You might lose your chance
of marrying again.

183
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,758
Then you shouldn't even come to see me.

184
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,393
But it's your birthday.
Who else is going to celebrate it?

185
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,232
You don't like to see me?

186
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,695
If I don't, you won't come anymore?

187
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,947
Don't come here often.

188
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,116
I'm okay now.

189
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,290
I'm not okay with it.

190
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,544
When you get a boyfriend, I won't come.

191
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,797
So bear with me until then.

192
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,607
Kids.

193
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,360
Do you know him?

194
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,155
Yes, he's the director's friend.

195
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,115
Does he come here often?

196
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,076
Why haven't I seen him before?

197
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,704
Sometimes, he plays with us
during the day.

198
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,122
During the day?

199
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,957
Doesn't he work?

200
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,669
I don't know,
but he says that he likes to play.

201
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,256
Does he think
that he's Pororo or something?

202
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,385
It must be hard for the director
to handle him, right?

203
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,553
- Right.
- Right.

204
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,765
What should we eat for dinner?

205
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,191
Oh, no.

206
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,359
I don't know.

207
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,028
He's a little scary.

208
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,364
If you're scared, stay quiet.

209
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,662
<i>This is harsh.</i>

210
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,414
It's impossible to finish it in one day.

211
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,457
No way.

212
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,585
- Calm down.
- Gosh.

213
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,337
Stay strong.

214
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,674
We're the top team,
so this is a piece of cake.

215
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,053
Since you're all working hard,
I will especially

216
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,847
treat you to pizza today.

217
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,141
- Really?
- I'm ordering now.

218
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,600
What's gotten into him?

219
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,644
Straighten the back-zza.
Open the chest-zza.

220
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,564
Stop frowning! Smile big-zza!

221
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,985
Look at her.

222
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,319
Don't you feel energized?

223
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,405
Pepperoni pizza.

224
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,656
- What?
- Here's your delivery.

225
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,782
- Amazing.
- Mr. Yu.

226
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,617
Did you read my mind, Mr. Yu?

227
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,286
Your telepathy worked.

228
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,706
I wanted to make this joke today
for some reason.

229
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,750
Goodness, you're awesome.

230
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,294
I brought shrimp pizza
that you like, Kyung-hwa.

231
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,171
- Look at this.
- Thank you.

232
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,922
- Thank you, Mr. Yu.
- Guess what it is.

233
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,424
Did you know pizza is my favorite?

234
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,884
- Oh, god!
- Wow.

235
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,594
- Here you go.
- Look at this.

236
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,846
- Come and join us.
- Check it out.

237
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,474
Eating tasty pizza reminds me of Ms. Kang.

238
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,227
"Ms. Seo!"

239
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,437
"Ms. Seo?" "Yes!"

240
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,439
"Yes, by today."

241
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,565
"Update the database."

242
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,483
"Make a list of candidates."

243
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,484
"Prepare a list of questions."

244
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,237
"Is it possible by today?" "Yes, ma'am."

245
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,156
"Meeting's over."

246
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,283
"Meeting's over."
You all know what I mean, right?

247
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,576
- Meeting's over.
- The meeting is over!

248
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,660
That's not it.

249
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,996
You have to say "over"
just like Ms. Kang.

250
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,081
Be more objective and cold.

251
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,541
Even better when it's scary.

252
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,418
"Meeting's over," and head to the office.

253
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,878
Where did she go? To the office.

254
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,130
Kyung-hwa, don't hold back.

255
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,799
- Kwang-hee, have some pizza.
- Why?

256
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,800
Eat up.

257
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,230
Hello, Ms. Kang.

258
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,441
Would you like some pizza?

259
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,448
Jeez, what kind of response was that?

260
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,075
Why is everyone…

261
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,035
What's this smell?

262
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,620
Have some with us. Mr. Yu bought it.

263
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,207
- Ms. Kang, have some with us.
- Please join us.

264
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,418
We had a lot of food
at the meeting. It's okay.

265
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,420
It smells really good.

266
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,797
- Ms. Kang.
- Ms. Kang.

267
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,258
- Can I have a piece?
- Help yourself.

268
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,384
Kyung-hwa, enjoy your food.

269
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,886
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ms. Kang, I can explain!

270
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,559
I'm so grateful for him.

271
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,398
How did Mr. Yu come up
with such an excellent idea?

272
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,650
Excellent, my foot.

273
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,486
Scolding employees isn't
always the answer.

274
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,406
He was hired to take care of you,

275
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,783
and he also takes care of your employees.

276
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,119
I shouldn't have done that.

277
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,287
He's so nosy.

278
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,871
You eat too often.

279
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,418
When you see something like that,

280
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,378
don't you feel anything here?

281
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,421
What if I get fired?

282
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,172
You can explain later.

283
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,675
When will they finish work?
Can't they eat after work?

284
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,510
Can they eat when they aren't done?

285
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,428
That's what I feel.

286
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,519
There's a lot of dust, isn't there?

287
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,687
Mi-ae.

288
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,981
Goodness.

289
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,528
I think I sounded exactly like her today.

290
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,946
Do you want to get fired?

291
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,240
I don't think you sound like her.

292
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,783
Stop imitating her.

293
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,076
Eat outside.

294
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,585
<i>Chef Han Jeong-won.</i>

295
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,795
<i>After graduating from a prestigious
cooking school in Italy,</i>

296
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,341
<i>he gained experience at many Michelin
restaurants in the US and Europe.</i>

297
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,508
Number one and three…

298
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,428
<i>He returned to Korea five years ago
and starred on a few TV shows,</i>

299
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,264
<i>where his signature dish became a hit,
launching his popularity as a star chef.</i>

300
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,267
<i>Recently, he appears less on TV</i>

301
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,728
<i>to focus solely on Bello Buono.</i>

302
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,065
<i>It's a fine dining restaurant
that he started two years ago.</i>

303
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,233
<i>It takes several months
to reserve a table.</i>

304
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,612
I'll take a look.

305
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,656
A COLLECTION OF
HAN JEONG-WON'S PERFORMANCES

306
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,325
MICHELIN STAR
HAN JEONG-WON'S PERFORMANCE

307
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,744
<i>This is his signature pose.</i>

308
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,539
An impressive work experience
and star quality.

309
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,875
I can see why Ganiel Hotel wants him.

310
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,421
By the way, Manager Na…

311
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,218
- Na…
- Manager Na Gyu-rim will join you

312
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,136
at the restaurant after the meeting.

313
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,483
Didn't you call me here
because you liked the offer?

314
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,570
Under one condition.

315
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,616
{\an8}I'd like to work with my sous-chef.

316
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,369
{\an8}Do you want her to get hired with you?

317
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,286
Yes.

318
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,289
We've been working closely
with each other.

319
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,791
Ms. Kang, you must know

320
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,961
how lucky it is to find an employee
who's in sync with you.

321
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,755
It'd be my loss
if I leave someone like her.

322
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,426
I'll discuss it with Ganiel Hotel.

323
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,347
If it's someone you recommend,
they won't refuse.

324
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,102
Good for you. Such an employee is rare.

325
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,479
An employee you're in sync with.

326
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,191
Is that Mr. Yu?

327
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,118
My sous-chef is working alone.
Where is everyone?

328
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,122
I'm sorry. He doesn't need to help.

329
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,248
It's all right.

330
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,918
I'm sure he volunteered to help,
so don't worry.

331
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,174
Is that the sous-chef
you want to work with?

332
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,177
Yes, that's the assistant chef
I mentioned.

333
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,444
- Are you okay?
- Yes, of course.

334
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,616
Shall I put it here?

335
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,451
Yes, wherever is fine.

336
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,623
Is this everything?

337
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,541
Yes, that'll be all.

338
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,710
Thank you for helping me.

339
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,879
If Chef Han finds out, he'll scold me.

340
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,714
No, we should help each other.

341
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,718
Luckily, we ended early.

342
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,928
Thank you.

343
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,475
Gosh, do you grow all these here?

344
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,270
Yes, we grow flowers and herbs that we use

345
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,022
at the restaurant.

346
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,275
Chef Han is sincere about cooking.

347
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,027
There's so much variety.

348
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,571
This one has mysterious colors.

349
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,864
It's called nasturtium.

350
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,033
You can eat the flower, leaves,
stem, and fruit.

351
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,660
You can use every part of this plant.

352
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,579
Thanks to its piquant flavor,
it's used in many salads.

353
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,664
And

354
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,707
this one is pansy.

355
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,461
Pansy is good for <i>bibimbap </i>or tea
because it tastes slightly sweet.

356
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,255
That's called China pink.

357
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,384
You seem more sincere
about cooking than anyone.

358
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,554
I have a long way to go
to catch up to Chef Han.

359
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,851
What's a good pansy dish for children?

360
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,605
Pansy is also good in <i>gimbap</i>.

361
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,564
I'll tell you.

362
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,066
- I'm a good cook.
- Really?

363
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,530
Then I'll get going.

364
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:14,948
Take care.

365
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,142
It's that way.

366
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,807
Ms. Kang.

367
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,768
We're departing.

368
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,995
{\an8}DODAM BOOK STORE

369
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,542
Ji-yun, long time no see.

370
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,461
I had time before my meeting,
so I stopped by.

371
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,907
Thank you.

372
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,201
I got it for myself.

373
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,120
Can you yield it to me?

374
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,163
I've been trying to get it.

375
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,456
Why should I yield?

376
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,708
Adults are supposed to yield to children.

377
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,420
Do you really want to read this book?

378
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,504
Yes.

379
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,131
Can you even read all Korean letters?

380
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,883
I can read them all.

381
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,721
Then read this.

382
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,977
It's a picture book.

383
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,647
Read once you learn all Korean letters.

384
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,607
What kind of adult reads a picture book?

385
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,860
You have many
other books to read, old lady.

386
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,195
Adults read picture books, too.

387
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,196
Also,

388
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm a lady, not an old lady.

389
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,243
You don't look like a lady.

390
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,204
You look older than my dad.

391
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,040
Your dad must have gotten
married very young.

392
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,668
My dad was very popular like me.

393
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,129
If so, he wouldn't have
gotten married early, like me.

394
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,672
- Hmph!
- Hmph!

395
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,887
Hello. Byeol!

396
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,180
Auntie!

397
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,186
Did something happen between you two?

398
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,522
Yes, ma'am. I'm nearby.

399
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,108
I'll be right there. Okay.

400
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,738
Kiddo.

401
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,156
Enjoy the book.

402
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,908
I don't know if you can read it.

403
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,830
What? That's rude.

404
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,834
Who is it? Do you know her?

405
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,004
- Look. What does it say?
- What?

406
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,424
Byeol, you can't read this yet.

407
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,717
But what does it say?

408
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,931
"A Picture Book for Adults."

409
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,810
She was right.

410
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,369
WOO JEONG-HOON

411
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:57,814
Mr. Woo.

412
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,234
- Yes?
- Do you have

413
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,194
something to say to me?

414
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,115
I have

415
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,616
lots to say.

416
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,662
I also have many questions for you.

417
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,334
What cologne do you use?

418
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,962
Pardon?

419
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,006
When I was in your arms last time,

420
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,966
that fragrance

421
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,759
was to my liking.

422
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,889
Are you talking about this?

423
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,642
If you like it, I'll tell you.

424
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,980
I was worried for nothing.

425
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,064
Please, excuse me.

426
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,367
He doesn't get flustered.

427
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,992
Working at a place like this
must be stressful.

428
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,373
My beloved.

429
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,333
Hey, that's wrong.

430
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,793
Watch.

431
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,836
My…

432
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,423
beloved.

433
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,759
- Right?
- That's not it.

434
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,302
I'll write "seeker."

435
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,845
Look.

436
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,139
Seek…

437
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,478
- Is that why she's being that way?
- Yes.

438
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,605
Her sense of pride got damaged.

439
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,608
Next time, she's determined to read
perfectly in front of her.

440
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,861
I don't know who it is,
but she's out of favor with Byeol.

441
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,029
I know.

442
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,949
- What's today's menu?
- Well…

443
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,826
<i>Jjimdak</i>.

444
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,578
Perfect. I couldn't be bothered
to make dinner tonight.

445
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,622
Did your mother get home safe?

446
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,165
Yes, I called her.

447
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,084
Why did she go on a trip…

448
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,795
It's coming up soon.

449
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,091
Are you okay?

450
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,969
I can't be worse off than my mom.

451
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,557
- I'll bring the children.
- Okay.

452
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,436
That's not how you write it.

453
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,521
Kids, let's eat.

454
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,356
Dad, don't you see us studying?

455
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,733
You should eat first.

456
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,317
Dad, do me a favor.

457
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,610
What?

458
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,321
What's wrong?

459
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,490
That's strange. It feels familiar.

460
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,952
I'm off work, but it doesn't feel like it.

What are you doing?

468
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,988
I made something.

469
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,323
- What?
- Would you like to try?

470
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,407
Do you need kabocha?

471
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,580
- It's so good.
- Is it?

472
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,123
It's incredible.

473
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,917
Didn't it come out well?

474
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,793
How is it so good?

475
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,837
HAN JEONG-WON, YU HYE-IN

476
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,382
An inappropriate relationship?

477
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,928
Did that come up
during the reference check?

478
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,348
Yes, we heard it from their coworkers.

479
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,934
It turns out that there have been rumors.

480
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,354
Chef Yu Hye-in used
her personal relationship

481
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,231
for special treatment.

482
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,067
Hye-in was kind and lovely.

483
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,902
She did whatever was asked.

484
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,987
I heard that recently,

485
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,198
she started working for that famous chef.

486
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,077
How did she start working with him?

487
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,455
Chef Han Jeong-won is very strict.

488
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,706
He's all about skills.

489
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,542
He only hires employees who studied abroad

490
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,254
except Yu Hye-in who didn't graduate
from a good school.

491
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,130
After I left,

492
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,509
I heard that she stays
right by his side as his sous-chef.

493
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,010
There's something between them.

494
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,597
Quite frankly, Hye-in isn't good enough
to be his sous-chef.

495
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,099
Are you practicing?

496
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,184
<i>She didn't graduate
from a prestigious school.</i>

497
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,894
<i>She started from washing the dishes.</i>

498
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,813
<i>How else would she have come this far?</i>

499
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,483
It's obvious.

500
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,821
I believe that we should
change the candidate.

501
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,739
There is no clear evidence,

502
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,534
but it's certain
that they're in a relationship.

503
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,827
Change the candidate?

504
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,495
They're both single.

505
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,788
They can date, can't they?

506
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,624
It's not ethically wrong.

507
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,544
It's a problem if she used
her personal relationship

508
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,297
to get special treatment
instead of her skills.

509
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,965
Not only did she become his sous-chef,

510
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,634
but she's also trying
to get hired with him.

511
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,222
Ms. Kang, what do you think
of hiring them together?

512
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,443
Let's hire Chef Han Jeong-won only.

513
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,446
Whether the rumors are true or not,
there has to be

514
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,489
a clear reason to justify them.

515
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,452
I don't see why
we should hire him with Yu Hye-in.

516
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,580
Rumors will get worse
if they get hired together.

517
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,666
It would damage their careers as well.

518
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,129
Those rumors would follow them
like a label.

519
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,548
Right.

520
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,051
There is one thing

521
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,304
that we didn't check yet.

522
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,226
The people concerned.

523
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,395
Let's ask them directly.

524
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,398
How could we?

525
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,026
If we do, they'd deny it.

526
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,652
We should still verify with them.

527
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,154
Who knows?

528
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,448
There may be a reason
others don't know about.

529
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,494
When we get swayed by rumors,

530
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,121
we often lose sight of the truth.

531
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,712
There were some
who were jealous of Hye-in.

532
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,508
Having someone without
conventional training as their boss

533
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,259
hurt their sense of pride.

534
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,678
Wasn't there favoritism involved?

535
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,347
Chef Han wouldn't do that.

536
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,391
My work experience is ordinary,

537
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,435
but he recognized me
for my competence without bias.

538
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,523
When I was new in the kitchen,
he encouraged me a lot.

539
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:04,276
I couldn't have continued cooking
without Chef Han.

540
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,489
Are you saying that the rumors are false?

541
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:14,703
Ms. Kang, I'm very picky
when hiring my kitchen crew.

542
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,415
Although my sous-chef has
a weak mentality,

543
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,668
she has a strong foundation,
she's hardworking,

544
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,629
and most importantly, she treats
her ingredients with sincerity.

545
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,508
She's much better than those who brag
about graduating from a famous school.

546
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,969
I wanted to bring her with me
for a reason.

547
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,973
Are you insisting on being hired together?

548
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,934
The rumors aren't true.
I have no reason to succumb to them.

549
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,291
BELLO BUONO

550
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,588
Thank you for your cooperation.

551
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,964
Don't mention it.

552
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,091
Such misunderstandings should be resolved.

553
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,635
Please don't hesitate to ask
more questions.

554
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,054
- Okay, I'll contact you again.
- Bye.

555
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,015
Take care.

556
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,357
Chef, are you okay?

557
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,072
Goodbye.

558
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,832
WORK EXPERIENCE
HEAD CHEF AT BELLO BUONO

559
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,085
A PERIOD OF INACTIVITY?

560
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,760
Did you find out why Chef Han had
a period of inactivity for two years?

561
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,678
You were right about it.

562
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,223
I verified with his coworkers
that Chef Han had

563
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,724
a neurosurgical operation
on his right wrist.

564
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,976
Also, take a look at this.

565
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,312
<i>Will you be stir-frying this?</i>

566
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,814
<i>Once it gets completed, I will…</i>

567
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:09,318
It's the last show that he was on
before reducing his TV appearances.

568
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,071
When did Chef Yu become his sous-chef?

569
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,866
At the same time when
Chef Han stopped appearing on TV.

570
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,785
<i>I can't wait to taste it.</i>

571
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,120
There was another reason
for being hired together.

572
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,999
<i>You can see him
stir-frying the vegetables.</i>

573
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,210
<i>Wild chives, shepherd's purse…</i>

574
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,883
You're right.

575
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,510
I have a wrist problem.

576
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,680
There was no problem after the operation,

577
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,683
but it hasn't been working well
since a few years ago.

578
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,602
So I've been getting help
from my sous-chef.

579
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,522
That explains the rumors.

580
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,191
Only Hye-in knows about my condition.

581
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,609
I'll keep it that way.

582
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,654
Please keep it a secret from Ganiel Hotel.

583
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,533
You want to get hired
while keeping it a secret?

584
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,452
Do you see this?

585
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,454
This hand is still good enough.

586
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,582
Most of the time, it's normal.

587
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,085
My hand gets numb only from time to time.

588
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,753
I'm getting treated consistently.

589
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,463
I can still cook.

590
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,216
I can't give up my career because of this.

591
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,428
You know,

592
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,555
I didn't get here easily.

593
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,433
I went through much worse than this.

594
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,185
Hye-in and I have been working
well together.

595
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,062
There won't be any problems.

596
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,147
So please,

597
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,107
proceed with the hiring.

598
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,696
Does Chef Yu Hye-in agree with this?

599
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,198
Of course.

600
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,785
This is the best opportunity for Hye-in.

601
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,878
YU HYE-IN

602
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,963
WORK EXPERIENCE

603
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,840
EXPERIENCE IN KOREAN CUISINE IS HER FORTE

604
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,342

00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,718
CREMA HOTEL

ITALIAN RESTAURANT, GUSTORIO

607
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,056
She wasn't incompetent.

608
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,515
Her competency had been hidden.

609
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,383
Here's some coffee.

610
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,931
I pressed it twice by mistake,
so I got another one.

611
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,435
May I join you?

612
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,451
Have you made a decision yet?

613
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,830
I should tell the truth to the client.

614
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,790
Now that I know, I can't keep it a secret.

615
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,209
Did you have a hunch about it?

616
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,838
When I was working in HR,

617
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,632
I often handled rumors at work.

618
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,552
Sometimes, I found out that lies

619
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,221
became truth without any basis.

620
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,434
From seeing how people's lives
can suddenly change

621
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,269
by distorted truth,

622
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,187
I felt very regretful.

623
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,277
I had forgotten about it.

624
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:45,576
What work have you done in HR,
and for how long?

625
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:51,415
From romantic relationship problems,
to schemes and betrayal,

626
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,917
I handled a variety of problems.

627
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,253
What type of problem were you involved in?

628
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,382
From being betrayed
and schemed against, I got fired.

629
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,009
The result wasn't surprising.

630
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,219
Betrayal and scheme?

631
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,265
Those are my expertise.

632
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,563
Why are you nodding?

633
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,941
Do you think I'll betray or be betrayed?

634
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,615
I won't comment.

635
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,912
What kind of person do you take me for?

636
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,080
Oh, right.

637
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,125
I've always been a villain to you
since the beginning.

638
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,294
So from now on,
I'll try to get to know you better.

639
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,176
So what kind of person do you think I am?

640
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,514
I'm not sure,

641
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,725
but one thing is certain.

642
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,687
You worry about your candidate,

643
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,815
but you never take care of yourself.

644
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,507
Your candidate isn't
the only one that is important.

645
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,968
Please take good care

646
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,512
of yourself.

647
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:47,114
I never had the leisure
to take care of myself.

648
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,328
To some, enjoying what other people

649
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,123
take for granted can be a luxury.

650
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:46,048
<i>I never had the leisure
to take care of myself.</i>

651
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,551
<i>To some, enjoying what other people</i>

652
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,346
<i>take for granted can be a luxury.</i>

653
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,853
Are you awake?

654
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,367
How many times did we go around?

655
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,123
Well done today.

656
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,971
We found out

657
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:44,184
that the rumors about
the two chefs were false.

658
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:48,021
However, Chef Han Jeong-won has
a problem in his wrist.

659
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:50,023
Something went wrong
after his operation nine years ago

660
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:53,401
and Chef Yu Hye-in had been
helping him in secret.

661
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:57,823
In my opinion, it'd be difficult
for Chef Han to work in the kitchen

662
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,784
without assistance.

663
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,457
Congratulations. You're officially hired.

664
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:11,044
Did they pick me despite the truth?

665
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,839
What Ganiel Hotel needs now

666
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,049
is a chef with definite star quality.

667
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,845
The only condition is
that you'll be hired alone.

668
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:21,930
Unless you tell the truth,

669
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,600
if you get hired with your sous-chef,
the rumors will follow you.

670
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,646
Ganiel Hotel doesn't want
any unnecessary gossip.

671
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,609
No one can replace your star quality...

672
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,320
There are many
who can replace my sous-chef.

673
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,710
I accept the offer. Let's proceed.

674
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,253
Oh, please ask them

675
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:57,632
for someone who's tight-lipped
and competent.

676
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,264
They hired only you?

677
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,559
It was their decision. What could I do?

678
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,853
I'm sorry that you can't join me.

679
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,064
Then what about me?

680
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,903
Why are you asking me that?

681
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,406
You should take care of your own business.

682
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,490
You promised you'd take responsibility.

683
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,585
If I helped you while keeping it a secret,

684
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,670
you said you'd help me continue my career.

685
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,964
I gave up on other plans.

686
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,759
I stayed by you despite the rumors.

687
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,304
Despite the rumors,
I've taught you until now.

688
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,221
Isn't that enough?

689
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,432
Shouldn't you stand alone now?

690
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,225
As you know,

691
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,436
I don't feel confident by myself.

692
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,939
Without you,

693
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,942
the kitchen crew members will…

694
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,781
Please take me with you.

695
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,491
I will work harder.

696
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,161
I will work harder
to keep your injured wrist a secret.

697
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,624
You said that I was the best.

698
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,466
Thank you so much for your work so far.

699
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,970
You'll get another chance in the future.

700
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,687
Continue to keep it a secret.

701
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,189
As you know, word spreads fast.

702
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,824
That's why your background is important.

703
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:46,866
Exactly.

704
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,618
She can't rely just on her pretty face.

705
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,892
- What?
- Oh, my.

706
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,937
What's gotten into her?

707
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,648
Look at her.

708
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,929
Mr. Yu!

709
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,517
Is this right?

710
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,312
Is this the right thing to do?

711
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,398
I worked very hard.

712
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,276
I did my best to keep his secret,

713
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,070
but why am I being…

714
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,322
Couldn't you keep it a secret?

715
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,699
If only someone kept it a secret…

716
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,952
What do I do now?

717
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,288
I was counting on Chef Han.

718
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,040
All I wanted was

719
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,293
to keep cooking.

720
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,172
I don't feel confident by myself.

721
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,049
I'm…

722
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:30,011
afraid of the people in the kitchen.

723
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,310
Nothing is kept a secret forever.

724
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,688
Relying on others is the same.

725
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,568
Did you enjoy working

726
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,569
with Chef Han?

727
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:53,535
If you don't believe in yourself,
you won't enjoy it anywhere.

728
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,250
Hye-in, you're an excellent chef.

729
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,670
Don't rely on others.

730
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,296
Believe in yourself.

731
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,424
BOOK STORE MAP

732
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,908
Kang-seok.

733
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,202
The book I asked for.

734
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,786
Sure. One moment.

735
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,585
Hey, kiddo.

736
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,046
- I can read all the letters now.
- Really?

737
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,345
"If you want to learn
more about the world,

738
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:36,721
go on a trip.

739
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,599
As long as you're determined,

740
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,392
you'll find an open path."

741
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:43,895
That's quite good.

742
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,438
You've got some tenacity.

743
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,422
"Paths remember everything.

744
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,842
Minor and important things in life.

745
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,972
When you fall hard.

746
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,517
When you firmly stand back up.

747
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:27,021
Where I started and went.

748
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,858
What I dreamed of.

749
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,487
They even know things you didn't plan…"

750
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,281
<i>Paths come back.</i>

751
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,118
"Paths come back."

752
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,496
<i>You'll see many things
during your long journey.</i>

753
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,374
<i>In the end, you'll think
of your cozy home.</i>

754
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,461
<i>Once you've seen everything
that you wanted,</i>

755
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,089
<i>the path will bring you back
to your place.</i>

FINE DINING RESTAURANT

757
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,432
Do I look good?

758
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,642
- Please look at the camera.
- Okay.

759
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,523
- Let me get a close-up.
- Okay.

760
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,525
- Hello.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

761
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,901
It's a pleasure.

762
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,903
Congratulations on your new start.

BANQUET, HOTEL LOBBY

764
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,747
Thank you very much
for everything, Ms. Kang.

765
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,458
Well done on your interview.

766
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,709
It was a pleasure.

767
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,639
GANIEL HOTEL

768
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,066
Please relax.

769
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,651
She's my new candidate.

770
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,074
Hye-in, it's time to find your place, too.

771
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,674
Take care.

772
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,300
Let's go.

773
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,563
I thought that she'd stay hiding.

774
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,816
Impressive.

775
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,947
Was I being too blunt
insisting that I met you here?

776
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,907
No, you did the right thing.

777
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,867
Did you finally make a decision?

778
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,371
Yes, I decided to take on the challenge.

779
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,455
To be a food scientist.

780
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:53,000
It's a perfect position for a cook
who's afraid of the kitchen.

781
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,169
You said that you weren't confident.

782
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,338
What made you change your mind?

783
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,094
There's a tenacious employee at Peoplez.

784
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,057
Thank you.

785
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,101
Thanks to you, I could muster up courage.

786
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,399
Will I be able to make it?

787
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,943
Résumés don't lie.

788
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,780
Those few lines show
the person's effort and time spent

789
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,074
as well as the result.

790
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,994
Your résumé isn't fancy,

791
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,371
but it shows the time you spent diligently

792
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:33,416
on your research as a cook.

793
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,085
They say that paths remember everything.

794
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,379
You've been working hard so far.

795
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,675
You'll be someone quite influential
in your field.

796
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,114
What is it?

797
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,949
Why are you looking at me like that?

798
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,038
I keep seeing new sides of you.

799
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,583
I didn't know that
you could say things like that.

800
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,669
What do you mean exactly?

801
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,548
Warm, comforting,

802
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,177
and encouraging words.

803
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,099
Books.

804
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,518
They're all in the books.

805
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,454
FOOD RESEARCH INSTITUTE

806
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,135
Well done.

807
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,681
Thanks to you,
I could wrap up this project.

808
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,683
It's you who made the decision.

809
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,604
I didn't expect you to recommend
Hye-in a new workplace.

810
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,107
I happened to find
the right position for her.

811
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,150
Every company needs different talents.

812
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,695
While some need famous stars,

813
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,573
some need competent people
who aren't in the spotlight.

814
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,533
Everyone has different capabilities.

815
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,829
I think that I know better now

816
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,539
what headhunting is.

817
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,793
Finding a place where
you can demonstrate your competence

818
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:43,254
seems like meaningful work.

819
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:48,926
You're amazing.

820
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,973
It's just work.

821
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,224
No need to be so symbolic.

822
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,565
Anyway, you're adapting quite quickly.

823
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,109
Is it because
you work for a competent CEO?

824
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:10,156
Actually,
adaptability is one of my strong suits.

825
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,619
Let's go before it rains.

826
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:15,745
Rain?

827
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,164
But the weather is so nice.

828
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,882
What? How did you know?

829
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,306
What's wrong?

830
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,016
Better than not having one.

831
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:20,893
Seriously?

832
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,729
- It isn't funny.
- It is.

833
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,944
Let's get going.

834
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:40,514
{\an8}<i>Ms. Kang, do you like winning that much?</i>

835
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,808
{\an8}<i>I hate losing.
I want to win at everything.</i>

836
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,478
{\an8}Then I'll always let you win from now on.

837
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,564
{\an8}He's my candidate whom I contacted first.

838
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,149
{\an8}Can you just let this one go?

839
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:51,150
{\an8}How can you say that?!

840
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,236
{\an8}<i>It still seems awkward
between Kyung-hwa and Mr. Kim.</i>

841
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,405
{\an8}<i>Have a few drinks
and things will smooth over.</i>

842
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,199
{\an8}- A welcoming party.
- A welcoming party?

843
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,367
{\an8}Line up if you want to drink
with Ms. Kang.

844
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,452
{\an8}This is a rare chance.

845
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:02,453
{\an8}<i>Have you seen Ms. Kang?</i>

846
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,623
{\an8}<i>Whenever she gets drunk,
she goes to the office.</i>

847
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,000
{\an8}Ms. Kang?

848
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,047
Mr. Yu.
