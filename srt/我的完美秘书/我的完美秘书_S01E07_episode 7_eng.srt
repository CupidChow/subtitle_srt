♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,300
    
 ♫  I don't know why I'm being like this  ♫

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,180
♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,130
    
 ♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,680
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,410
   

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,990
   

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,100
   

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,700
 To Kang Ji Yun, what kind of person is Yu Eun Ho? 

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:15,940


18
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,800
   

19
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,500
CEO, look, it's Ju Hee.

20
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,040
Get yourself together.

21
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,080
Let's have dinner. I'll get the car.

22
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,560
Is it far from here?

23
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,420
No, it's not that far.

24
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,790
In that case, let's walk.

25
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,460
I've been sitting for a long time.

26
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,570
Besides, the weather is nice.

27
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,270
Sounds good. Let's go.

28
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,430
I'm doomed.

29
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,700
How was the Hyeonjo Group meeting with you and Consultant Oh?

30
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,870
It worked out.

31
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,320
That's all?

32
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,560
Yes.

33
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,390
You can hear the details from Consultant Oh tomorrow at work.

34
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,920
- Is there no business talk after work? 
 - That's right.

35
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,890
So I encourage you to stop thinking of work when you're off.

36
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,960
You need to rest your brain.

37
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,800
That's not up to me.

38
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,240
Byeol says, "Hi."

39
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,710
Did her wound heal?

40
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,750
She says you're super cool.

41
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,780
What did you do?

42
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,010
Byeol has taste, unlike somebody.

43
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,790
What do you mean by that?

44
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,780
I hear you're a long-time regular at the bookstore,

45
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,840
from even before Kang Seok owned the place.

46
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,050
When did you start going?

47
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,650
Maybe in tenth grade.

48
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,200
I went to get a textbook, and I liked it.

49
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,030
I smelled the familiar scent of books,

50
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,630
then I started going every day.

51
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,080
I didn't have many friends.

52
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,700
That's how I became friends with Mi Ae.

53
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,170
That was the only place I could rest.

54
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,640
I tried imagining you back then.

55
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,500
I bet you were quite a difficult student like you are now.

56
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,690
Secretary Yu, what were you like?

57
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,270
Were you also nosy when you were a child?

58
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,420
No, I was really shy.

59
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,480
I was introverted, had no friends, and was scared of everything.

60
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,570
I can't imagine that.

61
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,210
I gradually changed as I grew up...

62
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,930
for the better.

63
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,310
So I like aging for that reason.

64
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,090
It feels like I'm becoming stronger.

65
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,850
I become more and more scared of things.

66
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,360
I feel like everything will fall apart if I trip and fall.

67
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,700
So what if you fall? You can always get up again.

68
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,580
I'll hold you up.

69
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,880
Really.

70
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,810
I used to be a member of a rescue club.

71
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,350
What are you saying?

72
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,030
I used to climb.

73
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,610
I've got strong hands.

74
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,300
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but could you take a photo of us?

75
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,770
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

76
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,930
Just a moment.

77
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,710
- Thank you. 
 - Please take a nice photo!

78
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,010
I will!

79
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,160
Taking the photo.

80
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,910
One, two, three.

81
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,460
- One more. 
 - Yes.

82
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,550
One, two, three. Last one.

83
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,570
One, two, three.

84
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,680
They look great.

85
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,450
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

86
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,650
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

87
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,310
I'll take a photo for you.

88
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,710
No, it's okay.

89
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,380
I'm a great photographer.

90
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,970
There's no need.

91
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,500
She says she takes great photos. Will you take one?

92
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,850
Please stand over there.

93
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,600
Shall we?

94
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,570
Get closer to each other.

95
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,450
All right, smile.

96
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,930
One, two, three.

97
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,570
One more.

98
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,460
Smile!

99
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,410
One, two, three!

100
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,290
   

101
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,130
   

102
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,220
   

103
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,390
   

104
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,520
   

105
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,920
Was the component changed?

106
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,070
Yes, I increased the content by 2%.

107
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,980
What about the moisturizing cream?

108
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,950
The consistency has improved a lot. It was...

109
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,730
too watery last time.

110
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,650
I see. The spreadability is not bad.

111
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,970
The consistency correction didn't make it feel heavier.

112
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,230
It absorbs quickly, yet remains hydrated.

113
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,050
It's much better than the last sample.

114
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,900
Yes, the scent is quite good.

115
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,440
- It's nice. 
 - Oh, yes.

116
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,270
 Diane Cosmetic's PM (Project Manager) Jeong Ha Na. 

117
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,260
She has been actively job-hunting, and a position opened.

118
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,450
She's working on the paperwork.

119
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,900
Did you find out why she wants to leave? Usually, in a rushed—

120
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,520
A workplace relationship.

121
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,140
They broke up recently, and it's hard to work together.

122
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,680
Did you make sure she really wants this?

123
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,090
She might regret it or renege on an emotional decision.

124
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,150
When a workplace relationship ends,

125
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,450
it's better for both if the more competent one leaves in a clean transition.

126
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,880
I have discussed it fully with the candidate.

127
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,720
It sounds like first-hand experience.

128
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,840
No comment.

129
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,470
- "No comment"? 
 - Yes.

130
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,270
- Let's finish if there's nothing more to report. 
 - Okay.

131
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,600
The meeting is over.

132
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,750
- The meeting is over. 
 - First-hand experience?

133
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,020
- "No comment"? 
 - The meeting is over.

134
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,520
Wow, what a small world.

135
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,410
Candidate Jeong Ha Na...

136
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,000
She's your sunbae, Deputy Na.

137
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,700
When we sent someone to Diane before,

138
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,530
she was the PM to oversee it.

139
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,690
That's right. Back then she said she'd stay at Diane forever.

140
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,300
A workplace relationship is never a good idea.

141
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,610
I've never seen it end well.

142
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,240
- That's right. 
 - Gosh...

143
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,820
I'd love to try it at least once.

144
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,740
A secret romance... So romantic!

145
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,890
Gyeong Hwa, you haven't been hurt yet.

146
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,120
Listen carefully. Office romance... is a curse.

147
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,210
Get your senses straight and avoid it. Got it?

148
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,510
- Got it? 
 - Yes.

149
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,920
Gosh, it would never happen at our company.

150
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,920
That would never, ever happen.

151
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,010
 Why are these invoices a mess? 

152
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,010
It's not over when we place the candidate.

153
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,610
I told you to tell them to file these on time. Am I supposed to?

154
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,960
Got it, got it.

155
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,240
I'll tell each team to be more careful when they issue invoices.

156
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,500
Why?

157
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,140
- What? 
 -  Just a moment. 

158
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,450
-  Hey!  
 - What?

159
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,400
- What? 
 - You just smiled.

160
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,100
I didn't. Don't change the subject.

161
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,590
So what will you do about this?

162
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,190
I'll speak to each team so you don't have to worry.

163
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,430
Didn't I just say this?

164
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,590
- When did you? 
 -  Didn't I?

165
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,750
Gosh, really...

166
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,330
Let's see. I'll jot it down.

167
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm in trouble. I just got to work, but I'm already tired.

168
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,940
Gosh, I need to get myself together.

169
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,670
 Yes, hello. 

170
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,260
- What? 
 - Secretary Yu is coming.

171
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,430
What are you talking about?

172
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,480
 Hello. 

173
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,150
How did you know? Did you see him?

174
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,690
 - You're early.  
 -  How could I not?

175
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,170
He's so loud.

176
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,040
- How did you know? Thank you. 
 - I know, right?

177
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,850
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

178
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,310
Good morning.

179
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,890
Yes.

180
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,630
I'm setting up a meeting with CEO Hwang.

181
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,510
I'll let you know when the meeting is confirmed.

182
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,140
I think you'll need to eat near the office before you go.

183
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,700
What would you like to eat?

184
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,690
What would you like, Secretary Yu?

185
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,370
What about your favorite malatang or the bakery in the front?

186
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,780
What do you like, Secretary Yu?

187
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,290
Me?

188
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,250
I like stir-fried pork on a day like this.

189
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,790
Secretary Yu, you're so predictable.

190
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,570
Stir-fried pork goes well with such weather.

191
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,350
Let's do that for lunch today.

192
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,030
- What? 
 - Nothing.

193
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,940
♫  I want to know your everything  ♫

194
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,420
♫  Baby, know you more and more  ♫

195
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,600
♫  More and more, I want to know it all  ♫

196
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,600
♫  One more step, should I get closer to you?  ♫

197
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,520
Kang Ji Yun, let's go have lunch.

198
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,210
I'm going with Secretary Yu.

199
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,570
Yes, I heard. You're going for stir-fried pork.

200
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,520
There's a good spot near here. Hurry and come.

201
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,060
 Let's go! 

202
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,040
Are you going to lunch, Director Seo?

203
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,440
Let's get rice and soup. I need a hangover cure.

204
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,600
- Stir-fried pork. 
 - "Stir-fried pork"?

205
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,040
- You're coming, too? 
 - Yes, I need to eat.

206
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,770
Let's all go eat. Who wants stir-fried pork?

207
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,340
Me!

208
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,770
I love stir-fried pork.

209
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,180
- CEO— 
 - Pork is good.

210
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,460
Secretary Yu, let's go eat.

211
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,560
Let's go.

212
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,020
- CEO— 
 - She's coming.

213
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,040
Wait a second.

214
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,990
I thought you didn't like stir-fried pork.

215
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,480
Do you want to eat something else with me?

216
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,640
Stir-fried pork is perfect on such a day.

217
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,970
What's special about today?

218
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,340
I really don't want stir-fried pork.

219
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,240
No one wants rice and soup, right?

220
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,650
You can't stop yourself from liking someone.

221
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,820
I really tried not to get into a workplace relationship, but...

222
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,620
I kept looking at him,

223
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,790
going to his side, and becoming curious about what he likes...

224
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,690
The next thing I knew, I was in a workplace relationship.

225
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,030
- And you broke up, too. 
 - Yes.

226
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,380
I must get a new job.

227
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,470
You didn't tell him I'm changing jobs, right?

228
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,270
- Come on. 
 - Jin Guk can't know about this.

229
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,890
Do you think I'm that foolish?

230
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,870
Maintaining confidentiality is a fundamental principle.

231
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,290
Gyu Rim, I don't want anything else.

232
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,020
All I want is to quickly get a new position.

233
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,520
But we still need you to get a good position.

234
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,080
You can't ruin your career over a breakup. No way.

235
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,460
Is it that tough?

236
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,990
You said it was a secret romance. So no one knows about the breakup, right?

237
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,480
 Thank you. 

238
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,040
 Manager Jeong! Come here, over here. 

239
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,710
 - Here. 
 - Chief, why did you call Manager Jeong? 

240
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,850
 We can't let her eat alone. 

241
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,860
 Manager Jeong, you're okay, right? 

242
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,500
 What do you mean? 

243
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,800
 - Enjoy your food! 
 - Yes! 

244
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,250
 - Enjoy! 
 - Let's eat! 

245
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,010
 It's so tasty! 

246
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,810
 I'll get going. I'm done eating. 

247
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,810
 - Enjoy your meal. 
 - See you. 

248
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,380
 Manager Kim Jin Guk. 

249
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,860
 Do you really have to make a point? 

250
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,650
 How can you sit there and swallow food? 

251
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,150
 Address me appropriately before everyone finds out we dated. 

252
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,060
 Manager Jeong Ha Na, those who need to know already know. 

253
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,960
 Did you tell people? 

254
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,660
 - Did you go around telling them? 
 - People already sensed it. 

255
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,440
 It's because you started sobbing at that gathering. 

256
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,510
 We broke up. 

257
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,590
 It doesn't matter anymore. 

258
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,800
 If they ask, I'll deny it. Is that good? 

259
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,390
 Wait. 

260
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,560
 I'll leave first. Leave after five minutes. 

261
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,980
   

262
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,490
 Ha Na! A moment, please. 

263
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,610
 Don't stare. Get back to work. 

264
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,060
 Do your work. 

265
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,750
 Ha Na, you must be tired. 

266
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,840
 No, I'm fine. 

267
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,960
 You'll need to work with Manager Kim Jin Guk on this project. 

268
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,100
 That's okay, right? 

269
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,240
 If it's too uncomfortable, one of you could go to a different team. 

270
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,010
 No, it's okay. I'm good— 

271
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,290
 Oh, right! 

272
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,500
 That's the right way. 

273
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,790
 Sure, you get over the pain by working. Here. 

274
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,170
 Fighting, Manager Jeong! 

275
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,840
 Go back to work. 

276
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,650
 So everyone knows. They do. 

277
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,770
   

278
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,320
Hello, Chairman.

279
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
Welcome.

280
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,860
Take a seat there.

281
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,600
Did you have something to talk about?

282
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,490
CEO Kang, you're just as impatient as I am. You get straight to the point.

283
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,980
"Get to the point." I learned it from you.

284
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,160
All right...

285
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,720
Soon,

286
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,170
the Ministry of Economy and Finance's National Investment Corporation

287
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,540
will fill a position.

288
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,320
It's a tough position to hire for,

289
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,520
and they decided to take recommendations.

290
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,990
I have a decent candidate.

291
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,220
Why don't you recommend him if you think he's a decent match?

292
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,610
Vice President Lee Seok Jin of Yoosung Finance.

293
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,310
I'll take care of the rest.

294
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,310
You just make the recommendation.

295
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,250
   

296
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,710
I'm sorry, Chairman.

297
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,680
I don't think I can help you with this.

298
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,750
If there's one rule I follow in my work,

299
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,750
it is never to lose objectivity, no matter the situation or the person.

300
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,460
If a headhunting firm compromises on trust and fairness,

301
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,130
it no longer holds value as a search firm.

302
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,180
I'm sure you don't want to compromise your portfolio company.

303
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,810
Peoplez...

304
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll steward it my way.

305
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,100
CEO Kang...

306
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,860
You're going in the right direction.

307
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,140
Thank you for understanding.

308
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,250
"My way"?

309
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,440
 Chairman, CEO Kim Hye Jin would like to meet with you. 

310
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,890
I hear you're interested in the National Investment Corporation position.

311
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,930
It seems someone couldn't keep a secret.

312
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,180
Getting people to reveal secrets is a skill.

313
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,230
Go ahead and blame me for my skills if you like.

314
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,850
I'll handle it without a problem if you entrust me with it.

315
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,910
This is a perfect occasion to use a search firm.

316
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,210
What do you want?

317
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,620
Peoplez.

318
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,620
I know Woomyeong Invest holds the

319
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,110
authority as the majority stockholder to name the CEO of Peoplez,

320
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,730
and you control Woomyeong Invest's capital.

321
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,700
If you conclude that I'm better than Kang Ji Yun,

322
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,590
give me Peoplez.

323
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,580
You'll find that I'm much more useful than CEO Kang.

324
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,410
   

325
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,100
Deputy. 
    

326
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,620
Deputy, won't you answer your phone?

327
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,710
I can't answer this. I shouldn't answer this call.

328
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,930
   

329
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,520
They should legally ban workplace romance.

330
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,690
Would you go so far as to legally ban it?

331
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,030
It sounds like you support workplace romance.

332
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,830
Right? You do, right?

333
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,960
It's because he hasn't been through it. If he did, he couldn't say that.

334
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,840
Deputy, what in the world did you suffer that

335
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,800
you detest workplace romance?

336
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,270
- In your previous job— 
 - No comment.

337
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,540
Sure, "No comment." I am not curious anyway, not at all.

338
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,720
Secretary, you haven't answered yet.

339
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,400
Do you support or oppose workplace romance?

340
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,240
 (What do you say?) 

341
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,940
Geez, you scared me!

342
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,070
CEO, why are you standing there like that?

343
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,390
Gosh, I found it.

344
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,730
Get back to your discussion.

345
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,860
That was to be shredded.

346
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,900
CEO Kang! Over here.

347
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,720
I was going there.

348
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,290
This is traumatizing.

349
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,910
 So should we change things with the strategic planning team at Hyeonjo Group? 

350
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,060
 Since the subsidiaries are continuing in a slump, 

351
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,180
 they realized they needed a change. 

352
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,840
Is this the first time Hyeonjo Group is bringing in an outside person?

353
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,650
So workplace romance...

354
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,110
CEO, I'm Kim Yeong Soo from Peoplez. You know I do a good job.

355
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,300
Yes, just trust me. CEO, no, Hyungnim!

356
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,830
 Just trust me and push for that candidate. He will work out. 

357
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,170
Gosh, really! Should we go to the sauna?

358
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,920
Hyungnim, do trust me.

359
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,080
Yes! I'm sure. Yes.

360
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,470
Should I get some coffee?

361
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,320
 Geez, I couldn't hear him. 

362
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,150
Did you break that?

363
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,240
Are you that strong these days?

364
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,700
Why is this made so poorly?

365
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,460
Let's finish the discussion.

366
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,430
So what was this month's revenue?

367
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,690
Kang Ji Yun, why don't you focus? We went over all that.

368
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,350
You did.

369
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,840
We were talking about the Hyeonjo Group, right?

370
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,590
The strategic planning team, right? Go ahead.

371
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,510
They will recruit external personnel for the strategic planning team

372
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,600
and completely restructure the organization.

373
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,500
So they're in contact with a re-organization expert right now.

374
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,090
I'm working hard for once. Why don't you pay attention to me?

375
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,690
Kang Ji Yun, what is going on with you?

376
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,420
Are you aware that you're not focusing on work?

377
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,180
I am focused.

378
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,970
What's going on? Pull yourself together.

379
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,710
May I check a couple more things?

380
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,640
Yes. Ask as many questions as you'd like, Managing Director.

381
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,450
Okay. In the company report you shared last time,

382
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,050
it says the long-term plan that the company seeks is...

383
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,350
Just a moment. It was right here...

384
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,060
Do you mean the company analysis I sent last week?

385
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,150
Just a moment.

386
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,210
Please bring the analysis report we sent to the Managing Director.

387
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,150
I never knew I was so indecisive.

388
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,330
I keep changing my mind ten times a day.

389
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,210
The right thing to do for my career is to move jobs.

390
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,650
But my concerns are making me hesitate.

391
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,800
Will I get used to the new company?

392
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,500
What is the company structure, and what is the company atmosphere like?

393
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,900
 I'm nervous, and I keep thinking... 

394
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,700
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

395
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,270
- You shouldn't run. 
 - I have so many questions.

396
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,210
CEO Kang.

397
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,990
CEO Kang.

398
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,960
I'm sorry.

399
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,920
Please continue.

400
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,610
Excuse me.

401
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,100
CEO.

402
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,520
Thank you.

403
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,260
Please take your time reviewing it.

404
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,490
Director Seo, get me a new secretary.

405
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,050
Wh-What? "A secretary"? You have Eun Ho.

406
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,090
Get me someone other than Secretary Yu.

407
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:41,140
What are you saying suddenly? There's no one like Eun Ho.

408
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,010
He's patient with your personality and is the office mood-maker.

409
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,800
I want to lift him up and thank him.

410
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,880
So promote Secretary Yu and find me a new assistant.

411
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Why? What's all this? I thought you were getting along.

412
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,330
Did Eun Ho make a mistake?

413
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,530
He keeps distracting me from work.

414
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,990
Are you not the one distracting him?

415
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,050
- He keeps crossing the line. 
 - What are you saying?

416
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,640
Tell me, so I understand you. What line? Cross how?

417
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,670
Gosh...

418
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,570
What do you mean? What's happening? Tell me.

419
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,610
Nothing's happening.

420
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,550
I shouldn't have said anything. Forget about it.

421
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,220
I need to understand what's going on!

422
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,930
I was just being fickle. You know me.

423
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,850
Don't worry. Forget about it.

424
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,070
It's so frustrating.

425
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,180
Eun Ho, shall we have a chat?

426
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,740
Ji Yun asked me to find a new secretary.

427
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,670
Did something happen between you two?

428
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,000
♫  Just like you  ♫

429
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,390
♫  A star shining in your eyes  ♫

430
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,380
♫  Just like moon  ♫

431
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:24,580
♫  Even when darkness falls, it shines  ♫

432
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,040
Thank you. Bye.

433
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:35,970
♫  When this night passes and the morning dawns  ♫

434
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,730
CEO.

435
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,910
Did I do something wrong?

436
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,230
Director Seo told me.

437
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,570
Please tell me if I'm not meeting your expectations.

438
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,420
Secretary Yu, you did nothing wrong.

439
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,450
I'm the problem.

440
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,570
I like you, Yu Eun Ho.

441
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,390
So I keep acting out of character,

442
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,650
and it's affecting work.

443
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,080
So I thought to get some distance between us.

444
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,740
But this is my problem.

445
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,000
I should take care of it by myself.

446
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,430
I'm sorry if I caused any discomfort.

447
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:35,160
Forget everything I said today, and keep doing what you've been doing.

448
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,100
I'll take care of my own feelings.

449
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,910
You can go now.

450
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,700
♫  When this night passes and the morning dawns  ♫

451
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:59,910
♫  This moment when I meet your eyes every day  ♫

452
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:07,380
♫  Approaches me like a dream  ♫

453
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,720
♫  Just like forever moonlight  ♫

454
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:19,280
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

455
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,690
♫  Just like a forever starlight  ♫

♫  I'm always by your side  ♫

457
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:43,340
♫  Until that day when your light dims  ♫

458
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,710
♫  Just like forever moonlight  ♫

♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

460
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,500
Dad, are you hot?

461
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,510
I forgot.

462
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,560
Did something happen?

463
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,970
No. Go change your clothes. Let's have dinner.

464
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,140
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

465
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,220
 I like you, Yu Eun Ho. 

466
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,050
Hello.

467
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,240
Good morning.

468
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,430
Yes, good morning.

469
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,880
Yes, this is Kang Ji Yun.

470
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,170
Yes.

471
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,550
No.

472
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,760
We just have the final candidate interview left.

473
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,500
Around three final candidates.

474
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,770
What would you like to eat?

475
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,480
I'm not hungry. You can go for lunch.

476
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,820
 Whom are you staring at so attentively? 

477
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,710
 Don't worry about it and just work. 

478
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,870
 Workplace romance is the root of all evil. Don't do it. 

479
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,990
Why out of nowhere?

480
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:50,180
I was just... looking...

481
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,910
 You keep looking if you like someone. 

482
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,870
 Right... 

483
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,710
I guess you keep looking...

484
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,560
 because that's where your heart is. 

485
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,620
 Right, it's the root of all evil. 

486
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,010
 It's not a good feeling. 

487
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,480
♫  For countless days  ♫

488
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,220
- I'll get it for you. 
 - I will get it.

489
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,470
♫  A day without you  ♫

490
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,330
I'll go alone.

491
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,280
Gangin Foods is getting into organics. Look into it, Director Woo.

492
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,360
Got it.

493
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,780
Ms. CEO, you need to leave for the Migang Law Firm meeting in five minutes.

494
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,520
I'll go with Director Seo, then go straight home from there.

495
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,830
- Follow up, okay? 
 - Oh, okay.

496
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,020
Speaking of Gangin Foods, I want their dumplings.

497
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,700
 They are awesome, right? 

498
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,580
 It would be so good to fry crispy dumplings to eat with beer. 

499
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,100
The juicy beef would just...

500
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,200
♫  I want to run to you  ♫

501
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:34,330
♫  Run to where you are again  ♫

502
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,920
- I'll go alone. 
 - Ms. CEO.

503
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,680
Go with me today.

504
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,150
No.

505
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,900
Go home early today.

506
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,620
CEO Kang!

507
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,430
Where are you going?

508
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,720
- The Yoosun Group headquarters. 
 - I see.

509
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,820
Let's go together. I'll take you.

510
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,590
I'll take good care of CEO Kang today.

511
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,840
- Let's go. 
 - Just a second.

512
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,720
The meeting materials.

513
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,960
I could have gone alone.

514
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,450
It's okay. Treat me to something yummy after the meeting.

515
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,180
Thanks.

516
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,670
Do you like Secretary Yu?

517
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,930
You've been self-conscious around Secretary Yu.

518
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:50,470
You don't reply so my imagination runs.

519
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,500
Excuse me.

520
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,380
Please focus on the person in front of you.

521
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,200
Please concentrate on me.

522
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,150
It's hard to get let down and eat a steak.

523
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,120
Sorry.

524
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,470
If you're sorry, then eat.

525
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,860
What do you think of me?

526
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:45,130
I'm quite decent, right?

527
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,090
Young, rich, and handsome.

528
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:51,800
I'm way out of your league.

529
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,960
Young, rich, and handsome men,

530
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,850
I don't like them.

531
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,350
Then what kind of men do you like?

532
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,380
Jeong Hun.

533
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,510
I want you in my life for a long time.

534
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,340
I don't want it awkward between us.

535
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,710
I'm going on a blind date next week!

536
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:47,890
Don't you dare cry when I get a girlfriend later, Noona! Really!

537
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,160
Let's eat.

538
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,980
Ms. Jeong!

539
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,690
- Over here! 
 - Oh.

540
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,490
Are you here to see the Principal?

541
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,810
Yes, but I struck out.

542
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,770
What about you?

543
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,880
I'm here to get this.

544
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,250
My son is clumsy, just like me.

545
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,160
- How old is your son? 
 - Seven.

546
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,220
Seven...

547
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,890
Here. Take this and share it with your son.

548
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:58,130
This is really sweet and tasty. 
    

549
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,980
You should take it and eat it.

550
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,490
It's too depressing to eat sweets alone on a day like this.

551
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:09,660
Is something the matter?

552
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,200
I got rejected,

553
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,040
even before I really confessed my feelings.

554
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,040
Is it a one-sided crush?

555
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,730
Do you want to grab a beer?

556
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,620
How many years has it been?

557
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,460
A sudden question?

558
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,240
When did I start working at—

559
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,720
- No, your one-sided crush. 
 - Oh...

560
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:02,240
That's...

561
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,980
When did it start? I don't even know.

562
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,520
I first saw her in high school.

563
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,970
Was she your first love?

564
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:13,510
I didn't start liking her back then.

565
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:18,390
So is your husband your first love?

566
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,380
- I don't have a husband. 
 - What?

567
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,870
You said you have a son.

568
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,460
I do have a son.

569
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,880
It seems you're biased.

570
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,940
There are many different kinds of families.

571
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:35,820
My mistake. I apologize.

572
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,460
In that case, are you also going through...

573
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,360
a one-sided crush?

574
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,210
That's how I could tell.

575
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,990
We are one-sided crush buddies.

576
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,600
Cheers, even if it's just us.

577
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,400
- Fine. Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

578
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,860
My head hurts.

579
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,160
- My head hurts! 
 - Look at you.

580
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,420
I'm surprised you didn't lose the child's stuff on your way back.

581
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,850
How much did you drink?

582
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,930
I don't know. My head is ringing.

583
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,360
Whom did you drink with?

584
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,390
You didn't drink by yourself like a pathetic fool, did you?

585
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:31,510
No. Just someone I know.

586
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,930
You drank that much with someone you just know?

587
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,200
It's a friend... a friend.

588
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,720
Do you work out with her?

589
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,260
You kept screaming "fighting" when you got home last night.

590
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,470
- "Better say fighting"? 
 - Right.

591
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,760
Hurry and wake up Seo Jun.

592
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,920
All right.

00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:00,580

 It's getting re-released. 
   

599

 What? That's amazing!

Hey, Mr. Yu. You're up.

616
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:47,010
Yes, Ms. Jeong. I got your text last night,

617
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,130
but there were too many typos to understand what you meant.

618
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:54,850
I meant, let's watch a movie.

619
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,770
 Mr. Yu, let's go to the movies. 

620
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,650
Sure.

621
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,010
Let's take the children on Byeol's day off from kindergarten.

622
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:04,200
 No, just us two. 

623
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,800
What? "Us two"?

624
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,240
 Y-Yes, the film you mentioned the other day. 

625
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,270
 It's being re-released. 

626
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,250
 Children can't watch that. 

627
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:17,140
The theater happens to be near your work.

628
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,600
Yes...

629
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,720
Okay, see you that day then.

630
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,130
- What? 
 - I'll watch the children that day.

631
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,020
How long were you eavesdropping?

632
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,650
I have been here all along.

633
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,600
Hey. Gosh, I feel so relieved.

634
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,500
Aigoo! Seo Jun, wake up!

635
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,990
- Dad, will you watch a movie with Auntie? 
 - Yes.

636
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,200
- Where? 
 - Near my office.

637
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,550
Take us, too.

638
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,790
You won't like it. It's for adults.

639
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,140
Let me tie your hair up. Come on.

640
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,640
I reviewed the résumé you sent, and it could use adjustments.

641
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:19,460
List projects you participated in that match the client's job description.

642
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,680
Deputy, someone is here to see you.

643
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,510
Who?

644
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,470
My gosh.

645
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,890
How did you find me here?

646
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,240
It's not me. I really didn't call him.

647
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,760
I want to know how you came here, too.

648
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,120
You never even take a sick day, and you took a weekday off.

649
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,960
It's so obvious. I know you.

650
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,860
You said you'd never change jobs. Gosh...

651
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,090
You said you can't, either. The person who can't tolerate it has to go.

652
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,910
You stay. I'll leave.

653
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,720
Forget it. It's all done.

654
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,710
- Gyu Rim found me a good— 
 - You said you gave this brand your youth!

655
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:11,800
You stay. Don't waste the hard work you put in!

656
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,800
You worked hard, too! You did half the work!

657
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,030
Gyu Rim, I'll change jobs!

658
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,830
You know that Jeong Ha Na's an amazing leader, smart,

659
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,540
loves this brand, and is so polite to her co-workers!

660
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,400
It would be a loss for her to change jobs due to me.

661
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,700
Gyu Rim, he's so foolishly nice, yields to others

662
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,510
and supports everyone behind the scenes.

663
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,310
- Listen— 
 - Tell him not to get used elsewhere and stay put!

664
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,650
- No, Gyu Rim. I'll leave! 
 - No, Gyu Rim, I will.

665
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,970
- Gyu Rim! 
 - Gyu Rim!

666
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:40,170
What are you doing right now?

667
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,390
You're so sensitive to even handle a season change. Where do you think you'll go?

668
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:48,170
How is their cafeteria? Are they good? You're a picky eater!

669
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,490
I'm sure I won't starve.

670
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:51,380
Can you really live without me?

671
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,260
♫  You are my destiny  ♫

672
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,990
I regret not holding onto you that day.

673
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,310
I regret it like crazy.

674
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,850
Ha Na, don't leave...

675
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,890
the company and me.

676
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,180
Don't leave, Jeong Ha Na.

677
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,670
♫  I only look at you  ♫

678
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,590
Are you crying right now?

679
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,070
Are you crying?

680
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:27,160
♫  You are the one I love, you are  ♫

681
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,730
So romantic.

682
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,450
Gyu Rim, I'm sorry.

683
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,630
I'll call you.

684
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:41,390
Gyu Rim, I owe you one.

685
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,070
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

686
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,370
Take care.

687
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,240
Bye.

688
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,950
   

689
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,110
 Look, they're holding hands. 

690
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:56,140
 - Wow. 
 - Look at that. 

691
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,810
So they made up?

692
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:04,590
Yes, they are dating.

693
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:07,340
 So no new job? 

694
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,090
She won't be going.

695
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,200
You worked so hard to prepare.

696
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,470
- Are you okay, Deputy Na? 
 - Of course, I'm okay.

697
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,750
It doesn't matter if I'm not okay.

698
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,790
What do I do? They like each other.

699
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,200
You can't deny love.

700
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,760
 We are here. 

701
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,800
It won't be long. Stay here.

702
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,090
This is the newest updated material about the company.

703
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,160
I thought it would be helpful since you haven't met with them in a while.

704
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,490
I marked the information that changed since last year.

705
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:16,320
With the last-minute notice, you must have prepared it all night.

706
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,050
Thank you.

707
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,390
When did you get back?

708
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,200
It's been about thirty minutes.

709
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,080
You should have woken me. I'm sorry.

710
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,690
It was the last thing on today's schedule.

711
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,390
It's okay.

712
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,630
Let's go.

713
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,290
Okay.

714
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,330
Hyung, I'm here.

715
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,560
 Over here! 

716
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:58,920
What is this? Wow.

717
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,100
Did you prepare all this by yourself?

718
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,850
Stop staring and sit down.

719
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,200
It looks so good.

720
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,010
You had a fight with your wife, right?

721
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,150
What are you talking about?

722
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:13,350
I just wanted to catch up with you.

723
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,800
Are you sure?

724
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,500
Really.

725
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,800
I got nervous when you wanted to drink.

726
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,760
- I worried it was an issue. 
 - Let's toast.

727
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,250
I feel something is up.

728
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,300
- Eun Ho. 
 - Yes?

729
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,700
How did it feel when you found out about Byeol?

730
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,460
What?

731
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,690
Is Mi Ae pregnant?

732
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:44,900
No, it's not like that.

733
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:49,220
I just wonder what it's like to be a dad.

734
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,600
Gosh, come on.

735
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,770
Mi Ae wants a child, but I'm not confident.

736
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,420
It's tough enough to handle myself.

737
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,790
How can I be responsible for someone else?

738
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,610
And I'm afraid to bring them into

739
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,860
this horrible world and make them suffer.

740
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,340
Am I a coward?

741
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,860
Hyung, it makes sense you're scared. You would be responsible for a life.

742
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:15,240
It's hard even when you consider it thoroughly,

743
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,110
but I'm sure you'd be fantastic.

744
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,780
Sure. Thanks.

745
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,300
It's that difficult, but you're doing it.

746
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:29,300
It's all thanks to you, Mi Ae, and everyone else helping out.

747
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,600
Byeol comes here and just reads by herself.

748
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:38,310
Byeol and CEO Kang have so much in common.

749
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,760
They both love books.

750
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,450
- Are they similar? 
 - Yes.

751
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,720
- What's up with the sad eyes? 
 - What?

752
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,970
Is something bothering you?

753
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,570
No, it's nothing. No worries.

754
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,460
Hey, Yu Eun Ho.

755
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,830
You don't have to pretend everything is fine.

756
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:03,840
Relax, Man! You don't need to be perfect with me.

757
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:09,220
Also, try being vulnerable for once, Guy.

758
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,090
Hyung.

759
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,770
I...

760
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:29,250
found someone whom I care about.

761
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,110
It's funny, right?

762
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:33,790
What's funny about that?

763
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:37,620
It's the best thing I've heard lately!

764
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,440
"The best thing"?

765
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,140
But I shouldn't let myself.

766
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,150
You absolutely should.

767
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,750
Now is not the time.

768
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,400
I need to take care of Byeol. She just got better...

769
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,860
Hey, Yu Eun Ho, that sounds like an excuse.

770
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,390
You would never neglect Byeol.

771
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:00,500
What's wrong with liking someone?

772
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:05,700
It's okay to be honest about your feelings for once.

773
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,480
Would being honest about my feelings be a good thing for her?

774
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,190
You know my situation so...

775
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,470
I don't want to make things hard for her.

776
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:20,040
Don't lose her while you worry and regret it later.

777
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,200
Be brave.

778
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,700
I bet what she wants are your honest feelings, not your polite consideration.

779
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:46,360
 Hey, hey! 

780
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,390
Wow, this place was so good. 
    

781
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,510
- That was fun. 
 - Come.

782
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:54,370
Gosh, Deputy, you worked so hard.

783
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,360
It's better to totally forget it.

784
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:00,110
Go home tonight and rest without worrying.

785
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,120
- Thank you. 
 - What are you talking about?

786
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,960
Are you leaving already? On a day like this, we should do a second round.

787
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,590
I'll buy the second round, okay?

788
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,720
There is a quiet place nearby. Let's go!

789
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,740
A convenience store. Let's go!

790
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,800
Goodbye.

791
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,740
Gwang Hee. Deputy.

792
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,690
Manager. Deputy...

793
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,520
- Stop that. 
 - G-Gwang Hee...

794
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,880
What do you like, Gyeong Hwa?

795
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,220
Gyeong Hwa,

796
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:29,080
how come you have such bad timing?

797
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,430
I'm just slow.

798
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,440
Yes, that's how it seems.

799
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,340
You have never dated, right?

800
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,100
That's not true. I have!

801
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,090
Look, you have definitely never dated.

802
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:44,040
You repeated the same phrase. That means you haven't.

803
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,900
- N-No... 
 - A strong denial is a strong admission.

804
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,970
You're fast.

805
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,820
Why is my heart beating?

806
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,150
Do you hear that? Why?

807
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:15,140
I'll go ahead.

808
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,560
 ­  

809
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,780
 ­  

810
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,950
Thank you. 
    

811
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,110
Unnie!

812
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:02,780
Long time, no see. How have you been?

813
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,870
I missed you a lot, but Dad said you're busy.

814
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:08,810
Did he?

815
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,370
Where is Dad?

816
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:13,940
He's at work. I'm dropping by on my way to an appointment.

817
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:16,150
Is your dad picking you up here later?

818
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,980
Dad is watching a movie with Auntie Su Hyeon today near work.

819
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,070
Pardon?

820
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,850
I'll be at Seo Jun's house.

821
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,560
Hello, I'm Jeong Su Hyeon's son, Jeong Seo Jun!

822
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,450
- Hi. 
 - She said it's a date.

823
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:37,780
- My grandma said they're going on a date. 
 - What?

824
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:46,170
Seo Jun! Byeol!

825
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:48,670
Grandma!

826
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:52,040
- Did you have fun? 
 - Wait up!

827
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,830
Oh, right.

828
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,370
This.

829
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,310
See you next time!

830
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,460
Let's go.

831
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,090
Get your bag. Thanks, Uncle!

832
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:05,280
Goodbye. 
    

833
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,430
- Goodbye! 
 - Bye!

834
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:09,240
"A date"?

835
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:52,830
You're here.

836
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,140
You're still here?

837
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:59,130
I was organizing some papers.

838
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:01,730
It's not urgent. You can do it tomorrow.

839
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,380
I'll just finish this, and I'll go.

840
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:08,990
It's okay. You can go. I know you're busy.

841
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,710
I will finish up.

842
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,790
Sure then.

843
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,810
   

844
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,950
Yes, Ms. Jeong.

845
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,480
 Yes. 

846
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,010
 Okay, got it. 

847
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,800
 Okay. 

848
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:50,710
   

849
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:53,670
 Don't lose her while you worry and regret it later. 

850
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,330
 Be brave. 

851
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,620
 I bet what she wants are your honest feelings, 

852
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,150
 not your polite consideration. 

853
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:04,020
 I like you, Yu Eun Ho. 

854
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:13,410
♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

855
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:16,840
 Ms. Jeong, I'm sorry. 

856
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,560
 I don't think I can go to the movie with you. 

857
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,990
♫  This strange sensation  ♫

858
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:26,940
♫  Feels more like excitement than nerves  ♫

859
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,620
♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

860
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,800
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

861
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,280
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

862
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,800
 What kind of person do you think I am? 

863
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,190
 You take great care of candidates but never take care of yourself. 

864
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:48,340
 You should take care of yourself, not just the candidates, please. 

865
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,250
 I don't need to probe. 

866
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,330
 Sometimes, just asking can be hurtful. 

867
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:55,530
 You don't need to explain anything. 

868
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:58,010
 I trust only what I see. 

869
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:02,700
 You did well. I thought I'd give a proper compliment. 
   

870
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,390
 So what if you fall? You can always get up again. 

871
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:07,300
 I'll hold you up. 

872
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:12,380
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

873
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:17,850
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

874
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,640
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

875
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:28,850
   

876
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,180
   

877
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:35,290
♫  Once again, my heart  ♫

878
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:45,750
♫  Is walking toward where you are  ♫

879
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:55,010
♫  Feelings for you that I can’t hide  ♫

880
01:15:55,010 --> 01:16:03,100
♫  Unstoppable steps toward you  ♫

881
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,960
Yu Eun Ho.

882
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,880
That movie...

883
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,860
Don't go.

884
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,780
I'm watching.

885
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:06,010
I'm coming.

886
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,310
♫  I will protect you  ♫

887
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:15,910
♫  No matter what moment comes  ♫

888
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:19,860
♫  No matter what world  ♫

889
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:25,330
♫  I'm just by your side, I'll be there for you  ♫

890
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:29,400
♫  Through all times  ♫

891
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:38,300
♫  Your trace, your scent, tenderly engraved in my heart  ♫

892
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:43,800
♫  Things I can remember  ♫

893
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,700
♫  Because it was all a path to you  ♫

894
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:54,390
♫  Your frigid, cold days since passed  ♫

895
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:57,100
♫  I will embrace you  ♫

896
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:05,380
♫  Hold your hand; I'll never let you go  ♫

897
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,340
   

898
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:11,210
♫  I will protect you  ♫

899
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:15,960
♫  No matter what moment comes  ♫

900
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,830
♫  No matter what world  ♫

901
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:25,420
♫  I'm just by your side; I'll be there for you  ♫

902
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:29,410
♫  Through all times  ♫

903
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:34,080
♫  Now in a world without you  ♫

904
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,350
♫  I can't live and breathe  ♫

905
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:45,780
♫  Even if I lose all I have  ♫

906
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,420
♫  Even if it disappears  ♫

907
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:53,330
♫  I want to stay by your side  ♫

908
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:56,750
 You're fine to keep it a secret at work, right? Be strict at the office. 

909
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,200
 - Keep work and life separate. 
 - Should I close the blinds? 

910
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,590
 Just leave. 

911
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:02,320
 I think my dad has a crush on someone. 

912
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,910
 Dad keeps staring into the mirror. 

913
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,070
 - It's not me, right? 
 - That guy is such a fool. 

914
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,890
 He is missing out on someone amazing. 

915
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:10,800
 I have some terms before I agree to the position. 

916
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,360
 This won't be easy to negotiate. 

917
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,990
 I'm here to meet with CEO Kang Ji Yun. 

918
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:18,050
 - Tae Yun! 
 - I have something to ask CEO Kang. 

919
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:19,680
 Me? 

920
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:24,670
♫  Baby, know you more and more  ♫
