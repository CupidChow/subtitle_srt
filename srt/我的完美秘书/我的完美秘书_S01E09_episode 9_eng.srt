Drink.

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,660
I'm Yu Eun Ho, CEO Kang Ji Yun's assistant.

18
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm sorry. I didn't organize her schedule efficiently.

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,990
She has to go to her next meeting right now.

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,580
You're way too loyal.

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,690
You should know better than to intervene right now.

22
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,450
I'm sorry if I was rude,

23
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,460
but I learned that an assistant must first be loyal to the boss.

24
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,110
Let's go, Ms. CEO.

25
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,020
Please excuse me.

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,000
What an interesting fellow.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,340
So pointless.

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,970
Do you look down on me, too, Secretary Yu?

29
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,790
Why did you step in? Did you think I couldn't handle it myself?

30
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,760
You didn't need to be insulted like that.

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,740
I will refrain from scheduling events like that in the future.

32
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,400
I was right. You look down on me. It's not up to you, Secretary Yu,

33
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,900
whether I'm insulted, treated inappropriately, or choose to attend.

34
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,640
You must think it's ridiculous

35
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,630
that I want to defend Peoplez when treated like this.

36
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,340
I think I'm pathetic, too.

37
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,900
I'm sorry if I crossed the line.

38
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,800
But even if I went back in time, I would do the same thing.

39

- Thank you. 
 - Good day.

- Good morning... Hyungnim. 
 - Good day.

84
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:26,070
The CEO must be in a bad mood today. I'm getting the chills.

85
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,920
Secretary Yu looks glum, too.

86
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,960
Did a project fall apart?

87
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,820
No...

88
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,080
Anyway, let's all watch out today.

89
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,630
Yes.

90
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,640
They came in together?

91
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,200
A grin?

92
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,810
Oh my, look at them.

93
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,760
   

94
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,270
You're here. Why are you so happy?

95
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,260
Do you pick on me first thing in the morning?

96
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,280
Oh, right. Are you okay?

97
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,980
I heard of a mishap at the event yesterday.

98
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,050
Director Seo.

99
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm leaving. You two chat.

100
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm sorry about... yesterday.

101
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,030
No need for you to apologize, Director Woo. You didn't do anything wrong.

102
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,900
You know that's just who he is, right?

103
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,980
And what's that?

104
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,660
Don't trust my dad too much.

105
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,650
But also don't make him your enemy. Nothing good will come from that.

106
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,000
So just use him to an extent.

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,340
You still need my dad's money.

108
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,130
Let me ask you this one more time.

109
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,750
To Kang Ji Yun, is Yu Eun Ho still

110
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,050
just a secretary?

111
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,150
Director Woo... I'm dating Eun Ho.

112
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,100
Kang Ji Yun, you're ruthless.

113
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,090
All right.

114
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,590
I need to go.

115
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,440
Where are you going?

116
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,600
I'll go to work hard and avoid getting fired by CEO Kang.

117
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,970
Later.

118
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,740
 If she was no good, she would be gone long ago. 

119
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,910
 But I can't turn my back on her. 

120
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,910
 All she has to trust is her own brain. 

121
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,180
 Stay until the end. 

122
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,360
 This is my event. 

123
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,140
 I think you're smart enough to know your place, CEO Kang. 

124
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,380
Hello, Division Director.

125
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,010
Yes.

126
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,720
"Next"?

127
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,850
 Yes, Next, 

128
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,270
 a portal site that owns more than half of domestic market shares. 
   

129
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,250
 They were consistently their industry's best, 
   

130
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,910
 but were in a decline for three years, 

131
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,910
 unable to keep up with market trends. 

132
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,060
Controversy surrounded the CEO's poor leadership,

133
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,740
and he hired close people in executive positions.

134
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,620
In addition, the new business they invested in after he hired them

135
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,010
doesn't deliver profits, and the stock crashed.

136
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,620
So that led to the dismissal of the CEO.

137
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,160
Anonymous online business communities are speculating Next will go bankrupt.

138
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,460
This new CEO hire will be critical.

139
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,300
That's why they approached us and Career Way.

140
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,910
It's the first public bid competition in a while.

141
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,510
We absolutely cannot lose

142
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,400
if we're competing with Career Way.

143
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,270
We'd better focus.

144
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,270
Let's show them how Peoplez works.

145
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,820
   

146
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,700
I hear you represent the top two domestic search firms.

147
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,670
You are known as the best in the industry.

148
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,250
I expect to see the best candidates who live up to your reputation.

149
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,020
Is Next looking for anything specific?

150
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,230
I'm sure you two know the basic qualifications of a CEO better.

151
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,200
Just keep one thing in mind:

152
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,650
We need a talent who can powerfully dismiss

153
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,140
speculations about Next's downfall.

154
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,160
The new CEO's appointment will initiate much organizational change,

155
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,070
including many personnel changes.

156
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,170
We will sign the firm that brings us our new CEO

157
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,870
as Next's exclusive search firm.

158
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,810
That's how seriously we're taking this search.

159
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,810
I look forward to it.

160
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,230
   

161
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,660
It's good to see you.

162
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,830
If we see each other so often like this, we might become friends.

163
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,860
Let's go.

164
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,120
People might mistake you two for a couple.

165
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,880
Are they perhaps not mistaken?

166
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,240
How can you focus on work when you're busy with romance?

167
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,990
If I report this, Chairman Woo will turn his back on you.

168
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,320
You're so leisurely messing around with your assistant.

169
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,350
You're so relaxed.

170
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,560
- Don't cross the line. 
 - You don't cross the line.

171
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,400
How dare you act out in front of the Chairman?

172
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Your company would have quietly disappeared without the Chairman's investment capital.

173
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,210
What a taste you have in women. Do you even know how she is?

174
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,390
I know how she is:

175
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,000
stringent, stubborn, and relentless.

176
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,830
You don't want her as a competitor.

177
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:04,130
Is that why the other party keeps acting overconfidently?

178
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,770
CEO, I hope

179
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,680
you fight fairly this time.

180
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,460
Well then.

181
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,920
Let's go, Ms. CEO. You have a meeting.

182
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,820
Enjoy while you can.

183
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,680
You don't have much time left for this.

184
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,130
"Stringent."

185
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,600
"Stubborn."

186
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,580
"Relentless"?

187
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,880
You are relentless.

188
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,830
He's so cute.

189
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Chairman, Next approached Peoplez and Career Way for the CEO hire today.

190
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,230
That will be fun to watch.

191
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,450
 Watch what? 

192
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,790
What are you up to now?

193
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,700
How did he get in here? Do we let anyone in, like a flea market?

194
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,740
I'm sorry. I'll reprimand them.

195
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Does anyone in this building not know the Chairman's son?

196
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,190
There's no need to reprimand and torture innocent people

197
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,530
and stop torturing Kang Ji Yun.

198
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,940
Don't consider doing any harm to CEO Kang.

199
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,980
No, actually, don't do a thing.

200
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,740
You idiot.

201
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,200
Don't mess with Peoplez, either.

202
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,380
Now is not the time for you to heed such useless things.

203
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,640
Soon, your course of action will be determined.

204
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,870
Prepare yourself.

205
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,520
Why are you determining my "course of action," Father?

206
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,610
- I will do whatever I want. 
 - Don't delude yourself!

207
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,060
I didn't send you to CEO Kang for your sake.

208
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,900
Sending you was my investment.

209
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,960
The investment has failed; it's time to retract it.

210
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,000
Father!

211
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,670
I'm not a philanthropist.

212
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,380
If she won't become my daughter-in-law and is also incompetent,

213
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,600
it's time to discard her.

214
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,330
Don't force me to abandon my only remaining child.

215
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,940
I don't expect you to respect me as a father.

216
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,660
Just be quiet and follow me.

217
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,830
I will never turn out like my brother.

218
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,300
What a weakling.

219
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,470
 ­  

220
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,510
Director, what's wrong?

221
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,620
No, nothing's wrong.

222
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,090
Secretary Yu, have you dinner plans?

223
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,820
Nothing special.

224
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,600
Great.

225
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,990
Have dinner with me.

226
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,630
Do you like Kang Ji Yun?

227
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,940
I like her a lot.

228
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,360
You don't even hide it anymore.

229
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,890
You knew the answer before you asked me.

230
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,300
Right.

231
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,800
Then...

232
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,770
I'd like you to protect Kang Ji Yun.

233
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,690
It's funny I'm saying this.

234
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,420
My father is very scary. I guess you know since you saw it.

235
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,800
So I tried to protect Kang Ji Yun.

236
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,540
But what can I do?

237
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,250
Kang Ji Yun likes you, Secretary.

238
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,970
So...

239
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,030
I'm watching you.

240
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,520
Have another shot.

241
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,490
Thank you.

242
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:27,150
Secretary Yu. Let me ask one last favor.

243
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,720
Arm wrestle me.

244
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,580
That sounds good.

245
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,850
Your hand will hurt for a few days.

246
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,200
I'll finish you off without pain.

247
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,170
Start.

248
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,720
Everything is on me!

249
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,190
You're terrible at arm wrestling. This...

250
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,420
You're supposed to flip like this.

251
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,290
Look, look, your muscles are huge but weak.

252
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,700
You've got no strength.

253
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,930
- Thank you! 
  - Thank you! 

254
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,630
   

255
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,300
I won the arm wrestling match!

256
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,630
I win against anything!

257
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,340
 - Bon appetit. 
 - Thank you! 

258
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,790
Director.

259
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,790
Director?

260
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
Director.

261
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,530
Director.

262
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,750
- Yes. 
 - You can't sleep here.

263
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,750
I'm cold.

264
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,330
Where's your car, Director?

265
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,080
Director, I'll call a driver for you. Where do you live?

266
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,520
Home...

267
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,550
We're in trouble.

268
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,180
Director, we're here.

269
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,940
Writer! My friend!

270
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,650
My friend! My comrade!

271
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,940
Writer! Why are you here?

272
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,220
I-I live here.

273
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,840
Do you two know each other?

274
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,410
- This is top secret, but we're buddies. 
 - "Buddies"?

275
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,990
One-sided—

276
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:45,800
No, no! We just happen to know each other.

277
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,240
It's late. Let's go inside.

278
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,490
Let's hurry.

279
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,810
I bit my tongue...

280
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,680
Here? Here?

281
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,130
Hurry! Hurry!

282
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,020
Let's go.

283
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,080
Gosh, so...

284
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,930
How do you two know each other?

285
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,640
Forget it. That's not important.

286
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,960
Forget it, forget it. Forget it!

287
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,500
Secretary, go home now.

288
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,360
I'm going to keep drinking with my comrade.

289
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,650
- I'm going home. 
 - Bye.

290
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,450
I'm also going home.

291
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,800
Director, that's not it.

292
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,980
Why are you following me?

293
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,100
I can't believe I get to drink with you again! I'm so lucky!

294
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,400
- What's all this noise late at night? 
 - Mom...

295
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,370
- And who's this? 
 - Hello! I'm her friend. No, her comrade...

296
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,070
- Comrade... 
 - Oh, my gosh!

297
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,930
Excuse me!

298
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,510
Do you know him?

299
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,290
 Well, I do know him, but... 

300
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm crazy...

301
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,830
I'm sorry.

302
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,010
Are you just leaving?

303
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,040
You came in without permission, and you leave without permission?

304
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,010
I don't remember much.

305
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,170
How did I get here?

306
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,350
How can it taste like this?

307
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,300
I thought I was drinking the ocean.

308
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,970
The crunchy bean sprouts

309
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,390
and umami flavor of the pollack in deep, rich broth

310
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,990
formed a fantastic harmony.

311
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,120
That was the best hangover soup I've ever had.

312
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,460
I just put it together.

313
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,630
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

314
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,020
So how do you know Su Hyeon?

315
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,980
What do you do? How old are you?

316
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,040
What are your hobbies? What food do you like?

317
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,680
Mom.

318
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,370
You just met him. That's too many questions.

319
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,240
You're making him uncomfortable.

320
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,820
Not at all.

321
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,810
I'm not uncomfortable at all. I can answer everything.

322
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,960
Feel free to ask me anything you want.

323
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,640
Height, weight, ideal type, net worth...

324
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,170
To start, my height is—

325
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,370
He must be here. Just a moment.

326
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,800
He's here.

327
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,190
- Hello. 
 -  Hello. 

328
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,450
- What did you do yesterday? 
 - I watched TV.

329
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,130
- Really? 
 - Aigoo, they see each other every day, yet they love it.

330
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,250
- I know. 
 - "Every day"?

331
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,520
 I walk the children to school with him daily. Tomorrow too.  

332
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,630
 - When did you go to bed last night? 
 - Me? 

333
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,340
 I don't know how to read the clock. 

334
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,650
- Do you know how to read the clock? 
 - I don't know, either.

335
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,560
- What will you do at kindergarten? 
 - Me?

336
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,610
Coloring, of course.

337
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,270
Coloring is so fun.

338
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,000
Byeol.

339
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:15,260
So...  her one-sided crush is Secretary Yu.

340
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,010
That's it.

341
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,740
 What Next needs the most right now 

342
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,860
is a crisis management specialist with a clear solution.

343
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,610
Let's approach those with a legal or press background.

344
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,940
Pardon?

345
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,050
Not business management specialists?

346
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,400
Reversing the brand image is a top priority.

347
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,500
The new CEO's priority will be to quell the controversy the previous CEO caused.

348
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,830
They need someone who can deal well with the press.

349
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,030
Focusing on crisis management

350
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,650
candidates with legal backgrounds will be best.

351
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,880
Next has many legal battles.

352
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,370
A CEO with a legal background

353
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:02,160
will strengthen their risk management strategies and reassure stockholders.

354
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,760
Leadership skills are a prerequisite so let's seek

355
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,000
organization leaders with a legal or press background.

356
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,330
Many are watching this project. Stay sharp.

357
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,700
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

358
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,820
Gyeong Hwa, please make the candidate list.

359
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,200
Oh Gyeong Hwa.

360
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,770
CEO...

361
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,240
you just called me by the right name.

362
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,850
- Did I? 
 - Yes, you did.

363
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,620
Of course, as the CEO, I call my employees...

364
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,830
by the right name.

365
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,050
Meeting over.

366
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,580
Daebak. What in the world happened?

367
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,530
She called me by the right name the other day, too.

368
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,680
Me, too.

369
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,110
What? I thought none of you cared.

370
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,210
But you care a lot.

371
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,950
Don't you think our CEO has changed a bit lately?

372
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,420
She's slightly gentler and warmer.

373
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,000
Why did she change?

374
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,200
- What is it? What could it be? What is it? 
 - What...

375
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,210
Yes, hello. This is Yu Eun Ho.

376
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,490
I got a referral from the CEO of Gajin Real Estate.

377
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,250
I haven't been able to reach you.

378
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,570
Please return my call when you can. Thank you.

379
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,420
Secretary, three o'clock today, right?

380
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,560
What is it?

381
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,210
CEO Min Jeong Hyeok.

382
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,980
We heard he's coming to our office to meet with our CEO today.

383
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,720
Right?

384
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,230
Yes.

385
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,950
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - He's really coming! Oh, my gosh!

386
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,340
You know how handsome he is, right?

387
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,470
What a fuss.

388
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,240
Rumors travel fast.

389
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:08,580
CEO Min Jeong Hyeok runs a very successful interior design firm.

390
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,530
He makes the furniture himself.

391
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,730
Skills, looks, personality, he has it all.

392
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,700
Women go crazy over him.

393
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,040
Wait a minute.

394
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,770
I wonder if our CEO would be interested in him.

395
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,960
It would be the makings of a handsome couple. I feel it.

396
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,380
What's wrong, Hyungnim? Do I have something on my face?

397
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,380
Is it seaweed? Or am I just handsome?

398
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,180
Hyungnim!

399
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,090
Gwang Hee.

400
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,840
Gwang Hee, you have a tendency to be thoughtless.

401
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,910
I guess I was thoughtless to call myself handsome.

402
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,940
Hello.

403
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,730
- Yes. 
 - I'm Kang Ji Yun.

404
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,620
Yes.

405
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,500
I'm Min Jeong Hyeok, and I do interior design.

406
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,300
Please have a seat.

407
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,720
Let's get to the point since everyone's  busy.

408
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,820
That sounds good. I hear you're seeking a designer.

409
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,680
I need someone who can start work right away.

410
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,850
I have no time to train or wait for them to get used to the work,

411
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,030
and I don't have the energy for that.

412
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,340
What's wrong? Can't you find someone like that?

413
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:45,540
Of course, I have to. My job is to recommend the best candidate to my clients.

414
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,300
Just like your customers trust the furniture quality you make,

415
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,100
some clients wholeheartedly trust candidates I recommend.

416
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,090
You'll see why that is.

417
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,500
Do you have time for dinner?

418
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,980
Why don't you view my office

419
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,790
and discuss details over dinner?

420
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,220
What are my evening plans today?

421
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,390
- Secretary Yu? 
 - Yes.

422
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:20,220
Unfortunately, you have no special plans for tonight.

423
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,060
Then let's do that.

424
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,400
It sounds like the project will move fast.

425
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,060
Great, let's waste no time. Let's go.

426
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,600
Oh, no need for you to come, Secretary.

427
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,950
I'll drive her home safely.

428
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,740
No, I should take her.

429
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,540
Let's do that. We both don't need to go.

430
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,120
Leave work early.

431
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,960
Give me a moment.

432
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,790
I'll see you later.

433
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,620
My apologies, I used to climb.

434
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,180
Oh, well, I used to do judo.

435
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,850
Let's go.

436
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,690
Hyung, I'm almost done. Should I put it on top of the books?

437
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,150
Yes, put it where it goes.

438
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,070
   

439
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,020
   

440
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,690
   

441
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,180
What's with this? I can't get it out of my head.

442
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,690
I see.

443
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,070
I was right.

444
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,180
Right about what?

445
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,810
I can tell you're jealous.

446
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,900
I couldn't believe it.

447
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,190
Why would I be jealous?

448
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,790
Do you like CEO Kang that much?

449
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,050
It's not that.

450
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,380
How did you know?

451
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,360
- Know what? That you're dating CEO Kang. 
 - Yes.

452
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,000
I was wondering when you'd tell me.

453
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,300
Wow, I can't believe I'm witnessing Eun Ho being jealous.

454
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,940
I'm not jealous.

455
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,800
You must like CEO Kang a whole lot.

456
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,850
I said I'm not jealous.

457
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,490
So you're not.

458
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,340
Then I didn't have to come here.

459
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,780
I skipped dinner for you, Eun Ho,

460
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,550
but let me call him and say I'm coming.

461
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,380
No!

462
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,070
Have dinner with me.

463
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,260
I'm very jealous.

464
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,020
Eun Ho, you're such a go-getter.

465
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,190
Director, h-h-how long were you there?

466
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,010
From the moment you walked in here.

467
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,240
You were so jealous of someone;

468
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,710
you didn't even notice me and took it out on the books.

469
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,400
Kang Ji Yun, you lucky thing.

470
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,110
Should we go?

471
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,540
Yes, I'm starving.

472
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,480
Bye, Kang Seok.

473
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,810
- Bye. 
 - Bye, Unnie.

474
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,730
My Eun Ho is very powerful.

475
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:30,410
♫  When I see your heart, will you tell me?  ♫

476
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,190
Eun Ho, you're so cute when you're jealous.

477
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,930
Did it bother you that much?

478
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,010
I was so jealous and upset.

479
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,780
Those are the good days.

480
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,840
What? I thought you were against them because CEO Kang is better.

481
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,780
I was just...

482
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,380
Well, they like each other. What can we do?

483
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,720
They look so happy. That's all that matters.

484
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,480
- They appear happy, right? 
 - Yes.

485
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,570
They look blissful.

486
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,140
Gosh, that's it then.

487
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,460
 What should we eat? 

488
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,100
 Something cool? 

489
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,800
   

490
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,140
Your face is glowing. Business must be good.

491
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,600
What a showoff.

492
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,810
Thanks to you, we had great returns on our investment

493
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,670
and successfully selected search firms for Next.

494
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,230
What do you think? Are you happy after meeting them?

495
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,550
I'll need to see the candidates they put forth.

496
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,530
Do you want to back one over the other?

497
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,340
Go with whoever is better.

498
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,660
Didn't you need a search firm to hire a proper CEO?

499
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,570
I hear you enjoy tuna.

500
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:18,270
Would you like to try a sake pairing?

501
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,960
I'm okay.

502
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,160
I always get sick when I overeat my favorite foods.

503
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,540
Chairman Na, you're just how I remember.

504
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,350
Then you already know I'm straightforward.

505
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,380
Meeting privately before an important candidate recommendation

506
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,330
isn't my style.

507
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,260
Why did you want to see me?

508
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,900
I have researched your favorite foods and

509
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,170
your meticulous, upright personality, Chairman.

510
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,980
But there's one thing.

511
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,240
I haven't found a candidate who fits your preferences yet.

512
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,190
Here's a candidates list of the world's top three management consulting firms, 
    

513
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,290
listing management specialists.

514
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,270
   

515
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,140
Are you asking me to pick one from here?

516
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,380
You can also tell me if there's a candidate you want.

517
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,000
A stockholder's favorite CEO is great,

518
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,340
but the Board of Directors' favorite CEO is even better.

519
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:27,900
I don't work this way. I'm leaving.

520
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,070
I hear you're a long-time investment partner of CEO Woo's.

521
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,640
How do you think Director Lee Seok Jin

522
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,610
became National Investment Corporation's director?

523
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:43,470
Ask CEO Woo how he leverages me.

524
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,010
So are you interested in these candidates now?

525
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:08,100
Please select the candidate you like and gather votes of your fellow board members.

526
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:39,690
I had no idea it got this late. You should have gone home.

527
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,680
I've been working this whole time.

528
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,110
My boss is a workaholic so I can't stop working.

529
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,080
I don't know your boss. What a great boss.

530
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,550
- Yes, that's right. 
 - Yes.

531
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,070
Who could she be?

532
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:56,430
Did you pull the full candidate list? I found so many.

533
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,580
Should we clock out now?

534
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,200
I've already clocked out.

535
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,330
Good job today.

536
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,410
Eun Ho, you did a good job, too.

537
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,880
What should we do tomorrow?

538
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,350
Should we go on a date? It's the weekend.

539
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,330
I have plans tomorrow.

540
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,360
What?

541
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,620
Fine, I'll yield for Byeol.

542
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,130
It's not with Byeol.

543
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,960
I'll tell you after.

544
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,180
CEO Park Gi Hoon.

545
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,230
Hello.

546
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,600
Are you the child that Mr. Kang rescued during the Gajin fire?

547
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,350
Yes.

548
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,840
So his name is?

549
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,850
Mr. Kang Gyeong Tae. He was an elementary school teacher nearby.

550
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,110
Everyone admired his exemplary character,

551
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,300
and when he passed away so tragically,

552
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,490
people said, "How characteristic of him."

553
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,780
I just feel bad for the daughter left behind.

554
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,160
She became an orphan overnight.

555
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,900
He was all that his daughter had.

556
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,810
She went from one relative's home to another after his passing.

557
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,090
Well...

558
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,290
Have you heard anything else?

559
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,620
I heard she became a company CEO.

560
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,450
Sounds like she grew up fine.

561
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,870
Do you have her contact info or her company's name?

562
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,860
I'm not sure.

563
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,600
What was the name of the company? I heard it once.

564
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,470
Oh, they might know at Mr. Kang's former school.

565
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,300
Go there.

566
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,510
Yes. Thank you.

567
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,040
You're looking for Kang Gyeong Tae's daughter, right?

568
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,880
Yes, please. I heard his daughter attended this school.

569
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,050
We cannot share personal information.

570
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,940
Just a second.

571
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,130
   

572
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,000
- Yes, Sir. 
  - Eun Ho, 

573
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,410
 Mr. Kang's daughter's company. 

574
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,280
Yes. Did you remember?

575
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,450
 It's Peoplez. 

576
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,420
Excuse me?

577
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,040
 I can't share anything besides her name. 

578
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,230
 It's Kang Ji Yun. 

579
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,890
 Hi! 

580
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,220
 How did you know I was here? 

581
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,700
 Who else but you comes here at this hour? 

582
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,210
 Do you not think so? 

583
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,680
 This time... 

584
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,680
 Of course, this time... 

585
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,260
 Save me! 

586
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,400
 I'm here! 

587
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,940
 Save me! Help! 

588
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,170
 I'm here! 

589
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,900
 Help me! 

590
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,330
 Save me! 

591
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,540
 Please save me... 

592
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,570
 Help me. 

593
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,420
 Save me... 

594
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,100
 Hello! 

595
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,700
 Hey! Someone is here! 

596
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,550
 Hey! 

597
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,350
 Are you okay? 

598
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,620
 Don't give up! 

599
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,610
 - Save me. 
 - Hey! 

600
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,470
 - Give me your hand. 
 - Help me. 

601
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,470
 Hey, Boy, wake up!  

602
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,310
 Don't give up. 

603
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,720
 You will live. Got it? 

604
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,650
 Is anyone inside? 

605
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,930
 Over here! We are here! 

606
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,610
 There are survivors inside! Requesting a rescue crew! 

607
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,780
 Hand him over. We got him. 

608
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,700
 We are on the third floor. Support is needed! 

609
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,550
 Third floor... 

610
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,980
 Are you okay? Can you hear me? 

611
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,460
 When can we have more support on the third floor? We have a survivor. 

612
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,910
 Go down first. 

613
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,530
 Step away from the door! 

614
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,930
 Is someone still there? 

615
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,760
 Eun Ho. 

616
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,550
Eun Ho!

617
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,340
What were you pondering so deeply that you didn't see me here?

618
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,260
I'm sorry.

619
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,370
Is something wrong?

620
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:26,900
Your face looks pale. Why did you ask to see me privately?

621
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,640
I... have something to ask you.

622
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,100
Is this about Ji Yun?

623
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,850
Ji Yun's father...

624
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,700
Did Ji Yun overreact or something?

625
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,840
I hope you can understand, Eun Ho,

626
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,910
that is Ji Yun's trauma.

627
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:54,770
I heard he died during a fire while rescuing a young child.

628
00:49:54,770 --> 00:50:00,470
People would call him a hero, say he died a righteous death, and praise him.

629
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,380
Ji Yun said she hated hearing that.

630
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,960
After Ji Yun's mom died early,

631
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,200
she relied solely on her dad,

632
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,490
but she was left all alone in the world overnight.

633
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,420
It makes sense that she resents her dad.

634
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,130
Also, Ji Yun's relatives are obsessed with money.

635
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,630
They kept dumping her on other people,

636
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,270
but they try to take credit now that she is successful.

637
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,980
They come regularly to take money from her.

638
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,310
Gosh, I said too much, didn't I? Gosh.

639
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:39,250
I'm sorry. I'll stop. It's not a pleasant topic.

640
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:48,550
♫  I always trust you to answer to me  ♫

641
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,810
♫  Yesterday  ♫

642
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,040
 Whenever I dream, I see my late father. 

643
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,910
 You must miss him a lot. 

644
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:59,350
 Not really. I don't really miss him that much. 

645
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:02,980
 He wasn't a good dad to me. 

646
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:08,010
 At least you're always there when Byeol calls for you. 

647
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:14,440
 I'm sure Byeol knows how hard you try. 

648
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,880
 So... just keep being 

649
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,020
 by your daughter's side, like now. 

650
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:28,420
♫  Just trust me whenever; just trust me whenever  ♫

651
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,520
   

652
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,540
Yes, Ji Yun.

653
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,350
 Daddy! 

654
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,800
Hi. Are you with Unnie?

655
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,980
 Daddy, guess where I am? 

656
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,550
 Were you not at Uncle's bookstore? 

657
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,300
Byeol is on a date with me. Come join us.

658
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,630
What if your dad is upset we came out by ourselves?

659
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,490
Gosh, my daddy doesn't get upset about stuff like that.

660
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,720
What does he get upset about then?

661
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,450
It sounds like your dad doesn't get angry at you.

662
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,310
What an amazing dad.

663
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,820
But my daddy does have weaknesses.

664
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,250
"Weaknesses"? What are they?

665
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,880
My daddy is scared of many things.

666
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,250
Really?

667
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:35,200
Yes. He's scared of bugs and blowing balloons.

668
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,840
"Balloons"?

669
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,850
What else?

670
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,780
He is scared on amusement park rides.

671
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,070
He will ride only the merry-go-round with me.

672
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,450
I heard your dad was part of a rescue club.

673
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,280
That is different, he says.

674
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,990
He says a spinning ride is scarier than climbing a mountain.

675
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,290
- So cute. 
 - What?

676
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,950
Your dad is funny, Byeol.

677
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:05,540
- Right? My daddy is funny. 
 - Yes.

678
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:10,050
Cute.

679
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,260
 Daddy! 

680
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,170
Oh, Byeol.

681
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,160
What happened?

682
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,240
We ran into each other at the bookstore.

683
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,730
They have a new mint chocolate chip item. It was so good, right?

684
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,890
Wow, so many pretty things!

685
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,600
- There are. 
 - This is so pretty!

686
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,270
It's so pretty, Byeol. Let's try it on.

687
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,800
Let's see.

688
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,390
Adorable! Look.

689
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,180
It's so pretty, right?

690
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,060
You, too, Unnie.

691
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,630
Me, too?

692
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,990
What do you think?

693
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,640
Do I look okay?

694
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,240
Daddy, too.

695
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,960
Daddy, you, too!

696
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,640
Okay. Shall I? Go ahead, Byeol.

697
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,750
- What do you think? 
 - Cute.

698
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,010
Let's take a photo of us three.

699
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,290
Say cheese.

700
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,610
One, two, three!

701
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,400
She is sound asleep.

702
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:44,100
♫  While baby sloth was climbing a tree, aigoo! Fell down  ♫

703
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,690
Drive slowly so Byeol doesn't wake up.

704
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,580
I'm driving safely at 50 kmh (31 mph).

705
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,640
Also, not even an earthquake can wake her.

706
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:07,970
- Are you not feeling well? 
 - What?

707
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:11,460
No. Do I seem that way?

708
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,930
You just seem different than usual.

709
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,030
Are you not tired, Ji Yun?

710
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,810
I think I'm good with children. I'm not tired at all.

711
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,770
I love chatting with Byeol.

712
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,010
I hear you're secretly scared of many things.

713
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,440
Byeol said that?

714
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,790
It wasn't just 1-2 things.

715
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:41,810
Why are you scared of blowing balloons?

716
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,210
I'm not scared of that. Why would I fear that?

717
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,600
Gosh, she said you're scared of it.

718
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:51,250
It seems Byeol had fun badmouthing her dad.

719
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:55,570
Byeol likes you a lot, Eun Ho.

720
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,720
She's so proud of you.

721
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,760
I'm jealous

722
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,970
that Byeol has a dad like Yu Eun Ho.

723
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,150
 Hello! 

724
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,360
 Hello. 

725
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:42,850
 CEO Kang! 

726
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,380
Is something going on with Eun Ho?

727
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,170
I got a text saying he's not coming in.

728
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,770
- He isn't coming in? 
 - Didn't you know?

729
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,600
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

730
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:15,620
 Is something wrong? Call me when you see this. 

731
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,360
Is something going on?

732
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:16,210
   

733
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,290
   

734
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,700
Thank you for saving me.

735
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,910
Thanks to you, I didn't give up.

736
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,630
And now,

737
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,710
about Ji Yun...

738
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,540
 I want to protect Ji Yun now. 

739
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,800
 Will that be okay? 

740
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,620
Hello?

741
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,190
I'm sorry I couldn't call.

742
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:03,230
Everything is okay, right?

743
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,550
Where are you?

744
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,510
 I'm home. 

745
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,720
I miss you.

746
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,520
Come quickly.

747
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,940
You're here.

748
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,630
Come in!

749
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:10,560
What happened? I couldn't contact you all day.

750
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,520
What were you up to?

751
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,720
What is this?

752
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,600
I can't even get angry at you if you do this.

753
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:38,280
I'm sorry, Ji Yun,

754
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,820
for making you live all by yourself feeling lonely.

755
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,710
Why are you sorry about that, Eun Ho?

756
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,350
Something is off today.

757
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:04,020
Did something happen?

758
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,870
Today...

759
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,020
I paid my respects to your father, Ji Yun.

760
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,360
What do you mean by that?

761
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,170
There is something...

762
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,660
I must tell you, Ji Yun.

763
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,720
The child that...

764
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,710
your father saved...

765
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,300
that was me.

766
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:29,230
   

767
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,570
   

768
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:55,100


769
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:06,290
 How am I supposed to be at ease with you anymore? 

770
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,030
 Did you two fight? Did something happen? 

771
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,260
 You're sure this time? 

772
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,950
 I confirmed it with a current Peoplez employee. 

773
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,520
 If I'm taking it from her, 

774
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,680
 I might as well leave nothing behind. 

775
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,260
 Did something happen to Seo Jun? 

776
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:22,060
 Unnie, I'm doing a good job, right? 

777
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,030
 It's okay. 

778
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:26,640
 I'm here, Dad. It took so long... 

779
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,200
 for me to get here. 

780
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,800
 Thank you, Eun Ho, for turning out to be such a great person.
