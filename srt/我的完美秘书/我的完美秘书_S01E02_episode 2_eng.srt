00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,340
    
 ♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,350
♫  I don't know why I'm being like this  ♫

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,180
    
 ♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,110
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,610
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,110
♫  Though it might be sudden  ♫

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,910
   

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,060
♫  So just test me, I'll tell you  ♫

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,920
♫  My sincere feelings for you  ♫

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,380
♫  Yes, whenever it is, just tell me  ♫

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,690
♫  Whatever it is, I can do it  ♫

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,110
    
 ♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,540
   

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,070
   

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,560
Byeol, I think you can stop coming now.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,570
- Really? 
 - Of course!

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,100
Byeol, you did such a good job.

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,110
Can you play with the nurse for a bit?

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,210
Byeol, come with me.

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,780
So...

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,780
she's really okay, right?

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,990
Yes.

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,130
There is no full recovery from this.

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,900
But she is currently very healthy.

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,430
I think we can stop the therapy for now.

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,930
And...

27
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,120
this is a gift for you.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,140
   

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,870
Thank you for focusing on Byeol for a whole year.

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:50,020


31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,000
   

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,370
   

33
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,030
 Dad, hurry! 

34
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,190
Uncle Kang Seok!

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,660
I haven't seen you in a while, Byeol! Did you have therapy today?

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,580
I don't need to see a doctor anymore!

37
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,240
Really?

38
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,300
Then I must treat you.

39
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,280
Byeol, choose all the books you want to read. It's my treat.

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,210
Really?

41
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,400
Good job. You worked so hard.

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,750
Now, you need to take care of work. Are you looking?

43
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,600
Sure—

44
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,290
- Aigoo... 
 - It's okay, it's okay.

45
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,800
Byeol, are you all right?

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,460
You're so ambitious! Whom do you seem like?

47
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,890
All right, take all of these.

48
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,740
Uncle, let's have a party at our house.

49
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,520
Shall we?

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,640
 ­  

51
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,910
They divorced before Byeol turned one?

52
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,380
Has he raised her alone since then?

53
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,430
Yes.

54
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,160
He's been through so much.

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,700
He works very hard and is talented too.

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,280
That's why I asked CEO Kang to come. I wanted to introduce them.

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,710
It's too bad I can't give him good news.

58
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,240
Why? Is no position available?

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,110
Can you do anything about it?

60
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,410
We have nothing open in HR.

61
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,200
He was dismissed for disciplinary reasons.

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,250
That chief manager is giving him bad references.

63
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,930
Has it that much impact?

64
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,030
Yes.

65
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,610
A supervisor's feedback is very powerful.

66
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,390
If his ex-boss gives a bad reference, you'd hesitate to hire him.

67
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,680
Make it happen somehow. I vouch for him.

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,990
You're always like this about your hoobae (junior)...

69
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,070
from college, right?

70
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,470
Yes.

71
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,520
Is everything okay?

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,110
 It's at the end over there. 
   

73
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,820
Really? Wow, look at the cherry blossoms!

74
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,490
Here we are.

75
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,670
Oh, what?

76
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,520
What is this? It's so thoughtful. See this! 
    

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,620
Should I take one?

78
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,970
Of course, Mr. Delivery Guy.

79
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,800
See the cherry blossoms. They're so pretty.

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,400
They're in full bloom.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,990
- You're here. 
 - Hello.

82
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,580
- Come in. 
 - Yes.

83
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,570
I finally get to meet you. I've been wanting to.

84
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,070
I know! Kang Seok praises you.

85
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,570
- Aigoo! 
 - Hello.

86
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,340
- Hello. 
 - Hey, Byeol.

87
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,700
This is for you.

88
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,110
Thank you.

89
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,850
Your place is so nice and lovely.

90
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,810
Wow!

91
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,190
You said not to bring anything. What's all this?

92
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,960
We always eat like this, you know.

93
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,940
Really? Right, right.

94
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,510
- Make yourself comfortable. 
 - Thank you!

95
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,400
Wow, you did so much work!

96
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,830
Not at all.

97
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,680
This is amazing. What's all this?

98
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,190
One second.

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,470
Oh, yes, please save me. Are any good assistants available?

100
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,190
Here's the soybean stew.

101
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,390
The person must understand our field.

102
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,640
HR experience would be ideal.

103
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,430
Someone organized and clean...

104
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,540
 ­  

105
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,860
Someone good at time management...

106
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,260
 ­  

107
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,400
Thoughtful with a good memory would be perfect.

108
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,210
Most importantly,

109
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,770
someone who can take care of CEO Kang when she gets into trouble.

110
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:30,460
An HR person like that is hard to find, right?

111
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,520
I have to go.

112
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,140
   

113
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,850
   

114
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,610
   

115
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,900
I found him.

116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,590
A secretary?

117
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,930
Yes.

118
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,840
Good morning, CEO.

119
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,700
One second, please.

120
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,240
What is this? What happened? Why is he here?

121
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,780
I told you. He's your new secretary.

122
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,080
Why? How is he my secretary?

123
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,410
Hey! He has all the qualifications we're seeking.

124
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,140
Do you know who he is?

125
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,240
 Former HR Manager of Hansu Electronics: 

126
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,670
HR knowledge, good organizational skills, and

127
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,300
expertise in caring for a clumsy person.

128
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,460
Kang Seok can vouch for his character.

129
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,280
Okay, do you want to know anything else?

130
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,110
- Are you introducing a product? 
 - He's perfect as Kang Ji Yun's secretary.

131
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,420
He's even overqualified.

132
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,690
Why are you being so extreme?

133
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,650
I'm a search firm accountant for five years.

134
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,360
I can do this in my sleep.

135
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,300
I'm the best at finding talent.

136
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
So trust my judgment. Just trust me, okay?

137
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,640
No.

138
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,500
Why not? Wh-Why don't you want to?

139
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,050
Yu Eun Ho is that guy.

140
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,660
Yes, that's Eun Ho.

141
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,640
The guy who ruined things for me

142
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,000
with Team Leader Yang Ho Jin!

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,640
Wow, he's a real talent then!

144
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,310
   

145
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,560
 So the CEO you were talking about... 

146
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,130
 is Kang Ji Yun from Peoplez? 

147
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,280
 I see CEO Kang's quirks are well known. 

148
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,950
 But... 

149
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,030
 Ji Yun isn't as bad as the rumors. 

150
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,650
 She's difficult, of course. She is... 

151
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,790
 but it'll help your career. 

152
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,380
 After facing many different situations working for her, 

153
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,210
 you'll have wider experience in human resources. 

154
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,720
 You'll experience new things than working internally. 

155
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,010
 Six months. 

156
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,250
 P-Please just help us for six months. 

157
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,570
 After that, I guarantee you a transfer to where you want. 

158
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,930
 Build your résumé here then go to a better job! 

159
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,250
 Come on, how can you promise that? 

160
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,380
 Byeol. 

161
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,110
 I can promise you time with your child. 

162
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,560
 Byeol, you like spending time with your dad, right? 

163
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,800
 Yes. 

164
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,300
 Coming home early is great, but... 

165
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,410
 I would love if he bought me lots of those. 

166
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,150
 What? 

167
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,330
 - Is that possible? 
 - Byeol, that's— 

168
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,000
 The salary is 50% more! 

169
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,920
 "It's 50%"? 

170
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,020
 I can... do that. 

171
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,470
 Dad, I approve. 

172
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,600
There was a misunderstanding.

173
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,060
Let's say you didn't get hired.

174
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,220
 What happened last time... 

175
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,640
I mean, I'm sorry for what happened that day.

176
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,220
Team Leader Yang explained it to me.

177
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,410
I'll do my best. I anticipate working with you.

178
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,540
So you'll really be my secretary, Yu Eun Ho?

179
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,880
Yes.

180
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,370
You know what our company does, right?

181
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,530
We "steal key talent and make chaos."

182
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,470
Is that okay?

183
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,490
Oh, right.

184
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,350
We don't have a "conscience" here, do we?

185
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,420
That day, I—

186
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,330
It's dead.

187
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,120
Excuse me.

188
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,040
Are you looking for...

189
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,870
See what she's like? Why is she so stubborn?

190
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,150
Eun Ho, are you all right?

191
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,920
- Did I just get fired? 
 - Never!

192
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,680
I know CEO Kang well.

193
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,460
Don't worry. It's all about your willingness, Eun Ho.

194
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,610
- I mean— 
 - All I have is you. Can you do it?

195
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,600
You must.

196
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,420
Terms are as agreed, right?

197
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,270
I swear on Kang Seok.

198
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,050
I swear on Byeol.

199
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,800
Okay, deal.

200
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,090
Deal.

201
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,230
Attention, everyone!

202
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,040
Say hello to our new member who'll work with us:

203
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,750
Executive Secretary, Yu Eun Ho.

204
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,020
He will assist CEO Kang.

205
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,930
I had great difficulty to find him

206
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,790
so please help him. A big welcome!

207
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,780
Finally, we found one.

208
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,810
Thank you for giving me such a warm welcome.

209
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,810
I'm Yu Eun Ho. It's nice to meet you.

210
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,300
Gwang Hee, what kind of new trend is this?

211
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,330
You know, analog is popular now, Director.

212
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,230
It was really hard to find this camera. But wait!

213
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,770
 Our new colleague's looks are a work of art! Is he real? 

214
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,510
 The camera just follows you. 

215
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,580
 It's not me. It's the camera. 

216
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,630
Director, let's film you introducing people naturally. Okay, cue!

217
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,340
 This is Manager Kim Yeong Soo, our consultant. 
   

218
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,550
 "To live, be ready to die; to die, be ready to live." 

219
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,290
 Here's my business card. 

220
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,190
 Wow, why did someone so incredible 

221
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,980
decide to work for our CEO? It's so great!

222
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,860
I am so glad you did.

223
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,320
Please work with us for a long, long time. Here.

224
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,280
I'll do my best.

225
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,290
Take a coffee sachet.

226
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,670
Thank you. 
    

227
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,580
It's the little things, you know?

228
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,870
 You don't know? He doesn't know. 

229
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,590
 Manager, you learned something new. What is it this time? 

230
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,000
 Little things you "seize" (sounds like "steal"). 

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,350
 Not little things that make you happy, the little things you "seize." 

232
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,490
I made Gyeong Hwa laugh! Wow! That one was great.

233
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,970
That one was funny. 
    

234
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,530
 - Gyeong Hwa. 
 - So funny. 

235
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,150
 Just get used to it. That's enough. 
   

236
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,050
 This is our consultant, Deputy Na Gyu Rim. 

237
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,990
Welcome to our company.

238
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,920
 Our CEO is awesome.
   

239
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,760
 Consultant Oh Gyeong Hwa. 

240
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,140
 She's my role model. 

241
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,890
 - I look forward to working with you. 
 - Me, too! 

242
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,360
This will help you.

243
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,210
Fighting!

244
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,200
   

245
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,790
- And this is— 
 - Director, stop. Stop.

246
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,590
I'll do it.

247
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,400
I will do my own introduction.

248
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,820
- I'm Consultant Lee Gwang Hee. 
 - It's nice to meet you.

249
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,400
I just wanted to tell you one more thing.

250
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,670
I must be careful, and I know I'm overstepping, but...

251
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,940
run away right now.

252
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,240
- "Run"? 
 - Yes, run.

253
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,870
Oh, gosh! Gosh!

254
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,860
This... Where did you get this? It's really rare!

255
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,700
I felt it when you walked in, Secretary.

256
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,020
You really know fashion.

257
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,240
Well...

258
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,900
may I call you "hyungnim"?

259
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,270
- I want to do that. 
 -  Hello! Ciao! Hi! Aloha! 

260
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,390
Ciao! Hi! Aloha!

261
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,570
He's always like that.

262
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,520
Come over here!

263
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,420
Say hello.

264
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,780
Are you all right?

265
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,550
Who...

266
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,440
A new face...

267
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,220
CEO Kang's new secretary, Yu Eun Ho.

268
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,460
You seem trustworthy. I trust you with CEO Kang.

269
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,470
You're in!

270
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,730
Let's get to work now.

271
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,250
Let's work!

272
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,010
Sorry to make you come here.

273
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,530
We're doing HR training so I'm here more than headquarters.

274
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,560
I was so glad to hear from you.

275
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,760
Someone I recommended is acknowledged at her new workplace

276
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,600
and even wants to be our client.

277
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,730
I'm grateful to you.

278
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,200
Thanks to you, I moved somewhere better, and now we're working together.

279
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,840
Thank you for the opportunity.

280
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,930
What role do you want filled?

281
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:41,570
For a while, our chairman has wanted to do a project.

282
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,890
   

283
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,410
 He's envisioning a skyscraper, 

284
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,210
 a landmark that can represent Korea to the world. 
   

285
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,100
 He's had this dream for 30 years since his Selim Confectionery days. 

286
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,770
 He's finally able to make his dream come true. 

287
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,530
I saw the interview.

288
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,080
Did the permit come through?

289
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,340
Yes, Selim Group will build Asia's tallest building.

290
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,000
Please find a principal architect who can direct the entire project, CEO Kang.

291
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,040
The project will be unrivaled in completion time and budget.

292
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,940
If you can find the right person, we will also ask Peoplez to fill the entire team.

293
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,500
Can you do it?

294
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,970
I'll make it happen. That's why you hired me.

295
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,340
Yes, don't just rely on the database. Look outside too.

296
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,590
Select famous landmarks and identify companies involved in the construction.

297
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,590
From design and execution to maintenance, find how they did it.

298
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,530
Yes. They entrusted us with this; let's do it right.

299
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,060
Yes, bye.

300
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,760
You must have some good news.

301
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,290
I know we're unhappy to see each other so let's skip niceties.

302
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,280
I guess I can't wear these shoes anymore.

303
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,320
What did those shoes do to you?

304
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,760
You're losing candidates these days. Save your cash.

305
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,190
Is that what happened? Are you cash-poor?

306
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,440
I wondered why you pushed candidates to switch jobs without considering their careers.

307
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,740
Was tampering with fees not good enough for you?

308
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,260
That's why you're not top-rank, CEO Kang.

309
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,900
It's high risk, high reward.

310
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,560
How long will you limit developers to work domestically?

311
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,880
Let's work globally.

312
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,310
Are you happy to be top-rank that way?

313
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,710
Your working style, Sunbae,

314
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,500
makes people treat us like we're cheap brokers.

315
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,790
Be more discerning about what you take on. Have some class.

316
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,780
You don't "take on" work. You make it happen.

317
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,720
I thought I taught you better than that. I see I've raised you wrong.

318
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,390
"Raised" me?

319
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,260
No one raised me. I raised myself.

320
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,600
Children always think they grew up by themselves.

321
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,490
How arrogant.

322
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,230
Do you sleep well?

323
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,280
I pray for you every night... for your ruin.

324
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,870
When ruined, I'll find a job for you.

325
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,220
This is your problem, Sunbae.

326
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,490
You are always greedy for the impossible,

327
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,450
like before.

328
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,490
You have to be greedy to get it.

329
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,730
Good luck chasing me.

330
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,340
I like them. They're very elegant.

331
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,600
Ma'am, the shoes you were wearing earlier...

332
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,720
Throw them out.

333
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,900
Got it.

334
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,760
 We were a step behind. 

335
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,700
 They should work with the best, not just someone they know. 

336
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,170
Keep following CEO Kang's movements.

337
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,100
Yes, CEO.

338
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,280
I just wanted to follow up...

339
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,660
Depending on the recipient's method...

340
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,160
that'll change the story...

341
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,700
Yes.

342
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,650
The result wasn't as low as I expected.

343
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,070
 Hello, CEO! 

344
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,790
CEO.

345
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,790
Didn't you see Secretary Yu? You should say hello!

346
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,990
Who? Was someone there?

347
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,950
Secretary Yu. This is his first day.

348
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,380
Secretary Yu?

349
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,670
What? What are you...

350
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,710
You don't recall? Really?

351
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,830
D-Do you recognize me? What's my name?

352
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,610
What's my name? Tell me. Don't you remember?

353
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,630
Stay still for a second. I'm thinking.

354
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,350
- The CEO... 
 - The C-CEO? CEO?

355
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,150
Director Seo Mi Ae had Yu Eun Ho come despite the CEO's no. The audacity!

356
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,420
Hey! I thought your symptoms got worse.

357
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,830
I plan on it. I'm even more stressed since you won't listen.

358
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,060
So you'll keep ignoring him?

359
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,510
You did whatever you wanted. I'll do what I want.

360
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,300
Don't you need to work?

361
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,040
I do.

362
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,950
Eun Ho!

363
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,880
Do you have something to tell me?

364
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,940
Eun Ho, listen carefully.

365
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,380
Here.

366
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,580
 You must master CEO Kang's client companies and list of key candidates. 

367
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,240
 CEO Kang hates slow, uninformed, frustrating workers. 

368
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,630
 No matter when or where she requests info, 

369
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,420
 be able to answer immediately. Okay. 

370
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,070
 She hates a meeting place too far 

371
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,140
 and she'd rather die than be late for an appointment. Don't forget. 

372
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,440
 Have her schedule and news articles ready as soon as she arrives. 

373
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,820
The 10 a.m. weekly meeting.

374
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,290
At 1 p.m. the twenty-fifth, meet Nam Dong Yoon...

375
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,680
CEO Lee Soon Il...

376
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,290
CEO Yoo Jae Pyo, CEO Kim Jun Gyeol...

377
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,770
   

378
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,980
   

379
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,000
   

380
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,870
   

381
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,700
Aigoo.

382
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,110
All documents must be stapled at a 45° angle.

383
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,540
I know it's weird. But staple it at a 45° angle,

384
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,600
45° to be exact. There!

385
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,750
Here. 
  ­  

386
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,810
Fighting.

387
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,060
   

388
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,710
 Coffee must come from the third street from this block: 

389
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,380
 the fourth cart, right temperature, 

390
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,570
 not too hot nor cold. 
   

391
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,500
I'm sorry.

392
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,250
Here's your coffee.

393
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,130
 When CEO Kang moves, 

394
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,860
 pay attention to all directions. Got it? 

395
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,360
CEO.

396
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,210
Your handbag...

397
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,990
Yes. Yes, CEO.

398
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,940
I'll be there right away. Okay.

399
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,730
   

400
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,930
Hello.

401
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,020
Put it there.

402
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,560
He won't take it.

403
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,610
Don't do it. No need for anything extravagant.

404
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,600
No, no.

405
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,140
I organized it by the candidates' current company

406
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,160
 so you can just enter the data here... 

407
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,350
Wow! Amazing!

408
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,890
 I used this a lot in the HR team. 

409
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,570
How did you manage this?

410
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:18,150
Oh, generally, people apply to MBA programs...

411
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,170
 or get transferred to internship positions at companies abroad. 

412
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,950
 And most importantly, smiling... 

413
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,320
 Don't do it. She hates smilers. 

414
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,940
 Dad! 

415
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,960
You're working so hard.

416
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,760
   

417
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,960
You're the author. You shouldn't do this here.

418
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
What? You scared me!

419
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,480
Have some pride. This is so embarrassing.

420
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,050
You shouldn't be doing this yourself.

421
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,320
Wow! Picture books!

422
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,260
Are you looking for a picture book?

423
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,280
This is "Rainbow Bingsu" by the most popular author, Jeong Su Hyeon.

424
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,300
- Take it to your dad and ask him to read it to you. 
 - Yes.

425
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,080
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

426
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,400
- Bye! 
 -  Dad! 

427
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,370
Let's go.

428
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,100
If you do that, be obvious. Why hide?

429
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,370
Do you know how sad a writer feels who can't sell her books?

430
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,250
Other people get the front display when they publish a new one. 
    

431
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,830
What kind of picture is that? Your book is much better.

432
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,950
Thanks. I feel better now.

433
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,820
Do you know? Byeol only looks at your books, Ms. Jeong.

434
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,180
- So let's work hard and get on the bestseller list. 
 - Okay...

435
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,500
Byeol wanted this one.

436
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,620
- "This one"? 
 - Yes.

437
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,400
Byeol said that?

438
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,020
She's so honest. Whom is she like?

439
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,410
Your new workplace must be nice.

440
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,240
You leave work early with time to stop by the bookstore.

441
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,010
Yes, it's good. Everyone is nice except the CEO.

442
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,330
What?

443
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,200
- Are you her secretary? 
 - Yes.

444
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,940
I know.

445
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,010
   

446
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,360
Fighting!

447
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,370
 Director Seo. 

448
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,190
 Director Seo! 
   

449
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,750
 Director Seo! 

450
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,530
 Director Seo! 

451
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,470
 Director Seo Mi Ae! 

452
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,660
If you need something, you can tell me—

453
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,670
Finally? I thought something was wrong with your ears.

454
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:46,440
I know. What exactly do you need from me now?

455
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,080
I confirmed a final meeting between

456
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,210
Director Im Seung Jae from Focus Build and Selim Group.

457
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,620
- Really? 
 - We just need the offer and negotiation.

458
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,080
So find contracts and materials we can reference.

459
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,120
And confirm the final meeting time.

460
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,240
Oh, right. Can you get me a perfect temperature coffee?

461
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I can go—

462
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,600
Just wait. Just wait one second...

463
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:12,070
 Hey! Kang Ji Yun, will you really do this? Stop being so stubborn! 

464
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,530
I picked him for you, for your health!

465
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,210
How long will you be like this? Why the heck do you dislike Eun Ho?

466
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,430
Everyone else loves him!

467
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,240
I don't like him.

468
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,670
He's here as my secretary. I should like him. But I say I don't like him.

469
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,220
Look, everyone else says "Yes," but you're the only one saying "No."

470
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,270
- Don't you think you're the strange one? 
 - No.

471
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,490
I've always walked a different path from others.

472
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,100
Now on, Secretary Yu assists you, not me.

473
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,220
If you need help, ask him.

474
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,140
If you don't want to, do it yourself.

475
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,290
That'll be nice and stressful for you.

476
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,320
Then your brain will overload again, you'll faint, and be in hospital.

477
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,110
Try it again. It'll be such fun.

478
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,100
 ­  

479
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,180
 ­  

480
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,130
Y-You are still here?

481
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,140
What's going on?

482
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,470
Here are average salaries and contract terms of Selim Group's

483
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,300
C-Level employees in the past two years.

484
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,670
I thought you'd be looking for it.

485
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,890
   

486
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,990
   

487
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,390
Let me know if you need anything else. I'll find it.

488
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,100
Yu Eun Ho.

489
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,420
Let's talk.

490
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,330
   

491
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,230
Let's stop wasting time.

492
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,500
You persist; I ignore you... It's exhausting.

493
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,180
I hate to spend energy on useless things like this.

494
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,820
What don't you like about me? If I can assist you better,

495
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,980
or if I made a work mistake, let me know. If not—

496
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,000
I want to work with someone who respects my job.

497
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,300
What do you think a headhunter is, Yu Eun Ho?

498
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,660
 Is this how headhunters operate? Have you any conscience? 

499
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,920
 You make money switching people's jobs? 

500
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,190
 Look here, Yu Eun Ho. 

501
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,110
I've said what I need to say. You can go now.

502
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:48,490
I'll toss out my presumptions and start over. Please teach me.

503
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,570
I have nowhere else to go but here.

504
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,410
I'm so sorry for that day's incident. CEO...

505
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,060
I have extensive, lengthy HR experience.

506
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,420
I can do anything you ask of me.

507
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,040
So please judge me as only your secretary.

508
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,000
   

509
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,720
   

510
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,100
   

511
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,940
   

512
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,900
   

513
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,140
   

514
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,240
   

515
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,690
   
   

516
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,550
   

517
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,780
   

518
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,330
   

519
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,290
Good morning, Ms. CEO.

520
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,100
   

521
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,810
Hello!

522
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,210
Please be careful.

523
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,370
Over there?

524
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,450
   

525
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,980
♫  How are you feeling?  ♫

526
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,000
♫  How are you feeling?  ♫

527
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,340
Here's the document.

528
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:30,760
♫  Wonder if you are the only one I've waited for  ♫

529
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:37,550
♫  Giving in to this feeling, guide me closer  ♫

530
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:43,480
♫  Yes, I'll dive in deep into your heart  ♫

531
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,520
♫  Babe, living inside of my heart  ♫

532
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,850
♫  I know you mean it's all right  ♫

533
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:59,300
♫  I heard your heart beating loud  ♫

534
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,460
I'm leaving right now. It won't take long.

535
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,980
The same place. Okay.

536
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:12,700
♫  Yes, I got to say, I can't control my heart  ♫

537
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,780
♫  How you feeling?  ♫

538
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,410
♫  How you feeling?  ♫

539
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,220
Hi, Mom. I'm almost there. What about the children?

540
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,780
 They're at the playground. 

541
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,590
 Byeol's dad arrived early from work. The children took him. 

542
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,080
They must be so excited.

543
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,130
We will go home together. Bye.

544
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,780
 Ready? 

545
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,220
 One... two... three! 

546
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,760
I'm coming for you!

547
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,820
Oh, my head!

548
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,440
You'd better not let me catch you!

549
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,630
Yu Byeol, where are you?

550
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,210
I got you!

551
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,500
- No! 
 - I'll fly there!

552
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,710
Jeong Seo Jun! Yu Byeol!

553
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,580
Auntie!

554
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,880
Goodness, come here!

555
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,570
Mom!

556
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,510
Aigoo, are you having fun?

557
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,540
Were you bothering Uncle?

558
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,730
- Did you tease him? 
 - Yes, we did.

559
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,980
Should we bother him again?

560
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,250
- Hey. 
 - Uncle!

561
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,510
Gosh.

562
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,140
Here, go get him!

563
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,320
The older they get, the more they like it.

564
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,200
We caught Byeol's dad again and again.

565
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,400
- Really? 
 - That's why I'm holding her up like this.

566
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,980
So bad. He really can't play, right?

567
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,980
- Was I that bad? 
 - Yes.

568
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,380
- He was so bad! 
 - Yes, so bad.

569
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,960
- Really bad? 
 - So bad.

570
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,770
- But it was so fun, right? 
 - They say you were so bad.

571
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,900
   

572
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,900
   

573
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,840
   

574
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,910
 Ji Yun, just wait here. 

575
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,950
 - Daddy will be back soon. 
 - No. 

576
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,850
 Dad, Dad, don't go! 

577
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,300
 Don't go! 

578
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,660
 Dad! Dad! 

579
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,740
 Dad! 

580
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,300
 Dad! 

581
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:22,440
 Dad! 

582
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,830
   

583
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,690
 Wow! 

584
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,360
 It's so pretty. 

585
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,310
 Right? It's so pretty. 

586
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,820
 - Ji Yun, did you have fun today? 
 - Yes. 

587
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,520
 You're the best, Dad. Let's come back again! 

588
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,000
 My girl... 

589
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,220
 Thank you for growing up so well although Mom isn't here. 

590
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,150
 It's okay. I have you, Dad. You're all I need. 

591
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,470
 Okay, I will be by your side for a long, long time and protect you. 

592
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,360
 - I'll never let you be alone, Ji Yun. 
 - Okay! 

593
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,710
 I promise. 

594
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,090
 - Promise! 
 - We promised! 

595
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:54,170
 The cherry blossoms are so pretty, right? 

596
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,250
Lies.

597
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,210
How are you feeling? Still not good?

598
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,470
Have you had lunch?

599
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,980
Oh, seriously.

600
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:02,820
She says she doesn't care, but she always gets sick at the same time of year...

601
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:07,080
   

602
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,820
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

603
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,230
Wow, it looks so good.

604
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,060
Have some.

605
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,070
I said I didn't want to.

606
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:33,800
Director Seo begged me to watch you eat, even if you don't want to.

607
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:49,170
You know what? Every other store is called a "store,"

608
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:52,030
but restaurants are called "home" ("Bapjip" meal home).

609
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,280
Fish stores, fruit stores, and cosmetics stores.

610
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,550
They're all "stores," but have you heard of a "meal store"?

611
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,580
It's awkward, right?

612
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,810
It means food goes well with a home.

613
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:07,000
It's not just about eating.

614
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,500
Taking in the devotion made by someone

615
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,500
who thought of their loved ones.

616
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,690
It's a while since you ate at home, right?

617
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,670
Their food really looks home-cooked.

618
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,940
It looks so good. Go ahead.

619
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:33,070
So why did you take paternity leave,

620
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,480
instead of working on your career?

621
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:41,680
I wanted to see her smile. My daughter has such a pretty smile.

622
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:51,160
She needed me.

623
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,930
I promised her I'd stay by her side, and I kept my promise.

624
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,650
I am all that my daughter has.

625
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:05,470
 I will be by your side for a long, long time and protect you. 

626
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:09,380
 I'll never let you be alone, Ji Yun. I promise. 

627
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,860
You eat.

628
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,530
Ms. CEO.

629
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,060
CEO, I got you some porridge and painkillers.

630
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,090
You don't look well so...

631
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,110
Have some before it gets cold.

632
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,640
   

633
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,430
I don't need it. Take it away.

634
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,310
Are you okay?

635
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:54,490
I can take care of myself.

636
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,260
Take it with you. It's distracting.

637
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:15,670
Why did you do something I didn't ask?

638
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,790
I just wasted energy due to you.

639
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,790
You said to judge you as a secretary.

640
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,650
The secretary I need does only what I say.

641
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,220
Don't do too much like this.

642
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,430
Get out.

643
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,410
I'm sorry.

644
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,250
Yes, Executive Director.

645
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,020
I know it's our candidate's first day tomorrow. I meant to call you.

646
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,530
I guess you didn't hear. I just got the call that he's not coming in.

647
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:30,250
 CEO Kang, it's your third candidate who backed out. 

648
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,020
 You picked the right Head Architect. 

649
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,290
 What's going on with the rest of the team? 

650
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:36,400
Well...

651
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,540
I'm sorry, Executive Director. Let me check—

652
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,420
 The Chairman says we should stop accepting candidates from Peoplez. 

653
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,120
- I'm afraid this is it for this project. 
 - Wait—

654
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,950
CEO Kang, I think someone is stealing your candidates.

655
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:54,760
Please be aware of your surroundings. That's all.

656
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,490
 You must have some good news. 

657
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,770
 You don't "take on" work. You make it happen. 

658
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:05,990
 You have to be greedy to get it. 

659
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,210
- CEO. 
 - Don't follow me.

660
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,250
CEO Kang!

661
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,130
Hey, what's wrong?

662
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,550
What's going on?

663
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,860
   

664
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,510
To what do I owe the pleasure?

665
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:09,890
Welcome.

666
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,950
I'll keep this brief.

667
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,980
Please uphold business ethics.

668
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,310
Stop what you're doing right now.

669
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,290
It was the candidates' choices.

670
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:21,630
All I did was give them better terms.

671
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:25,290
You lost candidates because you're incompetent. Why make a scene here?

672
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,740
You steal them on purpose to hurt me.

673
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,870
So are you hurt? Since you came all the way here.

674
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:36,460
Stop scheming behind my back. It might make me think...

675
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,850
you're actually afraid of me.

676
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,160
Do I terrify you that much?

677
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,880
Of course. Someone died because of you.

678
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,780
Sunbae.

679
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,120
Did you feel nothing walking in here?

680
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,040
How do you dare walk in here again?

681
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,320
You're so shameless.

682
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,260
I haven't removed anything that belonged to him.

683
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,050
You must have forgotten.

684
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,780
   

685
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,130
   

686
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,650
-  Traitor. So shameless.  
 -  It's Kang Ji Yun's fault that CEO Lee died, right? 

687
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:36,500
 Traitor. How dare she walk in here after killing someone? 

688
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:43,340
This is your last warning.

689
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:47,550
If you do this again, I won't hold back anymore.

690
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,630
What do I do? Both then and now...

691
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:01,860
no one is on your side here.

692
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,890
 Did something happen between her and the CEO? She doesn't look good. 

693
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:08,210
 What is she doing coming here after five years? 

694
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:12,730
 She's still just as shameless. 

695
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,330
 How dare she walk in here? 

696
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:17,180
 How dare she come here? 

697
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,490
 Has she no shame? 

698
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,690
 I thought she established her own company. 

699
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:25,120
 Why is she back here? Wow, what a party. 

700
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,440
 Who is she here to kill this time? 

701
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,720
 How could she betray the CEO? 

702
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,440
 How can she be so brazen? 

703
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,500
 Can she sleep at night after destroying CEO's life? 

704
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,870
 - Is she crazy? 
 - How could she? 

705
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:39,180
-  She looks proud. 
 - It's Kang Ji Yun's fault that the CEO died, right? 

706
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,820
 A person should have some shame. 

707
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:45,300
 - Traitor. 
 - Shameless. How dare she appear here? 

708
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:48,950
 How dare she crawl back here after killing someone? 

709
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:53,340
 If it were me, I would never stand up again. 

710
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,550
 She's a murderer. 

711
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,480
Ms. CEO.

712
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:44,040


713
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:48,080
♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

714
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,970
♫  I don't know why I'm being like this  ♫

715
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:53,760
♫  I'm looking at you  ♫

716
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,810
♫  It's a difficult feeling  ♫

717
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,780
♫  This strange sensation  ♫

718
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,640
♫  Feels more like excitement than nerves  ♫

719
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,430
♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

720
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:08,490
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

721
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:13,960
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

722
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,370
♫  Though it might be sudden  ♫

723
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:22,430

726
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:31,960
    
 ♫  Whatever it is, I can do it  ♫

727

729
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,200
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

730
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:54,010
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

731
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:59,430
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

732
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,600
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

733
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,880
 Thanks for today. 

734
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,330
 - Hot! 
 - Let's do our best to work together. 

735
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:13,050
 An inappropriate relationship appeared in the reference check? 

736
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:16,370
 There won't be an issue. Please keep it a secret. 

737
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:19,100
 I think there's one thing we didn't check. 

738
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,930
 - Abeonim. 
 - Abeonim? (father) 

739
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:23,000
 Do I look like someone's dad to you? 

740
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,530
 Have you ever seen a dad who looks like this? 

741
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,350
 What kind of person do you think I am? 

742
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:31,320
 I've been a villain to you from the start, Secretary Yu. 

743
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,240
 That's why I want to know the real you.
