16
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,151
Will you really be okay?

17
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:01,153
I'm fine sleeping at home now.

18
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:03,904
Please explain it well to Byeol.

19
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,741
 Take care. 

20
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:07,742
Drive safely.

♫  For countless days  ♫

22
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,502
I will go in after seeing you off.

23
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,670
I'll call you when I get home.

24
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:30,410
♫  A day without you feels so unfamiliar  ♫

25

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:46,047

27
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:47,783
   

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,800
   

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,000
 Do you want to go to the ocean? 

30
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,900
 What were you thinking about? 

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,000
 So much has changed since I met you, Eun Ho. 

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,096
 I always thought I must be responsible for it all alone. 

33
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:12,874
 Building Peoplez and protecting it, 

34
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:15,460
 I thought it was all my responsibility. 

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,562
 After seeing my staff at the bookstore, 

36
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:19,980
 I realized that is not true. 

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,950
♫  When we meet again, please hold my hand  ♫

38
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,070
♫  Embrace me  ♫

39
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:34,788
Chairman Woo is right.

40
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,200
Even if I fight to keep my position,

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
it will be hard for Peoplez to return to normal again.

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,204
There's no reason the employees should endure that.

43
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,400
I told you.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Thanks to you, Eun Ho, I know what truly matters.

45
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:54,432
My employees...

46
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,717
I want to protect them.

47
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,024
You're amazing.

48
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:07,962
I trust your decision, Ji Yun.

49
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:10,631
Thank you.

50
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,660
Then there's just one thing left

51
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,998
for me to do:

52
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,041
continue to stay by your side.

53
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:42,920
I asked you all to come in because I have something to tell you.

54
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,077
As of today,

55
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm resigning from CEO of Peoplez.

56
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,110
Pardon?

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,385
Career Way will acquire this company.

58
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,846
Your jobs are guaranteed to transfer

59
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:18,500
so you can keep coming to work as usual.

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry that I can't be with you until the end.

61
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:25,190
Please protect Peoplez

62
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,967
in my place, everyone.

63
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:37,218
Wh-What?

64
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:40,236
What is she talking about?

65
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:48,588
What is this? I don't understand anything.

66
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,965
What you just said...

67
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:51,258
Was it Chairman Woo?

68
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,384
Did my father do this?

69
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,927
It was my decision.

70
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,553
You two will transfer, too,

71
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:56,721
so think about it.

72
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,473
Hey, Kang Ji Yun!

73
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:00,475
You can't just spit out whatever you want.

74
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:03,744
How could you make such a decision without consulting us?

75
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:05,063
I can't accept this decision.

76
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:06,815
I'll stop it somehow

77
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:08,566
so rethink it, CEO Kang.

78
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,530
Director Woo!

79
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,451
You knew about this, right?

80
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:22,554
You knew and didn't stop her?

81
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:29,671
Yes, Sir.

82
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,470
Where is my father right now?

83
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:37,242
Secretary Yu, is this really the decision?

84
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,114
Hyungnim, is it so?

85
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:40,515
We have all the evidence.

86
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:43,518
We worked so hard.

87
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,020
Is this really what she wants?

88
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,438
Did you agree to this?

89
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,900
You know very well how hard it would be for a search firm

90
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,493
to regain people's trust.

91
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,537
There's no guarantee the case will resolve,

92
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:04,664
and even if does,

93
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,958
we don't know if clients will return to Peoplez.

94
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,660
But...

95
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,170
but still...

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,449
From CEO Kang's view,

97
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:19,600
she thought this was the best way to protect you all.

98
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:36,304
Who is that? Why is he in my office?

99
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:38,938
- Get him out of here. 
 - Chairman.

100
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:43,627
I lost.

101
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,664
I'll go to your company.

102
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:50,418
If you tell me to move back home,

103
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:52,211
I will.

104
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,675
I guess you see reality more clearly

105
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:00,996
now your company is in ruins.

106
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:04,700
Instead, please don't take Peoplez away from Kang Ji Yun.

107
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,336
Will you sell yourself to protect Peoplez?

108
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:11,272
Do you think you're worth that much?

109
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:12,860
No,

110
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,402
of course not.

111
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,513
Hyung wasn't good enough for you. How could I be?

112
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:20,000
No.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Can anyone match your expectations in the first place?

114
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,954
Hyung worked so hard

115
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,123
just to win your darn approval!

116
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,390
Until his very end!

117
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,426
I can't do what he did,

118
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,062
but... I can at least pretend.

119
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:49,325
If that's what you want, I will do it.

120
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,910
So...

121
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,409
please leave Kang Ji Yun alone.

122
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:05,960
Please...

123
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,750
   

124
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,310
What? I thought you went home.

125
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,701
Why didn't you answer your phone after leaving like that?

126
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,495
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

127
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,871
And the company issue will resolve itself so—

128
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:56,542
So the solution you found was to submit to the Chairman?

129
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,048
What else can I do?

130
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,649
This is the only weapon I have.

131
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:08,515
- Director Woo... 
 - I was going to surrender anyway.

132
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,643
I can't support myself without my father.

133
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:14,395
I'm sick of sleeping outside of my home.

134
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:16,856
If I will surrender,

135
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,068
I might as well get something from it.

136
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:23,420
Let me aid your life for once, Kang Ji Yun.

137
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:25,865
This is my choice.

138
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,493
If I chose to fight, no matter what he does,

139
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:31,094
I would stay to the end. You know that.

140
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:34,882
Jeong Hun,

141
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,168
I know how you feel.

142
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:40,345
I understand, but I'm truly okay.

143
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,006
So don't do this for me.

144
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:44,000
- Noona... 
 - If you really care for me,

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,579
don't give up the fight until you get what you want,

146
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,663
not for any reason.

147
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,689
The equity transfer deal is closed.

148
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:01,730
Please sign the corporate acquisition contract.

149
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,830
   

150
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,810
   

151
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,720
   

152
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,802
The corporate acquisition contract is closed.

153
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,554
Congratulations, CEO Kim.

154
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,556
You got what you wanted.

155
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,891
All due to you, Chairman. Thank you.

156
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:37,400
Thanks to you, I sold all problematic shares.

157
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,280
This is called a "win-win."

158
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,900
Good work, CEO Kang.

159
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,000
Thank you for everything.

160
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:04,396
How does it feel to lose your company to me?

161
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,925
Please take good care of my employees.

162
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:09,827
Ensure you honor their employment transfers.

163
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:11,304
I don't know why you care.

164
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,431
It's a hundred times better to float in a top company

165
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:16,184
than to be at one with investment fraud.

166
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:19,719
Your employees will be happy in the acquisition.

167
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:22,239
Let's go.

168
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:26,861
Your judgment isn't as sound as I thought.

169
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:31,500
I didn't think you'd choose to go down with a sinking ship.

170
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,456
Kang Ji Yun,

171
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,862
watch carefully

172
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:49,000
how quickly Peoplez and your name disappear.

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,200
How the five years you spent go to shambles.

174
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,224
A week is plenty of time, right?

175
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:58,925
Clean out your office.

176
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:01,353
Make sure no trace of you stays.

177
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:16,244
Mr. Yu, are you okay?

178
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:17,678
Of course. Don't worry.

179
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:19,680
Let me know if you need any help.

180
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,316
You already help me so much.

181
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,950
Thank you.

182
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,838
Daddy, let's go.

183
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,047
Let's go.

184
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,780
Bye, Byeol.  Bye bye.

185
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,218
- Good night. 
 - Bye.

186
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:42,019
Byeol,

187
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,105
I heard of the watermelon party at kindergarten today.

188
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:45,398
Was it fun?

189
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,774
Yes.

190
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,770
- Daddy! 
 - Yes?

191
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,290
What?

192
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,575
Be strong.

193
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,746
Did you feel I root for you?

194
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,080
Yes.

195
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,058
Make sure you pass it to Unnie from me.

196
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,363
Okay, I will.

197
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,884
I'm so touched,

198
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:15,961
and I feel so strong!

199
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,630
   

200
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,470
And I feel strongly... 
     

201
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,274
You've worked so hard for five years.

202
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,848
Let's go now.

203
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,530
   

204
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,079
Let's take that down first.

205
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,123
Why don't we create a new name?

206
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:50,857
Yes, CEO.

207
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,780
   

208
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,110
   

209
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,880
   

210
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,270
   

211
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,800
They must have seen our resignation letters by now, right?

212
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,480
Did we make the right choice?

213
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,300
Gyeong Hwa, it's pointless to regret a decision already made.

214
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,465
Stop shaking your leg.

215
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:09,604
We will be fine, right?

216
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:12,498
So many search firms are out there.

217
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,376
Let's be patient and take time to think.

218
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:19,400
We won't be unemployed in a month, will we?

219
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,981
We can't just be here like this.

220
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,340
I think I saw a post.

221
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,016
Team Leader Lee, the team offer...

222
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,560
Look for it. It's there.

223
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,761
There's no way it's missing.

224
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,700
CEO, much gossip is about the forced acquisition.

225
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,820
If news spreads that 90% of employees resigned,

226
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,321
it might cause problems.

227
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,923
I think you need a fast solution.

228
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,202
Are you CEO Kim Hye Jin?

229
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:53,831
Yes, who are you?

230
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:55,000
Police.

231
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,400
CEO Park Yeong Min of Econic Bio turned himself in.

232
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:03,023
In his confession, your name emerged.

233
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,850
Please come to the station with us.

234
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,310
 "CEO Park Yeong Min"? 

235
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,040
 Wasn't that a fraud case? 

236
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,380
 What? What's going on here? 

237
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,868
 With CEO Park Yeong Min's confession, 

238
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:15,770
 the Econic Bio investment fraud case 

239
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,730
-  takes a new turn.  
 - As investment experts,

240
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,524
- they approached me first. 
 -  Besides CEO Park Yeong Min, 

241
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:22,001
-  others were involved.  
 - Did you two conspire

242
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,944
to approach CEO Park Yeong Min?

243
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:25,780
 CEO Kim of a well-known search firm... 

244
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,047
 I already said no. 

245
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,533
Have you any proof besides Park Yeong Min's testimony?

246
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:32,900
 and investment expert Han are being investigated. 

247
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,100
 Yes, is that a problem? 

248
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,086
- You changed your name. 
  - Han had many records of fraud. 

249
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,696
 Han and Kim were found to have 

250
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:46,618
 conspired investment fraud five years ago. 

251
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:50,321
The employee reported to be involved in investment fraud five years ago,

252
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:51,823
was that CEO Kim Hye Jin?

253
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:54,324
Yes, that's correct.

254
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,646
Thank you for assisting our investigation.

255
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:00,981
The findings will be announced soon.

256
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:02,941
Good work.

257
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:07,403
Kang Ji Yun!

258
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:13,327
It was you, right?

259
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:15,996
I don't know your supposed scheme,

260
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:17,898
but you won't ruin me.

261
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:19,458
Do you think you won?

262
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,750
Are you so happy you could die?

263
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:23,800
No,

264
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,700
I pity you. You still live full of resentment.

265
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,970
I won't live motivated by hatred anymore.

266
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,346
Pay for your crimes

267
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:35,682
and live to atone for what you did to CEO Lee.

268
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:41,938
Kang Ji Yun!

269
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:46,360
This is all your fault!

270
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,461
Kang Ji Yun!

271
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:50,823
Let me go! If you didn't enter my life...

272
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,534
It's your fault that Sunbae died!

273
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:54,952
Hey!

274
00:19:54,952 --> 00:19:56,000
Let me go!

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,500
   

276
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:03,978
Oh my!

277
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:06,297
Career Way has a new CEO.

278
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:08,883
Wow, how long will Kim Hye Jin be in jail?

279
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,802
I hope she rots in jail a long time!

280
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:13,721
So what happens to Peoplez now?

281
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:15,389
Can't CEO Kang just return?

282
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:17,016
Who would give that away for free?

283
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,977
Kim Hye Jin already cost them plenty.

284
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:22,479
I'm sure Career Way lost much money.

285
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,648
You need money for an acquisition.

286
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:25,833
You can find investors.

287
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,904
She doesn't want to be whipped by investors anymore.

288
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,739
So what will CEO Kang do now?

289
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,409
I don't know. That's why I feel crazy!

290
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,494
Have you heard from Eun Ho?

291
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:39,163
No.

292
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,417
Honey, maybe you will really end up unemployed.

293
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,921
Do I need to find another job?

294
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:51,024
What goes on in that girl's head?

295
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,699
How long will you lie in bed? Time to wake.

296
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:19,610
- Why are you here so early? 
 - "Early"? It's past ten.

297
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,305
Let me just rest longer.

298
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:23,656
I have nothing to do.

299
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,543
It appears a life without work suits you.

300
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,924
I never knew how good it is to rest.

301
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:35,570
I haven't slept in for years.

302
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:38,530
So will you sleep all day?

303
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:41,725
No, I'll play with Yu Eun Ho.

304
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:43,701
What do you want to do?

305
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:48,748
Get over here first.

306
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:53,654
Nice.

307
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:55,860
Let's just sleep longer like this.

308
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,080
♫  Guide me closer  ♫

309
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,262
Sleep a little longer.

310
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:09,561
Sleep longer?

311
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,298
Yu Eun Ho, seriously...

312
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,132
What, Kang Ji Yun?

313
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:17,111
"Kang Ji Yun"?

314
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,263
Yes. You're not a CEO now.

315
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:22,000
- But... 
 - Ji Yun.

316
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
Ji Yun...

317
00:22:24,018 --> 00:22:25,119
Sleep.

318
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,520
Seriously.

319
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,772
I forgive you since you're handsome.

320
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:30,957
I forgive you since you're pretty.

321
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,100
It's too bright.

322
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,880

323

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,580
♫  Makes the whole night sway  ♫

335
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:39,200
♫  Yesterday, even my dreams were filled with you  ♫

336
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,420
♫  You know, my feelings grow every day. Will you understand?  ♫

337
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,530
Next, please.

338
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,430
♫  Let me know your everything  ♫

339
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:54,530
Is this place that good?

340
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:59,113
- Number one on my list. 
  - Oh.

341
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:02,415
- Trust me. We will see. 
 - I'll see.

342
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:08,540
♫  Watching you all day, the day passes by  ♫

343
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,040
♫  I want to know your everything more and more  ♫

344
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,720
That was good.

345
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:16,897
I agree with you.

346
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:18,510
Of course.

347
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:24,304
Is it raining?

348
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:25,820
Let's run!

349
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,940
 Oh, my gosh! Let's stay here for a bit. 

350
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,590
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

351
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,382
I haven't seen rain like this in a while.

352
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,950
Do you like rain?

353
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,827
Yes, I like hearing the sound of rain.

354
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,930
What's your favorite weather?

355
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:56,003
I haven't really thought about such things.

356
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:59,105
I don't know what I've been doing my whole life.

357
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:04,678
You can find out with me now on.

358
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:06,250
Sounds great.

359
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:09,170
It feels cool.

360
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,452
Day-drinking while the sun is out?

361
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:30,621
I never thought I'd do this.

362
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:33,207
Did you never day-drink before? It's your first time?

363
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:34,875
Not even in college?

364
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,294
No, I haven't.

365
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:38,645
How unromantic of you.

366
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:41,772
You can't have romance by yourself.

367
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:52,408
Day-drinking is sweet.

368
00:25:53,227 --> 00:25:55,020
It's fun.

369
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,300
I become impulsive when I'm with you, Eun Ho.

370
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:01,900
I'm usually anxious without a plan.

371
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,100
- It's fun, right? 
 - This is serious.

372
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:09,592
Let's chug this. I want to get drunk today.

373
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,060
 So pretty. 

374
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,470
   

375
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:36,186
I've never done this before.

376
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,854
- Me, neither. 
 - Really?

377
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:43,876
 I want to be taller than Yu Eun Ho. 

378
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,930
   

379
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:49,416
Have you been coming occasionally?

380
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:53,320
Seong Hoon must be happy to see you.

381
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,646
I found this while cleaning my room yesterday.

382
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,998
It's a photo that was always in Seong Hoon's office.

383
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:05,025
I couldn't find it before,

384
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:07,985
but maybe I was meant to meet you here today.

385
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:19,847
Seong Hoon always said this was a memorable day for him.

386
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,300
I brought the photos to show him,

387
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,025
but I guess they were meant for you.

388
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:36,546
After Seong Hoon died, I had many regrets.

389
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:39,226
I should have listened more when he was upset.

390
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:41,937
I should have been the one to comfort him.

391
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:44,772
But I couldn't do that.

392
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,570
I hated you so I resented Seong Hoon as well.

393
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,698
I know you dislike me.

394
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,700
I won't tell you to stop hating me, but...

395
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:59,303
please don't repeat the same mistake with Jeong Hun.

396
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,724
Seong Hoon never hated you,

397
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:05,043
and you should...

398
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,561
also forgive yourself.

399
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,920
   

400
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,040
   

401
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,650
No jobs anywhere.

402
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,764
Are you working hard?

403
00:29:58,764 --> 00:29:59,900
What?

404
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,900
Why are you so pretty today?

405
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,189
I devoted a little effort.

406
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:09,081
Do I look okay?

407
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:13,794
Did you devote effort for me?

408
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:19,633
No! I had a meeting with the publisher today.

409
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:24,096
Oh, "a meeting with the publisher"?

410
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,712
Ta-da! I finally have my new book.

411
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,547
Wow, daebak!

412
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:35,180
"On Monday Morning."

413
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:38,053
It's a big success. I can already smell it.

414
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:41,655
This looks like a bestseller.

415
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:43,682
Congratulations, Ms. Jeong.

416
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:49,311
Good! Now, you can take care of me.

417
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:51,316
Fine. That sounds good.

418
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,026
I'll be a bestselling writer.

419
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:56,922
How can you agree just like that?

420
00:30:56,922 --> 00:31:00,424
"What do you mean? Why would I take care of you?" That's what you should say.

421
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:02,369
Ms. Jeong, you'll get in big trouble.

422
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:05,379
You just asked me to take care of you.

423
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:10,752
Do you do that for everyone?

424
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:12,770
I don't know...

425
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,749
Wait a minute.

426
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,110
Hello?

427
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,263
 Woo Jeong Hun, where are you? 

428
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:23,598
I know I'll work today. I didn't forget.

429
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:25,533
I'll be there on time.

430
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:31,286
Yes, yes, yes. Sorry for sassing as a lowly part-timer. Bye.

431
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:35,794
- I shouldn't have volunteered to work part-time. 
 - Why?

432
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,878
Noona is bullying me.

433
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:43,050
Okay! Let's go.

434
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,871
We have only three more hours of free time.

435
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:46,955
Okay!

436
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:49,307
I already researched where to go.

437
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,710
Just trust and follow me.

438
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,652
Okay.

439
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:57,465
- Wait! 
 - What?

440
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,801
We're wearing the same shoes!

441
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,595
What?

442
00:32:01,595 --> 00:32:03,471
- Really? 
 - What is this?

443
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:05,240
Stop making it so obvious.

444
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,075
Gosh! Seriously!

445
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,580
Wow...

446
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:18,851
Jeong Hun, I heard this is a lot scarier than you think.

447
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:20,989
Will you be okay?

448
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,490
- Me? 
 - Yes.

449
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,243
- Are you asking me right now? 
 - Yes.

450
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,012
Honestly, I don't believe in ghosts.

451
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:32,900
I even watch horror movies before I go to bed.

452
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,961
If it's too scary, don't worry.

453
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:37,297
Just follow me, I'll protect you.

454
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:38,660
Okay.

455
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:41,034
Can I trust you?

456
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:42,302
Of course.

457
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:45,012
It's all just people here, nothing to fear.

458
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:47,560
Be careful. I think this is moving.

459
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,575
Where are you going?

460
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,939
Oh, my gosh!

461
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:57,480
No, no. A foot, it was just a foot.

462
00:32:58,193 --> 00:33:00,127
That scared me.

463
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:04,449
- Sh-Should I go in front? 
 - No, no. I'll go in front.

464
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,825
- Stay behind me. 
 - Okay.

465
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:07,460
It's dangerous.

466
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,001
J-Jeong Hun?

467
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:16,430
Yes?

468
00:33:17,237 --> 00:33:19,714
I mean, something is on here.

469
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:21,883
I got it off. I got it...

470
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,551
Was something on my clothes?

471
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,220
Yes.

472
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,100
- I thought about it. 
 - Yes?

473
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,542
- We're a bit unprotected from behind. 
 - Yes.

474
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:35,010
If you go in front, I'll keep watch in back.

475
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,190
- Me? 
 - Yes, if you go in front...

476
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,858
I think the back is dangerous.

477
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:39,734
- Me? 
 - Yes.

478
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:41,236
- First? 
 - G-Go ahead.

479
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:44,029
- I'll watch the back. 
 - Okay.

480
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,310
- Jeong Hun? 
 - Yes?

481
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,370
You're coming, right?

482
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,080
Yes, I'm coming.

483
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,399
- I'm looking behind so... 
 - Okay.

484
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,310
Don't worry.

485
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:00,922
Please, please!

486
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,048
Just go!

487
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,580
Please!

488
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,120
Oh, crap.

489
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:19,658
I'm sorry.

490
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,359
- I'm sorry. 
 - I was just scared.

491
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,394
R-Right...

492
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:26,780
Sh-Should we go?

493
00:34:27,307 --> 00:34:29,830
- Should we? 
 - Yes.

494
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,952
My goodness.

495
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:33,150
This is just...

496
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:36,891
- I'm so hungry. 
 - Right?

497
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:39,793
- Should we get tteokbokki? 
 - I like tteokbokki.

498
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,922
Hello.

499
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:45,050
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

500
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,660
How come you're here together?

501
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,895
Were you just together somewhere?

502
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:52,020
Yes, she and I...

503
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,878
We just met each other around the corner.

504
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:58,938
Coincidentally, right?

505
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:00,815
Yes, around the corner.

506
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:02,441
Coincidentally.

507
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:05,820
Go in. The principal must be searching for you.

508
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,655
Then I will go in.

509
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:09,616
Come over again some time.

510
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:10,909
I'll make you something delicious.

511
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,660
I would be so grateful.

512
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,331
I still haven't forgotten the taste of the ocean.

513
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:17,457
Let me know when.

514
00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:18,984
- Of course. 
 - Bye now.

515
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,630
Bye.

516
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,408
Hey, I approve. I like him.

517
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:29,467
Mom, what do you mean? It's not like that.

518
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,304
What do you mean it's not like that?

519
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,515
You had clothes strewn all over your room.

520
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:38,753
Oh, that was for the meeting with the publisher.

521
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:40,687
Let's go, Byeol.

522
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:44,384
Hey, Seo Jun. See how your mom's ears are all red?

523
00:35:44,384 --> 00:35:47,590
Yes, she's embarrassed.

524
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,155
- Grandma. 
 - Yes?

525
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:51,116
Should we pretend we don't know?

526
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,483
Aigoo. Sure, let's do that.

527
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:56,270
You're better than me, Seo Jun.

528
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:06,280
I'm so tired.

529
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:11,943
Where did she go after leaving me to clean? Why isn't she back?

530
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:13,730
Gosh, seriously.

531
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,820
   

532
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:22,313
Hello?

533
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,691
- I unfroze your credit card. 
 - What?

534
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:26,734
 Stop sleeping elsewhere. Come home. 

535
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:30,086
Father? Are you ill?

536
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:31,656
Crazy jerk.

537
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,274
Make some time for a meal with me!

538
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,576
What? What is he saying?

539
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:47,005
What's going on?

540
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,491
What are you doing? Keep cleaning.

541
00:36:49,491 --> 00:36:51,100
I mean...

542
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,600
My father just told me to come home.

543
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,181
He unfroze my card too.

544
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,891
What is he talking about?

545
00:36:57,891 --> 00:37:00,226
It seems an olive branch.

546
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:02,919
Reconcile? He'd never.

547
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:05,273
Don't you know my father yet?

548
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,277
I think you're the one who doesn't know, Woo Jeong Hun.

549
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:10,810
See you.

550
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:35,736
Why aren't you eating?

551
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:42,409
I can't swallow without knowing your ulterior motive.

552
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,700
What do you want? Just tell me.

553
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:53,503
"Ulterior motive"? It's a father and son meal.

554
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,882
So what will you do with your life?

555
00:37:58,284 --> 00:37:59,661
I'm figuring it out.

556
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:01,829
I know I'm too old to be idle.

557
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:04,249
I think I'm pathetic, but...

558
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,025
I don't know.

559
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:10,200
What does a meaningful life look like?

560
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:15,075
It's not something to find overnight.

561
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,900
So how are you doing these days? Are you fine?

562
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:23,543
Pardon?

563
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:25,619
Are you okay?

564
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:29,680
Well, fine, I guess.

565
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,259
I work part-time.

566
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,782
Since when were you interested in me?

567
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,202
I didn't even ask him if he was okay.

568
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,600
To your brother.

569
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,874
I thought he could handle it.

570
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:51,243
As a father, I didn't even know.

571
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,800
You should lead the life you want.

572
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:08,220
I don't want to lose you, too.

573
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:13,767
We can eat together sometimes.

574
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,973
Wow, Yu Eun Ho!

575
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:57,403
What? You look good. Wh-Why is that?

576
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:58,738
Why do you look so good?

577
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:01,282
Is it a problem if I look good?

578
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:02,450
Thanks for this.

579
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,320
I heard the company you were working for went down.

580
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,413
I thought you'd be in shambles.

581
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,874
I was going to show up as your savior.

582
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,200
How? Tell me. Why are you my savior?

583
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,547
Director Kim wants to bring you back.

584
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,616
Chief Song finally got fired.

585
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,759
He's so talentless.

586
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:22,637
He stuck it out so long through politicking.

587
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:27,039
As soon as Song got fired, Director Kim sought you first.

588
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,936
Hansu Electronics' HR ace.

589
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,270
You're coming, right?

590
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,900
You will be back, right?

591
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,385
- No. I won't. 
 - Wh-Why, why not?

592
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:39,779
Are you already another job?

593
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:42,088
I don't have one,

594
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,258
but I need to be somewhere.

595
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:50,163
-  Hello?  
 - Ji Yun. What are you doing?

596
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:52,917
It's nice out. Shall we go on a date?

597
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,900
I can't today.

598
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
It's here already. I'm busy. Bye.

599
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,597
 Hey, Ji Yun— 

600
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,690
   

601
00:41:13,646 --> 00:41:15,440
What is this?

602
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,860
I'm going to start working again.

603
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,295
This is my office!

604
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:23,823
I'm starting over,

605
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:26,932
without anyone's stock, without being shaken by anyone,

606
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:28,727
and on my own.

607
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,331
So is this my seat?

608
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:34,834
- Good that you bought a big desk. 
 - No.

609
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:37,144
- There is no position for you. 
 - What?

610
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:40,840
Yu Eun Ho, you're fired now.

611
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,701
You were going to work for only six months anyway.

612
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,053
A-Are you serious? What do you mean?

613
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,800
Selim Group seeks a headquarters HR team lead.

614
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,710
They sent me an inquiry.

615
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,950
   

616
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,573
 Yes, Director. 

617
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:07,492
 It's been a while. How have you been? 

618
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,744
 CEO Kang, won't you start working again? 

619
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,846
 We're starting construction on the new project next month. 

620
00:42:11,846 --> 00:42:13,539
 All thanks to you, CEO Kang. 

621
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:14,874
 So to hire for this round, 

622
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:17,210
 I hope you would take it on. 

623
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,002
 Can you do it? 

624
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:21,672
 Yes. 

625
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,174
 I surely can. 

626
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:25,384
 A talent with deep understanding of HR, 

627
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,929
leadership, and communication skills.

628
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:31,432
I searched, but there's no one more perfect than you.

629
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:33,900
- Ji Yun... 
 - Eun Ho.

630
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,100
This whole time, you've given me so much.

631
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,700
Now I want you to make choices for yourself.

632
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,900
Please be the first candidate for my new company.

633
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:11,000
   

634
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,850
   

635
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,420
   

636
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,550
   

637
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,480
   

638
00:44:12,158 --> 00:44:14,134
Yes, Executive Director.

639
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,998
Yes, thank you.

640
00:44:18,998 --> 00:44:20,532
All right.

641
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,140
Wow! What is all this?

642
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,561
It's to congratulate your dad. 
    

643
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:43,513
Let's throw him a surprise party together.

644
00:44:52,965 --> 00:44:54,541
Ji Yun?

645
00:44:55,868 --> 00:44:57,590
Ji Yun?

646
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,330
   

647
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,900
   

648
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:25,039
Congratulations, Daddy!

649
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:27,023
Congratulations, Eun Ho!

650
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,737
I got it?

651
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:35,408
I said no one is more perfect for it than you.

652
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:36,951
Byeol.

653
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:38,585
Come here.

654
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:40,621
Ta-da!

655
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:42,181
Daddy, blow out your candle. 
    

656
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:43,416
Blow on three.

657
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:45,959
 One, two, three! 

658
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,389
Congratulations!

659
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:58,754
Byeol. What did Daddy say?

660
00:45:58,754 --> 00:46:00,766
Happiness...

661
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:02,601
is shared!

662
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:04,812
Run! Run!

663
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:06,147
Byeol, run!

664
00:46:06,147 --> 00:46:07,581
Byeol, turn around!

665
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,280
Run away!

666
00:46:15,823 --> 00:46:18,358
You can't get away!

667
00:46:29,336 --> 00:46:31,988
We did well, right, Byeol?

668
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,942
I'm so happy.

669
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:01,135
Who's this?

670
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:02,244
Hello!

671
00:47:02,244 --> 00:47:03,245
Welcome.

672
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:05,247
- Hello, CEO. 
 - Whoa, nice!

673
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:07,124
- Congratulations on your new company. 
 - Thank you.

674
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,226
- Come on in. 
 - Yes.

675
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,930
Your place is so nice.

676
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,234
Hyungnim! 
    

677
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:20,503
Congrats on your new job!

678
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,340
Look at Byeol.

679
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,561
Don't get too excited. It's nothing crazy.

680
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:29,463
- Thank you. 
 - That's expensive.

681
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:31,966
Why did you make all this food?

682
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:34,209
You didn't have to, but thank you.

683
00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:36,921
Of course, we should for our guests.

684
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,390
How have you been, everybody?

685
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,850
Quite good, right?

686
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,993
Good, yes.

687
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:46,597
So don't you have other employees?

688
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,332
Did just you two start it together?

689
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,500
Yes, that's how it worked out.

690
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,500
I'm stuck next to Kang Ji Yun again when I'm not even treated well.

691
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:57,575
I signed up to suffer. Aren't you sad for me?

692
00:47:57,575 --> 00:48:00,010
What? You pushed yourself in here.

693
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,680
- Should I go? 
 - No, you can do as you wish,

694
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,765
but don't leave. Where would you go?

695
00:48:04,765 --> 00:48:06,976
You two haven't changed.

696
00:48:06,976 --> 00:48:09,979
Now we're all together, it seems we're at Peoplez.

697
00:48:09,979 --> 00:48:12,314
I love it.

698
00:48:12,314 --> 00:48:14,859
I'm not just saying it since we're all together.

699
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:16,026
When we worked together,

700
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,670
those were the days.

701
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,283
Why?

702
00:48:22,283 --> 00:48:24,560
Manager, you haven't changed.

703
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,786
Why? Did I say something?

704
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:28,455
Why mention Peoplez now?

705
00:48:28,455 --> 00:48:30,541
No, well...

706
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,409
I have been thinking of you all.

707
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:36,100
If you are okay with it,

708
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,900
would you consider working with me again?

709
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,700
Because I want to start over again,

710
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,291
and I need you.

711
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,050
Ms. CEO?

712
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:56,515
Thank you, Director Yu.

713
00:48:56,515 --> 00:48:58,230
Here are your offers.

714
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,600
- Gosh, you really prepared this. 
 - Really?

715
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,158
Please give it careful thought; let me know your decision.

716
00:49:04,158 --> 00:49:07,036
- Yes, I will be careful... 
 - You'll come, right?

717
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:09,204
Will I have to deal with Kang Ji Yun alone?

718
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:12,307
If CEO Kang needs us, we will be there!

719
00:49:12,307 --> 00:49:14,184
Gyeong Hwa, stop! Well...

720
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,500
Why be impatient?

721
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,000
She gave us an offer. Read it before we decide.

722
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:20,524
- So aren't you joining? 
 - I'm just saying...

723
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,384
Excuse me, CEO?

724
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:26,096
Could I possibly put an addendum?

725
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,799
Oh, of course. If you want, please let me know.

726
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,838
Twice a month... guaranteed staff dinners!

727
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:37,232
Manager, seriously?

728
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:39,234
We need to approach this seriously.

729
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:42,211
No. This is vital to me.

730
00:49:43,364 --> 00:49:45,120
Three times.

731
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,201
If it's twice a month, I won't go.

732
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:48,510
Let's go once a month.

733
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,621
- Once... 
 - Hello, everyone!

734
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:53,457
Ciao! Hi! Aloha!

735
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,890
CEO Kang! Congrats on your new business! 
    

736
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,100
I wanted a bouquet, but they had only potted.

737
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,049
Thank you.

738
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:04,551
I heard you went to work for the Chairman.

739
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:09,303
When you're hiring, please consider using our business, Dear Client.

740
00:50:09,303 --> 00:50:11,575
Yes, got it.

741
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,310
How's work?

742
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,271
I'm doing it my own way.

743
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:18,210
I'm not my brother.

744
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:23,801
And Director Yu, congratulations on your new job.

745
00:50:25,114 --> 00:50:27,320
Congratulations to you, too.

746
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,225
You haven't changed.

747
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:32,178
This hasn't changed either.

748
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,333
What is this?

749
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,335
Everyone, this...

750
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:42,000
Don't get carried away by the atmosphere to just join.

751
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:45,200
You should read the contract carefully.

752
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,900
When could we play hard to get with Kang Ji Yun?

753
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,179
What?

754
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,180
That's what I say!

755
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,850
That's what I want to say.

756
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,685
Ms. CEO, I want something.

757
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:56,186
Can I take his notebook?

758
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,521
Unnie, this is for you!

759
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,900
Byeol, what is this?

760
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,394
I promised to name your new company.

761
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,820
Right.

762
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,989
"We"?

763
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:08,380
Yes!

764
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:12,051
Because it's us. We!

765
00:51:12,995 --> 00:51:15,054
Because it's us...

766
00:51:16,665 --> 00:51:18,590
We.

767
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,044
"We"?

768
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,050
Byeol, wait.

769
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,080
Let's see...

770
00:51:31,513 --> 00:51:33,057
How's this?

771
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:34,441
"We Company."

772
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:37,019
It rolls off the tongue.

773
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:38,853
I like it.

774
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:41,681
Thank you, Byeol.

775
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:48,000
   

776
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:53,410
 How did your meeting go? 

777
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,828
 You look like you're in a good mood. 

778
00:51:54,828 --> 00:51:56,463
I have good news.

779
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:58,415
The response to my book is good.

780
00:51:58,415 --> 00:51:59,750
It's going to the second print.

781
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,651
For real?

782
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,215
That's right! I knew you could do it.

783
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:08,884
I'm not the type to count the chickens before they hatch,

784
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:11,095
but I'm kind of excited this time.

785
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:12,930
I know it's just the second printing,

786
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,849
but maybe it will really become a bestseller.

787
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:17,601
"Just" the second printing?

788
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:20,087
You can't tell the future.

789
00:52:20,087 --> 00:52:22,605
- Is that so? 
 - Of course.

790
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:25,192
Excuse me.

791
00:52:25,192 --> 00:52:28,294
Young Man and Lady, who are curious about the future...

792
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,480
Us?

793
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:36,510
You wanted to know the future.

794
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,330
Jeong Hun, let's just leave.

795
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,990
Should we?

796
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:45,500
How strange.

797
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,200
Why do I see a small boy between a youthful man and woman?

798
00:52:54,163 --> 00:52:56,473
You're very insightful.

799
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,408
Here... Ask away.

800
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:01,979
She wrote a book recently.

801
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:04,481
How many copies will it sell?

802
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,807
Not that, next question.

803
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:11,180
I need to sign another contract.

804
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,656
Not that kind of thing.

805
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,576
Ask what you really want to know.

806
00:53:15,576 --> 00:53:16,827
Then what...

807
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:19,621
Don't you two want to know

808
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:23,424
if things will work out for you two?

809
00:53:23,424 --> 00:53:27,670
The whole year will end while you keep flirting.

810
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,090
- "Flirting"? No. 
 - Flirting...

811
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,909
Flirting? W-W-We're not... We're not like that at all.

812
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:37,945
Then are you siblings? Friends?

813
00:53:37,945 --> 00:53:39,349
An affair?

814
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,685
"Affair"? Don't say stuff like that!

815
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:44,700
- No way. 
 - That's nonsense.

816
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:49,193
You need to tell me what you two are if you want me to say anything.

817
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:53,387
Do you really have to know what we are?

818
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,800
So...

819
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,864
What is the nature of our relationship?

820
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:09,161
We're... just...

821
00:54:09,796 --> 00:54:13,948
saying hi when we meet each other?

822
00:54:14,676 --> 00:54:16,386
Oh, sure.

823
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,888
Aigoo, Dear Lord.

824
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,223
That's right.

825
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:22,750
We say hello... here and there.

826
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,270
That's...

827
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,600
Is that what we are?

828
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,092
We meet often to talk and went on a da—

829
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:35,104
This is ridiculous.

830
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,825
Instead of that,

831
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:41,377
let's have a different relationship!

832
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,851
A romantic one,

833
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,854
starting today.

834
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,500
A confession at a fortune teller's booth? How extra of you.

835
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,295
- How much... 
 - Take her hand and go!

836
00:55:17,197 --> 00:55:20,120
- Thank you. 
 - Bye.

837
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:26,755
Why are you holding my hand?

838
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,694
I can't believe so many people were at my place.

839
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:43,598
I'm tired.

840
00:55:43,598 --> 00:55:47,009
Maybe I should have said we will take tomorrow off.

841
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:52,330
Director Yu. I'm CEO Kang Ji Yun from We Company.

842
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:55,609
Please let us know if you have hiring inquiries.

843
00:55:58,305 --> 00:56:00,650
Are you already working?

844
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:05,495
I think my team is growing so...

845
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,664
Good, then I don't need to worry you're alone.

846
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:12,919
It's all thanks to you, Eun Ho.

847
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:16,800
Yu Eun Ho was the best secretary for me.

848
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,900
Kang Ji Yun was the best CEO I could have.

849
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,610
♫  Just like you  ♫

850
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,190
♫  A star shining in your eyes  ♫

851
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,580
 Good morning, CEO. 

852
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,890
♫  Just like moon  ♫

853
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:50,500
 You should take care of yourself. 

854
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:59,320
♫  I can show you the light  ♫

855
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,220
♫  When this night passes and the morning dawns  ♫

856
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,322
 Good job. 

857
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:13,800
♫  This moment when I meet your eyes every day  ♫

858
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,800
 I become more and more scared of things. 

859
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,069
 I feel like everything will fall apart if I trip and fall. 

860
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:21,770
 So what if you fall? You can always get up again. 

861
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,940
 I'll hold you up. 

862
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:31,345
 All right, smile. One, two, three. 

863
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,088
 You don't have to be perfect. 

864
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,257
 It's okay to look pathetic. 

865
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:45,476
 However you are, Ji Yun... I'll be by your side. 

866
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:53,501
 I won't... ever let go of this hand. 

867
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:57,497
 So... don't let go, either, Eun Ho. 

868
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,380
♫  Just like a forever starlight  ♫

869
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:10,434
 No matter where you are, Ji Yun, I will never let go of your hand. 

870
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:15,880
♫  Until that day when your light dims  ♫

871
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,944
I adore you.

872
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:24,110
I also cherish you.

873
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:33,980
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

874
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:38,380
♫  Just like a forever starlight  ♫

875
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:51,310
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

876
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,479
Are you awake?

877
00:59:11,473 --> 00:59:14,299
How long have you been gazing at me?

878
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:16,937
What?

879
00:59:16,937 --> 00:59:20,039
My face must be all puffy and ugly.

880
00:59:21,274 --> 00:59:23,193
I mean, yes.

881
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:25,028
What did you say?

882
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,662
Don't look!

883
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,765
I'm going to.

884
00:59:34,454 --> 00:59:36,188
Good morning.

885
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,877
Yes, lovely morning.

886
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,770
   

887
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,767
Byeol, let's have breakfast!

888
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,880
   

889
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,380
   

890
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,850
   

891
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:03,070
Daddy, let's go.

892
01:01:03,585 --> 01:01:06,486
- You got ready faster than me? 
 - Yes.

893
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:13,030

894
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,960
   

895
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,225
There they are.

896
01:01:19,225 --> 01:01:22,077
- Good morning! 
 - Morning!

897
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,349
Have a good day. Bye bye!

898
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:31,040

899
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:37,010

900
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:42,050

901
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:47,070

902
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:52,230

903
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:57,430


904
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:00,470
   

905
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,440
   

906
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:08,090

907
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,620
   

908
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,740
   

909
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:22,020
   

910
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,000
Can I get the analysis for last month's gross?

911
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,128
Gwang Hee is a fashion commerce expert.

912
01:02:28,128 --> 01:02:29,546
Do you know anyone for this?

913
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:31,673
I think street brand designers

914
01:02:31,673 --> 01:02:34,300
will fit better than established brand designers.

915
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,386
A couple of brands come to mind.

916
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:39,338
Let me contact them right away.

917
01:02:49,524 --> 01:02:50,567
Good morning!

918
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,660
- Hello, Ms. CEO. 
 - Hello!

919
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,230
   

920
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,992
Yes, this is We Company.

921
01:02:58,992 --> 01:03:00,340
Yes.

922
01:03:01,161 --> 01:03:03,278
Not even one?

923
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,150
Okay, got it.

924
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,752
What's wrong?

925
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:11,045
They want new recommendations.

926
01:03:11,045 --> 01:03:14,857
There isn't anyone suitable on the list we sent.

927
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:18,428
- Is it that place again? 
 - Yes.

928
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:22,766
I think it might be best if you meet with them yourself.

929
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:25,033
Got it. I'll meet with them.

930
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,500
So you don't like any candidates we recommended?

931
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,612
Yes.

932
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:38,381
We asked for specialists in practical experience.

933
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:42,744
Candidates you sent lack practical experience compared to their résumés.

934
01:03:42,744 --> 01:03:46,621
On your job description, we said your criteria was too narrow.

935
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:49,626
You can't find candidates of the right age with experience

936
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:52,045
within that same field.

937
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:54,589
Do you say we should look at other fields?

938
01:03:54,589 --> 01:03:56,132
If you can widen the field,

939
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:59,801
we will recommend new candidates with more practical experience.

940
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:05,022
It could be a good time to bring a fresh perspective to your company.

941
01:04:11,105 --> 01:04:13,316
Sounds good. Let's do that.

942
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:17,469
Yes. We will inform you of a new candidates list.

943
01:04:18,905 --> 01:04:20,448
Wait.

944
01:04:20,448 --> 01:04:22,941
Can you view this as well?

945
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,990
   

946
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:47,880
   

947
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,457
   

948
01:04:54,457 --> 01:05:00,176
With your last year's picture book, you've become a steady-selling writer.

949
01:05:00,176 --> 01:05:02,250
How does it feel?

950
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:06,060
It still feels a little surreal.

951
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:10,871
Could you talk a little about your new book?

952
01:05:10,871 --> 01:05:13,126
I'd rather you find out when the book is out.

953
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:16,446
If you could wait a little, it'll be out soon.

954
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:18,680
You're not falling for it.

955
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:21,785
People around you must be happy.

956
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:24,345
Who is the happiest?

957
01:05:24,345 --> 01:05:25,722
I don't know.

958
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:28,624
It's hard to pick just one person.

959
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:31,394
Right.

960
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:34,230
You have so many fans.

961
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,290
It must be hard to just pick one.

962
01:05:39,093 --> 01:05:40,570
Let's go home!

963
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,530
- Got it. 
 - Good work.

964
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,157
 Great work! 

965
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:45,658
Date night?

966
01:05:45,658 --> 01:05:47,170
See you tomorrow.

967
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,970
Excuse me, Manager. Do you want to have a drink tonight?

968
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:54,400
Hey, who drinks and goes home late these days?

969
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,810
I'm going home.

970
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,560
- Good night! 
 - Good night.

971
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,547
Bye now!

972
01:05:59,547 --> 01:06:01,341
How about you? Do you...

973
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:04,460
- Just make up with Gyeong Hwa already. 
 - Make up what?

974
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,220
It's a misunderstanding, just misperception...

975
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,332
I'm going home!

976
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,917
That's enough.

977
01:06:10,917 --> 01:06:12,627
See you tomorrow.

978
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:13,853
What are you doing tonight, Director Seo?

979
01:06:13,853 --> 01:06:16,204
M-Maybe not her.

980
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,930
- Over there. 
 - Okay.

981
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:22,000
Our usual.

982
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,784
Just call him.

983
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,369
- Want me to do it? Give it. 
 - No!

984
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:32,246
I won't forgive him so easily this time.

985
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:34,374
How exhausting.

986
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:36,250
Ma'am, an order of hagfish over here, please!

987
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,543
Hagfish...

988
01:06:37,543 --> 01:06:41,370
One more order of spicy chicken feet, too.

989
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:48,137
Gyeong Hwa doesn't like hagfish.

990
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,806
She likes chicken feet.

991
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:54,108
You've worked with her for years. How come you don't even know that?

992
01:06:54,108 --> 01:06:56,078
Wow.

993
01:06:58,172 --> 01:06:59,674
I'm... I'm sorry.

994
01:06:59,674 --> 01:07:01,150
I don't want you to be angry.

995
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:04,086
It was hard to come here, Gyeong Hwa.

996
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,490
You can't eat spicy food, Oppa.

997
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,825
Order something not spicy.

998
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:12,120
No, you like spicy food, Honey. I'm okay.

999
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,081
I'm fine, thank you, and I love you.

1000
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:17,959
Then at least order steamed eggs or your stomach will ache.

1001
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:19,168
Then instead of steamed eggs,

1002
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,628
can I have steamed Gyeong Hwa?

1003
01:07:20,628 --> 01:07:22,662
Steamy Gyeong Hwa?

1004
01:07:24,966 --> 01:07:26,134
I can't watch this anymore.

1005
01:07:26,134 --> 01:07:28,094
If you make up so easily, why get angry?

1006
01:07:28,094 --> 01:07:30,471
Why do you fight?

1007
01:07:30,471 --> 01:07:32,598
This is tiring, so annoying.

1008
01:07:32,598 --> 01:07:34,767
How many times do I need to see this?

1009
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:36,686
Yes, it's Na Gyu Rim.

1010
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,271
Right now?

1011
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:39,647
No, it's fine.

1012
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:42,115
I'll go send it right now. Bye.

1013
01:07:42,115 --> 01:07:43,651
It's better if I'm gone, right?

1014
01:07:43,651 --> 01:07:45,111
Are you going to the office?

1015
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:47,155
Team Leader Oh will regret losing this prospect.

1016
01:07:47,155 --> 01:07:50,199
I'll go tame his wavering mind.

1017
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,025
Staff dinner is over.

1018
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:58,360
Wow! I feel she resembles CEO Kang more every day.

1019
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:06,830


1020
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:08,634
Daddy!

1021
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:11,220
Oh, hello!

1022
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,638
What's up? Why are you here?

1023
01:08:12,638 --> 01:08:14,724
We got groceries, and I thought it's good timing.

1024
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:17,317
You did? Wow! Ye Rim, you are so healthy!

1025
01:08:17,317 --> 01:08:20,855
It's so nice we three can go home together.

1026
01:08:20,855 --> 01:08:22,831
So nice!

1027
01:08:28,488 --> 01:08:30,530
I'm here!

1028
01:08:31,157 --> 01:08:32,408
You're finished early today.

1029
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,910
What?

1030
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,578
Why are you so surprised?

1031
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,580
- Nothing. 
 - What is it?

1032
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,165
- It's just a book. 
 - What book?

1033
01:08:39,165 --> 01:08:40,833
What's inside?

1034
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:43,185
What is it?

1035
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,880
   

1036
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,091
I heard there's a lot to prepare with older pregnancies.

1037
01:08:50,009 --> 01:08:53,195
I wanted to research and tell you...

1038
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,420
Honey...

1039
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,870
Sorry.

1040
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:02,600
I made up my mind way too late, right?

1041
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,900
Let's give it a try.

1042
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,540
Yes.

1043
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:20,250
 ­  

1044
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:25,650
 ­  

1045
01:09:28,548 --> 01:09:29,966
Hello?

1046
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:31,883
Yes, Eun Ho.

1047
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:33,970
Which side?

1048
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:36,388
I'm almost there.

1049
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,474
 Can't you see me? 

1050
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,308
Where are you?

1051
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:44,071
There you are!

1052
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,380
Hello!

1053
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:54,040
♫  Deep into your heart  ♫

1054
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:59,540

1058
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:17,800
♫  Yes, I got to say  ♫

1059
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,660
♫  I can't control my heart  ♫

1060
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:26,970

1061
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:32,820

1062
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:39,790

1063
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:42,450
♫  If I have to say it  ♫

1064
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,490
♫  I'll say it one more time  ♫

1065
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:48,780
♫  Only you, I'll gladly show my heart  ♫

1066
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:53,570

1067
01:10:53,570 --> 01:11:00,590
♫  As I keep trying to know you, the more I'm missing  ♫

1068
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:07,080
♫  Can't help diving deep inside your heart  ♫

1069
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:12,560

1076
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:51,770
♥️  Thank you for watching "Love Scout."
