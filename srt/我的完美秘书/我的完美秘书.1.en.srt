THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS,
COMPANIES, AND PLACES

2
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,964
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,777
<i>Peter Kwon, head designer
of the racing team at Genus Motors.</i>

4
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,113
<i>The first Korean to enter
The Royal Academy of Arts in 1999.</i>

5
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>Youngest recipient
of the Auto Design Award.</i>

6
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,659
<i>The first Asian to be in charge
of design on F1 teams.</i>

7
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,536
<i>Last victory 15 years ago.</i>

8
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>Values honor before money.</i>

9
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,165
<i>Intensely ambitious. Hot-tempered.</i>

10
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,209
<i>Highly competitive
and doesn't like losing.</i>

11
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,252
<i>Emphasizes outcome over output.</i>

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,171
<i>Doesn't shy away
from aggressive altercations.</i>

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,175
<i>Where would you really be needed?</i>

14
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>National racing market stagnation.</i>

15
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,692
<i>No F1 games being held for over a decade.</i>

16
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>Genus pulling back
from the racing industry.</i>

17
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,084
<i>Don't beat around the bush
and get straight to the point.</i>

18
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,670
<i>Scratch his ego,
while raising his self-esteem.</i>

19
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>Emphasize his being number one.</i>

20
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,257
<i>Trigger his competitive drive.</i>

21
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,343
Director Kwon.

22
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,270
Hello. I'm Ji-yun Kang from Peoplez.

23
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,651
KANG JI-YUN

24
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,498
Have you had a chance
to look through my offer?

25
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,419
How bold of you
to pay me a visit all the way here.

26
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,422
But as I've mentioned before,

27
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,591
I'm not interested in finding a new job.

28
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,889
Any reason for your refusal?

29
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,562
Do you really think
that this offer is right for me?

30
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,023
It seems like
you don't know much about me.

31
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,109
I was told that your team is suffering
financial issues lately.

32
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:17,363
With that, I'm sure managment
may have concerns with your designs.

33
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,199
You're probably experiencing some
difficulties with your company.

34
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,869
Who are you to talk about…

35
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,496
And, off the record, they're signaling
for your resignation as well?

36
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,626
What are you trying to pull here?

37
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,836
You'd rather have me walk out on my own
before they fire me?

38
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,507
Even if I retire, I do it on this circuit.

39
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,721
Do you remember

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,851
how Designer Peter Kwon first started off?

41
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,276
THE 2ND AUTO DESIGN

42
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,154
How did you get a hold of this?

43
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,408
You submitted this to Auto Design
20 years ago.

44
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,245
You introduced an aerodynamic design

45
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,290
that can provide a race car experience
to even a family car.

46
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,127
And you became the youngest recipient
of the award.

47
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,546
It's all ancient history.

48
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,383
And the world has changed since.

49
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,929
That ancient concept of yours has
become the new trend for EVs.

50
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,226
BUSINESS PROPOSAL FOR
HANGUK MOTORS NEW CAR DESIGN

51
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,187
My client is preparing a new model
for their EV line.

52
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,064
Not just any model,

53
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,942
but one that'd bring innovation
to the entire brand.

54
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,780
And they're looking for someone
who can take charge of the project.

55
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,908
There's only one thing that
my client wants.

56
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,120
To be number one.

57
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:54,252
Of course, you'd have full liberty
and authority over the design.

58
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,674
I've already…

59
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,721
come too far down this road.

60
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,057
Then you're back where you started…

61
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,936
since the circuit is round.

62
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,191
Why not start from a new beginning?

63
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,903
The glory from your past won't come back.

64
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,477
Change is always scary.

65
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,901
But you'd fall behind
if you shy away from it.

66
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,655
I'll be waiting for your call.

67
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,172
<i>Innovation of urban driving!</i>

68
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,174
A space to connect with the driver.

69
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,718
Introducing Head Director of Pamir 30,

70
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,845
Mr. Peter Kwon!

71
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,797
{\an8}<i>Hanguk Motors' newest model
has been released.</i>

72
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,343
{\an8}<i>Director Peter Kwon, whose recent move
to Hanguk Motors shocked everyone,</i>

73
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:11,681
{\an8}<i>is gaining attention with his
first work of design there.</i>

74
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,853
{\an8}<i>The recently released Pamir 30,
a new line of EV</i>

75
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,982
{\an8}<i>that includes the design dynamics
of a Peter Kwon racing car</i>

76
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,609
{\an8}<i>and the advanced technology
of Hanguk Motors,</i>

77
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,988
{\an8}<i>introduces a new type of family car.</i>

78
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,419
We now have Ji-yun Kang from Peoplez
with us.

79
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,881
The more I talk with her,
the more I become interested

80
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,800
in the lives of headhunters.

81
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,012
Do you have certain criteria
when recruiting people?

82
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,806
Someone worth their buck.

83
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,852
Try putting a price tag on yourself.

84
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,354
How much am I worth?

85
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,940
Do I deserve my paycheck?

86
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,734
That's pretty vulgar.

87
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,240
Do you really believe that you can
put a price on a person's worth?

88
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,329
If it's vulgar to put a price
on yourself in a capitalist society,

89
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,331
then what is it to be not worth your buck?

90
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,504
It's a crime.

91
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,719
I'd choose being vulgar

92
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,971
over being a criminal.

93
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,408
It's not easy being the CEO
of a booming company.

94
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,119
Head to the office.

95
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,125
Who are you, miss?

96
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,963
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,840
Who are you?

98
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,218
What is going on here?

99
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,595
You gave me a scare.

100
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,357
Look at you, Kim.

101
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,234
You must have a silver tongue.

102
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,631
I'm so mortified.

103
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,925
Didn't I tell you to get me a secretary?

104
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,805
How could you mix up a car
that you ride in every day?

105
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,724
You never get confused
with recruitment candidates.

106
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,937
Candidates are my clientele
while I'm the client of my car.

107
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,814
Why would I spend my time memorizing it?

108
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,569
So, when is my secretary coming in,
Ms. Seo?

109
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,321
I wish it was that easy,

110
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,532
but we're running thin on applicants.

111
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,951
Do you have any idea how many quit
this year alone?

112
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,910
Two?

113
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,288
Three?

114
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,041
I don't have enough fingers
to count them all.

115
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,754
It makes no sense
that you can't find anyone.

116
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,047
{\an8}This is a search firm, after all.

117

{\an8}HEAD HUNTING COMPANY THAT
FINDS EMPLOYEES FOR A COMMISSION

118
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,967
{\an8}Ms. Kang,

119
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,637
The new Crack AI Developer position
has reopened.

120
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,721
What should we do?

121
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,641
Isn't that the client that was
difficult last time we worked together?

122
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,850
We need more than a month.

123
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,144
If they want to find a good candidate,
tell them to give us more time

124
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,228
and not to sign with other firms.

125
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,480
- Right away, ma'am.
- Ms. Kang!

126
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,024
{\an8}This is the updated long list
for the promotion.

{\an8}LIST OF CANDIDATES

128
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,736
{\an8}Narrow it down and share
the final draft to our clients.

129
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,614
{\an8}- Yes, ma'am.
- Ms. Kang, the checklist is on the wall.

130
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,116
Yes, we've heard a lot about you.

131
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,556
Daniel applied for the MD position
at Spring Apparel.

132
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,308
He got it!

133
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,018
We did it!

134
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,191

YANG HO-JIN,

139
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,549
<i>Yang Ho-jin, wireless team chief.</i>

140
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,635
A chief smartphone developer who started
in the semiconductor development team

141
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,763
and became the first person to lead
the wireless team at Hansu Electronics.

142
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,848
Packaging is crucial…

143
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,351
<i>A symbolic figure who grew
alongside Hansu Electronics.</i>

144
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,187
<i>From third generation devices
to fifth generation devices,</i>

145
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,148
<i>he worked on nine different series.</i>

146
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,899
There's no doubt he's managed
as a core worker.

147
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,862
{\an8}That's why our clients offered a
handsome signing bonus.

148

{\an8}SIGNING BONUS:
INCENTIVE GIVEN TO NEW EMPLOYEES

149
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:23,701
{\an8}Which also means this is a very important
project for us to succeed in.

150
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:25,995
How was it then?

151
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,289
How did he react to our offer?

152
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,041
Didn't Mr. Yang take the offer already?

153
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,920
Did you get intel on the company
that's recruiting him?

154
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,380
Well,

155
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,090
we're still looking into it.

156
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,884
That's not going to cut it.

157
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,678
Do you have any idea how many
core workers we've lost?

158
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,971
I apologize.

159
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,017
Is there anyone who can secure
Mr. Yang to stay at our company?

160
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,518
I mean, anyone?

161
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,647
Why don't you let Mr. Yu handle it?

162
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,983
You mean Manager Yu Eun-ho?

163
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:56,942
Yes.

164
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,476
Thank you.

165
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,109
Hey, isn't that the manager
you were talking about last time?

166
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,403
- He's gorgeous.
- He's totally my type!

167
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,323
How did you know
I needed caffeine? Thanks.

168
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,741
It's not for you. Get one yourself.

169
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,035
- Whose is it then?
- I'm off to see Mr. Yang.

170
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,706
Wait, wait. Does this mean that you'll
be taking on Mr. Yang?

171
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,832
Mr. Song okayed it?

172
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,501
Dude, that's not…

173
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,419
Happy now? I'm off.

174
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,089
Wait. Hey!

175
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,465
- Hello.
- He's here.

176
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,760
Hello.

177
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,681
Hello.

178
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,432
Hello.

179
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,522
Excuse me.

180
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,648
Hello.

181
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,024
Hello.

182
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,526
- Hello.
- Hello to you too.

183
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,911
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

184
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,997
Is Mr. Yang in?

185
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,416
He's on leave today.

186
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,084
- On leave?
- Yes.

187
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,171
- Is it okay if I leave a coffee for him?
- Sure.

188
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,265
HANSU RING,
FINAL CONFIRMATION TEST!

189
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,320
March 6th.

190
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,864
That's today.

191
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,419
<i>The person you are trying to reach is
unavailable. You will be forwarded…</i>

192
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,052
{\an8}HUMAN RESOURCES TEAM

193
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,472
PERSONNEL CARD

194
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,192
- Where are you off to?
- Tell the boss I'm off to see Mr. Yang.

195
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,194
You said he's not picking up his phone.
How are you planning on finding him?

196
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,862
Let's just say that I have a hunch.

197
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,781
Don't waste your time.

198
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,659
If he's meeting a headhunter on his
day off, he's through with this company.

199
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,871
Mr. Song assigned him to you to screw
with you, knowing you'd fail.

200
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,332
All the more reason to catch him.

201
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,000
Aw, come on…

202
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,253
At least tell me where you're going!

203
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,435
I'm sorry for calling you here.

204
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,645
It's nice and quiet.

205
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:23,107
It's nice to get some fresh air.

206
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,859
I'm sure you have a lot on your mind.

207
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,319
What seems to bother you the most?

208
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,699
I've worked at this company for 22 years.

209
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,494
It's not easy for people my age to take on
the challenge at another company.

210
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,454
I understand.

211
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,165
It's not easy to move jobs.

212
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,252
Especially for people who have
worked in one spot for a long time.

213
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,881
But there's no such thing
as a job for life.

214
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,384
You never know how things will change.

215
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,053
As you've seen
from this year's promotions,

216
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,640
Hansu won't be investing as much
into the hardware industry.

217
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,477
{\an8}It'll be the one who conquers APs
that'll conquer the mobile industry.

218
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,731
Consistent research in packaging
is the only answer.

219
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,734
Our client is willing to invest
in your research

220
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,486
and support you with technical aspects.

221
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,114
You don't get many chances
to focus on your research

222
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,117
where your values are appreciated.

223
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,663
These are the conditions
that our client is offering.

224
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,083
I dare say this would be the best offer
you can get in the field.

225
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,462
All we need now is your decision.

226
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,883
I'm confident that this would be
worth trying.

227
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,929
It's not what you're trying
but who you're trying with that counts.

228
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,391
Mr. Yu.

229
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,314
Pardon me for interrupting.

230
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,358
How did you know I was here?

231
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,278
I knew that you come here often
when you need to unload.

232
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,161
I'm Yu Eun-ho from Hansu Electronics.

233
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,373
My apologies
if I've interfered with anything.

234
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,294
But Mr. Yang is a valued member
of our company.

235
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,466
Continue your conversation with her.

236
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,510
But please give me a
chance to chat afterward.

237
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,595
I'll be waiting.

238
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,812
- Sir…
- Ms. Kang.

239
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,232
I think we should wrap up here
for the day.

240
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,193
Let's continue later.

241
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,153
You should at least take this.

242
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,824
As for us, let's have a chat
back at the office.

243
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,117
I'll call you.

244
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,915
Well done meddling.

245
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,334
{\an8}HR TEAM MANAGER
YU EUN-HO

246
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,836
Manager Yu Eun-ho.

247
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,341
Mr. Yang has had such an affection
for our company for decades.

248
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,467
Stop swaying him.

249
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,095
All you need to do is
pay the right price to keep him.

250
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,930
Moving to a company where

251
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,599
you can expand your career
and people recognize you.

252
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,518
That's the nature of the market.

253
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,980
Well, somethings just aren't so simple.

254
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,816
Far too delicate an issue for someone
who steals a core employee to understand.

255
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,198
I know that Mr. Yang didn't stick around
just for money.

256
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,785
There's something greater than
personal benefit or success

257
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,913
such as the value of a company,
or a thing called loyalty.

258
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,959
So cliché.

259
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,128
You'll soon experience
and come to learn that

260
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,841
the company never takes on full
accountability for the individual worker.

261
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,538
Let's not make the mistake
of running into each other again.

262
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,552
HANJU ELECTRONICS

263
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,555
Yu Eun-ho from Hansu Electronics.

264
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,487
RIBS, PORK BELLY

265
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,657
Look who's here.

266
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,909
Hurray, you came!

267
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,994
What is this?

268
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,830
Why are you all here?

269
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,457
I've brought more beer.

270
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,419
I've been waiting for you.

271
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,839
Mr. Yang finally arrived!

272
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,636
Just enjoy for the day

273
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,388
since all the development legends
are here.

274
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,141
- Please, sit.
- Come on, have a seat.

275
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,518
I'll grab more beer.

276
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,562
You'll spend the entire night away
doing that!

277
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,855
All right, fill your cups!

278
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,897
Here you go.

279
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,691
He looks so much better now.

280
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,109
All together, cheers.

281
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,528
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

282
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,741
- That hits the spot.
- Nobody goes home before me!

283
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,452
PASSION GALBI

284
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,205
Looks like your win, Mr. Yu.

285
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,708
All right.

286
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,086
Let's hear what you have to say.

287
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,089
Sir…

288
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,384
do you remember this?

289
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,597
Gosh.

290
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,931
How could I forget?

291
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,392
This is the first model I made
at the company.

292
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,561
I think it was Version 6 that you
found an error with at the last minute,

293
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,229
causing the development team
to pull an all-nighter.

294
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,232
Don't even start with that story.

295
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,359
What a nightmare that was.

296
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,321
I was afraid this little guy
wouldn't even get a chance to roll out.

297
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,489
That little guy is eight years old now.

298
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,951
You'd better make sure he lasts
throughout his teens.

299
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,879
The company still has so many stories
to write with you.

300
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,299
Complete the hardware
for the new series as well.

301
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,760
Unless your heart's in a
different place already,

302
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,179
please reconsider.

303
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,202
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang. I forgot that I had
an important meeting today.

304
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,496
Give me a sec, please.

305
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,831
Hello.

306
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,418
Of course, I'm on the way.

307
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,504
It's your first game, son.

308
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,589
Yeah, I'm almost there.
I'll be there soon.

309
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,007
Okay.

310
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,677
Let me drive you.

311
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,761
We can talk on the way.

312
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,055
Oh, would you?

313
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,144
Jeez, I…

314
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,481
I feel terrible asking you to drive,
let alone canceling our appointment.

315
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,734
I just can't afford
to further disappoint my son.

316
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,194
That's all right.

317
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,073
You should take a look
while you have time.

318
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,574
It's a new proposal.

319
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,826
Thank you.

320
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,087
My friends love the snacks you sent
from work!

321
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,171
You're the best, Dad!

322
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,298
- We love you, sir!
- Thanks for the drinks!

323
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,675
- We'll win the game!
- Thank you, love you!

324
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,884
Thanks, Dad!

325
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,262
Uncle Eun-ho!

326
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,930
You're the best uncle in the world!

327
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,181
We'll win for you, uncle!

328
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,224
We love you!

329
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,228
Hansu Electronics rocks!

330
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,192
SEOUL CITY'S YOUTH SOCCER MATCH

331
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,408
- Thank you so much, Ms. Kang.
- Not at all.

332
00:26:59,034 --> 00:26:59,993
I'll give you a call.

333
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,244
- Sure, drive safe.
- Okay.

334
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,540
Eo-jin!

335
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,834
- Dad!
- Over here!

336
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,711
Dad!

337
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,635
- Dad!
- Whew!

338
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,512
Sorry I'm late, kiddo.

339
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,018
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

340
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,293
<i>Ms. Kang. About me moving jobs,
let's call it off.</i>

341
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,510
- For Mr. Yu!
- Cheers!

342
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,346
Congratulations!

343
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,518
Congratulations!

344
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,645
Congratulations, Mr. Yu!

345
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,607
Thanks to you,
we can walk around proud for once.

346
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,984
How did you change Mr. Yang's mind?

347
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,320
He proved that sincerity works.

348
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,780
In any case, this is a big win for us.

349
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:23,451
I guess this is the end of
Eun-ho's time in the dumps!

350
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:29,290
When he gathered all of the
old developers under Mr. Yang,

351
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,459
I literally cried.

352
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,961
You're overreacting.

353
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,170
I really did.

354
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,713
Sure you did.

355
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,133
We should have another round.

356
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,093
- Yeah!
- Grab your cups, and cheers!

357
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,220
- Cheers!
- Good work, everyone!

358
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,391
Well, this is festive.

359
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,476
Very nice.

360
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,648
You know, you could use this spirit
at work.

361
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,109
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

362
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,530
You're all fussing over nothing.

363
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,409
Eun-ho didn't do this on his own.

364
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,870
Mr. Yang has got plenty on his part.

365
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,873
{\an8}We gave him a great counter offer.

366
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,666
{\an8}You lot don't know the half of it.

367
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,671
That was the bare minimum since
you've taken that much time off.

368
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,508
The rest of the members worked
their butts off while you were gone.

369
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,136
Don't tell me
you've all forgotten about it already.

370
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,137
Unbelievable.

371
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,556
Some do all the heavy lifting.

372
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,602
While others just reap all the rewards.

373
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,525
Raise your glasses. I'll pour you a round.

374
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,068
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,404
- There you go.
- Thank you.

376
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,615
No need for formalities. Here.

377
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,824
Thank you, sir!

378
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,909
There you go.

379
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:47,994
Thank you.

380
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,122
There.

381
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,668
Mr. Kim, have some.

382
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,046
Yes, sir.

383
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,427
Okay.

384
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,597
Sir.

385
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,685
I will pour you a glass.

386
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,541
Here.

387
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,251
Yes, sir.

388
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,049
Now, let's toast.

389
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,509
Okay, cheers.

390
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,510
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

391
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,846
- Good work today.
- Great work.

392
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,479
- Are you okay?
- Yes, sir.

393
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,356
Careful, sir.

394
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,821
Have a good evening, sir.

395
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,366
Hey, Eun-ho. Hey!

396
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,535
Am I being unfair?

397
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,123
You should've expected this
when you came back.

398
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,751
Don't try to swoop in
as if nothing happened.

399
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,962
I haven't even started.

400
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,340
Let's go.

401
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,592
Good night, sir.

402
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,560
He's gone. You can get up now.

403
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:40,857
You want more drinks?

404
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,569
Yeah, it's kind of late.

405
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,154
See you.

406
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,450
Yeah. Go on, man.

407
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,494
You really can't get enough of her,
can you?

408
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,119
- Hi.
- Hey, you're here.

409
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,121
- I ran a little late.
- It's okay.

410
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,749
- How's Byeol?
- She's just playing.

411
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,668
Byeol, your dad's here!
Seo-jun, uncle is here.

412
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,877
Hey, Seo-jun!

413
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,712
- Dad!
- Byeol.

414
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,589
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

415
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,760
My little princess.

416
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,596
Daddy.

417
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,765
Guys, I feel left out now.

418
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,517
I know looking after children
is a job no one appreciates,

419
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,186
but others might get the wrong idea
that I've scolded them all day.

420
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,105
No way, Granny.

421
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,108
We do appreciate you.

422
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,776
See? I don't take it for granted.

423
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,820
Thank you so much as usual.

424
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,780
There's no one like you!

425
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,240
What is it?

426
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,075
And this is for Seo-jun.

427
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,997
You must be tired. Go on up.
Take this with you.

428
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,125
It's enough that you take care of Byeol,
you don't have to cook for us as well.

429
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,086
But you pay me.
I'm just doing what I'm getting paid for.

430
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,464
Well in that case, thank you.

431
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,010
- Have a great night.
- Good night.

432
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,803
- Good night.
- Good night.

433
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,054
- Bye.
- Bye, Byeol.

434
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,180
Take your bag with you.

435
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,517
- Take care of your stuff.
- Sleep tight and see you tomorrow.

436
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,269
- See ya.
- Bye.

437
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,688
- Bye, Byeol.
- Bye-bye.

438
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,231
- Good night.
- Bye.

439
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,232
- Sweet dreams.
- Bye.

440
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,942
- See you.
- Bye.

441
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,236
Stop eating.

442
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,864
He's so sweet.

443
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,241
Yeah, he's a good dad.

444
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,411
A good father usually
becomes a good husband.

445
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,330
Oh, don't talk such nonsense.

446
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,166
Seo-jun, let's brush your teeth.

447
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,377
What do you mean nonsense?

448
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,297
It'd be perfect for two single people
to rely on each other.

449
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:16,012
I have to ask,
why does Mr. Song hate Mr. Yu so much?

450
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,140
He's the best member of the HR team.

451
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,851
You don't get to be the youngest manager
by doing nothing.

452
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,729
Is it really because
of his paternal leave?

453
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,689
That's just too old school.

454
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,857
It's ridiculous.

455
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,778
Paternity leave is just an excuse.

456
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,987
He's getting revenge.

457
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,989
Before the paternal leave,

458
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,743
they were both preparing
for renewal of the management system.

459
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,914
It was a direct order from the Chairman
so Mr. Song poured his heart into it.

460
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,793
{\an8}1 YEAR AGO

461
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,838
It's confirmed. We'll be taking over
the Human Resources System renewal!

462
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,131
- Really?
- <i>He worked so hard that</i>

463
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,716
<i>we were expecting to outrun Mr. Kim</i>

464
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,260
- Congratulations.
<i>- …And get noticed by the boss.</i>

465
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,470
<i>But…</i>

466
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,597
Let me just take this call.

467
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,433
After Mr. Yu went on paternal leave,
it all went down the drain.

468
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,936
Yes, ma'am. Is everything okay?

469
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,564
What?

470
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,494
Seo-jun's mom came today
and held an art class with the children.

471
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,954
And…

472
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,791
this is what Byeol drew.

473
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,755
Sir,

474
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,091
your daughter,

475
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,844
has rarely been talking lately.

476
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,513
Were you aware?

477
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,734
Are you out of your mind?

478
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,070
This is a direct order from the Chairman.

479
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,822
Our proposal even won against Manger Kim.

480
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,535
I'm sorry. I'll make sure to hand over...

481
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,121
You were the only reason
I pushed this project…

482
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,918
Eun-ho, I want you to reconsider.

483
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,463
You have no idea
what you're missing out on.

484
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,340
Once this is through,

485
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,010
the future's nothing but roses
for the two of us.

486
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,642
You can always go on paternal leave later.

487
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,938
Sir, actually…

488
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,941
Byeol is sick.

489
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,945
That's a pitiful excuse.

490
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,031
You think you're the only one
with a child?

491
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,949
Your kid being sick is not a big deal now.

492
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,826
It's not like your kid
is the only special kid in the world.

493
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,585
She's special to me.

494
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:55,838
Eun-ho!

495
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,216
You leave now,

496
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,634
don't even think about coming back!

497
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,471
As long as I'm here, you won't survive!

498
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,974
He was going to use Mr. Yu for the project

499
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,809
but that totally flopped.

500
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,021
And the project was passed over
to Mr. Kim.

501
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,564
Got bumped out of his promotion.

502
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,400
Jeez, that was one hell of a disaster.

503
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,987
He must've waited with gritted teeth
for revenge on Mr. Yu.

504
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:26,327
Eun-ho's life is quite hectic, isn't it?

505
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:31,540
Exactly.
Why did he have to get married so early?

506
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,460
With those looks!

507
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,505
How can his child
already be seven years old?

508
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,674
It's absurd.

509
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,634
He is so my type.

510
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,386
There she goes again.

511
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,976
How is it that we have so many girls
saying the exact same thing?

512
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,812
Eun-ho's a sly criminal, I tell ya.

513
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,939
Blame it on his face!

514
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,440
His face is guilty!

515
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,526
{\an8}YELLOW PRINCESS

516
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,157
BYEOL'S ALBUM
DAD AND BYEOL'S ALBUM

517
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,537
MY DAD IS A HERO

518
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,076
Time for breakfast, Byeol.

519
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,047
Miss Byeol,
what style would you like today?

520
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,548
Do whatever you like.

521
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,674
May I?

522
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,844
Then, number three it is.

523
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,514
You're so pretty.

524
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,099
Let's go.

525
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,482
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

526
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,154
I'm not gonna lose tomorrow.

527
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,451
Let's go! Seo-jun, wait! Seo-jun!

528
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,287
You'd better behave
in front of your teacher, okay?

529
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,663
Off you go! There!

530
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,501
Don't run in the hall! Don't run!

531
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,213
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

532
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,964
Hello.

533
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,841
Bye, Seo-jun.

534
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,135
- Bye
- Break a leg!

535
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,720
Bye, kids.

536
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,351
Woo-rim woke up early to meet Ju-mi today.

537
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,435
How diligent of him.

538
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,603
He has good taste in girls.

539
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,065
Look, look, look. Byeol's dad is coming.

540
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,942
- Where?
- Where is he?

541
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,769
- Hello.
- Hello.

542
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,273
- Hello, Mr. Yu.
- Hello.

543
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,692
Have a splendid day!

544
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,367
Hello.

545
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,785
Hello, Mr. Yu.

546
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,787
- Hi, Song-jin.
- Hello.

547
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,331
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

548
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,791
Are you okay?

549
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,128
Yes.

550
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,091
Thank you so much.

551
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,510
Thank you! See you again!

552
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,348
Are you okay?

553
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,106
I don't wanna work.

554
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,657
Good morning, everyone! Aloha!

555
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,620
What?

556
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,499
What's going on?
What's with the grim faces?

557
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,168
Tell me.

558
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,213
What's going on?

559
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:51,592
It seems Jeong-nam lied
on his candidate's résumé.

560
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,011
Oh, no.

561
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,180
I'm getting film noir vibes.
What do you guys think?

562
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,264
Why did he do that?

563
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,475
I think it's horror.

564
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,061
It's gonna get noisy today.

565
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,687
It's not my fault.

566
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,314
I swear I didn't know.

567
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,567
If you didn't know the résumé was fake,
you're incompetent.

568
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,570
If you'd known and proceeded anyway,
you're not qualified to be a headhunter.

569
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,405
Which is it?

570
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,325
Look at me, Go.

571
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,248
{\an8}GO JEONG-NAM

572
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,416
The name's Go Jeong-nam.

573
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:30,172
Fine. Honestly? If we
hadn't mentioned anything,

574
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,840
Hanguk Group would've never known.

575
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,469
It's not like
I completely fabricated the résumé.

576
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,388
It was just a bit of overstating things...

577
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,889
So you're not qualified.

578
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,059
You're the one who wanted more results.

579
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,811
You pushed and pushed for results...

580
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,271
Jeong-nam!

581
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,610
You had one achievement,
and that was two months ago.

582
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,613
It's been six months since you came.
You're still learning the ropes?

583
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,537
"Five years' experience as a headhunter.
Specialized in logistics.

584
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,707
Yearly performance, 15.
Excellent in client management."

585
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,167
Where is this guy that I hired?

586
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,255
Was this also overstated
the same way as your candidate's?

587
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,843
Mr. Go Nam-jeong!

588
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,725
It's Go Jeong-nam.

589
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,066
My name is Go Jeong-nam.

590
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,071
Go Jeong-nam.

591
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,242
Not once have you said my name properly.

592
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,787
You know what?

593
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,789
I don't work with underqualified people.

594
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,295
I won't be seeing you again.

595
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,424
Not here, nor any other search firms.

596
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,636
Ms. Seo will handle
the resignation process.

597
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,141
Oh, right, I had something to tell you…

598
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,107
Hello? Speaking.

599
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,943
Find a new candidate right away.

600
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,404
{\an8}Confirm the JD
and bring the list up again.

601
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,114
{\an8}INFO OF SKILLS REQUIRED
FOR THE POSITION

602
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,700
{\an8}Since it's your ex-team member
who screwed up,

603
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,826
you clean up after him.

604
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:29,458
That's not it at all.
Even if we take that into account...

605
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,548
I need to talk with you.

606
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,551
Okay.

607
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,153
Did you check all the candidates
on the list for the Hanguk Group?

608
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,823
I believe you're the one in charge.

609
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,118
I tend to leave it to their free will.

610
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,245
It's not like they're children.

611
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,496
One has to do one's own chores.

612
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,041
Is that why you bluffed
on the candidate's résumé?

613
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,627
To freely conduct your job?

614
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,171
I feel so bad for them.

615
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,425
How bad they must've wanted better
results to fluff up the résumé like that.

616
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,260
Don't you know that the Hanguk Group
is our main client?

617
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,096
Would you take responsibility
if we lost them because of trust issues?

618
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,099
They're looking up other search firms
when we should be their sole contractor!

619
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,351
If we don't reach our monthly goal...

620
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:33,355
If we don't reach our monthly goal,

621
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:38,944
it's because you've lost
Mr. Yang from Hansu Electronics.

622
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,822
I wonder who it was
that lost that big catch.

623
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,367
Don't scare me like that!

624
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,995
I was raised cushy.

625
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,123
You know I don't like that kind of thing.
Why do you do this to me?

626
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,375
Treat me with some cushy respect.

627
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,672
I shouldn't have hired you.

628
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,967
Money's to blame. Money.

629
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,803
But because of that
you got the investment funds you needed.

630
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,930
And I got my freedom.

631
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,391
Isn't that right, Ji-yun?

632
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,947
Ugh, how exhausting.

633
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,158
She's so difficult.

634
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,620
I wanna go home.

635
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,966
Another paper cut?

636
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,886
I told you to be careful.

637
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,679
You lost a candidate,

638
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,224
decreased sales,
and, on top of that, a paper cut.

639
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,850
Nothing's working out, huh?

640
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,853
What. Did you decide to team up with Woo?

641
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:59,816
Here. This is the revised sales plan
for the month.

642
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,195
You just might make quota
if you work hard at it.

643
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,821
Bye.

644
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,312
HR TEAM MANAGER
YU EUN-HO

645
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,192
You must be the one bringing bad luck.

646
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,619
Didn't we have a meeting at 4 o'clock?

647
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,329
Why don't you start getting ready?

648
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,456
Yes sir.

649
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,875
I've sent a mail to you.

650
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,335
Do you mind checking them?

651
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,463
Um, sir.

652
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,592
Um, Mr. Song…

653
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,927
He said that you'd be preparing
meetings from now on.

654
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,520
Hand it over. I'll do it.

655
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,355
I was the printing god
when I first started working here.

656
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,910
MONTHLY MEETING, MARCH

657
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:48,842
You can leave now, Mr. Yu.

658
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,720
You don't need to attend.

659
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,973
It's not like you have a grasp
on anything around here.

660
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,477
I'm sure you didn't have time to adjust
after coming back from your long vacation.

661
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,485
Mr. Kim. Did you set up
the TF team members yet?

662
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,695
Have you contacted
any overseas specialists?

663
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,448
Well, um.

664
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,913
If we rashly scout professionals from
abroad, we might lose our brand's image.

665
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,792
Gathering talented members from within
should prove much more effective.

666
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,170
For example, Mr. An,
senior researcher from R&D Team 2.

667
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,047
He's more qualified
in renovative projects...

668
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,090
Mr. Yu!

669
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,138
You're driving me up the wall.

670
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,309
What do you think you're doing?

671
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,312
Does it look like I wanted your opinion?

672
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,774
Give me a break.

673
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,919
He'd be much more qualified,
according to Mr. Kim.

674
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,590
And he'll carry on with the presentation.

675
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,894
Let's start the meeting.

676
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,741
Can I have double chocolate, ice blended.

677
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,076
- With lots of cream.
- Okay.

678
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,663
I'd also like a salt bun,
a streusel, and a financier.

679
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,664
Of course.

680
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,922
What are you, a child?

681
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,758
What's with all the cream?

682
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:54,551
Look who's talking.

683
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:56,970
I quit smoking.

684
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,180
I need to get married.

685
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,473
Wow, how mature of you.

686
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:04,311
You're the one who got married, a child,
and a divorce all in your twenties.

687
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,979
I need to do at least one of them.

688
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,901
Are you okay, though?

689
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,069
No, I can't take this anymore.

690
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,404
I'm resigning today.

691
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,039
You're not even gonna stop me?

692
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:25,999
Come on now.

693
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,630
Byeol's tuition, living expenses,

694
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,508
your loan, retirement savings,

695
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,219
Babysitting fees, installment savings.

696
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,221
Should I go on?

697
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,640
I'd be a crazy fool if I quit now.

698
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,725
The biggest, craziest fool.

699
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,980
Come to think of it, you really do
like to be first at everything.

700
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,191
You're the first at everything
among our peers.

701
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,068
First marriage, first baby,

702
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:56,029
first divorce, first promotion,
and first paternal leave.

703
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,907
I applaud you, really.

704
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,827
But just don't be first to be fired.

705
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,916
It's not like I did anything wrong.

706
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,960
Yet it feels like I did.

707
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,885
Hey, wait here.

708
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,268
Ms. Kang, remember the company
that you recommended last time…

709
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,063
I'll call you back.

710
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,359
Mr. Yu, how are you doing?

711
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,195
- Yes.
- I'm sort of in the middle of something.

712
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,572
Sorry, bye.

713
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,423
Haven't we gone through this
a million times?

714
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,508
No one likes their CEO staying in
the office after hours.

715
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,928
Let's go. I'm starving.

716
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,596
I don't feel like eating.

717
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,140
This is why you don't.

718
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,019
This isn't food.
How many cups of coffee is that today?

719
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,270
Why are you such a nag.

720
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,605
Is it your divine will to die out here?

721
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,898
Come on.

722
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,696
Why are you so interested in what I eat?

723
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,822
It's just a meal.

724
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,575
You need to eat properly to stay healthy

725
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:09,788
and you need to stay healthy
to keep working as the CEO

726
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,122
so that I get paid.

727
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,921
I'm still paying off my loans.

728
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,799
You can't get sick or die until then.
Okay?

729
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,805
I processed Jeong-nam's resignation.

730
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,682
Jeong-nam? You mean…

731
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:37,273
You need to cut your employees some slack.

732
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,109
And call them by their actual name.

733
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:43,363
You memorize everything about your
candidates just by looking at the résumé.

734
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,824
Why is it that you don't remember
your own employees' names?

735
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,075
Is it intentional?

736
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,785
I don't have the energy to do all that.

737
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:49,953
I'm pretty fed up as it is.

738
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,663
Geez. Okay, look.

739
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,667
You need to show interest and affection in
your employees to keep the company happy.

740
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,169
Or you'll just drive them away
and end up being alone.

741
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,297
Not everyone in the world can be like you.

742
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,967
You gotta give trust and wait a bit
even when they make a mistake.

743
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,177
Give trust and wait,
and you'll fall behind.

744
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,015
Our employees are all a mess
because you're such a softie.

745
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,684
- You're the one I need to fire.
- Kang Ji-yun!

746
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,477
I didn't open this company
to raise people.

747
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,187
Let's just do our work.

748
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,024
- Why you...
- You said you need to pay off your loans.

749
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:22,694
I'm warning you,
you'll be left all alone in the end.

750
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:23,862
I'd still have money.

751
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,155
And what are you going to do
with all that money?

752
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,033
Do I need to do anything with it?

753
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,368
With money, it's always better
the more you have.

Hey, Ji-yun.

757
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,134
Eun-ho, you really had no idea?

758
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,636
Mr. Yang went behind our back!

759
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,972
He resigned and moved
to a Chinese company!

760
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:18,977
A new project, a signing bonus,
the counter offer. He took it all!

761
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,313
He might have stalled
to get intel on the new project

762
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,982
to sell that information.

763
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,278
Find out where he's going. Hurry!

764
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:32,365
Eun-ho.
You really know nothing about this?

765
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,993
What do you mean?

766
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,619
I'm asking if you teamed up with Mr. Yang

767
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,330
and bought time for him to
gather information!

768
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:45,211
Well, if he's really gone
corporate espionage on us,

769
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,549
you'll have to take responsibility for it.

770
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,426
Brace yourself.

771
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,900
<i>The person you are trying to reach is
unavailable. Please leave...</i>

772
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,029
This is Yu Eun-ho.

773
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,114
Can you please give me a call
when you get this?

774
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,914
Ms. Kang, remember the company
that you recommended last time…

775
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,043
I'll call you back.

776
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,758
Dong-gi, can you give me the address

777
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,885
of the search firm
that tried to recruit Mr. Yang?

778
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,180
- Thanks.
<i>- Doors are opening.</i>

779
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,601
Darn it, I mixed it up again.

780
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,733
But what is he doing here?

781
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,443
Ma'am.

782
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,445
Ms. Kang!

783
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,831
Did you do it?

784
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,293
Did you get Mr. Yang to move to a Chinese…

785
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,504
Where is he now?

786
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,384
Let me get this straight.

787
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,678
You think I'm the one who
took Mr. Yang to China?

788
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,722
Don't you care about your candidates'
reputation or career whatsoever?

789
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:03,349
Is all you care about
getting your client and profiting from it?

790
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,601
Just how much are your fees?

791
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,185
Not chump change, that's for sure.

792
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,604
That's the money I get
putting their life on the line.

793
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,646
Ms. Kang!

794
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,651
If Mr. Yang moves to China now,

795
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,070
his career will be over and he won't
ever be able to come back to Korea.

796
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,489
Is this how you headhunters work?

797
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,908
- Have you no basic morals?
- Look here, Mr. Yu Eun-ho.

798
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,328
I advise you to watch your mouth.

799
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,332
<i>I'm at the airport now.</i>

800
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:30,752
<i>I'm so sorry to do this to you, Mr. Yu.</i>

801
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,589
Hey! What the…

802
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,008
I'm not done talking…

803
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:39,719
Mr. Yu Eun-ho!

804
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,347
Mr. Yu!

805
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,225
Hey!

806
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,694
No, sir.

807
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,363
I don't recommend it.

808
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,032
You need to be able to keep your career.

809
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,826
If you move to China now,
people will start to assume things.

810
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,829
I advise you not to make any decision
you'd regret as an engineer.

811
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,332
I should've listened to you, Ms. Kang.

812
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,667
<i>You need to remain strong.</i>

813
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,670
That's the only way
for another chance to com.

814
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,297
Ms. Kang, remember the company
that you recommended last time…

815
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,426
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

816
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,307
Just how much did they torment him?

817
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,229
Someone keeps ruining
the reputation of headhunters.

818
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:36,192
You can always make an excuse for moving
to another company.

819
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,987
Even rats can bite cats
when they're cornered.

820
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,323
What else can you do
when there's no way out?

821
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,283
Yes.

822
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,333
Headhunters

823
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,460
are not all the same.

824
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,338
Okay.

825
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:47,513
Mr. Yang.

826
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,432
Mr. Yang!

827
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:52,810
Mr. Yang!

828
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,033
Mr. Yang.

829
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:09,952
I'm sorry.

830
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:21,839
Mr. Yu?

831
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,224
Technology leak?

832
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,770
Maybe if I even had a look at it
could I leak it.

833
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,564
I was left out from the project.

834
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,192
I thought they needed me.

835
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,487
Turns out that I was only a traitor

836
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:46,739
who tried to move companies.

837
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:51,077
They probably thought it was better
to have me than let me go,

838
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:52,912
even if I was just wasting time.

839
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,752
I'm leaving because I want to work.

840
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,255
I can't be a freeloader
walking on eggshells all the time.

841
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:06,133
What would my son think of me?
I just couldn't do it.

842
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,763
A misunderstanding…

843
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,849
I can't help it if that's the case.

844
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:14,433
I don't…

845
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,103
have any desire to work in Korea again.

846
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,067
I'm…

847
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,695
I'm sorry.

848
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,073
I had no idea.

849
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:32,368
No. I'm sure you just did
what you were told.

850
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:37,081
I'm rather concerned.
I hope this doesn't backfire on you.

853
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,727
<i>disposable to them.</i>

854
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,814
<i>It's our fate to be tossed away
after we've been used.</i>

855
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,775
<i>New parts</i>

856
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,320
<i>are not that hard to find.</i>

857
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,079
Yeah.

858
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,456
Dude, where're you at?

859
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:24,211
The internal investigation team is here
taking computers, notes, and everything!

860
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,339
<i>What's going on?</i>

861
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,798
Did you meet Mr. Yang?

862
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,972
Mr. Yang already departed.

863
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,103
Eun-ho.

864
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,356
I think this is the work of Mr. Song.

865
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:44,982
He meant to do this.

866
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,277
He was just waiting for the chance
to get back at you.

868
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,374

01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:52,466
<i>Ms. Seo.</i>

874
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,345
Ms. Seo?

875
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:58,806
Ms. Seo!

876
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,228
It's just not right.

877
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,188
Did you double-check it
before handing it over to…

878
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,565
Ms. Seo.

879
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:10,109
- I sent it. Please check again.
- Ms. Seo.

880
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,861
- I'm sorry.
- Coming.

881
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:14,530
{\an8}WILL I EVER BE ABLE
TO GET OFF WORK?

882
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,291
There's someone here.

883
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:29,420
Ms. Seo. Last month's IT client list
that I organized, where is it?

884
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:33,632
Also Ms. Seo, you need to reprint
this month's sales report.

885
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,593
- Open up.
- I'm not Ms. Seo.

886
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:36,677
Come on, Mi-ae.

887
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,220
Ms. Seo Mi-ae.

888
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:42,641
Come on.

889
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,118
Ms. Seo.

890
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,040
Ms. Seo Mi-ae.

891
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,128
Mi-ae.

892
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:14,298
Yeah?

893
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,717
Okay.

894
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:18,886
Stop calling me.

895
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:22,181
You're driving me crazy and I can't
concentrate on any of my work.

896
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,100
What is it this time? What?

897
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,643
Where's my phone?

898
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,441
Where is it?

899
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,652
I hear it somewhere. Where is it?

900
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:36,904
- Where is it?
- It's vibrating.

901
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,493
Gosh.

902
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,705
Gosh, why is this in here?

903
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,209
Unbelievable.

904
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,713
They agreed to remove the CEO
of SP Investment Securities.

905
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,967
We have to make a move
before it goes public.

906
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,510
And as for Mr. Kim…

907
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,303
- Hey.
- Ouch!

908
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,556
Contact Mr. Kim and set up a meeting ASAP.

909
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,765
M-ae, where's my bag?

910
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,267
You bag's over there.

911
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,018
- Take it with you.
- I'll call you later.

912
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:17,111
Seriously, wow!

913
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,535
You're lucky you're so good at your job
or you'd be dead meat.

914
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:25,953
Jeez!

915
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:30,207
Wait a minute. This messes up
her whole schedule for the day.

916
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,210
Oh, fun.

917
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:35,254
Oh, the joy.

918
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,843
Anybody free today?

919
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:43,804
It has to be today.

920
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,222
We have got to meet up today.

921
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:46,849
I mean it, today!

922
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:49,185
Yeah, we definitely have to meet up today.

923
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,402
No one's here, I see.

924
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,363
I guess I'm not going home again today.

925
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,911
My lovely dear Ms. Kang.

926
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,134
Kyung-hwa, put your head on straight.

927
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,490
Geez.

928
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:55,918
GREAT WORK, JI-YUN
MI-AE

929
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,213
Ms. Kang,
let's not change your schedule this time.

930
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:00,631
I beg of you.

931
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:06,053
Oh, what are you doing back?

932
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,389
- I have some files I need to check.
- No.

933
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,183
You look like a zombie. Go home!

934
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,936
Eat something nice, get some sleep.

935
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,104
Do what people do.

936
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,189
Do what ordinary people do.

937
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,899
You wanna look at the files with me?

938
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,694
Ms. Kang, good night.

939
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,071
See you.

940
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:26,740
Must've caught something.

941
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,450
Gosh, my throat.

942
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,704
Seems like I can't tonight.

943
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,622
It's out of my hands now.

944
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:45,718
Ji-yun!

945
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,721
{\an8}EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

946
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:54,935
Ms. Kang.

947
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:55,978
- Oh my.
- Who are you?

948
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:57,855
I'm so sorry.

949
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,443
Ms. Kang… isn't here.

950
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,403
I'm sorry.

951
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,113
Where is she?

952
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,868
Kim Ha-na? That's not it.

953
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:12,953
This one's empty.

954
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,539
Kang Ji-yun.

955
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,374
Kang Ji-yun!

956
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,837
Huh? Ms. Seo?

957
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:23,547
What happened?

958
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,343
What are you doing here?

959
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,764
Let me take a look.
They told me you collapsed.

960
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,098
You seem fine to me.

961
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,850
Stop overreacting. I'm okay.

962
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,896
- Ms. Kang Ji-yun?
- Yes?

963
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,314
- The doctor's ready to see you now.
- Thank you.

964
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:43,567
Her brain?

965
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,027
Overloaded?

966
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,195
In simple terms,

967
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,822
this one has overworked itself

968
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:51,033
and is protesting to its owner to stop.

969
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:52,868
Protest?

970
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:54,328
Why is it so weak?

971
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,954
Is it okay for a brain to be that fragile?

972
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:59,208
It's not fragile. You've just overused it.

973
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,585
The stress overloaded your brain

974
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:03,796
causing your autonomous nerve system
to show abnormalities.

975
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:07,007
Have you ever confused names,

976
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,926
forgotten to do things,

977
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:11,178
or said things you didn't mean?

978
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:12,888
Do these sound familiar?

979
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:13,972
Totally.

980
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,516
You were probably experiencing insomnia.

981
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,142
Wow, she's spot on.

982
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,061
All that was because you were sick?

983
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,313
Don't get stressed
and reduce your workload.

984
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:25,609
What about me?

985
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:26,777
Am I not suffering from brain overload?

986
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,696
I'm worst when it comes
to getting stressed.

987
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,614
Stay seated.

988
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:34,118
- You know how serious it is.
- Sure. We'll talk later. Sit down.

989
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:36,412
- Total overload.
- Okay, sit. We're at the hospital.

990
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,293
{\an8}DODAM BOOK STORE

991
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,588
She didn't move an inch today.

992
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,007
It's been three hours.

993
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,259
Let her be.

994
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:54,054
That's her only stress-coping mechanism
ever since high school.

995
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,806
Let her unload.

996
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,809
Is her physical condition okay?

997
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:00,769
I'd say she was due.

998
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,564
She's handling all that schedule
without a secretary.

999
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,941
There's no way she could handle it.

1000
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,110
And you still haven't found a secretary.

1001
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:09,570
No, not yet.

1002
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,697
I just can't find a person
who we can trust.

1003
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,910
You know how picky she is.

1004
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:20,497
Aren't you supposed to be
talking behind my back?

1005
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,291
Oh, you could hear that?

1006
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,377
I'm off. You can talk trash
all you want about me.

1007
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,671
Already? Let's have dinner together.

1008
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,299
I don't have any interest in becoming
a third wheel.

1009
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:32,050
You won't be a third wheel.

1010
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,846
We were invited to a friend's house.
Great at cooking.

1011
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:38,265
- Join us.
- Yeah, come with.

1012
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:40,976
You know I don't care for that. See you.

1013
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:56,700
Hold it, please.

1014
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,040
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

1015
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,295

<i>Doors are closing.</i>

1017
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:52,297
<i>Going up.</i>

1018
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:56,426
<i>What the heck?</i>

1019
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,595
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

1020
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,535
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

1021
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:27,624
<i>Going up.</i>

1022
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:44,600
Good morning, ma'am.

1023
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:45,767
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1024
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,102
- Hi.
- Hello.

1025
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,440
You're here.

1026
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,486
You walked in together with him.

1027
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:58,238
Eun-ho!

1028
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:56,213
I want you to meet our CEO,
Ms. Kang Ji-yun.

1029
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:01,927
How do you do?

1030
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,554
I'm Yu Eun-ho.

1031
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:12,813
Say hi. He's your new secretary,
Mr. Yu Eun-ho.

1032
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,316
- My secretary?
- Yup.

1033
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:24,282
It's a fine morning, Ms. Kang.

{\an8}Why is he my secretary?

1036
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:14,124
{\an8}<i>- Why do you hate Eun-ho so much?</i>
- Coffee?

1037
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:15,375
{\an8}<i>He's my secretary.
I should be comfortable around him.</i>

1038
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,710
{\an8}<i>I just don't like him.</i>

1039
01:19:16,793 --> 01:19:18,837
{\an8}- Am I fired?
- No, no.

1040
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,090
{\an8}<i>Keep an eye on all sides of her
whenever she's on the move.</i>

1041
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,675
{\an8}<i>Is that clear?</i>

1042
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,636
{\an8}<i>So, you'd really do it?
You'll be my secretary?</i>

1043
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,054
{\an8}<i>Mr. Yu Eun-ho?</i>

1044
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:29,806
{\an8}<i>Let's stop wasting our time.</i>

1045
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,851
{\an8}<i>I hate wasting my energy
on things like these.</i>

1046
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:35,103
{\an8}I'm willing to do everything you ask for.

1047
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,188
{\an8}<i>So…</i>

1048
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,649
