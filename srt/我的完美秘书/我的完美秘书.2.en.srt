00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,964
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,263
I guess it's okay for you
to stop coming here, Byeol.

4
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,598
You're good to go.

5
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,641
- Really?
- Yes, really.

6
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,019
You did so well.

7
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,896
Would you go and play with your teacher
for a while?

8
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,648
Let's go outside, Byeol.

9
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,154
Um…

10
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,947
Is she really okay?

11
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,991
Yes.

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,077
It may not be a complete recovery,

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,621
but her mental state is quite healthy.

14
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,665
I think we can stop with her therapy.

15
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,046
And I have a present for you.

17
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,967
Thank you for focusing on her for a year.

00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,065

21
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,324
Uncle Kang-seok!

22
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,746
Long time no see, Byeol.

23
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,331
Did you go to therapy today?

24
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,125
Yes, and they said
I don't need to go there again!

25
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,710
Oh, really?

26
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,298
Well, that calls for celebration.

27
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,717
You can choose any book here.

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,427
- It'll be my gift.
- Really?

29
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,474
Congratulations.

30
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,642
You deserve it.

31
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,687
Now all you need to do is
take care of your work problem.

32
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,397
Are you applying?

33
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,316
I'll have to spend more time...

34
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,233
Geez.

35
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,526
It's fine.

36
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,486
You okay, Byeol?

37
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,365
I wonder where you got that greed from.

38
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,700
Fine, it's all yours.

39
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,119
Uncle, let's celebrate at home.

40
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,787
Shall we?

DODAM BOOK STORE

42
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,921
He divorced before Byeol was a year old?

43
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,381
He has raised that girl alone?

44
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,926
Pretty much. He went through a lot.

45
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,678
He's competent and hardworking.

46
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,182
That's why I wanted to take Ji-yun with us
to introduce her to Eun-ho.

47
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,185
I feel bad about delivering bad news
when he's invited us for dinner.

48
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,562
Why? Is there no position at your company?

49
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,814
Can't you do something about it?

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,442
There are no open positions
in the HR department yet.

51
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,236
Disciplinary termination is an issue,

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,446
and the general manager who got him fired

53
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,740
{\an8}seems to be going around,
meddling with all the reference checks.

54
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,867
{\an8}Is it that important?

55
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,993
{\an8}Yeah.

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,663
{\an8}There's nothing more definitive than
what your former colleagues say about you.

57
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,166
It does affect us when a former boss
intentionally bad-mouths our candidates.

58
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
Can't you do something about it?

59
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,670
I'll vouch for him.

60
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,048
It's funny how you're so protective
when it comes to him.

61
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,425
- Were you like this in college as well?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,919
How is it going?

63
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,259
{\an8}It's that house at the end.

64
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,762
{\an8}Yeah? Wow, cherry blossoms have bloomed.

65
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,349
Here we are.

66
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,435
- Huh?
- What's this?

67
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,519
DEAR MR. DELIVERY MAN,
PLEASE HELP YOURSELF, THANK YOU

68
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,688
This is so thoughtful.
Take a look at this.

69
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,900
- Maybe I'll have one.
- Sure. If you were a delivery guy.

70
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,577
Just look at that cherry blossom.
It's so beautiful.

71
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,911
They're in full bloom.

72
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,123
- Welcome, you two.
- Hello.

73
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,791
- Come on in.
- Thanks for having us.

74
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,254
It's an honor to finally meet
Kang-seok's wife.

75
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,630
I've been meaning to see you for so long.

76
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,633
I know, right?
I heard so much about you as well.

77
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,510
- Look who we have here.
- Hello.

78
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,304
- Hello.
- Hi, Byeol.

79
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,221
This is for you.

80
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,098
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

81
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,311
- I love how lovely and sweet your home is.
- Wow.

82
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,190
You said it was a simple dinner party.
This isn't simple at all.

83
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,942
What, this is normal for us.
You've seen it before.

84
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,027
- Have I?
- Have a seat.

85
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,904
So I have.

86
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,822
- Please, make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

87
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,366
You must have been cooking all day.

88
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,493
It was no trouble.

89
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,411
This is such a fancy spread.

90
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,496
Wait.

91
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,124
Hey. Yeah?

92
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,001
Help me out here, I really am desperate.

93
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,461
Can't you find a good secretary?

94
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,213
Your soybean soup is ready.

95
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,423
We need someone
who understands our industry.

96
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,467
It'd be best if they had experience
in human resources.

97
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,386
Someone who is organized and spotless.

98
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,068
Yeah.

99
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,404
Schedule management is crucial.

100
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,865
FREEZER, FRIDGE, CABINET

101
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,873
Perfect if they have a good memory
and common sense to boot.

102
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,167
Oh, and most importantly,

103
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,587
it should be someone who can handle
Ms. Kang, who's known to be a mess.

104
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,157
A person like that surely wouldn't have
any HR experience, right?

105
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,576
Let me call you back later.

106
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,955
JOB APPLICATION

107
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,790
MANAGER AT HANSU ELECTRONICS

108
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,041
DEPARTMENT:
HR DEVELOPMENT TEAM

109
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,301
Jackpot.

110
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,471
- My secretary?
- Yup.

111
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,060
It's a fine morning, Ms. Kang.

112
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
Just wait there for a minute.

113
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,706
Explain yourself. What happened?
Why is he here?

114
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,875
I told you, he's your new secretary.

115
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,002
So tell me why. Why is he my secretary?

116
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,463
He checks all of our boxes perfectly.

117
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,672
Do you have any idea who he is?

118
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,343
He is a former human resources manager
at Hansu Electronics.

119
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,012
He has a working knowledge
of human resources, is well organized,

120
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,306
and exceptionally good at managing
troublemakers like you.

121
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,266
As for personality, my husband can vouch.

122
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,144
So, is there anything else
you want to know?

123
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,104
I don't need a rundown.

124
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,983
Well, he's the perfect candidate.
He's more than qualified.

125
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,401
Don't overreact.

126
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,656
I've worked in a search firm
as an accountant for five years.

127
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,158
With his record,
he should be music to your ears.

128
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,869
I've got an eye
for spotting good people too, you know.

129
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,871
So, trust my judgment
and take him as your secretary.

130
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,581
- Got that?
- Yeah, no thanks.

131
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,127
Why? Give me a reason.

132
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,008
That's the guy. Yu Eun-ho.

133
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,218
Yes, he's Eun-ho.

134
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,471
I'm saying he's the one
who screwed me over.

135
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,348
Mr. Yang's case!

136
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,686
That means he's super competent! Hot damn!

137
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,322
KANG JI-YUN, CEO

138
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,159
<i>So the CEO that you're referring to…</i>

139
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,869
is Kang Ji-yun of Peoplez?

140
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,293
That was quick.
Her reputation precedes her, huh?

141
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,544
But you know what?

142
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,964
She isn't as bad as they say.

143
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,591
Sure, she may be demanding.

144
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,426
I do admit that,

145
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,344
but I promise it'll help your career.

146
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,599
You'll get a chance to see
all kinds of people and positions.

147
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,310
It'll extend your capabilities
in human resources.

148
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,645
There are things you can't see
unless you're working from the inside.

149
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,772
Six months.

150
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,941
All I'm asking is help us for six months.

151
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,320
I promise I'll help you transfer
to anywhere you want to go.

152
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,405
Broaden your experience here

153
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,907
and move to a better place.

154
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,909
How can you say that for certain?

155
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,668
Your daughter.

156
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,796
I can guarantee time to spend with her.

157
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,966
Sweety, wouldn't it be nice
if you can spend more time with your dad?

158
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,594
Yes. But…

159
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,764
I like it when Dad comes home early,

160
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,350
but I also want him
to get me more of those.

161
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,643
What?

162
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,069
- Would that be possible?
- Byeol, that's...

163
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,945
I'll raise your salary by fifty percent!

164
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,282
Fifty percent?

165
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm sure I can do that.

166
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,081
Daddy. She's got my vote.

167
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,932
There has been some kind of mistake.

168
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,142
We can't hire you.

169
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,232
For everything that happened…

170
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,525
I mean, I'm so sorry

171
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,693
for everything I said that day.

172
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,362
I heard everything from Mr. Yang.

173
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,123
I'll do my best if you give me the chance.

174
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,046
So you really want to work here?

175
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,841
As my secretary? You?

176
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,301
Yes.

177
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,932
Do you have any idea
what we do around here?

178
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,519
We steal away core talent

179
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,563
and cause massive turmoil in companies.

180
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,815
Are you okay with that?

181
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,276
Oh, that's right.

182
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,029
What was it that you said?
We have no morals here?

183
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,326
What I said that day…

184
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,681
The plant's dead.

185
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,869
Are you looking for…

186
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,400
Can you believe how stiff she is?

187
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,236
Are you okay?

188
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,905
- Am I fired?
- No, no.

189
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,490
I know her well.

190
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,783
You have nothing to worry about.

191
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,035
- Your willingness is what counts.
- But…

192
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,579
You're the only one I'll accept.
So, can you handle it?

193
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,666
You have to. Please, say yes.

194
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,335
The condition still remains, right?

195
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,922
I swear on my husband's name.

196
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,760
And I with Byeol's.

197
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,145
Okay, everyone.
Can I have your attention for a second.

198
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,439
I want to introduce someone.

199
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,735
This is Yu Eun-ho,
who'll be joining us today.

200
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,071
He'll be taking on
the role of Ms. Kang's secretary.

201
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,949
It wasn't easy to scout him.

202
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,909
So please help him adjust.

203
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,327
Give him a hand!

204
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,582
Finally, we're saved.

205
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,669
Thank you so much for the warm welcome.

206
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,963
I'm Yu Eun-ho. Nice to meet you.

207
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,219
Kwang-hee, what is it this time?

208
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,930
Come on, you know how it is.
Old school is back these days.

209
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,349
It was hard getting my hands on this.

210
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,853
But Mr. Yu's face is a work of art.

211
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,104
Unbelievable.

212
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,522
It automatically picks him up.

213
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,566
I'm not doing anything,
it's the camera that's tracking him.

214
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,402
Ms. Seo, why don't you
give a brief introduction?

215
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,570
- Shall I?
- Okay, go.

216
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,073
{\an8}He's consultant Young-soo Kim,
Manager-level.

217
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,661
{\an8}Seek your life and you will lose it.
Risk your life and you will earn it.

218
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,539
Here's my business card.

219
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,919
Now, why would a handsome guy like you

220
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,797
make the mistake of working
as the secretary…

221
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,882
I mean, good job!

222
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,467
Real smart.

223
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,720
I hope to see you in the office
for a long time.

224
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,513
I'll try my best.

225
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,223
Take this with you.

226
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,308
COFFEE, MOCHA GOLD MILD

227
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,601
Thank you.

228
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,728
It's an SCE.
You know what an SCE is, right?

229
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,480
You don't?

230
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,357
He doesn't know.

231
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,985
Looks like he's learned
something new again.

232
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,487
So what's it mean?

233
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,616
"Small but Certain Embezzlement."

234
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,703
It's not SCH which is for happiness.
SCE. Embezzlement.

235
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,957
It's funny, right, Kyung-hwa?

236
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,584
This one's hilarious, for sure. Funny.

237
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,752
HILARIOUS

238
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,754
- Thanks, Kyung-hwa.
- That was so funny.

239
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,175
{\an8}You better get used to it.
It's the only way.

240
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,844
{\an8}This is consultant Na Gyu-rim.
She's an assistant manager.

241
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,723
Welcome to our company.

242
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,936
{\an8}Our boss is super awesome.

243
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,729
{\an8}This is consultant Oh Kyung-hwa.

244
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,272
{\an8}She's my role model.

245
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,275
It's nice to meet you.

246
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,860
It's nice to meet you too.

247
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,197
This will help you.

248
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,574
- Thank you.
- Break a leg!

249
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,036
THE COURAGE TO BE HATED

250
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,038
- And this is...
- Ms. Seo, stop.

251
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,623
Stop. Allow me.

252
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,918
Let me introduce myself.

253
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,712
{\an8}I'm consultant Lee Kwang-hee.

254
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,674
{\an8}- Nice to meet you.
- Just one more thing, if I may add.

255
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,427
It's a bit personal but may I?

256
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,970
Run while you can.

257
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,972
- Run?
- Yes, run away.

258
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,104
Where did you get this? It's super rare.

259
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,566
I noticed as you walked in.

260
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,317
You have great fashion sense.

261
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,445
Um…

262
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,115
May I call you bro?

263
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,158
- I'd like to.
- Good morning!

264
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,243
Ciao, hi, aloha!

265
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,120
Ciao, hi, aloha.

266
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,496
- Come here.
- He's always high-strung.

267
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,789
Hey, you!

268
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,458
Go say hi.

269
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,260
Are you all right?

270
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,928
Who…

271
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,598
You're a new face.

272
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,144
He's Ms. Kang's secretary, Mr. Yu Eun-ho.

273
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,775
You seem like a sturdy guy.

274
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,401
I guess I can leave her at your hand.

275
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,821
Pass!

276
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,826
Hi. Let's go that way.

277
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,247
Let's get to work now.

278
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,290
Let's work!

279
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,292
Let's get to work!

280
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,759
Sorry to make you come all the way.

281
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,552
We're in training season now.

282
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,554
So I spend more time here
than at headquarters.

283
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,681
I'm happy to be here.

284
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,684
It's a good thing when the person
I recommended is doing a great job

285
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,686
and is willing to work with us again.

286
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,731
I'm the one who's grateful.

287
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,483
You're the reason
I got to move to a better place

288
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,318
and was able to offer more work to you.

289
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,487
Thank you for giving us the chance.

290
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,489
What position are you looking for?

291
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,702
There's one thing
that my CEO had long dreamt of doing.

292
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,791
A PROPER FOUNDATION
CREATES PATHWAYS

293
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,046
<i>To build a high-rise landmark
that embraces his vision.</i>

294
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,883
<i>To introduce a landmark
that represents Korea to the world.</i>

295
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,344
<i>That's the dream that
he's had for three decades</i>

296
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,555
<i>ever since he opened Selim Bakery.</i>

297
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,433
<i>He's finally ready
to make that dream come true.</i>

298
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,102
I saw his interview.

299
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,479
- Has he gotten approval?
- Yes.

300
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,608
The Selim Group will construct
the highest building in Asia.

301
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:16,155
We're looking for someone to be in charge
of planning on this project.

302
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,656
And I want you to find that person.

303
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,035
The project will be monumental
in both construction time and cost.

304
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,537
Once you find the right person,

305
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,124
Peoplez will also be organizing
the entire team as well.

306
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,920
- Are you up to the task?
- Absolutely.

307
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,047
After all, isn't that why you chose me?

308
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,468
RÉSUMÉ

309
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,194
{\an8}Yeah. Don't just rely on the database,
conduct an outside search as well.

310
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,154
{\an8}Sort out all the famous landmarks

311
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,364
{\an8}and list every architect and company
that was involved.

312
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,743
Also find out how they managed
from planning to construction.

313
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,914
Yes. Since they trusted us this much,

314
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,415
we better make it worthwhile.

315
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,459
Okay.

316
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,797
You look pleased with yourself.

317
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,351
We're not happy seeing each other,
let's skip the formalities.

318
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,067
I'm not wearing these shoes again.

319
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,652
Don't blame the shoes.

320
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,987
I heard you were losing
a lot of candidates.

321
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,405
You should at least save money on shoes.

322
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,783
Oh, I get it now.

323
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,867
You were broke.

324
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,536
I was wondering why you'd push
your candidates to move companies

325
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,080
despite suffering reputational damage.

326
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,749
Was your overpriced commission not enough?

327
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,877
That's why you're never number one.

328
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,463
The higher the risk,
the better the output.

329
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,258
How much longer will you
keep developers trapped in Korea?

330
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,093
Let them swim in larger waters.

331
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,180
And you're satisfied being on top
with that mind-set?

332
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,599
It's because of your lousy work ethic

333
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,560
that we're treated
like cheap real estate agents.

334
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,938
Be smart about the jobs you take,
while staying classy.

335
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,650
We don't choose who we work with.
We create them.

336
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,527
I thought I taught you better.

337
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,779
That's not how I raised you.

338
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,906
Raised me?

339
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,744
I've never had anybody raise me
in my entire life.

340
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,206
- I'm a self-made woman.
- That's what every kid thinks.

341
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,833
Cheeky.

342
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,837
How are you sleeping? Getting enough?

343
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,089
You know, I pray every night

344
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,966
for your destruction.

345
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,635
When you do, I'll find a job for you.

346
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,973
That's your problem.

347
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,435
You're always greedy for the impossible.

348
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,688
Just like before.

349
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,483
To be greedy for it is to achieve it.

350
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,029
Try to keep up.

351
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,553
I like it. Looks classy.

352
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,432
Ma'am, what about the ones you wore here?

353
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,146
Throw them away.

354
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,648
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,777
We were one step behind.

356
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,863
For smooth results, work should be done
with the best, not with connections.

357
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,201
Keep track of Kang's whereabouts
for a while.

358
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,285
Yes, ma'am.

359
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,413
No, we don't.

360
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,043
It's just that,
based on the needs of our client,

361
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,838
some things may need to be adjusted.

362
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,964
Yes.

363
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,717
That's right.

364
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,637
The results were lower than expected.

365
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,931
A little less than seven percent.

366
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,226
- Hello, Ms. Kang.
- Hello, ma'am.

367
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,022
Ms. Kang.

368
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,506
Didn't you see Mr. Yu?

369
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,592
- Greet people if you see them.
- Who?

370
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,885
I didn't see anyone.

371
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,763
Mr. Yu! He came into work starting today!

372
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,348
Mr. Yu?

373
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,975
What are you trying to pull?

374
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,729
Did you really forget?

375
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,900
Do you remember who I am? What's my name?

376
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,321
Come on, what's my name?

377
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,698
Hurry up and tell me.

378
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,867
Give me a second, I'm thinking.

379
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,163
- The CEO…
- Me? CEO?

380
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,876
The CEO's friend who dared hire a guy
that she hated and refused multiple times.

381
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,796
Darn you.

382
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,966
- I thought your condition was worsening.
- It's about to.

383
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,552
My stress level is skyrocketing
due to someone who constantly disobeys me.

384
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,054
So your plan is to ignore him?

385
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,515
You didn't listen to me.
I'm gonna do whatever I want.

386
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,643
Don't you have work to do?

387
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,022
I do.

388
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,106
Mr. Yu.

389
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,154
Is there anything you need to tell me?

390
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,409
You need to listen to me very carefully.
Okay then.

391
00:24:55,452 --> 00:25:00,498
<i>The first step is to recognize
who her main clients and candidates are.</i>

392
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,002
<i>She hates being slow,
not remembering things, and being clumsy.</i>

393
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,671
<i>You need to be ready to answer
any information she asks</i>

394
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,549
<i>whenever, wherever you're asked.</i>

395
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,992
<i>She absolutely can't tolerate</i>

00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,037
<i>inefficient meeting schedules
and being late to appointments.</i>

397
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,163
<i>Never forget that.</i>

398
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,248
<i>Daily schedule check</i>

399
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,626
<i>as well as newspaper scrap check is

00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,712
<i>Check again at 1 p.m.

00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,508

00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,849
<i>CEO Yu, project planner…</i>

404
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,535
Yes!

How come…

408
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,708
Oh no.

409
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,045
Every document must be stapled
in a 45-degree angle, diagonally.

410
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,838
I know it's weird. But still,

411
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,924
staples should always be diagonal
at 45 degrees.

412
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,634
Exactly 45 degrees.

413
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,261
There you go.

414
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,141
Keep up the good work.

415
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:36,279
<i>Coffee must be from the fourth café

One, two, three!

One, two, three!

420
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,695
I'm sorry.

421
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,397
Your coffee…

422
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,629
<i>Keep an eye on all sides of her
whenever she's on the move.</i>

423
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,714
Is that clear?

424
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,111
Ms. Kang, your bag.

425
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,964
Yes.

426
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,051
Yes, I'll stop by your office right now.

427
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,511
Okay.

428
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,371
It doesn't work well.

429
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,169
- Good morning.
- Hello.

430
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,548
- Let me do it.
- Put it down.

431
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,466
You'll break it.

432
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,886
Don't do that.
We might have to fix it again.

433
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,971
Really, stop.

434
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,896
First, organize by candidates
and the type of companies they worked for.

435
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,648
And make your input here.

436
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,776
- You're good at that.
- You're amazing.

437
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,197
I used this all the time
when I worked in HR.

438
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,949
Convenient, isn't it?

439
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,246
How did you manage core candidates?

440
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,667
Generally speaking, categorize
ones from grad school or an MBA

441
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,379
or ones that have been interns overseas
from high-profile companies.

442
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,237
<i>And most importantly, the smile</i>

443
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,240
<i>should never be shown.</i>

444
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,491
<i>She says she hates it.</i>

445
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,163
Daddy.

446
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,710
You've done well.

447
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,092
WELL DONE

448
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,189
KORA, THE KING OF CUTTING LINES

RAINBOW BINGSU

450
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,499
You shouldn't be doing this.

451
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,793
What the heck. You scared me.

452
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,128
Don't you have pride as an author?

453
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,838
You shouldn't be doing this yourself.

454
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,433
Wow, picture books!

455
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,185
- So you're looking for a picture book?
- Yeah.

456
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,814
This is a popular book called
<i>Rainbow Bingsu</i> by Jung Su-hyeon.

457
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,108
Take this and ask your dad
to read it to you.

458
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,025
Okay.

459
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,569
- Thank you.
- Off you go.

460
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,447
- Bye.
- Daddy!

461
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,742
Let's go.

462
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,376
Be bold if you're
going to pull something like that.

463
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,295
What would you know
about being a nameless author?

464
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,425
I'm not one of these people who gets their
book displayed all over the bookstore.

465
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,885
What's with this drawing?
I like yours much better.

466
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,679
Gee, thanks. How comforting to know.

467
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,141
You know what?
Byeol only reads your books.

468
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,144
So try your best and become a bestseller.

469
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,605
Byeol wanted me to get this book for her.

470
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,691
- This one?
- Yeah.

471
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,900
- Did she?
- Yup.

472
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,279
Who does she take after
with all that honesty?

473
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,615
By the way, you seem like
you're enjoying your new job.

474
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,867
I see you getting off work early,

475
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,035
having time to visit
the bookstore and all.

476
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,745
Yeah, it's nice. Everyone is good to me,

477
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,954
except for my boss.

478
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,164
Huh?

479
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,457
Aren't you her secretary?

480
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,499
I am.

481
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,377
My point exactly.

482
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,089
SECRETARIAL PROCEDURES
HOW TO BE LOVED BY THE BOSS

483
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,303
Good luck.

484
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:18,848
<i>Ms. Seo.</i>

485
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,391

00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,517
Ms. Seo!

487
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,020
Ms. Seo!

488
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,773
Ms. Seo!

489
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,818
Director Seo Mi-ae!

490
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,992
If you need anything, ask me…

491
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,661
There you are.

492
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,455
Here I thought you were having
hearing issues.

493
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,459
Exactly.
What ever could you possibly need me for?

494
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,003
The final meeting between
The Focus Building and the Selim Group

495
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:49,921
is confirmed.

496
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,340
{\an8}- Really?
- Now all we need is to give an offer.

497
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,051
{\an8}Get any reference material
you can get your hands on.

498
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,511
And set up a date for the final meeting.

499
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,887
- All right.
- Also,

500
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,972
I need my temperature-perfect coffee.

501
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,516
I could get it…

502
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,853
Wait just one minute, please.

503
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,732
Kang Ji-yun, I have had it with you.

504
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,651
I have had it with your stubbornness.

505
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,363
I chose that guy for you and your health.

506
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,156
How much longer will you keep this act up?

507
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,117
Why do you hate Eun-ho so much?

508
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,409
Everyone likes him except you.

509
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,287
I just don't.

510
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,705
He's my secretary.
I should be comfortable around him.

511
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,790
I just don't like him.

512
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,583
Okay.

513
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,087
When you're the only one who says no
while everyone else is saying yes,

514
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,297
then you need to ask yourself
if you're the problem.

515
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,342
Nope. I've always taken
the path less traveled.

516
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,100
Henceforth, your secretary is Mr. Yu,
not me.

517
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,018
If you need any help, ask him.

518
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,020
If you don't like it,
then do everything yourself.

519
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,022
That'll wear you out nice and flat.

520
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,859
Overload your brain and end up
in the hospital again, why don't you?

521
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,154
Go ahead, do it.
It's already getting me excited.

522
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,563
SUPPLY ROOM

523
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,097
You haven't gone home yet?

524
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,308
Is something wrong?

525
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:14,440
{\an8}I have a report of the salaries and
conditions of Selim's C-level employees.

526
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,859

00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,878
I'll get it for you.

530
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,422
Mr. Yu.

531
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,467
Let's talk.

THE COURAGE TO BE HATED

533
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,365
Let's stop wasting our time.

534
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,367
You persevering, me ignoring,

535
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,494
it's all so useless.

536
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,122
I hate wasting my energy
on things like these.

537
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,251
What is it that you don't like about me?

538
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,837
If I lack in any way as a secretary

539
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,463
or have made any mistakes

540
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,548
just let me know.

541
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,799
- But if that's not the case...
- I

542
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,844
want to work with someone
who at least respects what I do.

543
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,141
What do you think a headhunter is?

544
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,269
Is this how you headhunters work?

545
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,520
Have you no basic morals?

546
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,897
Is all you care about
getting your client and profiting from it?

547
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,441
Look here, Mr. Yu Eun-ho.

548
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,113
I think I've made my point clear now.
You may go.

549
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,157
I'll start over without any prejudice.

550
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,450
You can teach me.

551
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,538
I don't have any other choice but here.

552
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,546
I really apologize
for what I said that day. Ms. Kang.

553
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,009
I've built a long career
in the HR department.

554
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,428
I'm willing to do everything you ask for.

555
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,472
So,

556
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,016
judge me only as a secretary.

I'm on my way now,
it won't take more than 30 minutes.

576
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,391
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

577
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,593
Hey, Mom. I'm almost there.

578
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,720
- How are the kids?
- <i>They're at the playground.</i>

579
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,599
<i>Byeol's father came early
and is now stuck with them.</i>

580
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,393
They must be happy.

581
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,937
Okay, I'll go in with them.

582
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,146
Bye.

583
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,689
Are you ready?

584
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,859
One, two, three!

585
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,822
Tickle time if you get caught!

586
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,577
Ow, my head! Run!

587
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,745
I'm gonna catch you!

588
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,871
I won't let you!

589
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,751
I'm gonna get you, Byeol!

590
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,763
I got you!

591
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,723
No, Uncle!

592
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,475
- I'm an airplane!
- Can't catch me!

593
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,599
Seo-jun! Byeol!

594
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,808
Auntie!

595
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,853
- Come here, my babies!
- Mom!

596
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,689
Were you kids having fun?

597
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,275
Were you bugging Uncle Eun-ho?

598
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,735
- Yeah.
- Yes, we were.

599
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,278
Wanna bother him a bit more?

600
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,698
- Hey.
- It's Uncle.

601
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,037
Oh, my legs.

602
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,623
Go torment him more. Hurry!

603
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,167
They've gotten even more energetic!

604
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,251
Come here!

605
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,879
So we beat Daddy like ten times.

606
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,088
Really?

607
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,090
That's why I'm carrying you.

608
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,675
He really sucks at Red Light, Green Light.

609
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,178
I've seen him before,
he really is pretty bad at it.

610
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,387
- Was I that bad?
- You were.

611
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,351
- You sucked.
- Yeah, he really sucks.

612
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,936
- He's really that bad?
- Yeah, so bad.

613
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,188
- But didn't you have so much fun?
- You still sucked.

614
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,477
{\an8}<i>Did you get home safe?</i>

615
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,628
Wait here, Ji-yun.

616
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,754
Daddy will be right back.

617
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,423
No, Dad. Don't.

618
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,882
Please don't go.

619
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,302
Don't go!

620
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,471
Dad, Dad!

621
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,889
Daddy!

622
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,810
Dad!

623
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,523
<i>Dad!</i>

624
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,883
Wow.

625
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,386
It's so pretty.

626
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,804
They sure are.

627
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,431
Did you have a good time today?

628
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,515
Yeah! You're the best, Dad!

629
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,058
Let's come again next time.

630
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,523
My sweet girl.
You grew up so well even without a mother.

631
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:27,733
Thank you so much.

632
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,610
It's all right. I have you.

633
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,737
You're all I need.

634
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,411
I'll be with you for a long time
and will always protect you.

635
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,038
I'll never let you be alone.

636
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,416
- Okay.
- Promise.

637
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,209
- Promise!
- It's a deal then.

638
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,425
Wow. The cherry blossoms are
so beautiful, aren't they?

639
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,561
Liar.

640
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,845
How are you feeling?

641
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,680
Still bad?

642
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,724
What about lunch?

643
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,237
What to do with her.

644
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,906
She says she doesn't care.

645
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:01,326
But she always feels down
this time of the year.

646
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:07,082
DEATH ANNIVERSARY
OF JI-YUN'S DAD

647
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,714
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal.

648
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,010
It looks so good.

649
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,558
Have some.

650
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,019
I don't feel like eating.

651
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,689
I was told to watch until you eat.

652
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,566
Ms. Seo practically begged me.

653
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,999
Did you know
that stores are normally called "stores"

654
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,542
but only restaurants are called "houses"?

655
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,212
Convenience store,
department store, electronics store.

656
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,715
But you never hear
people saying a meal store.

657
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,466
It doesn't feel natural.

658
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:03,597
That's because food
is the closest to home.

659
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,849
It's not simply about eating food.

660
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,185
You're eating a meal full of love,

661
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,771
from someone who went through
all the trouble of preparing it.

662
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,442
I bet you haven't had
a home-cooked meal in a while.

663
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,616
This place really makes it
feel like home.

664
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,117
It looks so good.

665
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,285
Please, have some.

666
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,206
I have a question.

667
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,334
Why did you go on paternal leave?

668
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,669
You were in your heyday,
progressing your career.

669
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,798
I wanted to see her smile.

670
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,425
My daughter has the sweetest smile.

671
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,226
She wanted it.

672
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,063
And I promised her
that I'd be by her side.

673
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,856
I was keeping that promise.

674
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,734
Because I'm all that she has.

675
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:04,115
<i>I'll be with you for a long time
and will always protect you.</i>

676
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,744
<i>I'll never let you be alone.</i>

677
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,662
<i>I promise.</i>

678
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,336
I'll wait outside.

679
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,921
Ms. Kang.

680
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:36,648
Ms. Kang. I bought some porridge
and painkillers.

681
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,900
You didn't look good.

682
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,902
Please have it while it's hot.

683
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,363
PAINKILLER

684
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,657
Take it and go. I don't need it.

685
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,246
Are you okay?

686
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,081
I'll manage myself on my own.

687
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,376
Take it outside. It's disturbing me.

688
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,853
Why did you do things I didn't ask for?

689
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,859
I'm pointlessly wasting energy
because of you…

690
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,156
You said you wanted to be judged
as a secretary.

691
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,116
The secretary that I need

692
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,785
is one who only does what I ask.

693
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,287
Not being nosy like this.

694
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,790
Get out.

695
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,677
I'm sorry.

696
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,581
Hello, ma'am.

697
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,167
Our candidate starts tomorrow, right?

698
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,752
I've been meaning to give you a call.

699
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,629
You haven't heard, have you?

700
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,923
We got a call just now,
saying he can't come in tomorrow.

701
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,093
Ms. Kang. This is the third time already

702
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,261
that your candidates
have backtracked on us.

703
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,013
<i>The person in charge is great.</i>

704
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,349
But your recommendations
for the team are terrible.

705
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,392
I…

706
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,852
I'm sorry, ma'am.

707
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,646
I'll check again and...

708
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,774
My boss told me to refuse talent
chosen by Peoplez.

709
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,984
The project ends here.

710
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,111
But…

711
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:50,323
Ms. Kang. It seems like
someone is stealing talent away.

712
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,283
You should be careful.

713
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,077
<i>I'm hanging up now.</i>

714
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,625
You look pleased with yourself.

715
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,585
We don't choose who we work with.
We create them.

716
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,046
To be greedy for it is to achieve it.

717
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,469
KANG JI-YUN, CEO

718
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,390
- Ms. Kang.
- Don't follow me.

719
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,895
Ms. Kang!

720
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,605
What's wrong?

721
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,941
Tell me what's going on!

722
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,942
My, what a lovely guest.

723
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,903
Welcome.

724
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,279
I'll keep it short.

725
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,364
You should've kept it civil.

726
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,326
Stop whatever it is that you're doing.

727
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,952
Candidates choose for themselves.

728
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,289
All I did was offer the better position.

729
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,417
Why are you here complaining about
your inability to keep your candidates?

730
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,545
You're doing it to screw me over.

731
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,548
I guess it worked.

732
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,133
You are here, after all.

733
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,427
Don't play games behind my back.

734
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,054
The more you act like this,

735
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,681
the more I realize
that you're scared of me.

736
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,350
Are you that afraid of me?

737
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,852
Of course, I am.

738
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,938
A person died because of you.

739
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,148
Hye-jin.

740
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,569
Did you not feel anything
when you were coming in here?

741
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,739
How dare you come back here?

742
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,366
Quite brazen of you.

743
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,495
I didn't throw away any of his belongings.

744
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,831
You got over it, I guess.

745
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,214
CAREER WAY, CEO

746
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,969
CAREER WAY, CEO, LEE YONG-HOON

747
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,777
<i>- Traitor. Look how brazen she is.
- She's responsible for Mr. Lee's death.</i>

748
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,446
<i>Traitor. How dare you come back,
after killing a man.</i>

749
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,328
This is the last warning.

750
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,414
Pull something like this again,

751
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,791
and I won't stand for it anymore.

752
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,927
Poor girl. Just as it was back then,

753
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,972
no one here is on your side.

754
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,558
<i>Huh? Did something happen with Ms. Kim?</i>

755
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,892
<i>She doesn't look good.</i>

756
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,228
<i>What is she doing coming back here
after five years?</i>

757
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,650
<i>She's still got some nerve.</i>

758
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,444
<i>The audacity for her to come back here.</i>

759
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,196
<i>What more does she want?</i>

760
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,574
<i>- Shameless.
- She's a scary one.</i>

761
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,994
<i>She left and built herself a company.
Now she's even got time to come here.</i>

762
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,246
<i>She sure is living the good life.</i>

763
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,415
<i>Who's she planning on killing this time?</i>

764
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,667
<i>How could one betray the CEO?</i>

765
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,461
<i>How can she be so shameless?</i>

766
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,755
<i>She must feel nothing
after everything she's done to him.</i>

767
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:34,922
<i>Is she out of her mind?</i>

768
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,090
<i>How could she?</i>

769
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,675
<i>Look how proud she is.</i>

770
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,177
<i>Ji-Yun is the one who killed Mr. Lee.</i>

771
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,345
<i>That's no way to repay kindness.</i>

772
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,804
<i>That traitor.</i>

773
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,474
<i>How brazen of her to come back here.</i>

774
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,935
<i>How could you come back here
after killing a man?</i>

775
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,482
<i>I'd never be able to walk with my chin up.</i>

776
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,901
<i>She's a killer.</i>

777
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,616
Ms. Kang.

778
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,383
Thank you for today.

779
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:08,803
{\an8}- Hot! Oh, that's hot!
- <i>Let's work together from now on.</i>

780
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,429
{\an8}<i>Inappropriate relationship?</i>

781
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,099
{\an8}That's what you got while conducting
a reference check?

782
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,101
{\an8}<i>There won't be any problems.</i>

783
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,185
{\an8}Could you keep it a secret?

784
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:19,188
{\an8}<i>There's one place we didn't check.</i>

785
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,648
{\an8}- Father!
- Father?

786
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,984
{\an8}How could you mistake me for a father?

787
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,527
{\an8}Have you ever seen a father
as good-looking as me?

788
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,988
{\an8}<i>What kind of person do you take me for?</i>

789
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:30,408
{\an8}<i>Right, I've always been a villain
to you since the beginning.</i>

790
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,369
{\an8}<i>So from now on,
I'll try to get to know you better.</i>

791
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:39,792
