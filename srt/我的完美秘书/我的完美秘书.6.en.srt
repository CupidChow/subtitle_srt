DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,008
- Oh no, there seems to be a fire.
- Oh my goodness!

4
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,365
Kids!

5
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,411
Hurry and get out of there!

6
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,333
Please help!

7
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,501
Help!

8
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,504
I'm over here!

9
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:29,922
Please help!

10
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,654
Sir! Can you take my child?

11
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:58,326
Ji-yun, wait for me here.

12
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,494
No!

13
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,872
Dad, don't go. Please don't.

14
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,624
Don't go.

15
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,583
I'll bring her right away.

16
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,336
No! Don't go!

17
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,593
My daughter… Daddy'll be right back.

18
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,768
Dad.

19
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,894
Dad!

20
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,604
Dad!

21
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,024
Dad!

22
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,654
Dad!

23
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,496
Dad…

24
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,207
<i>There are still people inside!</i>
<i>We need to use the ladder truck.</i>

25
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,125
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
<i>- They're stuck in the building.</i>

26
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,933
You promised you'd come back.

27
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,602
You promised me!

28
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,479
You told me to wait!

29
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,029
No…

30
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,743
No…

31
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,892
- What's going on?
- What?

32
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,727
- What the heck?
- What do you mean?

33
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,355
- The sun is up.
- What?

34
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,357
- What time is it?
- What time is it now?

35
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,569
What's going on here?
What am I doing here?

36
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:41,405
<i>Dad, get yourself a girlfriend</i>

37
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,782
<i>and go on dates.</i>

38
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,283
<i>It's TGIF.</i>

39
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,993
- You have to go now.
- Where?

40
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,495
- She's on her way.
- Who?

41
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,038
- My daughter!
- Your daughter.

42
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,748
What? Your daughter?

43
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,465
Why did you sleep in?

44
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,841
You didn't set an alarm?

45
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,259
I did, but…

46
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:09,475
By the way, did we do anything?

47
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:10,393
Pardon?

48
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,144
We didn't even hold hands.

49
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,813
All we did was eat and sleep--

50
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,939
Is it good, Byeol?

51
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,944
Dad.

52
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,156
Byeol.

53
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,998
- Let's get on.
- Okay.

54
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,458
Ouch.

55
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,043
I'm getting off.

56
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:38,671
<i>Going up.</i>

57
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,548
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

58
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,482
That person just now…

59
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,026
She seems familiar.

60
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,028
Where did I see her?

61
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:05,322
- Dad.
- Yes?

62
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,074
- Did you lie to me at all?
- No.

63
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,998
He must have lied.

64
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,834
I didn't.

65
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:26,927
Feeling better?

66
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,431
Yes, I think it stopped.

67
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,103
- Did she make a fuss?
- Don't get me started.

68
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,813
She cried because her dad wasn't there.

69
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,106
I could barely comfort her with candy.

70
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,108
Thank you so much for today.

71
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,693
I really slept in.

72
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:43,861
Did you get home late last night?

73
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,863
No…

74
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,910
Did you sleep on the sofa?

75
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,370
No, I mean…

76
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,290
I cleaned,
but this must have slipped my mind.

77
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,629
I'll babysit Seo-jun today.

78
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,382
I'd be so grateful.

79
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:13,057
Was someone else here yesterday?

80
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,612
PEOPLEZ CEO KANG JI-YUN

81
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:27,696
<i>Did you get home…</i>

82
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,702
<i>I'm sorry about…</i>

83
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,544
Jeez.

84
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,612
{\an8}EPISODE 6

85
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:14,952
That kiddo is Mr. Yu's daughter?

86
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,330
No wonder.

87
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:21,250
They felt oddly similar.

88
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,012
YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB

89
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,016
<i>You did an excellent job.</i>

90
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:45,024
A compliment should be done properly.

91
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

92
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,552
Hello.

93
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,137
Please wait.

94
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,392
<i>- The doors are opening.</i>
- Thank you.

95
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,026
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

96
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,282
Good morning.

97
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,410
Good morning.

98
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,122
Did you have a good weekend?

99
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,208
Well…

100
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,585
Did you also have a good weekend?

101
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,213
Yes, I had a good weekend.

102
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,382
Except for being kicked out.

103
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,761
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:57,054
Did you get home safely?

105
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,932
That's why I came to work.

106
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,810
Took long enough for you to ask.

107
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,106
Your daughter…

108
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,692
Did she say anything in particular?

109
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,568
Daughter?

110
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,947
Never mind. Forget it.

111
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,992
Let me ask you one thing.

112
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,121
- Why did you kick me out?
- Why did you run away?

113
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,872
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

114
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,712
- Let's go.
- Let's…

115
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,850
- Mom.
- Hi, Ju-hee.

116
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,769
- Did you get pricked? Let me see.
- It's okay.

117
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,230
- Are you bleeding?
- No, I'm not.

118
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,358
I feel terrible. Look at your hands.

119
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,902
It isn't unusual for a seamstress.

120
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,405
Was there traffic on your way here?

121
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:57,740
No, it was fine.

122
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,327
Do you have a lot of work these days?

123
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,914
Of course.
You know how amazing my skills are.

124
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,542
Ju-hee,

125
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,337
some people called headhunters--

126
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,923
Mom, can't you just quit your job?

127
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,551
What?

128
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:21,180
You sew every day sitting here
in this dingy little place.

129
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,183
Your hands are covered with blisters
from working with leather.

130
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,018
Just for a few bucks.

131
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,235
Now, both my husband and I earn money.

132
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,696
Stop working so hard and close up shop.

133
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:42,075
Whenever I look at your hands,

134
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,036
I feel terrible.

135
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,817
Are these so horrible to look at?

136
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,572
<i>Your hands that have worked</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

137
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,157
They must find it unfair.

138
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,702
Ma'am, your hands are very special.

139
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,248
Don't underestimate

140
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,916
the value of your time spent.

141
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:47,516
Excuse me.

142
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm here to meet CEO Kang Ji-yun.

143
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,064
Well, Ms. Kang is…

144
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:55,524
Oh, Ms. Cho!

145
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,364
Ms. Cho, have you made up your mind?

146
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,701
If someone needs my help, I'll do it.

147
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,327
I mean,

148
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,453
I'd like to try.

149
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,289
Gosh, Ms. Cho!

150
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:12,583
Goodness, I…

151
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,834
Gosh.

152
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,504
Ms. Cho, you saved me.

153
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,549
CHICKEN GALBI
PALGAKDO

154
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,343
It looks so delicious.

155
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,720
Try this.

156
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,430
I'm gonna have a bigger piece.

157
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,351
It's so tender. Try it. Go on.

158
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,317
What do you think? Isn't it tender?

159
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:40,736
It's okay.

160
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,696
How about some fried rice? I'll order it.

161
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,656
Ma'am, one fried rice, please!

162
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,249
I'm so glad that we found a candidate
for Deluxe Line before the deadline.

163
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,585
I'm so relieved.

164
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,087
Ms. Cho made up her mind
faster than I expected.

165
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,967
This is all thanks to Mr. Yu
and Kwang-hee's hard work.

166
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,636
Did you give them compliments?

167
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,179
Doesn't everyone work hard?

168
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,183
I told you not to judge people
based on your standards.

169
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,353
Then again, Eun-ho is just as bad.

170
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,021
He must have gotten it from you.

171
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:20,442
Last time, when Byeol went camping,
he insisted on working…

172
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,363
Wouldn't it be nice not to bring that up?

173
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,741
After working everyone up,
you canceled it last minute, Ms. Seo.

174
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:31,036
I couldn't help it.
I had a prior commitment.

175
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,246
I'm the one who's sad about not going.

176
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,915
You had good food thanks to me.

177
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:37,918
Isn't Eun-ho an amazing cook?

178
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:41,546
That, I agree.

179
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:45,384
The kiddo who comes often
to the bookstore.

180
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,260
- Her?
- Is that Mr. Yu's daughter?

181
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,553
Yeah, Byeol.

182
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,181
Kang-seok told me
that the two of you have met often.

183
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,934
Didn't he raise her well
as a single parent?

184
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,230
She's clever and cute.

185
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:01,358
By the way,

186
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:03,860
since when did he raise her by himself?

187
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,780
I heard that they got divorced
before Byeol's first birthday.

188
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:07,948
- Divorced?
- Yes.

189
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,242
I heard that they were
a famous couple at college.

190
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:13,036
They got married right after graduation,
so everyone expected them to be happy.

191
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,373
Even Kang-seok was surprised
when they divorced so soon.

192
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,458
They got separated with an infant.

193
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:22,087
Why did they break up?

194
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,798
Kang-seok doesn't know why exactly.

195
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:27,592
Eun-ho isn't the type to talk about it.

196
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,680
I think he raised Byeol
with a lot of determination.

197
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,515
Being a single parent can't be easy.

198
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,809
He completely dedicated himself to Byeol.

199
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,519
For paternity leave…

200
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,691
What? Why did you stop mid-sentence?

201
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,528
Aren't I talking about him recklessly?

202
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,363
- He's not just anyone.
- Right… What?

203
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,907
He's not just anyone?

204
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,703
What? You think…

205
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:55,746
He's my secretary.

206
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,249
I should know about my secretary's past.

207
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,378
Didn't you tell me to be more interested
in my employees?

208
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,296
Right.

209
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,340
Being interested in your employees
without ulterior motives is good.

210
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,511
Byeol used to be a sickly child,

211
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,139
so he gave up everything,
including his career.

212
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:17,184
He took a leave of absence
to stay with Byeol.

213
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,187
That's why people at work
disapproved of him.

214
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:23,106
Eun-ho is an amazing dad.

215
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,154
Why did you go on paternal leave?

216
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,614
You were in your heyday
to progress your career.

217
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:32,908
I wanted to see her smile.

218
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,618
My daughter has the sweetest smile.

219
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,289
She wanted it.

220
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:41,458
And I promised her
that I'd be by her side.

221
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,918
I was keeping that promise.

222
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,879
Because I'm all that she has.

223
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,967
You're right.

224
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,220
He's a good dad.

225
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,016
That tickles.

226
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,810
If you move, it'll get everywhere.

227
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,978
Okay, I'll try to hold my breath.

228
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,067
Why are you into nail polish
all of a sudden?

229
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,610
You weren't interested a while ago.

230
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,237
To show it to an amazing woman.

231
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,823
The one you met at the bookstore?

232
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,867
I don't know who it is,
but you must like her.

233
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,744
I'll introduce you next time.

234
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,330
Stay still. It's going to smudge.

235
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,836
Are you looking at me with adoring eyes?

236
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,090
You look super ugly
because you're concentrating.

237
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:33,218
No, Daddy always looks very handsome
when he's concentrating.

238
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:37,305
All done.

239
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,099
What do you think? You like it?

240
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:41,059
Well, not too bad.

241
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,562
Wait five minutes until it dries
before you go to sleep.

242
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,439
Dad, you put it on, too.

243
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,108
No, I don't have to.

244
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,986
- Do I really have to?
- Yeah.

245
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,246
- Stay still.
- That tickles.

246
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,654
Ms. Kang, I'll be honest.

247
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,032
I was offended when I got this document.

248
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,867
I didn't lose my number one candidate

249
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,828
and waited this long to get someone
like her as a recommendation.

250
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,371
Did you want to hire someone

251
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,707
with an impressive background
instead of real competence?

252
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,876
You haven't seen anything yet.

253
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,422
Please test her skills.

254
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:55,592
Any method of your choice will work.

255
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,302
Are you that certain?

256
00:18:57,385 --> 00:18:59,763
I don't recommend candidates
without certainty.

257
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,434
Mr. Jin.

258
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,357
- What is it? This is rude.
- I apologize, but you should look at this.

259
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,074
LUXURY BAG BOUGHT FROM
DELUXE LINE, ACTUALLY A FAKE?

260
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,868

{\an8}SUSPECTED TO BE COUNTERFEIT…

262
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,412
{\an8}"KNOCKOFF CONTROVERSY"

263
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,581
What's this?

264
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,001
A bag bought from us
was appraised by Luxury Seller.

265
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,836
It was revealed to be a counterfeit.

266
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,048
Luxury Seller?
The one that took our candidate?

267
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,261
Let's talk about recruitment next time.
I need to solve this first.

268
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,809
So what are they saying?

269
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:46,851
Why do they think it's fake?

270
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,021
The spacing in the logo is
minutely different from the genuine.

271
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,525
Call the customer to confirm the facts.
Then contact the distributor…

272
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:56,319
What's the matter?
Is it something serious?

273
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,488
The company must be facing a problem.

274
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:05,078
Gosh, what's this? Knockoff controversy?

275
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,207
Of all the companies,
Luxury Seller is involved.

276
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,084
This problem can only get worse.

277
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,419
Let's see what happens.

278
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,879
But it looks genuine.

279
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,506
It looks genuine?

280
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,303
I can't be 100% sure
without looking at it myself.

281
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,180
If you do, can you make a
definitive judgment?

282
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,107
Here's the bag
that we got from the customer.

283
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,651
What do you think? Is it fake or real?

284
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,320
It is…

285
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,448
real.

286
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:09,327
The number of stitches, their angle,
direction, thickness,

287
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,162
and spacing are even and accurate.

288
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:16,251
The lined backstitches are different
from curved backstitches.

289
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,627
Those are also accurate.

290
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,257
Aren't they easy to copy
by manufacturers who customize bags?

291
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,300
That's possible.

292
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:28,388
That's frustrating.

293
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,515
- If that's possible--
- Mr. Jin.

294
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,184
Please let her finish.

295
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:39,065
However, it's impossible to copy
the leather coating.

296
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,694
Each brand has their own standard
on the coating of leather.

297
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,905
A tiny difference can change its texture.

298
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,490
That can't be expressed in numbers.

299
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,369
You can tell the difference in coating
when you touch it.

300
00:22:51,452 --> 00:22:54,497
I don't know the exact measurement,

301
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,291
but I recognize it…

302
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,919
with my fingertips.

303
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,673
Mr. Jin,
please publish a rebuttal article.

304
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:09,053
Can I really trust her words
and take the risk?

305
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,016
Whether you trust her or not is up to you.

306
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,727
Right, but if you hadn't lost
that candidate,

307
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,729
this wouldn't have happened!

308
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:20,064
Do you still trust him more?

309
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,900
Then agree that it's fake.

310
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,152
Ms. Kang, are you saying
that we sold an imitation?

311
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:27,906
My company boasts transparency in
importing, clearing customs, and delivery!

312
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:30,909
We confirmed that there was
no problem during delivery.

313
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,369
Then it's settled.

314
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,997
You say that it's real,
and our candidate confirms it.

315
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,124
There's no reason for hesitation.

316
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,669
Mr. Jin, you should make
your statement first

317
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,797
and send the bag to the manufacturer
for accurate appraisal.

318
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,896
Say you're sorry!

319
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:01,272
I said, apologize!

320
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,113
Jung-tae.

321
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,741
Jung-tae, are you okay?

322
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,119
Seo-jun, you shouldn't push him.

323
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,585
I'm sorry, Director.

324
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,295
I'm very sorry.

325
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,339
How is he? Is he okay?

326
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:29,092
Yes. Luckily, he wasn't hurt.

327
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,886
I explained that
to Jung-tae's mother as well.

328
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,264
That's a relief.

329
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:38,017
Seo-jun isn't one to do that.

330
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,270
So why did he?

331
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,190
I think Jung-tae teased Seo-jun.

332
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,734
It hurt his sense of pride,
so he won't tell me.

333
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,368
Jung Seo-jun, are you
really not going to say why

334
00:24:55,451 --> 00:24:57,662
even to me, your grandma?

335
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:01,666
Then tell me, Byeol.

336
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,711
Byeol, why did Seo-jun fight
with his friend?

337
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:06,462
Well--

338
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,381
Don't ask Byeol about it.

339
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,220
Then will you tell me?

340
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:23,229
Byeol, could you give us some privacy?

341
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,274
Grandma, I want to go
to uncle's bookstore.

342
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,026
Over there.

343
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,029
That's a good idea.

344
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,405
I'll walk you there.

345
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:37,410
{\an8}DODAM BOOK STORE

346
00:25:58,639 --> 00:25:59,974
What are you doing here?

347
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:00,892
Oh, sis.

348
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:03,019
Aren't you here to read?
Why aren't you inside?

349
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,114
Isn't it adorable?

350
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,574
It's a baby.

351
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:20,828
But it's been alone for a while.

352
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,749
Do you want to find its mom?

353
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:34,008
Maybe it was also abandoned by its mom.

354
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,939
Then we can find its dad.

355
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,775
A mom may not be necessary.

356
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,612
Its dad might be
looking for it desperately.

357
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,283
This is a secret.

358
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,995
My mom passed away when I was young,

359
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,205
so I only had my dad.

360
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,082
Really?

361
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,918
Didn't the other kids tease you?

362
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,338
I didn't play with such lowly kids.

363
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,468
I don't know if you'll understand this,

364
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:21,139
but love is about quality, not quantity.

365
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,642
Having two parents doesn't mean
that you get loved twice as much.

366
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,187
One person who loves you
unconditionally is enough.

367
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:42,410
Kitty!

368
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:46,956
Byeol!

369
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:52,128
Jung-tae teased us
for not having a mom and a dad.

370
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:53,087
What?

371
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,215
He said that Byeol and I
have half families.

372
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,219
How…

373
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:02,847
Where did he learn to talk like that?

374
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,934
- Seo-jun--
- Grandma.

375
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:07,935
I'm okay.

376
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,979
We aren't half a family.

377
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,065
I have Mom and Grandma.

378
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,692
There's everyone.

379
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:17,236
Exactly, we aren't half a family.

380
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,989
There are so many who love you.

381
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:23,242
You should have just ignored him.

382
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,994
Why did you push him?

383
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,374
I'm okay, but I did it
in case Byeol felt bad.

384
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,002
Did Byeol also hear him say that?

385
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:36,047
Yes. Byeol is very upset about it.

386
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,179
You did well.

387
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,350
Gosh, my baby is all grown up.

388
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:53,523
Still, you should never hit anyone.

389
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:55,566
That's a terrible thing to do.

390
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,193
Okay.

391
00:28:58,444 --> 00:28:59,821
But one thing,

392
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,697
aren't I my mom's baby?

393
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,577
Byeol isn't here?

394
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,288
No, Byeol hasn't been here today.

395
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:13,209
I walked her all the way to the door
a moment ago.

396
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,669
You did?

397
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,463
I'll go outside and look for her.

398
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,217
Where did she go?

399
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,304
Where could she have gone?

400
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,681
BYEOL'S DAD

401
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:33,312
SEO-JUN'S GRANDMA

402
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:39,485
Dang. Luxury Seller published
another article for rebuttal.

403
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,572
They still insist that it's a counterfeit.

404
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:46,033
Don't most companies usually stay quiet?

405
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,953
It feels like they're blowing things out
of proportion on purpose.

406
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:50,830
They're creating a competition
between two companies.

407
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:53,916
The result will determine
whose appraisal system is more accurate.

408
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,212
Are they that confident or what?

409
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:01,632
Ms. Cho… Do you think she'll be okay?

410
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,467
I'll call her.

411
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:16,731
MISSED CALL

412
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,107
WRITER JUNG

413
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,778
Su-hyeon, is something the matter?

414
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,242
Byeol?

415
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,286
Okay, I'm on my way.

416
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,623
Eun-ho, did something happen to Byeol?

417
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,666
Ms. Seo, I have to go now.

418
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,710
Go. You can explain later.

419
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:40,171
What's wrong?

420
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:41,964
Eun-ho!

421
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,342
<i>There are people who saw Byeol</i>
<i>in front of the bookstore.</i>

422
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,470
<i>After reporting it to the police,</i>
<i>they began searching for her.</i>

423
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,722
<i>I'm also on my way to the bookstore.</i>

424
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,974
<i>Don't worry, Daddy Yu.</i>

425
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,559
<i>She must be somewhere nearby.</i>

426
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,732
PEOPLEZ CEO KANG JI-YUN

427
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,072
Ms. Kang, I'm on my way somewhere.

428
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,324
- <i>Byeol is with me.</i>
- Pardon?

429
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:11,410
Byeol crashed into a bicycle
in front of the bookstore.

430
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,620
She isn't seriously injured.

431
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,413
- Just a slight--
- Where are you?

432
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,304
Excuse me.

433
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,555
Have you seen Byeol?

434
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,266
She's went out for a moment.
She'll be right back.

435
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,980
- Dad.
- Byeol!

436
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,567
Let me see. Are you okay?

437
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,236
Dad, I'm sorry.

438
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,030
A kitten suddenly ran away.

439
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,282
It doesn't hurt at all.

440
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,575
Really.

441
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,705
Her wound was treated.

442
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,873
Just in case, they ran a few more tests.

443
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,458
The results aren't out yet.

444
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,630
I'm sorry.

445
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:08,759
How come you were with Byeol?

446
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,847
I told you. She's the amazing woman
from the bookstore.

447
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,148
Well, I…

448
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,400
Thank you for everything.

449
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:26,027
By the way,

450
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,364
I didn't expect you
to be the person Byeol mentioned.

451
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,117
I also found out recently.

452
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,995
Go in. She's alone.

453
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,622
Okay, I have some work
I haven't finished--

454
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,250
Think only about your child today.

455
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,005
See you later.

456
00:32:56,348 --> 00:32:57,475
Yes, Ms. Seo?

457
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,935
Right, today's meeting.

458
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,314
I'll be there in about an hour.

459
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,109
Okay, let's have it tomorrow morning then.

460
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:08,736
Yeah.

461
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,696
Today, Eun-ho…

462
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,449
You met him? Where?

463
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:15,242
How did you meet him?

464
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,120
Oh, okay.

465
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,497
Talk to you later.

466
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,751
What is it? Has Ms. Kang met with Mr. Yu?

467
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:27,088
Yes, he went to search for Byeol
because she disappeared.

468
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,174
But I wonder how Ms. Kang met Eun-ho.

469
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,178
That's strange.

470
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,846
Gosh.

471
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,059
Those two seem to
keep getting involved with each other,

472
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,144
or am I just imagining it?

473
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,563
Who am I supposed to blame?

474
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:48,025
You, since you brought Mr. Yu here,

475
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,652
or the heavens?

476
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,487
What are you talking about?

477
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,658
So our meeting is canceled, right?

478
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:56,909
I'm getting off work.

479
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,164
What's wrong with him?

480
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,125
What is he…

481
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,543
What is he talking about?

482
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,940
Is Seo-jun okay?

483
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:30,192
He fell asleep.
He must be tired after today.

484
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,778
It must've been shocking for him.

485
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,614
Byeol isn't seriously injured, is she?

486
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,491
No. I'm going to the hospital now.

487
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,243
I'll call you after I see her.

488
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:40,744
Okay, you should go.

489
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,873
I feel embarrassed to see Byeol's dad.

490
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,418
- How could I have left her…
- Mom.

491
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,295
Don't say that.

492
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,338
Stop worrying and get some rest.

493
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,340
You were shocked the most today.

494
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,595
Su-hyeon.

495
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,472
I realized today

496
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,017
that Seo-jun isn't just a baby.

497
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:06,020
How long will you keep it a secret?

498
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,105
It's about time Seo-jun should find out.

499
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,444
Yes, I'll think about it.

500
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,237
Okay.

501
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,781
You know what to do with him.

502
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,202
- You'd better go.
- Okay. I'll be back.

503
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,703
I'll call you.

504
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,171
<i>Something happened at kindergarten today.</i>

505
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:36,008
<i>One of their friends teased them</i>
<i>for both having single parents.</i>

506
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,428
<i>According to Seo-jun,</i>
<i>it made Byeol very upset.</i>

507
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,681
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it's the first time this has happened.</i>

508
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,113
Ms. Kang?

509
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,289
In case you haven't eaten.

510
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,667
PORRIDGE

511
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:34,775
Are you okay?

512
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,654
Oh, yes.

513
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:44,994
Actually,

514
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,204
I'm not sure.

515
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,210
I think I'm trying my best…

516
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,547
but sometimes,

517
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:59,383
I feel like I'm hitting a wall.

518
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,394
You're doing well.

519
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,688
At least,

520
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:17,568
you're always by Byeol's side
when she needs you.

521
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,200
I'm sure that Byeol knows

522
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,370
that her dad is making an effort.

523
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,499
So,

524
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,086
just like now,

525
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,007
always be by your daughter's side.

526
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,715
Excuse me, where is the emergency room?

527
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,884
- It's that way.
- Thank you.

528
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,390
Eun-ho, how's Byeol?

529
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,808
Hi, Su-hyeon.

530
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,312
Say hello. She's the CEO at my work.

531
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,357
Hello.

532
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,986
This is Jung Su-hyeon, a writer.

533
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,323
I'm a friend of Eun-ho's.
I've heard a lot about you.

534
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,743
I see. Hello.

535
00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:51,537
I'll get going.

536
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:54,498
- Wait a moment.
- Okay.

537
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,208
I'll be fine.
You don't have to walk me out.

538
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:06,927
How's Byeol?

539
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,180
Oh, she just fell asleep.

540
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,223
Let's go in.

541
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,192
- Su-hyeon.
- Yeah?

542
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,027
Right.

543
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,158
I hope that everything goes well today.

544
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,410
I'm a little scared to read the news.

545
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,579
- Hello, Kyung-hwa.
- Hello.

546
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,456
- Hello, Gyu-rim.
- Good morning.

547
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,292
Mr. Yu, is your daughter okay?

548
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,710
Yes, she's fine now.

549
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:42,838
I'm so glad. Everyone was really worried.

550
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:44,089
Thank you.

551
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,926
Go ahead.

552
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,555
Gyu-rim?

553
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,434
Both of you should look at this.

554
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:01,857
DELUXE LINE FAILS
TO RECRUIT APPRAISER

555
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,774
WILL THEY GET THEIR REVENGE?

556
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,946
It must be an article from Career Way.

557
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,032
How so very sneaky.

558
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:12,910
Their argument is solely based
on the appraiser's background.

559
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,578
Isn't this a big slap in the face?

560
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:18,332
This makes it unfavorable for Deluxe Line.

561
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:21,668
The press was divided equally,
but after these articles got published…

562
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,378
Who's this person?

563
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,421
- What?
- What is it?

564
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,756
Is it another article?

565
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,509
Those famous for
their online content on luxury brands.

566
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,345
They're having a party taking a stab
at this war since yesterday.

567
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:33,514
They've been running their own appraisals.

568
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,850
Experts from everywhere have taken action.

569
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,185
So what are they saying?

570
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,730
All of them are saying that it's fake.

571
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,112
DELUXE LINE BAG IS FAKE

572
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:57,162
DELUXE LINE GONNA GO BANKRUPT
IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE FAKE

573
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,830
LUXURY SELLER IS RIGHT,
WHAT HAS DELUXE LINE EVER DONE…

574
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,916
IS IT TRUE DELUXE LINE HIRED
A SEAMSTRESS AS THEIR APPRAISER?

575
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:02,000
YUP, IT'S TRUE

576
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,252
Mr. Yu.

577
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,545
Let's go visit her workshop.

578
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,171
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:23,230
GAEMI TAILORING

580
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,440
One moment.

581
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:28,652
Ms. Cho?

582
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:31,113
Ms. Cho.

583
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,325
She's not here.

584
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:41,456
Is Ms. Cho here?

585
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:45,043
Hello, you must be looking for my mom.

586
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:50,173
Yes.

587
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,720
DELUXE LINE FAILS
TO RECRUIT APPRAISER

588
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,637
WILL THEY GET THEIR REVENGE?

589
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:02,853
I had no idea
that the problem got so serious.

590
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,232
What happens if her appraisal is wrong?

591
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,109
Would she be responsible for it?

592
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,695
As a candidate that we recommended,

593
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:13,405
Ms. Cho only appraised the item.

594
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:16,366
The appraisal result won't put her
at any disadvantage.

595
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,745
But the job offer might be canceled.

596
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,873
What if my mom doesn't want to work there?

597
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,374
Can she refuse?

598
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,667
That is up to Ms. Cho.

599
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,836
She hasn't been hired yet.

600
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:32,466
What do the two of you think?

601
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:36,136
Do you think my mom's judgment
on the bag is correct?

602
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:41,141
What about you? What do you think?

603
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,648
A few days ago,
I told my mom to quit working.

604
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,775
I didn't want to see her suffer anymore.

605
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,903
I don't know how it got to this point.

606
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,117
Have you ever asked Ms. Cho
why she continues to do this work?

607
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,413
She only took a break of two years
during her 37-year career.

608
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,458
To raise you until you turned two.

609
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:08,585
She told me.

610
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,839
That's why I'd like her to quit her job
and take a break.

611
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,844
She told me that she was happy to work.

612
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,139
When she smelled the leather at this shop
after that two-year break,

613
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,016
she loved it.

614
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,354
I don't think she's working
just to make money.

615
00:43:27,437 --> 00:43:29,731
She's very proud of her work.

616
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,818
Just like how proud you are of your work.

617
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,822
Stop working so hard and close up shop.

618
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,449
Just for a few bucks.

619
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,125
Mom.

620
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:50,961
Ju-hee.

621
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,005
Ju-hee.

622
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:57,092
Don't you worry. I won't take the job.

623
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:59,886
Ms. Kang and Eun-ho,
I don't want to do it.

624
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,304
I don't think I can.

625
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,348
Let's just pretend that nothing happened.

626
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,726
Do you really want to quit?

627
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,812
Everyone says that I'm wrong.

628
00:44:08,895 --> 00:44:10,731
I thought you were the smart ones.

629
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,150
I didn't think that it was this serious,

630
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,610
and I don't want to be responsible for it.

631
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:20,615
We should stop here before
the damage gets worse.

632
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,453
Ms. Cho, do you think that they're right?

633
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:28,248
Who would even believe me?

634
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,838
Mom.

635
00:44:37,632 --> 00:44:39,050
I believe you.

636
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,179
If you say that it's real,

637
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,765
then it's real.

638
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,145
My mom doesn't know how to pull tricks.

639
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:53,482
To protect people's memories,

640
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:56,526
she delves into it and studies every day,

641
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,819
coming up with new material.

642
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,154
LEATHER RESEARCH
NATURAL LEATHER

643
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,490
All her life,

644
00:45:02,782 --> 00:45:03,992
that's how she's lived.

645
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,746
I'm not saying this because she's my mom.

646
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:10,707
In whatever field it may be,
you can trust…

647
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,127
someone like her.

648
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,254
I guarantee it.

649
00:45:21,092 --> 00:45:22,469
Ju-hee.

650
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:25,472
Mom.

651
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,851
How can you not believe in yourself?

652
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,312
You're an amazing person.

653
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,481
I know that.

654
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:37,400
Do what you want.

655
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:49,746
What would you like to do?

656
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,415
Please make your choice, Ms. Cho.

657
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,588
THE REAL FIGHT BEHIND
THE IMITATION CONTROVERSY

658
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,173
WHO WILL
THE MANUFACTURER SIDE WITH?

659
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:26,533
Mr. Jin, the result
of the official appraisal has arrived.

660
00:46:58,481 --> 00:46:59,399
The bag is genuine.

661
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,075
APPRAISAL SHOWS THAT
THE PRODUCT IS GENUINE

662
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,161
I told you that it was genuine.

663
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,754
- Ms. Cho.
- Gosh.

664
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:23,048
You saved me.

665
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:27,010
I look forward to working with you.

666
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:29,721
The pleasure is all mine.

667
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:31,389
Please get up, Mr. Jin.

668
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,191
<i>Regarding the controversial product,</i>
<i>the manufacturer stated</i>

669
00:47:41,274 --> 00:47:45,695
<i>that the logo's arrangement was changed</i>
<i>due to their new production line.</i>

670
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,864
<i>To prevent counterfeits,</i>

671
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:51,451
<i>the brand changes the production line</i>
<i>once every few years…</i>

672
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:52,911
I apologize, Ms. Kim.

673
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:55,622
Regarding the charges
on breach of contract with Luxury Seller,

674
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,040
I'll take care of it.

675
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,793
Peoplez found a better candidate.

676
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,756
Thanks to you, Career Way
lost its position in online shopping.

677
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:14,683
If I could, I'd make it impossible
for you to work in this field again.

678
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,227
For now, I'll see what happens.

679
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,478
One more time.

680
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,773
You better show something
that exceeds my expectation.

681
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,067
You're dismissed.

682
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,411
- I need to change my schedule today.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

683
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:47,465
Is it to your taste?

684
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,844
Thank you making time
out of your busy schedule.

685
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,684
Ms. Kim.

686
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,769
You don't have to walk on eggshells.

687
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,855
You have so many projects.

688
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:05,483
There's no need to report to me
every time you fail.

689
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,777
I didn't invest to oversee your company.

690
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:11,531
Let's not meet over such trivial matters.
We're both busy people.

691
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,783
I'll call you when necessary.

692
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:15,785
Thank you for
putting your trust in us, sir.

693
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,832
You haven't shown me anything
that deserves my trust yet.

694
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:23,334
You will from now on.

695
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,504
What happened today
won't be repeated again.

696
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,591
I'll prove that I was the right choice.

697
00:49:37,223 --> 00:49:38,683
Ms. Kang!

698
00:49:45,356 --> 00:49:47,525
Thank you for believing in me.

699
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,069
I haven't done a thing.

700
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:53,031
Mr. Yu told me all about it.

701
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:56,159
You said that you would
take responsibility for everything.

702
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,415
This is for you.

703
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,756
Ms. Cho's special business card holder
that's better than any luxury brand.

704
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,885
Also,

705
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,262
this is for you.

706
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,892
It's a performance organized
by my daughter.

707
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:22,477
She asked for you to come.

708
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,105
She also wanted me to tell you
that she's very grateful.

709
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,983
I'll be sure to attend.

710
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,280
Thank you so much for finding me.

711
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:39,327
Continue your good work for a long time.

712
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,120
I should head back in.

713
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:43,248
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

714
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,478
Do you want to come with me?

715
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,522
Why would I? They're for you.

716
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,233
There are two tickets,

717
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:12,861
and I'm grateful
that you believed in Ms. Cho.

718
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,195
I didn't believe in her.

719
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,573
- What?
- I knew the result.

720
00:51:17,448 --> 00:51:18,366
What result?

721
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,368
I knew that it was genuine.

722
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:24,330
I asked Mr. Woo to get it appraised
by a few more people.

723
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,374
Then when you said…

724
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:29,502
Did you think I'd take responsibility
without having a backup plan?

725
00:51:30,211 --> 00:51:31,921
I told you to stay objective.

726
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,216
Gosh, seriously…

727
00:51:46,185 --> 00:51:47,270
It's not that car.

728
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,448
It's not even similar.

729
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:12,170
We should probably
put a sticker on the car.

730
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:15,423
I'm not a child. We don't need a sticker.

731
00:52:15,506 --> 00:52:17,216
It's better than not finding your car.

732
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,886
What kind of stickers do you like?
Glow in the dark? Glitters?

733
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:22,180
I have all types. I can ask Byeol--

734
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:23,348
I don't want one.

735
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:26,935
Okay.

736
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,771
How about letter stickers?

737
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,525
Like one that says "rookie driver"
on the back of the car.

738
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,569
Except "Ms. Kang" in big font.

739
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,864
I'm sorry.

740
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,995
You two are rather close.
It's making me jealous.

741
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,288
Mr. Woo.

742
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,915
Does it look like we're close?

743
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:51,459
I said no. So don't even try.

744
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:55,004
What is it that you don't want?

745
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,092
Mr. Yu, she isn't harassing you, is she?

746
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:02,637
Please let me know if you need any help.

747
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,557
I know Ms. Kang very well.

748
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,690
Aren't you coming back from Deluxe Line?

749
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,525
I saw the article. Ms. Cho won.

750
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:21,781
She won because Ms. Kang
believed in her until the very end.

751
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,994
As I said, I didn't believe in her.

752
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:29,247
You would have believed in her anyway
without the appraisal result.

753
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:30,873
Amazingly.

754
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,008
I need to get this.
Please go upstairs first.

755
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,053
Yes.

756
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,265
About the interview? Yes.

757
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:48,725
<i>Going up.</i>

758
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,352
It'd be good to take it out.

759
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,397
Oh, yes.

760
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,778
Mr. Yu must think you're a good person.

761
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:05,783
What kind of person is Yu Eun-ho to you?

762
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,120
Mr. Yu?

763
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,544
What kind of question is that?

764
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,130
He's my secretary.

765
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:30,058
What was the appraisal result?

766
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,225
You haven't told me yet.

00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,608

IMPOSSIBLE TO APPRAISE

770
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,618
Is he rubbing off on me?

771
00:54:51,245 --> 00:54:52,955
I was a bit reckless this time.

772
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,754
I can't fall asleep. It's driving me mad.

773
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,686
How did I fall asleep that time?

774

775
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,290
Is this it?

776
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,337
That's not it.

YU EUN-HO

779
00:57:19,143 --> 00:57:20,102
Hello?

780
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,272
Were you sleeping? You just called me.

781
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,276
Did I call you by mistake in my sleep?

782
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,694
I see. Please go back to sleep.

783
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,738
What's the model of your sofa?

784
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:33,032
- Pardon?
- I mean…

785
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,954
Actually, I have a hard time
falling asleep because I'm sensitive.

786
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,289
I don't think so.
You slept so well that day.

787
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,832
Exactly.

788
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,585
I think that it was because of your sofa.

789
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,920
Weren't you sleeping just now?

790
00:57:46,003 --> 00:57:48,172
When I wake up, I can't fall asleep.

791
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,507
You woke me up.

792
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:51,759
So what's the model of your sofa?

793
00:57:51,842 --> 00:57:53,052
Tell me now.

794
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:56,138
I'll take a look and let you know.

795
00:57:57,014 --> 00:57:59,141
What about tonight? You're already awake.

796
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,021
Thanks to you,
I won't be sleeping tonight.

797
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,439
Because of me?

798
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,235
There's something that I do.

799
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:13,489
Drinking warm milk helps me fall asleep.

800
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,032
Why don't you try that?

801
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,913
Don't expect everyone
to have milk at home.

802
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:26,669
By any chance, do you have

803
00:58:26,752 --> 00:58:28,504
any other solution?

804
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:31,674
Shall I read you a book?

805
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:33,426
It always works on Byeol.

806
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:36,512
Am I a child?

807
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,598
- You're not that different--
- What?

808
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,890
I'm sorry.

809
00:58:46,939 --> 00:58:48,357
I'll take care of it.

810
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,901
I'll be hanging up now.

811
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:51,902
Okay.

812
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,448
Sleep well.

813
00:58:56,782 --> 00:58:57,742
Okay.

814
00:58:59,076 --> 00:59:00,161
Sleep well.

815
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,630
Don't have nightmares.

816
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,772
<i>Going up.</i>

817
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:12,692
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

818
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:15,194
Ms. Seo.

819
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,755
What? You look pretty.

820
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,924
Oh, thanks.

821
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:38,843
Are you going somewhere tonight?

822
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,761
- No.
- <i>Going up.</i>

823
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,764
That's odd. You're pretty.

824
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,396
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

825
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:52,148
I was about to call you.

826
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,107
Perfect timing.

827
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,650
I'm borrowing Mr. Yu for the day.

828
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,235
What is this about?

829
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:58,070
Heonjo Group is planning on reorganizing.

830
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,365
Mr. Yu has a lot of experience
since he worked in HR.

831
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,201
It'd be favorable for us
to bring an expert.

832
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,828
That's a good idea. Go with him.

833
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:07,830
Where's Mr. Yu?

834
01:01:07,913 --> 01:01:09,665
He went downstairs to get ready.

835
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,543
Our meeting might end late today.

836
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:15,004
I'll let him get off work
right after the meeting.

837
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:19,884
Ms. Kang?

838
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,010
Yes?

839
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,470
Oh, okay.

840
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,346
- Go ahead and do that.
- Okay.

841
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,809
Why are you so dressed up today?

842
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,312
It's my usual outfit.

843
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:33,105
Good luck.

844
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:38,861
Something seems different about her.

845
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,528
MESSAGE FROM YU EUN-HO

846
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,905
<i>I'll be there on time.</i>

847
01:02:22,988 --> 01:02:24,240
<i>See you at the recital.</i>

848
01:02:31,455 --> 01:02:33,541
<i>Don't worry about useless things.</i>

849
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,834
<i>Focus on the meeting.</i>

850
01:03:11,328 --> 01:03:13,747
Well, after that was in the clear,

851
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,666
he was interviewed by the executives

852
01:03:15,749 --> 01:03:17,543
and passed through without a hitch.

853
01:03:17,626 --> 01:03:19,962
I'll contact them
and confirm the interview dates.

854
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,797
Okay, that sounds good.

855
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:51,744
What's gotten into her?

856
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,164
Where is she going?

857
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,615
<i>What kind of person</i>

858
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:37,117
<i>is Yu Eun-ho to you?</i>

859

{\an8}<i>If they keep seeing each other,</i>

860
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,497
{\an8}<i>it means that they have feelings</i>
<i>for each other.</i>

861
01:08:48,123 --> 01:08:50,375
{\an8}<i>What's wrong with falling?</i>
<i>You can get back up.</i>

862
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,501
{\an8}<i>I'll hold you.</i>

863
01:08:52,502 --> 01:08:56,548
{\an8}<i>Ji-yun, did something happen to you?</i>
<i>Are you aware you aren't focused at work?</i>

864
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,843
{\an8}<i>I have someone who's on my mind.</i>

865
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,386
{\an8}<i>Have you checked</i>
<i>why she wants to change jobs?</i>

866
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,846
{\an8}<i>Dating at work?</i>

867
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,431
{\an8}<i>They broke up recently.</i>

868
01:09:04,514 --> 01:09:06,558
{\an8}<i>She's having a hard time working with him.</i>

869
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,269
{\an8}<i>Get me a new secretary.</i>
<i>It interferes with my work.</i>

870
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,771
{\an8}<i>He keeps going over the line.</i>

871
01:09:10,854 --> 01:09:13,315
{\an8}- <i>Ms. Kang, did I do something wrong?</i>
- I'm off.

872
01:09:13,398 --> 01:09:15,567
{\an8}Mr. Yu, you didn't do anything wrong.

873
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,526
{\an8}I'm the problem.

874
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,821
I like you, Eun-ho.
