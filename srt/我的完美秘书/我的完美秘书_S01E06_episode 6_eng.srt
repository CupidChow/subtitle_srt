 ♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,230

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,170
    
 ♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,140

16
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,610
Save me!

17
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,070
There's a person here! Save me!

18
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,580
Excuse me, please hold my child.

19
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,100
Ji Yun, wait here, okay?

20
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,540
No! Dad, no! Dad, don't go. Don't go!

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,630
- Don't go! 
 - I'll bring her out real quick.

22
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,250
No! I don't want you to! Don't go!

23
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,440
My daughter, I'll be quick. Okay?

24
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,570
Dad! Dad! Dad!

25
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,170
Dad! Dad!

26
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,120
Dad!

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,930
Dad! Dad!

28
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,070
Dad!

29
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,890
You said you would come back.

30
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,840
You said you would return! You told me to wait! 
    

31
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,890
Don't go...

32
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,300
- What? 
 - Pardon?

33
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,380
- What? 
 - What do you mean by "what"?

34
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,660
The sun, right now.

35
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,920
- What time is it? 
 - "What time"?

36
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,010
What happened? Why did I...

37
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:44,470
 Appa, get a girlfriend and go on dates. It's blazing Friday night. 

38
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,930
- We must go now. 
 - Where?

39
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,480
- They left already. 
 - Who?

40
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,150
- My daughter! 
 - "Daughter... daughter."

41
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,040
"Daughter"?

42
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,880
Why did you oversleep? Didn't you set an alarm?

43
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,430
I did set it, but...

44
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,500
- But did we do something? 
 - Pardon?

45
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,900
We didn't hold hands or anything. We just ate together and slept...

46
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,860
Is it tasty?

47
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,160
Appa...

48
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,700
Byeol...

49
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,300
Let's go.

50
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,050
I-I'm getting off.

51
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,470
But that lady just now... I think I know her.

52
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,730
Where did I see her?

53
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,310
- Daddy, are you lying about something? 
 - No.

54
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,590
I think he lied.

55
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,760
No.

56
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,380
Are you okay?

57
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,170
Yes, I think it stopped.

58
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,080
- It was a disaster, right? 
 - Don't even make me speak.

59
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,990
She sobbed that Daddy wasn't there. I had to get her a treat.

60
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,600
Thank you so much for today, Ms. Jeong.

61
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,160
- I really overslept. 
 - Did you get home late last night?

62
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,890
You fell asleep on the couch?

63
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,670
No, no, I thought I put things away, but I guess not.

64
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,440
I'll watch Seo Jun today.

65
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,220
I would love that! Thank you.

66
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,120
Was someone else here last night?

67
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,540
   

68
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,930
   

69
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,620
   

70
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,190
Aigoo.

71
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,370
   

72
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,840
Is that little girl Secretary Yu's daughter?

73
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,070
That's no surprise. They're oddly similar.

74
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,010
 You did well. 
   

75
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,900
 I thought I'd give a proper compliment. 

76
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,750
   

77
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,300
Hello. Hello!

78
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,460
Hold the elevator!

79
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,200
Thank—

80
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,150
Good morning.

81
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,230
Good morning.

82
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,140
Did you have a nice weekend?

83
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,900
Sure... Did you have a good weekend?

84
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,020
Yes, I did.

85
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,780
Except for getting pushed out by someone.

86
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,870
I'm sorry. Did you get home all right?

87
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,630
I arrived at work, didn't I?

88
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,690
I thought you'd never ask.

89
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,860
Your daughter—

90
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,380
Did she say anything?

91
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,910
My daughter?

92
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,730
Nothing. Never mind.

93
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,120
Let me ask you one thing.

94
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,190
- Why did you push me out? 
 - Why did you run away?

95
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,640
- That's what I'm saying. 
 - That's what I'm saying.

96
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,350
- Let's g— 
 - Let's go.

97
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,900
Mom.

98
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,670
Ju Hee is here!

99
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,920
- Did you poke yourself? Let me see. 
 - No, it's okay.

100
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,240
- Are you bleeding? 
 - No, I'm not.

101
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,360
So heartbreaking. Look at your hands.

102
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,950
I work with my hands. Of course, they look like this.

103
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,260
Did you get stuck in traffic?

104
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,500
It was fine.

105
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,190
Are you still busy these days?

106
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,520
Of course! Your mom is a master, you know.

107
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,450
Ju Hee, these people called "headhunters..."

108
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,790
Mom, can you stop working?

109
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,340
What?

110
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,140
You sit in this cramped room sewing all day.

111
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,650
Your hands are an eyesore from sewing leather.

112
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,190
How much money are you making anyway?

113
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,460
I and my husband make money now.

114
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,360
Stop putting yourself through this. Close the shop.

115
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,850
Every time I see your hands, it breaks my heart.

116
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,500
Are they that hard to look at?

117
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,830
 Your hands must feel unrewarded after working so hard all this time. 

118
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,560
 You have very special hands, Ma'am. 

119
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,930
 Don't underestimate the value of all those years. 

120
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,640
Excuse me.

121
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,620
I'm here to see CEO Kang Ji Yun.

122
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,000
The CEO...

123
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,810
Ma'am!

124
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,740
Ms. Jo, have you made a decision?

125
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,750
If a place needs my help, I'd like to try.

126
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,240
I mean... I want to give it a try.

127
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,200
Ms. Jo! Really? I—

128
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
I—

129
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,950
Ms. Jo, you saved my life.

130
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,540
   

131
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,350
 This looks so delicious. 

132
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,000
Try this.

133
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,310
I'll have the bigger one.

134
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,720
So tender. Try it! Try!

135
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,870
How is it? Soft, right?

136
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,640
- It's acceptable. 
 - Should we add fried rice? Let's do it.

137
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,810
Ma'am, one order of fried rice, please!

138
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,630
Hey, anyway...

139
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,230
thank goodness we found a candidate for Deluxe Line before the deadline.

140
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,690
Now, we can all breathe.

141
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,000
She decided quicker than I expected.

142
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,220
This is all due to Secretary Yu and Gwang Hee.

143
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,860
Did you praise them a little?

144
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,670
Is there anyone who doesn't work hard?

145
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,080
I told you to stop comparing everyone else to you.

146
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,910
I mean, Eun Ho is something else. He's emulating you.

147
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,910
He even wanted to work the day Byeol went camping—

148
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,680
Perhaps it's better to not mention that.

149
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,770
You talked big, then bailed on your plans.

150
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,110
My schedule got messed up.

151
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,440
I'm upset that I couldn't come.

152
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,100
You ate a delicious meal, thanks to me.

153
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,880
Hey, Eun Ho is an amazing cook, right?

154
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,220
I'll give him that.

155
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,090
- The child who frequents the bookstore 
 - Yes?

156
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,420
is Secretary Yu's daughter, right?

157
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,980
That's Byeol. Kang Seok says she spends time with you a lot.

158
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,100
He did a good job raising her by himself, right?

159
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,970
She seems smart and cute.

160
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,140
So...

161
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,800
how long has he been raising her alone?

162
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,730
I heard he got divorced before she turned one.

163
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,940
- "Divorced"? 
 - Yes.

164
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,610
I heard they were a famous campus couple in college.

165
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,920
They married right after graduation; it seemed a happy ever after...

166
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,860
but when they got divorced so quickly, Kang Seok was shocked.

167
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,690
They separated with a newborn, after all.

168
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,340
Why did they break up?

169
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,700
Kang Seok doesn't know the exact details, either.

170
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,870
Eun Ho is not the type to mention such things.

171
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,420
He has moved Heaven and Earth to raise her.

172
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,470
It must have been tough raising a child alone.

173
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,770
He put everything he had into her.

174
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,230
You know, paternity leave—

175
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,570
What?

176
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,830
Why did you stop talking?

177
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,260
I'm talking incessantly about somebody else, right?

178
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,070
- He's not just somebody. 
 - He's not... what?

179
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,740
Is he not?

180
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,890
Then... what? Are you—

181
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,970
He's my secretary.

182
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,060
I should know what my secretary endured, right?

183
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,290
You told me to take interest in my employees.

184
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,510
Right. Pure interest in your employees is a good thing.

185
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,130
Byeol was sick. So he gave up his career and everything...

186
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,630
He took a full year off work just to be with Byeol.

187
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,230
That's why he fell out of favor at work.

188
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,160
Eun Ho is a great dad.

189
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,190
 So why did you take paternity leave, 

190
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,270
 instead of working on your career? 

191
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,760
 I wanted to see her smile. My daughter has such a pretty smile. 

192
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,330
 She needed me. I promised her I'd stay by her side, 

193
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,840
 and I kept my promise. 

194
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,530
 I am all that my daughter has. 

195
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,960
Right.

196
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,010
He's a good dad.

197
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,950
That tickles!

198
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,870
It'll smudge if you move.

199
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,650
Okay. I'll hold my breath.

200
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,620
Why are you so interested in manicures suddenly? You never cared.

201
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,790
I want to show them off to a cool girl.

202
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,840
The girl you met at the bookstore?

203
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,940
Whoever it is, you must really like her.

204
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,980
I'll introduce you to her next time.

205
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,850
Don't move! It'll smudge.

206
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,610
Are you looking at me with loving eyes?

207
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,090
You look super ugly right now when you focus.

208
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,900
No, I look super handsome when I focus.

209
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,090
All done! What do you think? Do you like it, Miss?

210
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,960
Well, very good.

211
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,350
Let's wait five minutes for it to dry then you go to sleep.

212
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,350
Appa, you need one, too!

213
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,130
No, I don't need one.

214
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,950
- Do I really have to? 
 - Yes.

215
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,320
Don't move!

216
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,310
It tickles.

217
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,450
   

218
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,860
   

219
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,750
CEO Kang, let me be honest with you.

220
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,070
I was offended when I got this.

221
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,170
I didn't lose my first choice candidate and wait this long

222
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,940
to see this kind of person.

223
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,040
Did you want to hire for their résumé or their skills?

224
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,680
You haven't seen anything yet.

225
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,630
Make her prove herself to you.

226
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,680
Use whatever method you want.

227
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,340
Are you that confident?

228
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,780
I wouldn't recommend someone if I wasn't.

229
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,760
 CEO. 

230
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,790
What is this intrusion?

231
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,610
I apologize, but you need to see this.

232
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,380
   

233
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,540
   

234
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,630
   

235
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,350
- What is this? 
 - A bag from our site was authenticated by Luxury Seller

236
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,360
and determined to be counterfeit.

237
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,800
"Luxury Seller"? The one who took our candidate?

238
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,280
Let's talk of hiring another time. I need to deal with this.

239
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,800
So? What are they saying? Why do they think it's fake?

240
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,050
The margins of the logo differ slightly from the authentic one.

241
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,470
 Call the buyer and check the facts... 

242
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,640
What's going on? What is it? Did something happen?

243
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,460
I think the company has some trouble. 
    

244
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,250
What is this? "Knockoff allegations"?

245
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,100
It happens to be with Luxury Seller. This could get serious.

246
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,290
Let's monitor this.

247
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,660
I think it's real.

248
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,630
Do you think it's real?

249
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,330
I mean, I can't be 100% sure without seeing it in person...

250
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,310
If you see it in person, will you be certain?

251
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,990
This is the bag we got from the buyer.

252
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,600
   

253
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,620
What do you think? Is it real or fake?

254
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,190
It...

255
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,130
is real.

256
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,090
The number of stitches, their angle,

257
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,850
direction and thickness are all consistent and accurate.

258
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,190
This bag has straight stitching as well as curved stitching,

259
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,730
and both are accurate.

260
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,790
But couldn't someone get it custom-made to copy it?

261
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,350
That's possible.

262
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,750
How frustrating. Crap.

263
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,300
- How can you— 
 - Sir.

264
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,930
Let's let her finish.

265
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,300
But they couldn't imitate the coating of the leather perfectly.

266
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,840
Every brand has a different method of coating their leather.

267
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,730
That slight difference impacts the texture,

268
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,920
which cannot be quantified by numbers.

269
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,200
If you feel it, you can tell the difference in the coating,

270
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,340
but I don't know the exact numbers. It's more like...

271
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,790
I can tell from my fingertips.

272
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,700
CEO, we should issue a rebuttal.

273
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,170
I mean, can I really trust this person and risk it all?

274
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,800
You decide if you can trust her or not.

275
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,670
If you hadn't lost the other candidate in the first place, this wouldn't have happened!

276
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,360
Do you still trust them more?

277
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,830
Then just admit that it's fake.

278
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,170
CEO Kang, are you saying we sold a fake?

279
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,290
A transparent import, custom, and distribution process is our pride!

280
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,680
This case was also confirmed for no distribution issues.

281
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,090
It's set then.

282
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,170
You say it's real, and so does our candidate.

283
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,290
There's no reason for you to hesitate.

284
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,780
CEO, we should release a statement first

285
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,610
and send the bag to the brand to get it accurately evaluated.

286
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,520
   

287
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,850
 Apologize! Say sorry! 

288
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,260
Jeong Tae!

289
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,210
Jeong Tae, are you okay?

290
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,980
Seo Jun, you shouldn't push a friend!

291
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,200
I'm sorry, Principal. I'm so sorry.

292
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,310
How's his friend? Is he okay?

293
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,950
Yes. Thankfully, he wasn't hurt.

294
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,900
I spoke to Jeong Tae's mother, too.

295
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,460
Thank goodness.

296
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,720
But Seo Jun isn't usually like that.

297
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,820
What do you think happened?

298
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,340
I think Jeong Tae teased Seo Jun.

299
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,530
But I think his pride was hurt. He won't tell me.

300
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:58,670
Jeong Seo Jun, you're not going to tell Grandma why you did it?

301
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:05,580
Then tell me, Byeol. Why did Seo Jun fight with his friend?

302
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,500
- Well... 
 - Don't ask Byeol.

303
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,790
Then will you tell me, Seo Jun?

304
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,410
Byeol, I want to talk with Seo Jun alone for a second.

305
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,040
Grandma, I'll be at Uncle's bookstore.

306
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,710
That one.

307
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,470
Okay, that works. Let's walk over there together.

308
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,390
 ­  

309
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,940
What are you doing here?

310
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,280
Oh, Unnie!

311
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,050
Aren't you here to read books? Why not go in?

312
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,240
Isn't it cute?

313
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,150
It's a baby.

314
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,550
It's been alone this whole time.

315
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,470
Do you want to find its mom?

316
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,740
Its mom might have abandoned it, too.

317
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,820
Then we can find its dad.

318
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,530
You don't always need a mom.

319
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,660
Maybe the dad cat is looking for his baby right now.

320
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,900
Also, this is a secret, but...

321
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,910
my mom died when I was young.

322
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,260
I had only a daddy.

323
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,450
Really?

324
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,840
Did other children tease you?

325
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,130
I didn't play with dumb ones like that.

326
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
Also, I don't know if you'll understand this, but...

327
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,060
love is about quality, not quantity.

328
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,320
Two parents don't mean you get twice as much love.

329
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,940
If one person truly loves you, that's all you need.

330
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,020
Kitty!

331
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,620
Byeol!

332
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,310
Jeong Tae teased us for not having a dad and mom.

333
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,480
What?

334
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,020
He said Byeol and I were "half families."

335
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,780
That boy...

336
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,910
Where did he learn such a bad thing to say?

337
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,930
- Seo Jun. 
 - Grandma.

338
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,920
I'm fine. My family isn't half.

339
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,030
I have a mom and a grandma. I have everyone.

340
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,340
Of course, we're not half.

341
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,520
So many people love you, Seo Jun.

342
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,850
You should have just ignored him. Why did you push him?

343
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,850
I'm fine, but

344
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,660
I didn't want Byeol to be sad.

345
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,940
Byeol heard it, too?

346
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,960
Yes. Byeol gets sad a lot, Grandma.

347
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,530
Good job!

348
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,950
Aigoo. When did my boy grow up so much?

349
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,900
But still, don't hit someone, okay?

350
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,060
That's a really bad thing.

351
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,420
Okay.

352
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,360
But... I'm Mommy's boy.

353
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,570
Byeol isn't here?

354
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,830
No, I haven't seen her today.

355
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,540
I walked her to the door earlier.

356
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,020
What?

357
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,000
Let me go outside and look.

358
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,050
Where did she go?

359
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,820
Where...

360
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,630
Where did she go? 
    

361
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,250
   

362
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,470
Luxury Seller discounted our rebuttal.

363
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,690
They're still saying it's fake.

364
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,140
People usually don't accuse in these situations.

365
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,990
I feel they're trying to fan the flames.

366
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,770
They're trying to contrast the two companies.

367
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,050
It will decide whose authentication system is stronger.

368
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,210
So are they saying they're just as confident?

369
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,170
Ms. Jo will be okay, right?

370
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,900
I'll call her.

371
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,730
   

372
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,110
   

373
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,570
Hey, Ms. Jeong. What's going on?

374
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,020
Byeol? O-Okay. I'll be right there.

375
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,320
Eun Ho, did something happen to Byeol?

376
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,620
Director, I need to go.

377
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,490
Go, go. Explain later.

378
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,890
Hyungnim!

379
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,300
 Some people said they saw Byeol outside the bookstore. 

380
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,930
 We called the police, and everyone is looking. 

381
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,120
 I'm on my way to the bookstore. 

382
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,970
 Don't worry, Mr. Yu. 

383
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,540
 She will be somewhere nearby. 

384
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,790
   

385
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,000
Yes, CEO. I'm going somewhere right now.

386
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,210
 - Byeol is with me.  
 - Excuse me?

387
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,530
 A bicycle hit Byeol outside the bookstore. 

388
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,490
She's a little hurt, nothing serious.

389
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,460
Where are you?

390
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,770
   

391
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,930
Excuse me. Have you seen Byeol?

392
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,170
They stepped out for a second. They'll be right back.

393
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,820
- Appa! 
 - Byeol!

394
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,630
Byeol! Are you okay?

395
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm sorry, Appa. The kitten just started running.

396
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,200
But I don't hurt at all. I mean it!

397
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,730
They took care of her wounds.

398
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,230
I had them run some tests just in case.

399
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,400
The results aren't out yet.

400
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,270
I'm sorry.

401
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,890
But how did you and Byeol...

402
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,120
I told you, the cool unnie from the bookstore.

403
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,800
Well...

404
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,200
Thank you for everything.

405
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,030
But I didn't realize the person Byeol talked about was you.

406
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,610
I figured it out only recently, too.

407
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,330
Go inside. She's alone.

408
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,590
Okay. The work I didn't finish...

409
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,160
Just focus on your child today.

410
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,550
Bye.

411
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,380
   

412
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Hi, Director Seo.

413
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,840
Right, the meeting.

414
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,080
It'll take me an hour to get back.

415
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,840
Okay. Then let's do it tomorrow morning.

416
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,720
Yes.

417
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,370
Oh, Eun Ho...

418
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,520
You saw him? Where? How did you see Eun Ho?

419
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Oh, I see. Okay, understood. Bye.

420
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,180
- What? CEO Kang saw Secretary Yu? 
 - Yes.

421
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,420
He said Byeol was missing, and he had to go look for her.

422
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,070
So how did CEO Kang meet Eun Ho?

423
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,010
So strange.

424
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,340
   

425
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,670
I feel they keep bumping into each other.

426
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,730
Is it just me?

427
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,550
Whom do I blame?

428
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:50,550
Director Seo for bringing in Secretary Yu or the gods?

429
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,430
What are you saying?

430
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,650
So the meeting is canceled, right?

431
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,650
I'm going home.

432
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,890
What is wrong with him?

433
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,230
What did he... What did he say?

434
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,890
Is Seo Jun okay?

435
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,590
He's asleep. Today must have been tough.

436
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,830
We were all so scared.

437
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,320
- Byeol wasn't hurt too badly, was she? 
 - No.

438
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,150
I'm headed to the hospital. I'll call you once I see her.

439
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,270
Sure, go ahead.

440
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,010
How can I face Byeol's dad?

441
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,250
Gosh, how did I leave her alone?

442
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,280
Mom, don't say that.

443
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,580
Don't think and get some rest.

444
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,240
Today was scary for you, too.

445
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,580
Su Hyeon...

446
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,560
I noticed today that our Seo Jun isn't just a little child anymore.

447
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,230
How long are you going to hide it?

448
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,870
It's time for him to know.

449
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,210
Yes.

450
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,030
Let me think about it.

451
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,650
Okay.

452
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,160
He's your son. You know best.

453
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,540
Go, go.

454
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,180
I'll be back, Mom. I'll call you.

455
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,250
 Something happened at the kindergarten today. 

456
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,620
 A boy teased Byeol and Seo Jun for having one parent. 

457
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,300
 Seo Jun said Byeol was really sad. 

458
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,020
 I don't think this was the first time. 

459
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,410
Ms. CEO? 
    

460
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,540
I thought you might have skipped dinner.

461
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,110
   

462
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,810
Are you okay?

463
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,430
Oh, yes.

464
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,050
To be honest,

465
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,010
I don't know.

466
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,780
I do my best, but

467
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,260
I feel like

468
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,130
I'm hitting a wall at times.

469
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,980
You're doing a good job.

470
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,800
Secretary Yu, at least...

471
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,360
you're always there when Byeol calls for you.

472
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,870
I'm sure Byeol knows

473
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,420
how hard you try.

474
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,970
So...

475
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,880
just keep being

476
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,750
by your daughter's side, like now.

477
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,590
Where is the emergency room?

478
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,940
That way.

479
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,460
Thank you.

480
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,290
Eun Ho! How's Byeol?

481
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,700
Hi, Ms. Jeong.

482
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,790
Say hi. She's our CEO.

483
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,140
Hello.

484
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,580
This is the writer, Jeong Su Hyeon.

485
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,790
I'm Eun Ho's friend. I've heard a lot about you.

486
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,640
Yes. Hello.

487
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,750
I'm leaving then.

488
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,500
Just a second.

489
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,270
I'm okay. Don't come outside.

490
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,760
Where's Byeol?

491
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,040
Oh, she's asleep. Let's go inside.

492
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,920
- Ms. Jeong? 
 - Oh?

493
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,120
I hope today is a peaceful day.

494
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,920
I'm scared to open the news.

495
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,570
- Hi, Gyeong Hwa. 
 - Hello.

496
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,350
- Hi, Gyu Rim. 
 - Good morning.

497
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,280
Secretary Yu, is your daughter okay?

498
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,670
Yes, she's okay now.

499
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,800
Thank goodness! Everyone was so worried.

500
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,700
Thank you.

501
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,610
Go in.

502
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,400
Gyu Rim?

503
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,270
I think you two need to see this.

504
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,110
   

505
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,120
Career Way surely wrote this article. 
    

506
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,300
Wow, how nasty.

507
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,990
They're really touting their authenticator's résumé.

508
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,680
It just feels like a big middle finger.

509
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,290
Anyone would think Deluxe Line is at a disadvantage here.

510
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,570
Opinions were 50-50, but after these articles...

511
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,490
Who the heck is this?

512
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,270
- What? 
 - What's going on now?

513
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,570
People who make luxury content...

514
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,240
They've all staked an interest since yesterday.

515
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,170
Blabbering on, doing analysis...

516
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,680
All the neighborhood experts are out.

517
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,520
So what are they saying?

518
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,790
Everyone says it's fake.

519
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,170
   

520
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,040
   

521
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,060
   

522
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,940
   

523
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,990
   

524
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,980
Secretary Yu, let's go to the shop.

525
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,480
Okay.

526
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,300
   

527
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,780
 One moment. 

528
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,170
Ms. Jo?

529
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,980
Ms. Jo?

530
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,990
She must have gone somewhere.

531
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,310
Excuse me, have you seen Ms. Jo?

532
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:45,570
Welcome. You must be looking for my mom.

533
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,790
Yes.

534
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,910
   

535
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:04,130
Things got so big, and I had no idea.

536
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,490
What happens if my mom makes an appraisal mistake?

537
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,500
Will she be responsible for anything?

538
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,540
Ms. Jo performed the authentication only as our recommended candidate.

539
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,700
She won't be liable in the final determination.

540
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,020
Oh, the hiring may be canceled.

541
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,480
What if she doesn't want the job? Can it be refused?

542
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,670
It's her choice. They haven't hired her yet.

543
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,400
What do you two think?

544
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,430
Do you think my mom is right about the bag?

545
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,160
What do you think? As her daughter, what do you think?

546
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,620
I recently told her to stop working.

547
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,900
I didn't want her to struggle anymore.

548
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,760
But what is all this?

549
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,790
Have you ever asked her why she keeps doing this work?

550
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,390
In her 37 years, she took only two years off.

551
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,500
From your birth until you turned two, Ju Hee.

552
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,200
I heard. That's why

553
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,330
I wish she would stop working now.

554
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,910
She said this work makes her happy.

555
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,580
When she returned to the shop after two years and smelled leather again,

556
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,550
she said she felt happy.

557
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,550
To her, I doubt this job is just about money.

558
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,040
She has pride in her work.

559
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,330
Like you are proud of yours, Ju Hee.

560
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,640
 Stop putting yourself through this. Close the shop. 

561
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,040
 How much money are you making anyway? 

562
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,410
Mom...

563
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,680
Ju Hee!

564
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,920
Ju Hee!

565
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,020
Don't worry about it. I'm not doing it.

566
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,920
Ms. CEO, Eun Ho, I don't want it.

567
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,810
I can't. Let's just pretend like none of this happened.

568
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,100
Do you really want to quit?

569
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,110
Everyone said I'm wrong.

570
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,970
I hear all those people are smart.

571
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:14,770
I didn't know how big this was. I don't want to be responsible.

572
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:20,790
So let's stop this before you get in more trouble.

573
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:24,680
Then do you think they're right?

574
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,820
Who would believe me anyway?

575
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,130
Mom.

576
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,540
I believe you.

577
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,400
If you say it's real,

578
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,410
it is real.

579
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,150
My mom doesn't know how to cut corners.

580
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,900
She says she wants to protect people's memories.

581
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,700
 Separating things, studying their details, developing materials... 

582
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,830
 all her life. 

583
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,570
She spent her whole life doing that.

584
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,750
It's not because she's my mom.

585
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,470
Whatever the field, someone like that speaks,

586
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,910
you can believe it.

587
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,950
I can vouch for that.

588
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,870
Ju Hee...

589
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,900
Mom.

590
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,360
How can you not believe yourself?

591
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,600
You're an amazing person.

592
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,630
I know that.

593
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,070
You do what pleases you.

594
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,350
What do you want to do?

595
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,050
It's your choice, Ma'am.

596
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,120
   

597
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:14,020
   

598
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,750
CEO.

599
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,370
The brand appraisal results are here.

600
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,550
   

601
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,590
It's authentic.

602
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,010
   

603
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,870
I told you it was real.

604
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,020
Ma'am.

605
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,470
You saved me.

606
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,960
I look forward to working with you.

607
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,660
Oh, I'm the one happy to do it.

608
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,040
CEO, stand up, Sir.

609
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,080
 The brand's headquarters stated that the 

610
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,640
 logo spacing was their production line changes. 

611
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,790
 The brand, in order to prevent counterfeits, 

612
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:51,810
 changes its production line every few years— 

613
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,200
I'm so sorry, CEO.

614
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,500
I'll handle the breach of contract fees with Luxury Seller.

615
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,300
So Peoplez found a better candidate.

616
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,600
Thanks to that, Career Way lost its standing in the online shopping sector.

617
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:15,500
I am tempted to make sure you never work in this town again, Mr. Go Jeong Nam, but

618
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,100
I will observe you one more time.

619
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,690
You'll have to exceed my expectations.

620
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,340
Go.

621
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,740
I need to switch my schedule today.

622
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,500
 Yes, CEO. 

623
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,070
Is the food to your liking?

624
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,640
I know you're busy. Thank you for giving me your time.

625
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,360
CEO Kim.

626
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,020
Don't worry about me. I know you have many projects.

627
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,490
You don't need to report to me every time one fails.

628
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,310
I didn't invest in you to monitor all that.

629
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:12,170
We're both busy people. Let's not meet.

630
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,140
If I need you, I'll call you.

631
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,940
Thank you for your trust, Chairman.

632
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:21,070
I don't think you've shown me anything trustworthy yet.

633
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,690
You will see it soon.

634
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,390
What happened today won't happen again.

635
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,400
I will prove to you that I'm the better choice.

636
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,220
   

637
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,350
 CEO! 

638
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,600
Thank you for believing in me.

639
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,960
I didn't do anything.

640
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,970
I heard it all from Secretary Yu.

641
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,760
You said you would be responsible for everything.

642
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,230
Here. Take this.

643
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,940
It's better than a luxury wallet,

644
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,970
a Ms. Jo signature card case.

645
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,270
Also...

646
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,530
this is for you, Secretary.

647
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,070
My daughter produces this performance.

648
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,000
She really wants you to come see it.

649
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,920
She also told me to say thank you.

650
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,200
Yes. I will be there.

651
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:35,230
Thank you... for recognizing me.

652
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,780
Best of luck to both of you.

653
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,580
I'm heading back in.

654
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,070
- Thank you! 
 - Sure.

655
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,510
   

656
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,700
Want to go together?

657
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,460
Why would I go? She gave them to you.

658
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,240
There are two tickets,

659
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,290
and I'm thankful to you for your faith in Ms. Jo.

660
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,820
It's not about faith.

661
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,250
- What? 
 - I knew what the results would be.

662
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,820
What results?

663
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,160
I knew it was authentic.

664
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,700
I asked Director Woo to authenticate it in a few other places.

665
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,360
Then that's...

666
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,030
Do you think I would say I'd take responsibility without a plan?

667
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,790
I told you, don't lose your objectivity.

668
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,050
Wow, seriously...

669
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,080
That's not our car.

670
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,160
They don't even look similar.

671
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,180
I think I need to put a sticker on the car.

672
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,310
I'm not a child. "A sticker"?

673
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,440
It's better than you not recognizing it.

674
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,900
What stickers do you like? Glow-in-the-dark? Sparkly? I have all kinds.

675
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,200
- I'll ask Byeol— 
 - I said no.

676
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,570
Got it.

677
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:30,520
What about stickers with writing?

678
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:33,340
Like the ones that say "New Driver"?

679
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:37,670
A big one on the car's back that says "CEO Kang."

680
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,470
I'm sorry.

681
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,990
Why are you two so friendly? I'm getting jealous.

682
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,590
Hello, Director Woo.

683
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,810
Does this look friendly to you?

684
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:52,590
Anyway, I hate that. No.

685
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,740
What? What do you hate?

686
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,070
Secretary Yu, is she bullying you?

687
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:02,390
If you need help, please let me know.

688
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,110
I know a lot about CEO Kang.

689
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,810
You were just at Deluxe Line, right?

690
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:16,650
I saw the article. Ms. Jo won!

691
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,500
It's because CEO Kang believed in her all the way that we could win.

692
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:26,040
I told you, it wasn't like that.

693
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,650
You would without authentication results.

694
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,440
So awesome.

695
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,880
I have to take this call. Go on up.

696
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,250
Yes.

697
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,760
Oh, yes, the interview?

698
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,250
Yes.

699
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,910
Please don't include that.

700
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,010
Yes.

701
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,280
Secretary Yu seems to think highly of Kang Ji Yun.

702
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,700
To Kang Ji Yun, what kind of person is Yu Eun Ho?

703
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,110
Secretary Yu?

704
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,230
What do you mean?

705
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,990
He's my secretary.

706
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,330
So what was the authentication result? You didn't tell me.

707
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,600
   

708
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,410
   

709
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:47,200
   

710
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,400
I'm becoming like someone.

711
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,630
I was a little reckless this time.

712
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:42,250
This insomnia is killing me.

713
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:57,670
How did I fall asleep at that time?

714
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,240
Was this it?

715
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,840
No...

716
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,980
   

717
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:59,240
   

718
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,850
   

719
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,390
Hello?

720
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:24,500
Were you asleep? You called me so—

721
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,160
I think I sleepily dialed by accident.

722
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,870
Okay. Good night then.

723
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:31,290
What kind of couch do you have?

724
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:33,800
- What? 
 - I mean...

725
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,850
I'm actually quite particular so I have a hard time falling asleep.

726
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,530
I doubt it. You fell asleep easily that night.

727
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:44,490
Exactly. I think it's because of that couch.

728
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,010
You said you were asleep just now—

729
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:50,000
Once I wake up, I can't sleep again. You woke me up!

730
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,960
So what kind of couch? Tell me quickly.

731
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,850
I'll look into it and let you know.

732
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,980
But what will you do today? You're already awake.

733
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:04,500
I can't fall asleep again, thanks to you.

734
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,510
Because of me?

735
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,460
I do have a secret trick. If you warm up some milk, it works.

736
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,800
Want to try that?

737
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,720
Please don't assume every household has milk.

738
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:29,010
Well... is there anything else?

739
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,920
Then shall I read you a book?

740
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,310
It works on Byeol instantly.

741
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,570
Am I a child?

742
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,650
- You're not too different. 
 - What?

743
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,510
I'm sorry.

744
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,040
♫  For countless days  ♫

745
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:50,850
I'll take care of myself. Bye now.

746
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,580
Okay.

747
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,640
Good night.

748
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,270
You, too.

749
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,880

Director Seo.

765
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,260
Yes? You look so pretty.

766
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,610
Thanks.

767
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,460
Are you going somewhere today?

768
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,970
No.

769
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:44,300
That's weird. You look pretty.

770
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,090
What? Where are you going so early?

771
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:53,130
I was about to call you. Nice timing.

772
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,910
I'm borrowing Secretary Yu today.

773
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,280
What's going on?

774
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,060
Hyeonjo Group is restructuring.

775
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,360
Secretary Yu is from HR and has much experience in that area.

776
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,350
It's good for us to bring an expert.

777
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,580
Sounds good. Go for it.

778
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,900
Where is Secretary Yu?

779
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,030
He's downstairs getting ready.

780
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,500
The meeting might run a little late.

781
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,790
I'll let him go home right after.

782

CEO Kang?

783

What?

784
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:24,380
Oh, okay. Do that.

785
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:30,000
But... why are you dressed up so nicely today?

786
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,930
I always dress like this.

787
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,520
Bye now.

788
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,290

823
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:28,760
♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

824
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,770
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

825
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:37,350
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

826
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:43,750
♫  Though it might be sudden  ♫

827
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,510
 I guess the fact that I keep looking at her 

828
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:47,930
 must mean my heart is leaning toward her. 

829
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,260
 So what if you fall? You can always get up again. 

830
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,400
 I'll hold you up. 

831
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,880
 Kang Ji Yun, what is going on with you? 

832
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,770
 Are you aware that you're not focusing on work? 

833
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:59,680
 I found someone whom I care about. 

834
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,700
 - Did you find out why she wants to leave? 
 - A workplace relationship. 

835
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:06,520
 They broke up recently, and it's hard to work together. 

836
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,050
 Get me a new secretary. 

837
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:10,690
 He keeps distracting me from work. He keeps crossing the line. 

838
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:13,320
 - CEO, did I do something wrong? 
 - I'll be back. 

839
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:17,560
 Secretary Yu, you did nothing wrong. I'm the problem. 

840
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,410
 I like you, Yu Eun Ho.  
 ♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫
