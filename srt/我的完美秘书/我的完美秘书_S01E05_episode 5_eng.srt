Secretary Yu.

17
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,850
You're so handsome.

Oh, my head...

36
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,600
What? Was that a dream?

37
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
It can't be...

38
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
No, it must be a dream.

39
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,950
Did you go home in the morning?

40
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,010
Why do you always drag yourself to the office when you're drunk?

41
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,220
We're old now. Sleeping on the couch will hurt your back.

42
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,000
I pity your back for having a bad owner.

43
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,050
Unnie, did everyone get home safely last night?

44
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,830
Yes, I saw them all off.

45
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,790
- Secretary Yu, too? 
 - Yes.

46
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,640
He was looking for you.

47
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,060
I told him not to worry and go home, since you'll go to the office.

48
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,520
Why?

49
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,040
Nothing.

50
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,420
Give me just five minutes.

51
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,960
Was it really a dream?

52
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,090
What did you say?

53
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,690
Nothing.

54
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,150
Five minutes...

55
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,560
   

56
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,450
 You have the international talent-hiring seminar at noon. 

57
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,170
At three, you have the final paper interview for New Economics.

58
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,160
Secretary Yu.

59
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,570
You didn't come here after the staff dinner, did you?

60
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,730
You didn't come here after the staff dinner, did you?

61
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,040
No, I didn't.

62
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
Got it.

63
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,490
Get back to work.

64
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,210
I'll bring you the interview materials.

65
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,710
Yes, Director.

66
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,270
Yes.

67
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,190
 Gosh... 

68
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,450
It's gone.

69
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,870
Pardon?

70
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,900
Oh, nothing.

71
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,360
Yes, I just finished a meeting with the CEO.

72
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,040
Yes.

73
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,710
Yoosun Apparel seeks an executive to oversee global sales.

74
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,360
Ahead of their global expansion,

75
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,150
they established a global headquarters gathering existing team members.

76
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,450
I am compiling a talent list of team leaders and above who impacted

77
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,650
the global headquarters team in the last five years.

78
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,900
A bug...

79
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,540
Is there a bug?

80
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,370
"A bug"?

81
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,270
Yes, Ma'am.

82
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,520
Yes, I know.

83
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,420
 His nose is a work of art. 

84
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,250
Right?

85
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,160
CEO, do you like this idol group, too?

86
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,050
You said it's a work of art.

87
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,800
It is a work of art.

88
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,830
Unexpected.

89
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,670
We don't have to go together. I'll go straight home after the meeting.

90
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,220
I'll take you there.

91
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,310
I'll go alone.

92
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,980
Alone.

93
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,320
CEO Kang.

94
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,590
You'll fall!

95
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,170
She requested this material.

96
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,420
   

97
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,770
   

98
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,280
   

99
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,820
 "The dreams we remember and speak of" 

100
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,680
 "are dreams that seem to have really happened." 

101
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,260
 "We mostly forget dreams that are not like that." 

102
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,640
Ahjumma! (middle-aged)

103
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,520
Brat, you come here often.

104
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,430
I'm not a brat.

105
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm not an ahjumma, either. What book are you reading today?

106
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,170
It's about an ice cream store that opened in Snowman's Town. 
    

107
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,900
They talk about so many yummy ice creams.

108
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,100
So you like ice cream. What's your favorite?

109
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,550
- Mint chocolate chip! 
 - You know flavors.

110
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,090
Ahjumma, do you like mint choco, too?

111
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,720
Yes. Foods aren't my thing, but I like mint chocolate milk.

112
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,520
Have you tried mint chocolate candies?

113
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,260
What about mint chocolate snacks?

114
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,390
Oh, right! There's a new mint chocolate bun. Have you tried it?

115
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,670
Are there so many mint chocolate things?

116
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,250
You haven't tried it?

117
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,790
The store next door sells it. Do you want to go together?

118
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,700
Can you just go?

119
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,030
Where's your mom?

120
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,000
Uncle! Is it okay if I go to the store with this Ahjumma?

121
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,300
 What? 

122
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,310
Yes, sure.

123
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,890
   

124
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,340
   

125
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,210
   

126
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,960
What do you think? It's good, right?

127
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,710
It's good. Have a lot of it.

128
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,080
You shouldn't ask just anyone to go places with you.

129
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,310
You're not just anyone. I don't ask strangers.

130
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,370
Then?

131
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,320
Because I like you, Unnie.

132
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,810
You like me? Also, you just called me Unnie.

133
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,130
Why? Don't you like that name?

134
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,740
What's your name?

135
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,760
Byeol. I'm seven.

136
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,500
Byeol, you've got sharp eyes for a seven-year-old.

137
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,210
Call me Unnie.

138
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,720
   

139
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,290
Lately, Byeol and CEO Kang seem to be getting along.

140
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,650
Byeol...

141
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,700
- Oh, Eun Ho's daughter? 
 - Yes.

142
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,990
They even went to the store together.

143
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,060
But seeing them together...

144
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,370
I felt strange.

145
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,220
Gosh, really...

146
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,030
Why do you feel strange?

147
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,970
Stop writing fiction in your head.

148
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,990
Stop romanticizing people who just work together.

149
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,770
I just...

150
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,600
you know...

151
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,770
You never know.

152
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,730
If you're not working, let's go home.

153
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,710
Can't we even discuss this stuff?

154
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,280
My Kang Ji Yun's too good for him.

155
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,000
Gwang Hee.

156
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,070
Gwang Hee!

157
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,160
Gwang Hee.

158
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,340
My gosh, you scared me.

159
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,780
Look at you. And look at everyone

160
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,490
working so hard while you sit here dozing.

161
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,430
I slept only three hours. I went on a run this morning.

162
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,040
Did you sleep well?

163
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,130
Gwang Hee, back in my day, we saved pennies to buy a house.

164
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,640
Look at yourself.

165
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,910
You're obsessed with brand names. What a show-off.

166
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,320
I show off with the money I make.

167
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,970
Daebak, that's a ridiculously hard-to-get bag.

168
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,130
Who's this stylish person?

169
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,080
 It's nice to meet you. 

170
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,760
- Him? 
 - Who is he?

171
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,690
Come on, Manager.

172
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,620
He's the CEO of the most popular online name-brand platform.

173
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,270
Deluxe Line's CEO Jin Sung Ho.

174
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,900
Oh, I see! A "name-brand platform"...

175
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,920
What is that?

176
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,850
You know, people buy and sell name-brand goods online, right?

177
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,150
Of course, "name-brand platform"...

178
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,560
So what position do they want to fill?

179
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,360
So you seek a name-brand appraiser?

180
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,880
The market has grown, and the demand is high.

181
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,740
But there are few veteran appraisal experts.

182
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,920
When I find good ones, they're hired by competitors.

183
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,240
Those who claim to be certified have only 1-2 years of experience.

184
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,170
It's nearly impossible to find appraisers.

185
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,160
It makes sense that appraisers are hard to find.

186
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,760
The platform's credibility is determined by the appraisers' skills.

187
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,740
With high-value products, a single mistake leads to mistrust.

188
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,130
That's why we need a chief appraiser to oversee the platform,

189
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:19,770
an expert to train appraisers and make final appraisal decisions.

190
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,530
I care about only skills.

191
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,070
That's all I need.

192
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,810
We're on this exclusively, and the salary range is quite wide.

193
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,480
If we find a qualified candidate, they're flexible with the terms.

194
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,830
Don't you think this is too small for us? Must we take it?

195
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,850
They're opening an internal appraisal center.

196
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,420
If this goes well, we will handle the appraisal center exclusively.

197
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,220
That sounds reasonable, not bad.

198
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,960
In that case, this will be...

199
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,300
I think he would jump at the chance.

200
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,330
- It makes sense. 
 - He is an expert.

201
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,940
   

202
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,540
Wh-What are you talking about?

203
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,840
Am I the only one in the dark? Who? Who will take it on?

204
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,940
Who is it?

205
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,870
Gwang Hee.

206
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,950
-  Me?  
 - Yes.

207
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,330
Oh, Consultant Kim Gwang Hee from Team 2.

208
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,240
Consultant Lee Gwang Hee from Team 1.

209
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,020
Yes, Lee Gwang Hee.

210
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,210
Excuse me. What is it?

211
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,840
What?

212
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,240
   

213
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,330
 Okay, I trust you, Director. 

214
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,050
 Please make sure you do your best. 

215
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,540
 Hiring during an economic depression... 

216
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,820
I keep going back and forth on it.

217
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,200
You should increase supply when times are tough, not decrease.

218
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,090
Demand always comes with quality supplies.

219
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:53,660
That's why I never stopped publishing, even when I couldn't pay myself.

220
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,480
That's an interesting title.

221
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,810
"Rainbow Shaved Ice"?

222
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,610
This is an excellent book, but it didn't sell well.

223
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,740
The author is a wonderful person.

224
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,100
The editor worked hard on it, but we haven't even sold the first printing yet.

225
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,490
 Gosh, look at the writer. She's feeling down. 

226
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,600
 Goodness... 

227
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,650
Thank you for your hard work.

228
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,440
 Please come. 

229
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,400
Ms. Jeong, fighting.

230
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,130
Let's make our new book a great success.

231
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,850
Yes. Fighting!

232
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,030
Fighting!

233
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,460
Ms. Jeong, fighting from me, too!

234
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,590
 ­  

235
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,170
- What? 
 - Director, you know Ms. Jeong?

236
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,130
Wait... You called me "Abeonim" that time, right?

237
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,460
Hello.

238
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,690
What a small world.

239
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,190
So you're a writer. 
    

240
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,170
That's why you have such a big imagination, thinking I'm a father.

241
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm sorry about that.

242
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,690
- How do you write picture books? 
 - What?

243
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,620
Do ideas just...

244
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,930
come to you? Do you get inspired?

245
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,300
I dig a hole.

246
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,370
What?

247
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,690
I sit and tear my hair out until something comes to me.

248
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,370
The pain of creation...

249
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,870
It looks like you still have a few more books in you.

250
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,900
You have a lot of hair left.

251
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,250
   

252
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,460
Let me get your autograph.

253
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,190
I like being an early investor.

254
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,020
I'll make good use of it when you become a bestselling author.

255
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,930
What's your name?

256
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,350
Woo Jeong Hun.

257
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,450
"Woo Jeong Hun."

258
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,410
Here.

259
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,050
Thank you.

260
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,120
Then goodbye.

261
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,390
Bye.

262
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,150
Ms. Jeong!

263
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,250
The pain of creation. Fighting!

264
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,560
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting.

265
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,450
   

266
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,420
Where's the list of name-brand appraiser candidates?

267
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,120
I shared the list with the Deluxe HR Team.

268
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,260
We have reduced it to three candidates:

269
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,220
A customs officer nicknamed "Detail detective" in spotting counterfeit goods.

270
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,030
 The ornament placement is wrong. 

271
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,100
 See the terrible stitches here. 

272
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,600
He certified goods five times on a TV program.

273
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,900
This is a rising star creator in the appraisal world.

274
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,680
 I can tell authentic from counterfeit. 

275
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,390
Here's a duty-free manager for 20 years in luxury stores.

276
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,940
   

277
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,470
Okay, not bad.

278
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,260
Let's proceed quickly so we don't lose them to competitors.

279
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,400
Yes, I'll start first by meeting the client's preferred candidate.

280
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,500
Min Seok.

281
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,850
- Hello, here you go. 
 - Here.

282
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,510
- Have a seat. 
 - Yes.

283
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,980
   
   

284
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,240
Hello, everyone! Ciao, hi, aloha!

285
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,650
What's this? I feel I've been in this situation before.

286
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,540
What's with the mood?

287
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,160
So early in the morning, yet so tense...

288
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,760
What's this?

289
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,230
I'm even saying the same thing.

290
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,990
Gyeong Hwa, what? What's going on?

291
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,000
Deluxe Line's preferred candidate...

292
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,140
started today at a competitor.

293
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,110
Who was behind it?

294
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,490
Career Way.

295
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,820
CEO Kim Hye Jin?

296
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,140
Today, Kang Min Seok started at Luxury Seller.

297
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,510
It seems you've already adjusted to our company.

298
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,090
This is all thanks to you.

299
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,640
I'll manage Peoplez-related matters going forward.

300
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,390
I need to do some revenge.

301
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,230
 I don't work with unqualified people. 

302
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,670
 Let's end this then, here or at another search firm. 

303
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,510
   

304
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,920
I need you to explain why we lost our candidate to Career Way.

305
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,850
Didn't we contact him first?

306
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,570
The candidate asked for some time to think—

307
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,430
Weren't you aware another firm contacted him?

308
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,420
If candidates hesitate, you should identify

309
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,700
if they don't like the company or if they're comparing with a competitor.

310
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,180
 What about a replacement? 

311
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,630
 We contacted others, 

312
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,970
but we haven't found anyone who fits the criteria yet.

313
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,870
We will need to start over.

314
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,280
So were you just waiting for the candidate's response?

315
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,530
Had you no backups at all?

316
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,430
Gwang Hee has a meeting with Deluxe Line today.

317
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,260
You should brief them on the situation prior to that.

318
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,000
Please set up a meeting with CEO Jin.

319
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,470
Are you serious?

320
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,620
You told me to trust you, and the result

321
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,210
is that my competitor took the candidate I wanted?

322
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,880
I apologize. I am the one at fault.

323
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,160
I will find a better candidate within the time frame you've given me.

324
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,670
I'm sorry, CEO.

325
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,390
No need to be sorry.

326
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,150
Find new candidates within the time frame.

327
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,620
We will never satisfy our client with a second-best option.

328
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,200
Prove your skills and find an even better candidate.

329
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,210
If I can't prove...

330
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm sure you considered that before you lost the client's preferred candidate.

331
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,770
Isn't that so?

332
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,850
I guess I will be fired if I don't find a candidate.

333
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,110
Secretary Yu, follow on this project.

334
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,360
Hyungnim...

335
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,940
Hello, we're Peoplez, a search firm.

336
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,640
Hello, Team Leader. The designer you said you'd introduce me to...

337
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,070
I'm calling about the résumé you uploaded.

338
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,510
Oh, you went to Street Brand.

339
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,140
You worked managing quality, right?

340
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,460
In that case, you have an appraiser's license as well, right?

341
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,680
How long has it been since you acquired it?

342
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,610
A year and a half...

343
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,200
I'll reach out again.

344
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,990
Okay.

345
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,700
That was all.

346
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,400
Manager, you must be hungry. Should I get some bread?

347
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,990
Yes, sure. I love it, love bread.

348
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,780
Gwang Hee.

349
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,230
Should we go together?

350
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,170
What if I get fired?

351
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,530
I have nowhere to go.

352
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,340
I think you're worrying prematurely. First, look for a candidate.

353
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,000
You won't reassure me that I won't get fired.

354
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,090
 I'm having trouble swallowing. 
   

355
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,740
So where do I find a candidate?

356
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,980
I went through every name on the list and couldn't find a suitable candidate,

357
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,250
not one.

358
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,890
   

359
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,840
I bet they know all about cars, right?

360
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,540
Excuse me?

361
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,980
Of course, they're experts. 
    

362
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,040
I heard experts know the issue just hearing the engine sound.

363
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,450
 They can even tell the car model just hearing the engine. 

364
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,100
 That's what mastery is. They've seen and touched so many cars. 

365
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,310
Why do you keep changing the topic?

366
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,700
We were discussing name-brand appraisers.

367
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,570
Those who see, touch, and repair name-brand goods often...

368
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,070
I'm getting chills.

369
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,620
They would intuitively know.

370
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,610
What's authentic and what's fake.

371
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,180
So should I make a new list of repair specialists?

372
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,090
Let's start searching famous name-brand repair companies.

373
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,270
I'm sure they have repair experts.

374
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,090
If I search name-brand communities,

375
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,100
I'm sure I can find hidden masters!

376
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,700
So you say let's use a name-brand repair specialist angle?

377
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,880
Yes, it's unlikely the candidates in our database

378
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,560
will meet the client's expectations since they already know them.

379
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,900
That's why I had this idea, but I can start again.

380
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,680
Master of name-brand goods repair...

381
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,450
What a good pivot.

382
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,730
Real veterans whom CEO Jin wants might be there.

383
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,200
Look carefully.

384
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,300
Yes, CEO. I will definitely find a good candidate.

385
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,120
You can leave now.

386
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,840
Have a nice evening!

387
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,100
Good night, all.

388
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,300
Hyungnim.

389
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,600
Good job. I'll review it and give it to the CEO. Go home.

390
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,300
- Thank you. 
 - Go now.

391
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,320
Why is this here?

392
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,570
 CEO. 

393
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,580
 CEO? 

394
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,450
 Secretary Yu. 

395
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,000
Was that not a dream?

396
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,480
CEO, if you will keep working, should I order...

397
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,370
CEO?

398
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,260
Here you are.

399
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,330
Are you okay? It gets chilly at night.

400
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,690
So you came back to the office that night.

401
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,260
This.

402
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,770
It was in my office.

403
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,730
The night of the staff dinner,

404
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,350
you were with me in my office, right?

405
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,400
Yes.

406
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,260
Why did you pretend you didn't recall it?

407
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,320
What do you remember exactly?

408
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,930
What do you want me to remember?

409
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,010
Then let's say you never came to the office,

410
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,700
just like now.

411
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,740
Got it.

412
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,710
I'll remember it just like now.

413
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,000
Appa! (Dad)

414
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,490
 What do you want me to remember? 

415
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,660
 Then let's say you never came to the office, 

416
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,600
 just like now. 

417
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,890
 What do you remember exactly? 

418
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,710
 What do you want me to remember? 

419
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,820
 Then let's say you never came to the office, 

420
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,960
 just like now. 

421
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,470
 Got it. 

422
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,570
 I'll remember it just like now. 

423
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,360
   

424
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,950
Hyungnim! Here.

425
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,890
They're famous for their twisted donuts. Another one, please.

426
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,060
Did you find it?

427
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,620
Yes. Earlier, I saw Garim Repair Shop employees

428
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,990
going to the market with things to be repaired.

429
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,890
Garim Repair Shop is known for being the best in the name-brand repair industry.

430
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,980
The master that the Garim Repair Shop CEO keeps hidden...

431
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,170
is in this market.

432
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,950
Good job. Where is that?

433
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,300
Well... We have to start looking now.

434
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,500
You and I...

435
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,910
We will search through here.

436
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,850
What a nice, huge market.

437
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,580
Was it always this big?

438
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,710
 It's on sale! 

439
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,050
Thank you.

440
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,940
Thank you.

441
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,000
I have no idea.

442
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,420
Okay, thank you.

443
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,730
I don't think I've seen them.

444
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,640
You haven't?

445
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,440
Got it, goodbye.

446
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,030
- I don't know about that. 
 - Okay.

447
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,080
How about this? Wow, it looks good on you!

448
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,220
This would be a great gift. It's great!

449
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,530
It's huge; I can't find it.

450
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,410
Thank you for everything. This is the end of my journey.

451
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,750
Hey, tteokbokki and fish cake to go.

452
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,940
Are you eating street food for dinner again?

453
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,200
You should eat well.

454
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,700
My hands are in high demand today, as always.

455
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,200
Wait just a minute.

456
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,490
- Here. 
 - Thanks.

457
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,810
- Take care. 
 - Bye!

458
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,100
I think I did miss a place.

459
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,460
This place is called "Good Living."

460
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,530
- Ma'am. 
 - Yes?

461
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,970
What does she do?

462
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,600
She repairs bags.

463
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,400
 Thank you! 

464
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,050
- Oh, what? 
 - Thank you!

465
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,300
This is too much.

466
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,940
 We passed by here. 

467
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,740
 We definitely did. 

468
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,440
 Hyungnim. 

469
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,100
This street wasn't on the map.

470
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,750
Right.

471
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,570
You must tell me what you're thinking so I can also...

472
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,920
   

473
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,810
I think we found the one, right?

474
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,340
Yes.

475
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,040
Daebak!

476
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,520
You scared me. When did you come in?

477
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,130
Are you here to repair something?

478
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,170
Oh, hello, well...

479
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,180
What did you do to this? This wallet looks practically new.

480
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,900
My customer trusted me to repair it.

481
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,620
I should restore it nicely.

482
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,430
Looking at the different stitches,

483
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,990
she must cherish the wallet enough to have repaired it multiple times.

484
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,580
How did you know that?

485
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,400
This is what I do every day. It'd be weird if I didn't know.

486
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,840
Each brand and each product has its own stitch style.

487
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,050
She knows the difference between brands and products.

488
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,690
Gwang Hee, that's...

489
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,410
I found it.

490
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,370
Ma'am, by chance... 
    

491
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,520
Do you work with Garim Repair Shop?

492
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,280
Yes, I repair everything that comes through there.

493
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,970
Ma'am! Gosh, really!

494
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,090
This is...

495
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,350
- How were we supposed to find you hiding back here? 
 - Wait, that's—

496
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,290
But pearls are found at the ocean bottom!

497
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,480
- I'm embarrassed. 
 - Sorry.

498
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,880
Ma'am, we're here from Peoplez.

499
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,630
Pardon?

500
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,220
 Ms. Jo Yeong Sook. 

501
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,400
 A name-brand goods repair specialist, 

502
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,800
 who learned the craft at age 17, focusing solely on this work for 37 years. 

503
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,860
 An expert who replicates the color, thickness, shape, 

504
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,500
 and stitches just like the original. 

505
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,830
 With her many years of repair experience, she can intuitively tell 

506
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,980
 counterfeits from authentic ones with the touch of her fingertips. 

507
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,290
 She possesses an unparalleled skill acquired over time. 

508
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,820
Leyard shoulder bag, Kilim mini tote bag, Hegas belt.

509
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,550
Leyard, Kilim... okay, wow.

510
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,470
This?

511
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,530
Hegas belt.

512
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,630
Hyungnim, daebak!

513
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,980
Precisely.

514
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,240
You're a master.

515
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,530
How could I work for a company? I went to only elementary school.

516
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,610
Academic background isn't important.

517
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,520
I'm making an offer solely based on your skills.

518
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,840
I'm grateful for the offer, but I feel overwhelmed, Eun Ho.

519
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,700
There is no need to feel overwhelmed.

520
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,100
Just think you're continuing the work you're good at and enjoy.

521
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,930
I can't believe this is happening to me.

522
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,860
There are people with certifications and those who've studied a lot.

523
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,270
All I did was sew.

524
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:28,830
All I've done is sit, glue, and cut.

525
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:34,830
Over time, I naturally know what's real and what's fake.

526
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,630
All those years...

527
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,450
I want to compensate you for all those years that have given you the knowledge.

528
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:49,350
Don't underestimate the value of all those years.

529
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,830
Your hands must feel unrewarded after working so hard all this time.

530
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,530
You have very special hands, Ma'am.

531
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:09,430
You can refuse after thinking about it.

532
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,700
Then I'll await your response.

533
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,120
   

534
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,980
Appa, where's Bunny? Where's Bear?

535
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,770
 Second toy drawer. 

536
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,220
Appa, what about my pajamas?

537
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,230
 Shelf by the bed. 

538
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,380
Not this, the bear pajamas!

539
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,030
 That's too light to wear now. 

540
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,040
You'll take this, right?

541
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,590
Byeol, why are you so happy?

542
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,990
Are you that excited about a sleepover at school? I'm disappointed.

543
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,540
Will you sleep okay without Appa?

544
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,100
- Appa, it's time to become independent. 
 - Oh?

545
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,950
You can't live with me forever.

546
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,320
Get a girlfriend and go on dates.

547
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,490
It's blazing Friday night.

548
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,160
Where d-did you learn about "blazing Friday night"?

549
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,110
Appa, I'm seven.

550
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,480
Blazing...

551
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,600
Be careful.

552
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,190
Is she that excited? They're about to grow up.

553
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,930
Jeong Seo Jun woke up at six this morning.

554
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,840
- He did? 
 - Yes.

555
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,470
Wow, I feel so betrayed by Seo Jun.

556
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,490
Right? I'm hurt.

557
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,030
Sky Kindergarten children.

558
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,400
You won't look for your parents tonight. We can sleep well on our own, right?

559
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,480
 Yes! 

560
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,260
Time to say goodbye to mom and dad!

561
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,110
Say goodbye.

562
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,310
- All the tasty food... 
 - I'll eat a lot of it!

563
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,430
Love you, Byeol!

564
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,630
Mom, sleep with this if you get scared.

565
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,120
He will protect you.

566
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,960
Thank you. My son...

567
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,260
- See you tomorrow, Daddy. 
 - Watch over Byeol.

568
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,970
Okay! It's time to go inside.

569
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,880
 Yes! 

570
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,910
Let's go!

571
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,340
Moms and Dads, you're free today!

572
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,500
Enjoy!

573
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,500
 Director. 

574
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,130
 Eun Ho. 

575
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,350
I hear you're free today for once.

576
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,610
- How did you know? Did Kang Seok tell you? 
 - Yes.

577
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,480
A blazing Friday night without your child...

578
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,500
This is a major event that only happens a few times a year.

579
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,220
Do you have any special plans?

580
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,950
- I do have plans. 
 - What is it?

581
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,280
I'm preparing materials for the CEO's lecture. CEO Kang's lecture is—

582
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,590
What? What's wrong with you?

583
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,990
Now that you're Kang Ji Yun's secretary, did you get infected with workaholism?

584
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,850
What happened to our company?

585
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,710
Kang Ji Yun is the problem. I can't let this go on.

586
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,710
Let's all gather at my house today.

587
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,130
Well... Oh, Director Woo!

588
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,310
Are you busy today? Come to my place even if you are.

589
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,890
I'll treat our leadership team tonight.

590
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,670
- Suddenly? 
 - CEO Kang's been having a hard time.

591
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,960
I thought we should gather for a proper dinner. Let's all eat together.

592
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,160
But Director Seo, you're a bad cook.

593
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
I never had braised short ribs like that before.

594
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,680
You should rename it "braised rock."

595
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,390
We can always order takeout. Whatever you want.

596
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,880
I'll order it and set the table for you.

597
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,560
Then come to my place instead. I'll host.

598
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,730
- Really? 
 - Yes.

599
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,390
- Can we? 
 - Sure, come.

600
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,440
I would be so grateful.

601
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,370
I mean, Eun Ho's cooking is amazing.

602
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:11,270
I fell in love the last time I visited Eun Ho.

603
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,890
We're really coming.

604
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,570
- Really come over. 
 - Okay.

605
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,980
So we're gathering at Eun Ho's place.

606
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,840
Make sure everyone shows up!

607
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,790
You're coming, right?

608
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:24,590
Will CEO Kang go? I bet she won't go to an employee's house.

609
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:27,780
It's Eun Ho's house. I'll talk to her.

610
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,570
Is something special about Secretary Yu's house?

611
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,550
Do what you wish.

612
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,830
Why is he so grumpy?

613
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,710
I texted you the address. Come to Eun Ho's house by seven.

614
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,900
I said I'm not coming.

615
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,990
Why not? Let's go and enjoy a nice meal and drink wine. Let's have fun!

616
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,770
Now is not the time. Plus, why would I go to Secretary Yu's house?

617
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,520
You have to eat anyway. Plus, this is a leadership team meeting.

618
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,940
Why do it there? Unnie, that's being a nuisance.

619
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,960
Hey, it'd be more of a nuisance if we decline his invitation.

620
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,810
Just buy a tasty cake and come.

621
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,070
No, I don't want to go.

622
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,820
I said I'm not coming. Don't wait for me.

623
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,210
It'll be your loss. I told you he's an amazing cook.

624
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,880
So stubborn...

625
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,140
 I'll call you back after I check the CEO's schedule. 

626
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,880
 Okay. 

627
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,920
Schedule all my afternoon meetings in the same place.

628
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,640
- Secretary Yu, go meet Ms. Jo with Gwang Hee. 
 - Yes, I will.

629
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,040
She reached out first, which means she's considering it positively.

630
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,770
Meet her and convince her.

631
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,610
See what's holding her back and if she has any conditions—

632
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:55,300
CEO, don't worry too much.

633
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,560
We will convince her. This position suits her.

634
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,800
I'm sure things will be done one way or another in a week.

635
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,920
Go straight home from there.

636
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,690
Okay.

637
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,680
You're coming tonight, right?

638
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,320
No, I'm not coming.

639
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,140
Come.

640
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,390
I want to make you a home-cooked meal.

641
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,310
I'll be back.

642
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,300
♫  Just like you  ♫

643
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:43,620
♫  A star shining in your eyes  ♫

644
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,600
♫  Just like moon  ♫

645
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:53,660
♫  Even when darkness falls, it shines  ♫

646
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,200
In particular, the product buyer...

647
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,970
♫  I can show you the light  ♫

648
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:05,900
♫  When this night passes and the morning dawns  ♫

649
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:15,200
♫  This moment when I meet your eyes every day  ♫

650
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,570
♫  Approaches me like a dream  ♫

651
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,920
♫  Just like forever moonlight  ♫

652
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:34,560
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

653
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,870
♫  Just like a forever starlight  ♫

654
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:47,100
♫  I'm always by your side  ♫

655
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:58,590
♫  Until that day when your light dims  ♫

656
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,970
♫  Just like a forever starlight  ♫

657
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:10,740
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

658
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,380
 Come. 

659
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,500
 I want to make you a home-cooked meal. 

660
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,680
How good could a meal be?

661
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,250
   

662
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,760
Well...

663
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,340
we're just eating together.

664
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,930
CEO?

665
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,150
I'm a little late.

666
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,820
Is no one else here?

667
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,760
They said they couldn't make it so we canceled—

668
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,130
They posted it in the group chat.

669
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,970
You're not in the group chat.

670
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:06,810
   

671
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,750
   

672
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,760
   

673
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,740
   

674
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,460
CEO!

675
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,890
Yes?

676
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,040
Would you like some dinner?

677
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:32,140
No, I just dropped by. I was just passing by.

678
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,140
I picked this up on my way.

679
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,050
So on my way—

680
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,040
Thank you for coming.

681
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:50,080
I was disappointed people couldn't come after I bought all the ingredients.

682
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,570
Do you like soybean paste stew?

683
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,480
Are you uncomfortable?

684
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,440
No.

685
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,870
Wait just a moment. I'll make a good one for you.

686
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,160
N-No pressure.

687
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,550
No pressure...

688
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,840
   

689
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,110
What is it...

690
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:08,650
Just leave it alone, and it'll turn off.

691
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,030
It turned off.

692
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,900
What is Byeol's dad doing tonight?

693
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,010
Don't just wait. Call him.

694
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,140
I wasn't waiting for him.

695
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,510
Without the children, you two should go out, catch a movie,

696
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,790
and have some chicken and beer.

697
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,920
You know stuff like that, Mom?

698
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,740
That's not all I know.

699
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,800
If you keep dragging your feet, you'll lose Byeol's dad.

700
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,860
Imagine him inviting someone over to his house and cooking

701
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:20,510
his soybean paste stew for her. Then it's over.

702
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,910
Mom, I can't believe you said that.

703
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,520
And have you seen his back while he cooks?

704
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,510
Eat.

705
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:51,870
I finally got to make you a home-cooked meal.

706
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,920
"A home-cooked meal," so what.

707
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,810
What? Did you put something in here?

708
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:44,410
Did you make all this, Secretary Yu?

709
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,870
I told you I'm a good cook.

710
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,460
I think this is your special talent.

711
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,140
Then make a reservation next time.

712
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,120
It's nice to see you enjoy the food.

713
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,710
This is so pretty.

714
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,600
I agree. It was delicious.

715
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,150
When did you start cooking?

716
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,810
It's been 30 years, survival skills honed for 30 years.

717
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:21,680
Don't go overboard just because I complimented. I know your age.

718
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,210
I'm serious.

719
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:28,620
Are you saying you lived alone since you were in elementary school?

720
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,860
I turned out okay, didn't I?

721
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,780
You did turn out okay.

722
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,920
Good job.

723
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,910
You, too, CEO.

724
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,320
What is that?

725
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,540
You did well.

726
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,280
I thought I'd give a proper compliment.

727
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,800
   

728
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:56,760
Just a moment, CEO. Let me answer this call.

729
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,630
No, I'll go since we're done eating.

730
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,640
No, you should have some cake.

731
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,470
- Wait just a bit. 
 - Well...

732
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,670
 Did you have fun? 

733
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:14,950
 Did you eat dinner? 

734
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,050
 What? 

735
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,160
   

736
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:00,040
Byeol, how was your day?

737
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,850
 I did so much today. 

738
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,710
I played the Indian game, soccer,

739
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:07,990
 and played a game for snacks. Oh, we went on a treasure hunt! 

740
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,980
Appa, I found two treasures!

741
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,720
Wow, Byeol, you're amazing. The Principal prepared a lot.

742
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,680
Yes. It was so fun!

743
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,940
So you didn't think of Appa at all, did you?

744
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,880
Honestly, I didn't, just a little.

745
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,140
Are you sad?

746
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,700
No, I'm happy you had fun.

747
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,650
Appa will think of you more, Byeol.

748
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:29,220
 Then hang up now. 

749
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,030
My friends need to make calls.

750
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,390
Appa, good night!

751
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:36,120
- Good night, Byeol. I love you. 
  - Okay. 

752
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,740
CEO Kang, thanks for waiting...

753
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,780
What?

754
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,430
- Pardon? 
 - What?

755
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:44,670
What do you mean by "what"?

756
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,890
The sun, right now.

757
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:49,380
- What time is it? 
 - "What time"?

758
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,190
What happened? Why did I...

759
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:57,150
 Appa, get a girlfriend and go on dates. 

760
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,730
 It's blazing Friday night. 

761
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,150
- We must go now. 
 - Where?

762
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,750
- They left already. 
 - Who?

763
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,380
- My daughter! 
 - "Daughter... daughter."

764
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,040
"Daughter"?

765
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:14,080
My purse!

766
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,250
Okay, hurry, hurry!

767
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,760
- My phone... 
 - "Phone"?

768
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,720
Let's go. The elevator...

769
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,480
Why did you oversleep? Didn't you set an alarm?

770
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,060
I did set it, but...

771
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:52,220
- But did we do something? 
 - Pardon?

772
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:56,210
We didn't hold hands or anything. We just ate together and slept...

773
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,960
Is it tasty?

774
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,560
Appa...

775
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,100
Byeol...

776
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,030
   
   

777
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,240
 Don't go... 

778
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,660
 No... 

779
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:04,800
 Don't go... 

780
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:31,400
 It's okay. 

781
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,410
 It's all right. 

782
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:13,060


783
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:21,060
♫  Once again, my heart  ♫

784
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:31,640
♫  Is walking toward where you are  ♫

785
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:39,970
♫  Feelings for you that I can’t hide  ♫

786
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:48,810
♫  Unstoppable steps toward you  ♫

787
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:51,590
♫  I will protect you  ♫

788
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:53,260
 Let me ask you one thing. 

789
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,360
 - Why did you push me out? 
 - Why did you run away? 

790
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,610
 - That's what I'm saying. 
 - That's what I'm saying. 

791
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,150
 Are you saying we sold a fake? 

792
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:00,830
 What happens if my mom makes an appraisal mistake? 

793
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,710
 Who would believe me? 

794
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,280
 Everyone said I'm wrong. 

795
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,990
 The child who frequents the bookstore is Secretary Yu's daughter, right? 

796
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,490
 - Kitty! 
 - Byeol! 

797
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:10,470
 Eun Ho, did something happen to Byeol? 

798
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:13,360
 - Are you okay? 
 - To be honest, I don't know. 

799
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,990
 You're doing a good job. 

800
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,970
 I'm sure Byeol knows how hard you try. 

801
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,750
 To Kang Ji Yun, what kind of person is Yu Eun Ho? 

802
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,160
 I'm doomed. 

803
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,180
♫  Because it was all a path to you  ♫
