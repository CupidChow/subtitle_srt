00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,050
   

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:59,060


16
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,840
   

17
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,138
   

18
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:21,520
   
   

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,000
   

20
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,963
 The CEO of pharmaceutical company, Econic Bio, 

21
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,015
 amassed billions in investment capital for public stock, 

22
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:33,468
 then disappeared without a trace. 

23
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,237
 Company P, a renowned domestic headhunter firm 

24
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:40,424
 is being investigated for involvement in the investment fraud. 

25
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:45,610
 Prosecutors are investigating if Company P,  the exclusive hiring firm for Econic Bio during... 

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,732
Kang Ji Yun.

27
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,300
I said to enjoy it while you can.

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,800
 They investigate the search firm, Company P's involvement 

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,982
 in this investment fraud case. 

30
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,938
CEO Kang, is it true Peoplez is involved?

31
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,189
Did you really not know of the fraud?

32
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,258
They say you knew when you sent candidates. Is that so?

33
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:32,360
What happens to those who trusted Peoplez and moved jobs?

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,420
Did you not know until it got to this point?

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,614
 Do you truly have a special relationship with CEO Park? 

36
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,184
 CEO Kang, when did you last meet CEO Park Yeong Min? 

37
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:41,135
 Do you really not know where CEO Park Yeong Min is? 

38
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:43,954
 Have you anything to say to the fraud victims? 

39
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,610
 ­Ms. CEO, please say something! 

40
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,141
CEO Kang Ji Yun, right?

41
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:28,038
I'm here to investigate the Econic Bio investment fraud case.

42
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:31,002
Here's the search warrant. 
    

43
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,850
Please cooperate.

44
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,597
Okay, we will conduct search and seizure of your offices.

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,100
Start the search!

46
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,980
All right, you two go in there.

47
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,355
You can't just...

48
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,999
You can't just do this!

49
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,726
What are you doing right now?

50
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,595
Nothing is there!

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,400
CEO, let's talk there.

52
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,600
You can wait here, Sir. 
    

53
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,100
   

54
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,153
Why are they shutting the blinds?

55
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,005
Is our CEO a criminal or something?

56
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,226
What happened?

57
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:46,661
"Investment fraud"?

58
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,762
And a "search warrant"?

59
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,877
Econic Bio's CEO, Park Yeong Min, seized the investment capital and vanished.

60
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:09,300
The amount of theft is about ₩20 billion ($13.7 million).

61
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,430
You worked with CEO Park Yeong Min recently, correct?

62
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:16,049
Yes, we were the exclusive hiring partner.

63
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,985
I noticed you own shares in Econic Bio.

64
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,321
You two must have been close.

65
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,881
We received commission in the form of shares.

66
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:26,284
Is that common between a search firm and its client?

67
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,400
I wouldn't say it's common.

68
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,139
I agreed to it since Econic Bio had high growth potential.

69
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,800
It was about to go public, and the company was expanding.

70
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,712
That was all a lie.

71
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,797
Going public, a new technology contract...

72
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,367
It was all fabricated for the investment fraud.

73
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,152
Did you really not know?

74
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:45,787
Surely, you used a verification process.

75
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:48,500
I'm unsure I can believe you truly didn't know.

76
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,700
Do you realize many invested, seeing your name behind it?

77
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,300
Excuse me? What do you mean?

78
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,400
They actively leveraged Peoplez' and your name while fundraising.

79
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,730
Didn't you know that?

80
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,400
Didn't you agree to stay silent in exchange for financial gain?

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,507
Are you accusing me of being complicit in the fraud?

82
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:08,701
The investigation will tell us the answer.

83
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,994
That is untrue.

84
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,580
I have received no other compensation other than shares.

85
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,915
Please track my bank account records.

86
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,610
No one takes money like that through a trackable account.

87
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,753
Anyway, I understand.

88
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,355
I will reach out again after reviewing today's seized materials.

89
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:24,950
I'll see you at the station soon.

90
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,290
   

91
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,585
I'm sorry... It's all my fault.

92
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,960
 Gyeong Hwa, have you finished verifying Econic Bio? 

93
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,254
 Yes, as you can see in the materials I prepared, 

94
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,555
 the financial statements are stable, and the corporate report is flawless. 

95
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:08,136
 I confirmed that the new pharmaceutical product was trademarked without issues. 

96
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,456
 I believe we can confidently recommend candidates. 

97
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:14,600
I contacted the global pharmaceutical company

98
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,895
that held a technology contract with Econic Bio

99
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,100
and never received an answer.

100
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,885
All other paperwork was impeccable,

101
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:28,156
and there was so much press around their technology.

102
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,892
I thought there wouldn't be a problem.

103
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,910
I-I'm so sorry...

104
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,990
I had no idea i-it would turn out this way.

105
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,084
You said all other paperwork was solid.

106
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,004
How could we not be deceived by their lies?

107
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,638
It's okay. Don't beat yourself up and leave.

108
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:48,170
Yes.

109
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,100
Those scoundrels...

110
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,850
That's why they paid in shares, not money.

111
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,586
They planned empty shares, then he vanished.

112
00:07:58,586 --> 00:08:01,089
They used us to hire employees,

113
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,315
posed as a legitimate company, deceived investors, defrauded them...

114
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:05,860
They achieved two things at once.

115
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,870
If they commit fraud, they should do it alone.

116
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,120
Why did they drag us in?

117
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,268
Did someone curse Peoplez to go bankrupt?

118
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,080
It's okay. Come sit.

119
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,971
Stay in hiding for a while, then leave Korea.

120
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,557
Your life is about to change drastically.

121
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,175
- All has been planned out, right? 
 - Of course.

122
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:43,161
In ten days, we two will leave Korea without a trace.

123
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:46,049
Don't worry. It isn't our first time.

124
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:53,060
Here, congratulations.

125
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,494
CEO Kim, your dreams finally came true.

126
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,329
Are you happy to see Peoplez fall?

127
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,664
What an obvious thing to ask.

128
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,816
How does it feel to defraud investors of money?

129
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,767
Amazing!

130
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,204
- Are we really okay? 
 - Of course.

131
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:10,408
We securely funneled the money abroad.

132
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:13,876
We have our escape route. So what's the problem?

133
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:17,000
CEO Park, remember what I said when we first met?

134
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,017
You struggled all this time with an unsellable new drug.

135
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,536
Let's change our lives in one go.

136
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:26,939
CEO Park, you played your part so well, we're on the verge of winning.

137
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,859
So just enjoy it.

138
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,200
You went through with everything. What's gotten into you?

139
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:40,451
Let me ask you one thing. Why did you do that to Peoplez?

140
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:47,025
Because the Peoplez' CEO makes me angry.

141
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,850
CEO Park.

142
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,257
Humans are all the same.

143
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,118
Pretend to be classy, yet we're all the same.

144
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:58,170
We're in the same situation. Stop pretending you have a conscience.

145
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,600
You're the one who accepted our proposal.

146
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,501
CEO Park.

147
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,775
I'm good.

148
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,158
He thinks that makes him different from us.

149
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,951
- Will he be okay? 
 - Don't worry.

150
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,120
I'll keep him close until we disappear.

151
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,461
Are reporters still there?

152
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,070
Yes. It seems they will remain all day.

153
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,967
How much do they want from us?

154
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:40,500
There's an article about the search and seizure.

155
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,990
What?

156
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,480
   

157
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,124
With this, everyone must know it's our company.

158
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,590
CEO Kang.

159
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,531
The articles are popping up.

160
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,460
   

161
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,878
Yes, Director.

162
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,882
Pardon me?

163
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,368
"Contract cancellation"?

164
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,803
Wait, h-hold on—

165
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,620
 ­  

166
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,640
 ­  

167
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,144
Yes, hello.

168
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,501
Yes.

169
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,236
Yes, Team Leader.

170
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,672
 The search and seizure? It was an investigation... 

171
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,624
 No, it's not fraud! 

172
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:58,576
We are victims, too. There's a misunderstanding—

173
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:01,595
You can't just cancel the contract like this!

174
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,764
"Stop the search in the middle"?

175
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,583
- We should wait until the results... 
 - Of course!

176
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,518
We're doing business as usual.

177
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,002
Team Leader, just trust me.

178
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:11,054
T-Team Leader—

179
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,615
Should we tell the employees...

180
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,187
to go home?

181
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,173
Tell the employees...

182
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,184
to gather.

183
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:42,291
First of all, I'm sorry to put you through something so unpleasant.

184
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,638
I can say this confidently.

185
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,673
As the CEO of Peoplez, I did not do anything I am ashamed of.

186
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,000
The investigation results will reveal the truth,

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,566
and we can get through this crisis.

188
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,320
I promise that.

189
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,238
It may be difficult to do business as usual for a while.

190
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:05,273
We will switch to working from home until the investigation is complete.

191
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:10,312
Please work from home and be patient until further notice.

192
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,858
Did you do that, Father?

193
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,628
With no context, how am I to understand your question?

194
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,929
I asked if you did this.

195
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,869
Do you think I have that much time?

196
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,030
You think I'd meddle with a mere search firm.

197
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,043
Fine, as long as it wasn't you.

198
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,049
I'm watching what happens.

199
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,700
If it's a loss for me, then I'll have to decide.

200
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,055
Leave Peoplez within a month and come to my company.

201
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,140
No.

202
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,144
I have no interest in doing what you want.

203
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,022
I don't intend to work for you.

204
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,898
So please give up.

205
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,827
There's no value in investing in an idiot

206
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,012
who has no interest in doing what I want.

207
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,650
   

208
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,150
   

209
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,940
   

210
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,544
Did I just get kicked out of home?

211
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,782
 Chairman Woo is vicious. 

212
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,536
Sure. Let's do this.

213
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,285
Everyone went home.

214
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,144
We should leave, too.

215
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:10,590
♫  But you know, I still live in the world with you in it  ♫

♫  How are you these days?  ♫

219
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,240

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,100
that this might be the end.

221
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,195
♫  I want to run to you  ♫

222

230
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,478
I'm okay. You should go.

231
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,459
I'll stay until you fall asleep tonight.

232
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,769
I'm really okay.

233
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,687
I'm not okay.

234
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,231
I'll stay by your side until you fall asleep.

235
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,733
Forget everything and get some sleep.

236
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,635
 This is CEO Kang Ji Yun's place, right? 

237
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,262
CEO Kang, we know everything so come out!

238
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,530
Kang Ji Yun, come out!

239
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,432
- What is it? 
 - We are ones who lost money invested in Econic Bio.

240
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:31,500
Let us see CEO Kang if she's here.

241
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,100
The news says Kang Ji Yun was complicit in the fraud.

242
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,515
Stop hiding and come out!

243
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,992
Kang Ji Yun, come out!

244
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,160
That's not true.

245
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,079
Stop making a scene and leave.

246
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,497
CEO Kang is inside, isn't she?

247
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,958
Don't send someone else like a coward. Come out!

248
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,085
You're all in it together!

249
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,586
How much money did you take?

250
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,588
CEO Kang! Step aside.

251
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,699
I will call the police if you continue.

252
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,092
"The police"? Sure, call them.

253
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,010
Well, I guess this won't be enough to report.

254
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,705
Should I go all out and cause some real trouble?

255
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,439
I said move!

256
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,581
Please leave.

257
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,320
Sure, I'll leave today.

258
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,531
We know where she lives and works.

259
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,868
She'd better not dream of running away!

260
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,035
Let's go.

261
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,871
CEO Kang, you heard, right?

262
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,155
We will come again!

263
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,001
Let's go to my house.

264
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,913
Hey, Byeol, a bad thing happened at the CEO's company.

265
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,540
She will need to stay with us tonight...

266
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,335
 I love it. I totally love it! 

267
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,644
 Hurry and bring Unnie over. 

268
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,348
- The cool Unnie is coming over today. 
 - Really?

269
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,184
- Why is the cool Unnie coming? 
 - I don't know.

270
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,061
Something bad happened at her company.

271
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:33,298
Then you shouldn't be happy about it.

272
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,566
Is that so?

273
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,143
I think I made a mistake.

274
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,574
Jeong Seo Jun, can I borrow a colored pencil?

275
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,993
Slowly.

276
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,435
Unnie, here's a gift.

277
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,110
What is this?

278
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,860
   

279
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,400
   

280
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,451
This is the vitamin I give Daddy when he's down.

281
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,579
It's super-duper effective. Right, Daddy?

282
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,622
What?

283
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:35,101
Yes, it's the fastest, longest-lasting vitamin I know.

284
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,821
Thank you, Byeol.

285
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:40,506
This will cheer me up.

286
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,990
   

287
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,516
Unnie, you're really sleeping over at our house today, right?

288
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,851
Yes.

289
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,269
Thanks for hosting me.

290
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,254
Thank you for understanding, Byeol.

291
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:57,549
I have so much to thank you for today, Byeol.

292
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,927
Unnie, where will you sleep tonight?

293
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:01,611
What?

294
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,864
Oh, so...

295
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,700
Where...

296
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,468
Unnie, sleep with me tonight.

297
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:11,570
Daddy, I want to sleep with Unnie tonight.

298
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,300
Oh! Sure.

299
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,869
That sounds good.

300
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,015
Byeol. Aren't you uncomfortable?

301
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,641
What about you, Unnie?

302
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,810
- Is it too small? 
 - No.

303
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,145
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

304
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,399
Why?

305
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,600
- Can't you fall asleep? 
 - I can't.

306
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,031
It's hard to sleep with many thoughts.

307
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,508
So you must empty your head to sleep.

308
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,562
How do you empty your head?

309
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:53,747
Don't you know?

310
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,082
Do you know how?

311
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,917
I don't know, either.

312
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,920
I thought grown-ups knew.

313
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,372
There are things grown-ups don't know.

314
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,427
Can Byeol sing you a song?

315
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,596
I'm a great singer.

316
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,970
That sounds good. Sing for me.

00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,595
- Unnie is sleeping. 
 - Okay.

328
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:17,513
Byeol, you go to sleep, too.

329
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,450
 I'm glad. 

330
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,023
Unnie has such small hands.

331
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,691
Daddy has huge hands.

332
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,322
You smell so nice.

333
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,300
Why are you up so early? It's still early.

334
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,400
I just woke up.

335
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,954
Is this too big?

336
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,900
Unnie, you're cutting such ugly pieces.

337
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,893
It says to cut cucumbers into small rounds.

338
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,470
It all tastes the same in the mouth.

339
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,473
Plus, Byeol, you put the wrong sauce in earlier.

340
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,409
No, I did it right.

341
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:46,396
Six spoons of mayonnaise, two spoons of sugar,

342
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,148
and pepper...

343
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,151
What? Byeol, you already added those.

344
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,810
What do I do?

345
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,323
It's okay. It's okay. We will just double the portions.

346
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,024
- Let's add more ketchup. 
 - Excuse me, you two...

347
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,911
How about I take over?

348
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,580
We're going to do it.

349
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,148
You just watch us, Dad.

350
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:06,666
Add more mayonnaise.

351
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,337
We added more sugar and pepper earlier.

352
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,630
Oh? What's wrong?

353
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,897
Did it burn? Did it?

354
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,550
Let's just redo the bread. Right?

355
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,800
We put everything and next...

356
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,230
- It looks delicious. 
 - Of course.

357
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,998
We should have let the chef cook.

358
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,888
- Bon appetit. 
 - Bon appetit.

359
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:20,864
It looks delicious.

360
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,168
I'll take Byeol to kindergarten.

361
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,520
Have a good day at kindergarten, Byeol.

362
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,071
I'll go, Unnie.

363
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:36,339
See you soon.

364
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,758
You'd better not leave.

365
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,319
Okay, see you.

366
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,579
Let's go.

367
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:44,613
Make yourself at home.

368
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,484
Gyeong Hwa, since we're out anyway,

369
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,571
cheer up and consider it a date.

370
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,157
They might as well just go public.

371
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:48,995
We're outside now so we can hold hands.

372
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,455
Okay, let's go in.

373
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,750
Fighting.

374
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,100
Why did we come here?

375
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,100
I feel my blood pressure rising.

376
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,291
All right. Have some of these while working.

377
00:30:04,494 --> 00:30:06,179
- Fighting. 
 - Thank you, thank you.

378
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,347
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

379
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,625
Hello.

380
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,487
What? Is this everyone?

381
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,100
What about the others?

382
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,300
Everyone's figuring out their survival strategy.

383
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,000
But still, Team 1 are the loyalists.

384
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,207
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

385
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:38,208
No. We couldn't just sit still.

386
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,405
So what can we do?

387
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,749
Something seems suspicious. It stinks.

388
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:45,176
 Right. 

389
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,712
Why drag a search firm into investment fraud?

390
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:53,207
To deceive investors, they could have posed anyone as an employee.

391
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:58,028
Why did they hire real people after running a sham this whole time?

392
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:02,800
Could they purposely want to link Peoplez to Econic Bio?

393
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,531
Let's suppose that is the case.

394
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:12,892
Did someone set a trap to make Peoplez look complicit?

395
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:14,247
Who and why would they?

396
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,017
And that's what we're trying to find out, right?

397
00:31:18,017 --> 00:31:20,879
Yes. Who? Why in the world?

398
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,106
Why do they want to ruin us?

399
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,095
Our information right now is CEO Park Yeong Min.

400
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,763
Investigate around him.

401
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,366
I'm sure we will track something.

402
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:35,300
Let's think of who might resent our company

403
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,855
or any suspicious people in our company's orbit.

404
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,331
Go Jeong Nam?

405
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,375
Career Way wouldn't do that.

406
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,237
Over Next? Wait—

407
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,214
Let's not rule that out.

408
00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:51,474
I should be the one to meet Go Jeong Nam.

409
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:54,200
Considering the give-and-take between us,

410
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,000
this is a great opportunity to put an end to it.

411
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,893
Yes, let's take this all the way and don't stop.

412
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:04,047
It's too unfair to go down like this.

413
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,590
That's all. Split up!

414
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,758
Yes.

415
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,217
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

416
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:12,195
- Starting now? 
 - Yes. Now. Here, this moment.

417
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,490
- Director. 
 - Yes?

418
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,813
- Another article popped up. 
 - Oh?

419
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,610
   

420
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,537
What is this?

421
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,700
   

422
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,660
What? Gosh, my hands are shaking again. 
    

423
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,360
Ji Yun?

424
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,238
Ji Yun?

425
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,840
Ji Yun?

426
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,290
Ji Yun?

427
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,383
Ji Yun! Where are you?

428
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,719
I'm here to meet Kim Hye Jin.

429
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,013
I'll call you after my meeting.

430
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,520
Yes.

431
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,620
   

432
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:20,270
Eat. I'm sure you haven't been eating well lately.

433
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,400
You've always been good at cornering people.

434
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,080
It's almost like you've been waiting for this moment

435
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,040
to dig up the past from five years ago.

436
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:31,933
I know, right? You should have behaved yourself.

437
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:34,804
What goes around, comes around.

438
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:39,388
How does it feel? To experience what I felt five years ago?

439
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,495
Why do you do this to me?

440
00:33:44,163 --> 00:33:45,732
I just don't like you.

441
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,525
I don't like how you act all superior.

442
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,418
Drawing a line as if you're different

443
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,739
and pretending you're righteous is so annoying.

444
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,732
How clean do you think you are?

445
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,704
You must be so scared.

446
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,730
Is it because I know that CEO Lee Yong Hun

447
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,150
hid your secret with his death five years ago?

448
00:34:08,855 --> 00:34:13,622
Why? Do you think I'll use that against you?

449
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,181
This is why I hate you.

450
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,432
You're in big trouble right now.

451
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,267
Your company is going down.

452
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,102
So beg me to save you.

453
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,772
Or threaten me, using my weaknesses.

454
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,524
Would you rather die than to stoop to that level?

455
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:32,380
Why? Because you and I are different?

456
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,284
Ji Yun, don't fool yourself.

457
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,200
You and I both sell people.

458
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,791
We mark peoples' worth as their price and collect high commission.

459
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,125
That is our work.

460
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,152
Is it dirty work when I do it, and it's noble when you do it?

461
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:53,382
You don't view your employees as people.

462
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,800
Don't let recognition make you too proud.

463
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,400
Do you think others will stay by your side once Peoplez goes down?

464
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,600
I know...

465
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,400
at the end of the day, we're cut from the same cloth.

466
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,800
 Do you think others will stay by your side once Peoplez goes down? 

467
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,690
 Yes, Bro. 

468
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,184
 Let me ask you something. 

469
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,188
I'm looking for your classmate, Park Yeong Min.

470
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,190
Yes, entering class of 2004.

471
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,358
That's right, a chemistry major.

472
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,528
Do you know anyone close to him?

473
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,363
Yes. Send him a text for me, thank you.

474
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:01,851
Yes, Team Leader, I'm Oh Gyeong Hwa from Peoplez.

475
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:07,187
I know you have a long history in pharmaceuticals.

476
00:36:07,187 --> 00:36:11,425
Are you in contact with any previous Econic Bio employees,

477
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:13,546
including early members?

478
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,747
Us? Yes, we're okay.

479
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,385
That's all a misunderstanding.

480
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,955
Yes, it will all work out once investigation is done.

481
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:24,690
Yes.

482
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:28,978
Deputy, where are you going?

483
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,997
I contacted a researcher who worked at Econic Bio until last year.

484
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:33,024
I'll be right back. Bye.

485
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,970
- Yes. 
 - Fighting!

486
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,804
Where did the Manager go?

487
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:39,672
When will I get through all this?

488
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:41,840
- I'm going crazy. 
 - Right...

489
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,519
Go Jeong Nam!

490
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,590
Have you anything to say to me?

491
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,750
How could you? How could you use people like that?

492
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,595
I'm the one who got used.

493
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,930
Because you gave me the wrong information, I'm...

494
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,033
totally out of work.

495
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,773
I'm not sorry about that at all!

496
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,800
Follow me. I'll tell you something.

497
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,876
I have nothing to say.

498
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,616
But I do.

499
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,600
Wait, you're using physical force on me. Let go!

500
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,153
Oh, Eun Ho. Where are you?

501
00:37:37,153 --> 00:37:39,214
I'm at the bookstore.

502
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,380
- Eun Ho? 
 - Ji Yun?

503
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,805
I found Go Jeong Nam!

504
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,442
Why is the CEO here?

505
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,518
Hi, CEO Kang!

506
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,859
What are you all doing here?

507
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,838
So are you all gathered to do research?

508
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:24,639
Y-Yes... You said to work from home and not worry, but we couldn't.

509
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,612
Why?

510
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:28,097
What do you mean "why"? It's about our company, isn't it?

511
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,465
- That's right. 
 - Right.

512
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:37,737
CEO, don't be shocked. I learned something incredible.

513
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,119
Someone is behind all this. Do you know who?

514
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,990
Career Way's CEO Kim Hye Jin!

515
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,992
Gosh, I knew it.

516
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,994
You're shocked, right? I'm shocked, too.

517
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,774
I was so angry I met with Go Jeong Nam and forced him to confess!

518
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:58,794
It seems CEO Park Yeong Min frequented Career Way before this.

519
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,313
I got the CCTV footage. That's hard work!

520
00:39:02,313 --> 00:39:03,883
 That is such hard work. 

521
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,177
We're also seeking CEO Park Yeong Min.

522
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,912
His acquaintances say his personality changed drastically.

523
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:14,024
Back when he was patenting the new drug, he was a man of integrity.

524
00:39:14,024 --> 00:39:17,528
But when funding was scarce, he couldn't pay workers,

525
00:39:17,528 --> 00:39:19,882
became sensitive and stingy.

526
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:21,667
Seeing the whole situation,

527
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:24,400
he was lured into investment fraud due to financial woes.

528
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,572
As we look into Park Yeong Min,

529
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,500
I think we will discover more vital information, CEO.

530
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,700
CEO, we're doing research right now to clear your name.

531
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,205
So don't worry. Peoplez?

532
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:38,475
We will protect it.

533
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,933
Thank you.

534
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:01,564
Th-Thank... She thanked us.

535
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:04,068
No need to thank us.

536
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,880
We mine information for our livelihood.

537
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,409
There is nothing we can't find, right?

538
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,353
Ms. CEO, would you like to join us starting tomorrow and research together?

539
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:16,789
Then we'd totally be the Avengers!

540
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,349
Hey, Gwang Hee, leave the CEO out.

541
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:23,479
We should do it ourselves. We were doing well.

542
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:25,798
I just figured we could be Avengers.

543
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,866
Ms. CEO.

544
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,536
I'm so sorry!

545
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,800
Gyeong Hwa, you have nothing to be sorry about.

546
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,200
I made the final decision; that means I'm responsible.

547
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,100
Gyeong Hwa, you did your best in your position.

548
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,300
It's okay so please let it go.

549
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,554
- Ms. CEO... 
 - What should we do?

550
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:51,490
Gyeong Hwa. Gyeong Hwa! Stop crying. Tissues, please.

551
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,576
Gyeong Hwa, here are some tissues!

552
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,244
Gyeong Hwa, stop crying!

553
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,729
Look, you have eye boogers.

554
00:40:56,729 --> 00:40:58,013
Gyeong Hwa, stop crying.

555
00:40:58,013 --> 00:41:00,249
Let's stop crying. No more.

556
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,083
Gyeong Hwa, calm down.

557
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,691
It's okay, keep going.

558
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:10,468
We all know.

559
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,428
You all know?

560
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,304
Why wouldn't we know?

561
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,977
Oppa!

562
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,524
We are dating!

563
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,859
Stop crying, stop.

564
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,777
- No more tears. 
 - Done!

565
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,553
Daddy!

566
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,616
Say hello to my co-workers.

567
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,285
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

568
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,703
Oh, Unnie!

569
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,471
You will sleep at my house again tonight, right?

570
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,741
What?

571
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,636
- You two are already... 
 - What?

572
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,554
living together?

573
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,823
No... it's not that.

574
00:41:57,823 --> 00:41:59,225
Let's go!

575
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,876
Where are you going?

576
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:02,119
- Let's just leave. 
 - What?

577
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,646
What are we doing tomorrow?

578
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,022
We will gather again tomorrow.

579
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,525
It's so nice to have people around.

580
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,817
Right, Kang Seok?

581
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,402
Yes, of course!

582
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,263
Peoplez is always welcome here.

583
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,200
Can we just get together at the office if we gather anyway?

584
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,702
We technically work from home. See you tomorrow.

585
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,412
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Just a second.

586
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,331
- Goodbye! 
 - Okay, bye.

587
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,850
- See you later. 
 - Why are they leaving?

588
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,868
Gosh, that was chaotic.

589
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,089
No, Hyung. It's not what you think.

590
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,740
No, it's not that!

591
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,992
- What's not? 
 - I said no!

592
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:35,744
- What is? 
 - Daddy, Unnie, let's go.

593
00:42:35,744 --> 00:42:37,997
- Yes, let's go. 
 - Let's go.

594
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:40,833
Byeol, let's go. Let's hurry!

595
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,084
I said it's not.

596
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:44,550
- No. 
 - It must be no.

597
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,124
It's definitely a yes.

598
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,055
This hits the spot!

599
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:09,352
Unnie, you will sleep over for ten nights at our house, right?

600
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,800
Let's draw, put on nail polish,

601
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,401
play board games, and watch movies.

602
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:18,100
Also, let's play with dolls—

603
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,639
Byeol, why don't we eat first?

604
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,642
Yes, Byeol. I'm not going anywhere.

605
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,150
Okay!

606
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:31,200
How come you two aren't going to work?

607
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,587
Did the company close?

608
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,800
- Byeol, it's not that. 
 - Byeol,

609
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,300
do I look like I'd let the company close?

610
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,332
No!

611
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,016
Correct!

612
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:50,169
We are having a hard time,

613
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,629
but I think we found the answer.

614
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,940
I thought I was alone, but so many people are on my team.

615
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,343
You know, right? The one with the bigger team wins.

616
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,345
Yes. I'm on your side, too.

617
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,013
Unnie, you'd better eat a lot

618
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,973
so you'll save the company in style.

619
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,900
Yes, I'll eat a lot and power up.

620
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,197
- Bye. 
  - Goodbye! 

621
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,198
See you tomorrow!

622
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,161
The principal!

623
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,262
Hello.

624
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,122
Seo Jun and Byeol will be out soon.

625
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:29,770
- Please wait a moment. 
 - Thank you.

626
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,570
Oh, Woo Jeong Hun. Why?

627
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,838
I'm busy with children.

628
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,650
Get to the point.

629
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,550
The principal's office?

630
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,552
Why do you suddenly want to sleep in the principal's office?

631
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,346
What happened to your place?

632
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,855
So you really got kicked out?

633
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,500
- Mom! 
 - Auntie!

634
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,700
Come, come. Let's go. Let's go!

635
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,985
Let's go. What should we eat today?

636
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,950
Start over.

637
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,540
I have to start all over now.

638
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,749
What wrong did he do to get kicked out of home?

639
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:14,052
I heard the company has a tough time, too.

640
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,149
Does he have nowhere to sleep?

641
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,279
What's wrong? Are you not making progress on the picture book?

642
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:26,697
I thought it was due next week.

643
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:29,435
It's not that.

644
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,437
Work is going well.

645
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,855
Something is off.

646
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,499
You were murmuring to yourself.

647
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:40,100
Why don't you step out and get some fresh air?

648
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,299
I heard authors do when they have writer's block.

649
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:46,576
Why don't you go out a while?

650
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:50,254
Should I?

651
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,169
What? Ms. Jeong!

652
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,813
Oh, my! Jeong Hun!

653
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,799
What are you doing here?

654
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:19,000
- Children went home already. 
 - Oh!

655
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,472
Water bottle.

656
00:46:23,472 --> 00:46:26,825
Seo Jun left behind his water bottle again.

657
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,077
What about you, Jeong Hun?

658
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,954
Oh, me?

659
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,597
I...

660
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,459
My noona!

661
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,753
I'm visiting my noona.

662
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,921
- Oh, the principal... 
 - Yes.

663
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:45,077
Well, do you want to come in for the water bottle?

664
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:46,261
Sh-Shall I?

665
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,279
Let me open the door for you.

666
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,267
I'm glad I came today.

667
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,600
I got to see you.

668
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,100
I'm so happy to see you here, you know?

669
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:04,094
But are you okay?

670
00:47:04,094 --> 00:47:08,047
- What do you mean? 
 - Well, the company is not...

671
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,829
Yes.

672
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,600
I'm okay.

673
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,476
Plus, our CEO Kang is not someone who just gives in

674
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:20,044
so we are looking at all options.

675
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,883
Don't worry about Secretary Yu, either.

676
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,051
No, you, Jeong Hun.

677
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,888
Are you okay, Jeong Hun?

678
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,584
What?

679
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,900
Are you worried about me right now?

680
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,648
Don't mind me; I'm just getting emotional.

681
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:45,069
I am...

682
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,600
resolving some unfinished business with my father.

683
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,871
It's about time we came to a conclusion.

684
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,373
I won't live like my brother.

685
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,834
Well, there is no guarantee I will win,

686
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,650
but I'd better stick it out as long as I can.

687
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,047
I can't keep running away.

688
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,597
Wasn't I cool just now?

689
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,390
Be honest! I was cool, right?

690
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,840
Do you agree?

691
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,040
A little.

692
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,572
Not saying stuff like that would be cool, right?

693
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,300
Well, Secretary Yu...

694
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,500
doesn't say stuff like this, no?

695
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,274
Since you're my one-sided crush pal,

696
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:42,018
I'll let you in on two secrets:

697
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,215
I'm completely over my one-sided crush.

698
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,218
I have totally moved on.

699
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,019
Also...

700
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,573
I didn't come here for the water bottle.

701
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,142
Why did you come then?

702
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,780
Go back inside. The principal must be waiting.

703
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,883
Ask for the children's mats to sleep on.

704
00:49:06,883 --> 00:49:10,200
I'll cheer for your unfinished business to resolve.

705
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,808
W-Wait!

706
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:21,750
♫  Yes, I'll dive in deep into your heart  ♫

707
00:49:22,484 --> 00:49:24,670
What? That means

708
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,797
she came knowing...

709
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,275
I was sleeping here?

710
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:32,540
She came intentionally?

711
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,079
To see me?

712
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,980
♫  I can't control my heart  ♫

713
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,900
♫  How you feeling?  ♫

714
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,824
She could have just said she came to see me.

715
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:48,150
Water bottle, my foot!

716
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,162
How will I sleep tonight?

717
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,445
The chairman is in your office.

718
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,130
Oh, CEO Kang.

719
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,984
Hello.

720
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,986
The company is in rough shape.

721
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,320
What happened?

722
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,300
The investigation results will prove our innocence.

723
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,951
I will bring us back to normal right away.

724
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,261
I'll make it so.

725
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,329
Business doesn't run on facts;

726
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,956
it runs on trust.

727
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:47,516
Trust takes time to heal once it has been damaged.

728
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,505
You said this, CEO Kang,

729
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,800
"If a headhunting firm compromises on trust and fairness,"

730
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,637
"it no longer holds value as a search firm."

731
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:00,415
No one is curious about the truth.

732
00:51:00,415 --> 00:51:03,018
You should have prevented things from getting to this point,

733
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,353
at least, as the company's CEO .

734
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,930
CEO Kang,

735
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:17,833
take responsibility for this and step down.

736
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:20,519
- Chairman! 
 - If you won't step down voluntarily,

737
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:23,438
I will convene the board for a dismissal motion.

738
00:51:23,438 --> 00:51:24,940
I can't do that.

739
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,777
Peoplez is my company that I have built thus far.

740
00:51:28,777 --> 00:51:30,670
I can't step down like that.

741
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,905
If you step down, I guarantee your staff will stay employed.

742
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:38,245
Someone is interested in acquiring Peoplez.

743
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:40,370
Is Career Way...

744
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:45,200
the one interested, on the condition that I step down?

745
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,232
I need to cover my losses, too.

746
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,100
Peoplez has already lost its market value.

747
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,600
Don't push your staff into danger by holding your position.

748
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,474
Hand over your equity, management rights, and step down.

749
00:51:59,474 --> 00:52:01,909
Your employees need to earn a living.

750
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:06,347
Think carefully which decision

751
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,100
serves Peoplez the most.

752
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,600
Why don't we wrap up the meeting here?

753
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,000
   

754
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,500
I have an important announcement to make.

755
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,607
Peoplez will...

756
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,378
be acquired by Career Way.

757
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,551
Are you talking about the Peoplez that we know?

758
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:44,870
Yes.

759
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,147
CEO Kang Ji Yun will be fired shortly.

760
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:50,856
Once CEO Kang is fired, we will start the acquisition.

761
00:52:50,856 --> 00:52:53,943
But Ms. CEO, the stockholders will be against it, right?

762
00:52:53,943 --> 00:52:55,447
The market value of Peoplez

763
00:52:55,447 --> 00:52:58,700
is at rock bottom, even if we don't push to acquire them.

764
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,136
No, we will acquire them.

765
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,804
If stockholders oppose it,

766
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,639
tell them I will buy their shares myself.

767
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,200
Peoplez will disappear fully from this industry

768
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,000
and be absorbed by Career Way.

769
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,358
- What you were looking for... 
 - Here it is.

770
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,776
Thank you.

771
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,300
Gwang Hee, look at this.

772
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,032
They planned to jointly develop the new drug

773
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,284
with this pharmaceutical company before they patented it.

774
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,620
They halted the joint development for a reason.

775
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,373
They must be aware of Econic Bio's internal affairs.

776
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,907
I'll look into it right away.

777
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,390
I know a few people in the pharmaceutical industry.

778
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,809
- Yes, Ji Yun. 
 - Yes, I'll also get into...

779
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,219
I'm at the bookstore with the team members.

780
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:35,647
 I will look into it further with Manager. 

781
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,899
 I'll find more news articles from that time. 

782
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,317
 I'm sure we will find clues. 

783
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,403
 Gwang Hee, contact the pharmaceutical company. 

784
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,638
 Yes, I've left them a voicemail. 

785
00:54:43,638 --> 00:54:45,280
 Okay. 

786
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,642
Eun Ho,

787
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,100
do you want to go to the ocean?

788
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,800
♫  Just like you  ♫

789
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:05,220
♫  A star shining in your eyes  ♫

790
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:09,200
♫  Just like moon  ♫

791
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:17,730
♫  Even when darkness falls, it shines  ♫

792
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:22,420
♫  I can show you the light  ♫

793
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:28,420
♫  When this night passes and the morning dawns  ♫

794
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:37,710
♫  This moment when I meet your eyes every day  ♫

795
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:45,170
♫  Approaches me like a dream  ♫

796
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:49,510
♫  Just like forever moonlight  ♫

797
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:55,460
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

798
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,520
Is it because the setting is so beautiful

799
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,481
that it came out so nicely?

800
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:08,690
♫  I'm always by your side  ♫

801
00:56:09,683 --> 00:56:12,159
What were you thinking about?

802
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,164
My thoughts are of you, Eun Ho.

803
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,998
About me?

804
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,700
So much has changed since I met you, Eun Ho.

805
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:30,678
I always thought I must be responsible for it all alone.

806
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:34,500
Building Peoplez and protecting it,

807
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,852
I thought it was all my responsibility.

808
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,939
After seeing my staff at the bookstore,

809
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,273
I realized that is not true.

810
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,778
Thank you.

811
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:50,346
If not for you, Eun Ho, I wouldn't have realized it.

812
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,619
Ji Yun, you're not alone,

813
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,200
all this time and going forward as well.

814
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:14,930
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

815
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,203
Byeol, why didn't you go to the ocean with them?

816
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,704
- Didn't you want to go? 
 - I'll join them next time.

817
00:57:40,704 --> 00:57:44,060
Today, my daddy has a gift for her.

818
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:47,713
I don't know if he gave it to her nicely.

819
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,145
Eun Ho, just take it out.

820
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,880
I was trying to be secretive.

821
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,900
You were being super obvious.

822
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,105
What is it?

823
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,225
Just a moment then.

824
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,660
Here!

825
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,850
Ta-da!

826
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:49,007
Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.

827
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,154
That's right. I love it.

828
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,730
Thank you.

829
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,001
It's so pretty,

830
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,518
right?

831
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,380
♫  What should I say about your facial expression?  ♫

832
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,760
♫  There's something there  ♫

833
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:20,013
 What's your favorite, Byeol? 

834
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,510
♫  A hidden world that only you know  ♫

835
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,111
 This one! 

836
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,389
 Please show me this one. 

837
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:30,410
 - Let me show you. 
 - Yes. 

838
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:36,030
♫  Let me see you now, Baby  ♫

839
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,282
 What do you think? 

840
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,230
 It's pretty. 

841
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:41,703
 I bet it would look so good on her! 

842
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,440
 Really? 

843
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,330
♫  Will you tell me?  ♫

844
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,876
I'm glad to give this to you at such a lovely spot.

845
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,044
I'm glad I had it with me.

846
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,370
Wow! So pretty.

847
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,009
May I put it on you?

848
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,760
♫  The day passes by  ♫

849
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,690
♫  I want to know your everything more and more  ♫

850
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,910
♫  Baby, know you more and more  ♫

851
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:10,080
♫  Makes the whole night sway  ♫

852
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,560
♫  Yesterday, even my dreams were filled with you  ♫

853
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,387
What do you think?

854
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:18,238
Enchanting.

855
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,412
Thank you, Eun Ho.

856
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,300
With you, I became a slightly better person.

857
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,048
I never thought to look inside myself,

858
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,883
although my job is recommending people.

859
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,000
I didn't like my life.

860
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,434
But ever since I met you, Eun Ho...

861
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,604
I started liking myself.

862
01:01:01,048 --> 01:01:03,341
No matter where you are, Ji Yun,

863
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,787
I will never let go of your hand.

864
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,819
Will you really be okay?

865
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,821
I'm fine sleeping at home now.

866
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,572
Please explain it well to Byeol.

867
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,409
 Take care. 

868
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,126
 Drive safely. 

869
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,620
I will go in after seeing you off.

870
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,338
I'll call you when I get home.

871
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,064
 Peoplez Staff, 

872
01:02:31,064 --> 01:02:35,500
 please come to the office by 10 a.m. tomorrow morning. 

873
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,450
   

874
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,228
 Gosh, this scent. 

875
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,080
I haven't been here in so long.

876
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,165
It's been only a week.

877
01:02:58,165 --> 01:03:00,735
I have been dying to get back.

878
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,588
I got butterflies after getting the CEO's message yesterday.

879
01:03:03,588 --> 01:03:05,272
I can't believe I'm so excited to come to work.

880
01:03:05,272 --> 01:03:06,632
Right, right?

881
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:08,800
So we can go back to work now, right?

882
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,327
Ms. CEO! You're here early!

883
01:03:11,327 --> 01:03:13,398
- Good morning. 
 - Hello!

884
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:15,366
Hello, CEO!

885
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:17,251
Long time, no see!

886
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,586
- Hello. 
 - Hello!

887
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,387
Good morning.

888
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,424
Hello, Ms. CEO.

889
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,675
- Yes. Good morning. 
 - Hello.

890
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,360
 Long time, no see. 

891
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,738
I asked you all to come in

892
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,048
because I have something to tell you.

893
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,180
As of today,

894
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:04,400
I'm resigning from CEO of Peoplez.

895
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:13,990


896
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,960
   

897
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:27,990
♫  Once again, my heart  ♫

898
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:38,260
♫  Is walking toward where you are  ♫

899
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:46,530
♫  Feelings for you that I can’t hide  ♫

900
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:56,180
♫  Unstoppable steps toward you  ♫

901
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,420
 Please protect Peoplez, everyone. 

902
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,650
 I trust your decision, Ji Yun. 

903
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,240
 Yu Eun Ho was the best secretary for me. 

904
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,090
 Kang Ji Yun, watch carefully 

905
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,920
 how quickly Peoplez and your name disappear. 

906
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,510
 I pity you. You still live full of resentment. 

907
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,910
 I won't live motivated by hatred anymore. 

908
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,340
 It appears a life without work suits you, Kang Ji Yun. 

909
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,390
 - "Kang Ji Yun"? 
 - Ji Yun. 

910
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,210
 What is the nature of our relationship? 

911
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,150
 Saying hi when we meet each other? 

912
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:23,430
 Instead of that, let's have a different relationship! 

913
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,760
 I become impulsive when I'm with you, Eun Ho. 

914
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,560
 I'm usually anxious without a plan. 

915
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,840
 - It's fun, right? 
 - This is serious. 

916
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,640
 Hansu Electronics' HR Ace! You're coming, right? 

917
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,770
 You will be back, right? 

918
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:33,920
 There is no position for you. 

919
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,220
 Yu Eun Ho, you're fired now.
