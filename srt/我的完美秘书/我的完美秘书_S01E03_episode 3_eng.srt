00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,380
    
 ♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,360
♫  I don't know why I'm being like this  ♫

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,210
    
 ♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,110
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,590
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,960
♫  Though it might be sudden  ♫

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,990
   

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,020
♫  So just test me, I'll tell you  ♫

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,960
♫  My sincere feelings for you  ♫

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,440
♫  Yes, whenever it is, just tell me  ♫

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,390
♫  Whatever it is, I can do it  ♫

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,640
    
 ♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,550
   

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,020
   

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,880
   

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,270
   

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,860
   

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,890
   

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,270
Where's the CEO? Was the CEO really fired?

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,320
Why would he—

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,350
That's why I told you to stay quiet.

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,740
If you had just stayed quiet, our company could have played the victim.

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,280
Because you made a fuss...

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,430
Sunbae, someone almost committed suicide.

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,160
People lost jobs and livelihoods due to us.

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,690
How can we cover it up to save ourselves?

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,740
We should look into it and take responsibility.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,440
The investor created a paper company to deceive willfully.

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,610
How could we take responsibility for that?

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,980
More people are involved. If anyone at our company benefited—

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,100
Shut up!

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,490
Excuse me.

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,140
   

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,840
We're from the Yeongpo Police Station.

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,410
What is it?

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,320
Early this morning, Lee Yong Hun...

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,110
fell to his death from his apartment rooftop.

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:23,100


39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,980
Kang Ji Yun.

40
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,700
Is this what you wanted?

41
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,920
Are you happy now?

42
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,870
You knew this would happen.

43
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,230
 Don't pretend you didn't. You disgust me. 

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,700
You killed Sunbae.

45
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,740
Where are we going?

46
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,620
- First, the hospital... 
 - Turn the car around.

47
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,040
Excuse me?

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,450
Let's go eat. I'm hungry.

49
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,210
Well, CEO...

50
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,220
Next time.

51
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,340
I'll explain next time.

52
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,690
Today, let's just eat.

53
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,040
Thanks for today.

54
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,380
   

55
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,050
- Auntie. 
 - You came.

56
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,550
Long time, no see.

57
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,810
The same as usual, right? Level five spice.

58
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
Yes, give me two servings.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
   

60
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,460
Thank you.

61
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,580
Just a second.

62
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,160
There.

63
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
Let's eat.

64
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,500
Isn't it spicy?

65
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,430
I can't lose to this.

66
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,870
Are you fighting with tteokbokki right now?

67
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,990
This is always a battle between you and the food.

68
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,030
Who gets so competitive about eating?

69
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,340
Me.

70
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,050
I do.

71
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,380
Why aren't you eating?

72
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,190
I'm not good with spicy foods. I haven't tried death-level spicy.

73
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,680
You should have said so when we ordered.

74
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,430
You can't even tell me that?

75
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,520
 The secretary I need does only what I say. 

76
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,900
 Don't do too much like this. 

77
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,370
It's okay.

78
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,020
All right.

79
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,870
It's your fault for not saying anything so do as you please.

80
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,790
Slow down—

81
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,690
It's spicy, after all.

82
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,240
Napkin...

83
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,300
No.

84
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,730
You hold a grudge, don't you?

85
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,250
Did I do too much again? I'd better not cross boundaries.

86
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,600
Why don't we stop?

87
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,800
Right, we should stop.

88
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,950
I went too far earlier.

89
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,300
So just do a good job.

90
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,470
Just don't be a bother. Okay.

91
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,880
Let's do our best to work together.

92
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,230
Sounds good.

93
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,440
Are you really not eating?

94
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,320
You're Korean; you should handle this much. Try.

95
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,040
Sure, why not?

96
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,530
It's so delicious.

97
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,500
It's not that bad.

98
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,860
Why are you eating such a spicy thing?

99
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,600
We're so different. You don't know how to enjoy it.

100
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,590
Thank you.

101
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,000
Hot!

102
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,500
So hot!

103
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,240
Just a second...

104
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,750
Yes, Director Seo.

105
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,340
 You're not there yet, right? 

106
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,350
You don't need to go over there, Jeong Hun. The situation's over.

107
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,010
I see.

108
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,700
Great, it was about to be rush hour.

109
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,400
Okay.

110
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,870
It was somehow spicier today.

111
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,250
   

112
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,440
 Thanks, Auntie. 

113
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,680
 - Goodbye. 
 - Thank you. 

114
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,350
 Could I take one? 

115
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,680
 - Take all you like. 
 - Thank you. 

116
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,410
 Thank you! 

117
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,400
   

118
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,900
   

119
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,130
The Selim Group project has been wrapped up.

120
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,410
I should have watched it more closely. It was my fault.

121
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,440
What could we have done when Career Way intentionally took candidates away?

122
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,820
Let's acknowledge we failed and focus on ongoing projects.

123
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,010
Are there projects we should especially focus on?

124
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,220
Hotel Ganiel for their executive chef position.

125
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,200
We're in contact with the candidate Ganiel selected,

126
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,720
but he seems to want certain terms met.

127
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,250
I think you should attend the meeting and get a sense of it.

128
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,110
Sounds good. Prepare the necessary materials by today.

129
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,500
- "Today"? 
 - Yes, today.

130
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,490
Update the DB (database) and list the candidates.

131
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,620
Prepare sample questions.

132
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,000
You can also prepare other projects today, right?

133
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,770
That's it.

134
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,610
- Good work. 
 - We're not ready to end.

135
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,470
I wanted to ask a question.

136
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,080
- I really can't. 
 - This is impossible.

137
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,950
- I can do it! 
 - Deputy, that's really impossible.

138
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,240
Why do I have to?

139
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,110
Manager, you, too.

140
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,270
In two days?

141
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,870
Sure, it's possible.

142
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,110
Wow, Kang Ji Yun is all fired up.

143
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,970
That's who she is, naturally.

144
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,320
CEO Kang Ji Yun is her best when she's upbeat.

145
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,700
 Where are you going? 

146
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,490
Going somewhere.

147
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,050
   

148
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,310
Not here?

149
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,080
Excuse me, Abeonim. (She assumes he's a father.)

150
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,140
Abeonim?

151
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,730
Abeonim.

152
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,950
Abeonim.

153
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,580
Me?

154
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,270
W-Were you talking to me?

155
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,430
There's still time before the children are out.

156
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,320
You can wait over here, Abeonim.

157
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,010
"Abeonim"?

158
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,360
Do you think I'm a father of a child?

159
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,420
Pardon?

160
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,080
Do I look like someone's dad to you?

161
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,130
Have you ever seen a dad who looks like this? See my amazing skin!

162
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,180
It's not like dads give birth.

163
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,670
That is true.

164
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,270
But still, this is wrong. I'm not even married!

165
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,640
Have I let myself go? Let's see.

166
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,990
Then what brings you to the kindergarten?

167
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,460
My family member is here.

168
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,280
- Noona. 
 - Principal.

169
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,430
N-Noona?

170
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,170
N-Noona?

171
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,090
Why did you have to run a kindergarten?

172
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,960
No one told you to come.

173
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,060
Also, I told you not to call me "Noona."

174
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,020
Hyung has been gone a while. How long should I call you "Sister-in-law"?

175
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,670
At this rate, you'll never remarry.

176
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,700
Then you shouldn't even be visiting me.

177
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,560
Still, I should remember your birthday.

178
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,270
Don't you want me to come here?

179
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,260
Will you stop coming if I say yes?

180
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,650
Just don't come too often. I'm okay now.

181
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,470
I'm not okay.

182
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,200
I'll stop coming once you find a boyfriend.

183
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,890
So bear with me until then.

184
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,170
Guys.

185
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,190
Do you know him, too?

186
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,740
Yes, he's the principal's little brother.

187
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,120
Does he come by often? How come I've never seen him?

188
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,010
Sometimes he comes and stays with us during the day.

189
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,800
"During the day"?

190
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,550
Doesn't he work?

191
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,270
I don't know. He says he loves to play.

192
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,410
What? Does he think he's Pororo? (penguin cartoon)

193
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,570
Must be tough for the Principal to care for her brother. Right?

194
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,570
Yes.

195
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,590
What should we have for dinner?

196
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,290
Oh, no.

197
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,010
I don't know.

198
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,810
I'm a little scared.

199
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,330
Stay still. It's scary.

200
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,510
 This is too much. How can we do all this in one day? 

201
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,050
No.

202
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,890
 All right, all right. 

203
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,470
Cheer up.

204
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,680
We're the best of the best. We can finish this in no time.

205
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,090
You work very hard

206
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,420
so I'll order pizza as a special treat.

207
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,160
- Really? 
 - Yes, I'm ordering now.

208
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,530
What's up with him?

209
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,610
Straighten your crust! Stretch your slices!

210
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,440
Face pizza, smile blossoms pizza!

211
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,330
See your face. Don't you feel energy?

212
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,370
Pepperoni pizza.

213
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,670
- What? 
 - Delivery.

214
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,080
- Daebak! 
 - Executive Secretary!

215
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,770
Secretary Yu, were we in sync?

216
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,030
It must have been telepathy.

217
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,800
I wanted to use this pun today for some reason.

218
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,080
Gosh, daebak.

219
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,260
I got shrimp pizza too.

220
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,120
Look, I got goosebumps!

221
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,960
- Thank you. 
 - Let's dig in.

222
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,390
Secretary Yu...

223
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,800
- Oh, gosh! 
 - Wow, look at this.

224
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,850
Let's all eat.

225
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,170
Gosh, this tasty pizza reminds me of our CEO.

226
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,350
"Director Seo!"

227
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,720
"Director Seo! Yes. By today!"

228
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,590
"Update the DB. Make a candidate list."

229
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,070
"List the sample questions. By today, right?"

230
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,070
"Prepare it."

231
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,040
"Meeting over."

232
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,470
"Meeting over." You get it, right?

233
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,100
- Meeting over. 
 - No, it's not that.

234
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,310
You need to add her personal inflection at the end.

235
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,900
Colder, more rational, and harsh.

236
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,720
"Meeting over." Then the CEO's office. Where? The office.

237
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,260
"Gyeong Hwa, don't hold back."

238
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,220
- Have some pizza. 
 - Why?

239
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,090
Ma'am, you're here.

240
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,730
Would you like some pizza? Crap...

241
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,580
Where did I put my makeup?

242
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,490
My goodness...

243
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,160
- What's this smell? 
 - Have some. Secretary brought some.

244
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,500
CEO, have some, too.

245
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,460
- Have some. 
 - We ate a lot during the meeting. We're good.

246
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,520
You guys eat.

247
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,350
Ma'am...

248
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,290
I'll take just one piece.

249
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,750
Gyeong Hwa, enjoy.

250
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,720
CEO, let me explain.

251
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,220
I'm so grateful.

252
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm so proud of Secretary Yu for thinking of this.

253
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,980
- Proud, my foot. 
 - Rushing and pushing people isn't the only way.

254
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,760
I hired him to care for you, but he also cares for employees.

255
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,010
 I shouldn't have eaten pizza at this hour. 

256
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,450
He loves to push boundaries.

257
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,870
When you see him doing that,

258
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,430
do you think of anything from the bottom of your heart?

259
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,210
 What about Deputy Gyu Rim? You can say it. 

260
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,720
"When will they finish at that rate? Why not eat after work?"

261
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,680
"How can they eat when they're not done?"

262
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,570
Stuff like that.

263
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,620
Look at all this dust.

264
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,490
Unnie!

265
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,920
Gosh, really...

266
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,610
 I feel I sounded exactly the same. 

267
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,310
- Do you want to get fired? 
 - I didn't think it was similar.

268
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,760
Stop imitating her.

269
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,810
Eat outside.

270
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,880
 Chef Han Jeong Won, 

271
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,710
 a renowned Italian culinary school graduate. 

272
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,440
 He built a career at Michelin-starred restaurants in USA and Europe. 

273
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,490
Number one and three...

274
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,400
 He returned to Korea five years ago and did TV programs 

275
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,040
 as a star chef for the signature menu he showcased. 

276
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,040
 He stopped TV appearances lately to focus solely on Bello Buono, 

277
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,330
 the fine dining restaurant that recruited him two years ago. 

278
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,440
 They're known for having a month-long waiting list. 

279
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,740
Let's see.

280
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,080
   

281
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,040
 Chef's signature menu... 

282
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,210
A spectacular résumé and outstanding star power,

283
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,930
no wonder Hotel Ganiel  wants him.

284
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,640
So who was that, Na...

285
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,250
- Na... 
 - Deputy Na Gyu Rim will come straight

286
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,860
to the restaurant after her meeting.

287
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,510
You must be pleased with the offer since you invited me all the way here.

288
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,390
But I have my conditions.

289
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,290
I'd like to take my sous-chef with me.

290
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,400
Are you saying you want to relocate together?

291
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,220
Yes, it's someone who complements my style perfectly.

292
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,980
You know how important it is to work with someone who complements you.

293
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,890
It would be a huge detriment to me to leave them behind.

294
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,400
I will discuss it with Ganiel.

295
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,630
Since it's someone you recommend, I'm sure the hotel won't object.

296
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,480
You must be glad to have someone like that,

297
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,220
an employee who complements you...

298
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,330
Executive Secretary?

299
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,890
Gosh, where's everyone, leaving my sous-chef alone?

300
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,360
I apologize. He doesn't have to help.

301
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,160
It's okay.

302
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,930
Don't worry. He seems to want to help.

303
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,920
So she's the one you want to bring with you, right?

304
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,210
Yes, she's my second-in-command, as I mentioned.

305
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,210
- Are you doing okay? 
 - Yes, of course.

306
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,280
- Should I leave this here? 
 - Yes, you can put it anywhere.

307
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,700
Is that everything?

308
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,720
Yes, that's all. Thank you for your help.

309
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,850
The chef will scold me if he finds out.

310
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,350
Nothing wrong that I lent a hand.

311
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,790
I'm glad we finished in time.

312
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,590
Thank you.

313
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,500
Wow, do you grow all this here?

314
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,230
Yes, we grow all the edible flowers and herbs

315
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,260
we use at our restaurant.

316
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,970
The chef is very serious about his cooking.

317
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,550
There are so many kinds. This is such an unusual color.

318
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,670
This one's called nasturtium, and you can eat its flower, leaf, and seeds.

319
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,700
It's often used in salads for its spicy zing.

320
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,310
And...

321
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,760
these are pansies.

322
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,790
Pansies are great for bibimbaps and teas because they're slightly sweet.

323
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,230
Those are dianthus (carnation petals).

324
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,360
Sounds like you're serious about cooking, Sous-chef.

325
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,640
I have a long way to go to catch up to the chef.

326
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,750
What are some dishes children could eat with pansies?

327
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,440
Pansies are tasty in kimbap. I'll give you the recipe.

328
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,980
- I'm a good cook. 
 - Oh, really?

329
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,740
I'll be leaving then. Goodbye.

330
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,930
   

331
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,780
It's that way.

332
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,380
♫  Quite thrilling  ♫

333
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:56,540
♫  Giving in to this feeling, guide me closer  ♫

334
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:03,010
♫  Yes, I'll dive in deep into your heart  ♫

335
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,560
♫  Babe, you're living inside of my heart  ♫

336
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,760
♫  I know you mean it's all right  ♫

337
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,700
♫  I heard your heart beating loud  ♫

338
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,370
♫  Because your whispers tickle my mind  ♫

339
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,320
CEO.

340
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,380
We will leave now.

341
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,700
♫  I can't control my heart  ♫

342
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,020
♫  How you feeling?  ♫

343
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,300
♫  How you feeling?  ♫

344
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,970
   

345
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,560
Ji Yun, long time, no see.

346
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,560
My meeting ended early so I dropped by.

347
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,780
Thank you.

348
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,470
I took it out to read it.

349
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,200
Can you give it to me? I've been meaning to take it out.

350
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,570
Why should I give it to you?

351
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,210
Grownups are supposed to give children things.

352
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,640
- Do you really want to read this book? 
 - Yes.

353
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,570
But you can't fully read Korean yet, right?

354
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,950
I can read everything.

355
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,210
Then read this. 
    

356
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,350
Th-This is a picture book.

357
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,080
Read it once you can fully read Korean.

358
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,790
Why is an adult reading a picture book? Ahjumma, you can read so many others.

359
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,580
Adults read picture books, too. And...

360
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,260
I'm an unnie, not an ahjumma.

361
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,870
I don't think you're an unnie.

362
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,360
You look older than my dad.

363
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,150
Your dad must have married really early.

364
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,670
I heard my dad was popular, just like me.

365
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,500
He wouldn't have married early if he was popular, like me.

366
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,850
Hello. Byeol!

367
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,810
Auntie!

368
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,100
Did something happen?

369
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,040
Yes, Director. I'm nearby.

370
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,720
I'll be right there. Yes.

371
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,730
Brat, enjoy it.

372
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,300
Although I'm unsure if you can read it.

373
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,200
What the heck? So annoying.

374
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,070
Who is that? Do you know her?

375
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,590
Look here. What does this say?

376
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,430
What?

377
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,310
You can't read this, Byeol.

378
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,290
Why not? What does it say?

379
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:08,950
"Picture book for adults."

380
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,750
So embarrassing...

381
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,370
Director.

382
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,220
- Yes. 
 - Do you have something to tell me by chance?

383
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,130
I sure have lots to say to you.

384
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,550
And I have lots I'm curious about.

385
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,930
What cologne do you use?

386
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,030
- Pardon? 
 - When I fell into your arms the other day,

387
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:27,640
I liked the way you smell.

388
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,900
Are you talking about this scent?

389
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,840
I'll let you know what it is if you like it.

390
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,550
I was worried for no reason. Okay then.

391
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,280
He doesn't get flustered.

392
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,300
No wonder she's stressed out working in this environment.

393
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,500
O... kay.

394
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,620
Hey, that's wrong.

395
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,120
Look.

396
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,750
O...

397
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,240
Kay. See?

398
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,000
Hey, you're wrong.

399
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,160
Let me try.

400
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,090
Look.

401
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,890
Soo...

402
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,970
That's why she's doing that?

403
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,720
Yes, she got her ego bruised.

404
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,580
She wants to show off perfect reading skills the next time she sees her.

405
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,020
Whoever it is, it seems she wronged our Yu Byeol.

406
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,640
Right?

407
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,020
What's tonight's menu?

408
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,890
Braised chicken.

409
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,890
Amazing. I was feeling too lazy to cook dinner.

410
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,520
Did your mom arrive okay?

411
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,600
Yes. I talked to her earlier.

412
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,860
Why is she taking a trip suddenly?

413
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh, there's not much time left.

414
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,560
Are you okay, Writer Jeong?

415
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,740
Well, not as bad as my mom.

416
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,230
- Let me get the children. 
 - Okay.

417
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,520
- No... 
 - Let's eat, Children.

418
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,470
Dad, can't you see I'm studying?

419
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,600
- Let's eat first. 
 - Dad, please do only what I ask you.

420
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,860
What's wrong?

421
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,320
This feels so familiar.

422
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,990
I feel I'm still at work.

423
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,040
   

424
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,000
   

425
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,830
   

426
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,370
   

427
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,590
   

428
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,220
   

429
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,790
   

430
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,030
What are you up to?

431
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,090
I made something.

432
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,760
- What is it? 
 - I feel shy.

433
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,600
Do you need anything?

434
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,480
- It's so delicious. 
 - Is it?

435
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,460
- It's no joke. 
 -  I did a good job, didn't I? 

436
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,800
 It's so tasty. 

437
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
   

438
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,060
An inappropriate relationship

439
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,910
appeared in the reference check?

440
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,320
Yes, it came from one of their co-workers.

441
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,510
I looked into it, and there seem to be rumors,

442
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,360
how Sous-chef Yu Hae In gets special treatment

443
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,390
due to their personal relationship.

444
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,030
 Hae In was so pretty and sweet. 

445
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,130
 She'd do anything I asked. 

446
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,090
 A few years ago, who was that again? 

447
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,950
 I heard she went to work for that famous chef. 

448
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,130
 But how did she get in there? 

449
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,640
 Chef Han Jeong Won. 

450
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,780
 He's very precise. He's all about skills. 

451
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,620
 He hires only crew who have studied abroad. 

452
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,620
 Yu Hae In is the only one without credentials. 

453
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,460
 She became a sous-chef after I left, 

454
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,490
 and I heard she's glued to his side in the kitchen. 

455
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,490
 I'm sure something is between them. 

456
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:47,420
 Honestly, Hae In isn't skilled as a sous-chef. 

457
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,150
 She didn't even graduate from a major culinary school. 

458
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,800
 I heard she started as a dishwasher. 

459
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,560
 How did she manage to advance? 

460
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,770
 It's obvious. 

461
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,900
I think we need to replace the candidate for this project.

462
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,550
Although there's no concrete proof, they're clearly involved in some way.

463
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,140
"Replace"? They're both single. What's the big deal if they're dating?

464
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,980
That's not inherently an ethical issue.

465
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,310
If she gained special benefits due to their relationship, not her skills, that's a problem.

466
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,410
Being a sous-chef and relocating jointly...

467
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,470
CEO, what do you think of the joint relocation?

468
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,210
Let's proceed with Chef Han Jeong Won's transfer alone.

469
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,600
If it's true or not, there should be clear merit to overcome the rumor.

470
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,380
But there's no justifiable reason to relocate Yu Hae In as well.

471
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,960
Bringing her along will only fuel the gossip.

472
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,200
It could even harm his career.

473
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,260
Yes, the rumor will probably follow them around.

474
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,220
I think there's one thing

475
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,110
we didn't check:

476
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,970
these two themselves.

477
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,220
We should ask them directly.

478
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,280
How could we ask them? Even if we ask, they'll deny it.

479
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,020
We should still check.

480
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,170
Who knows? Maybe there's a story behind it all.

481
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,920
Being swept up by rumors makes it hard to see truth.

482
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,570
Many people were jealous of Hae In.

483
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,750
Their pride was wounded by having someone unconventional above them.

484
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,680
So there was never favoritism?

485
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,700
The chef is not like that.

486
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,590
Despite my average background,

487
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,800
he saw my skills without prejudice.

488
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,850
He really supported me when I couldn't fit in the kitchen.

489
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,360
Without him, I wouldn't have been able to continue cooking.

490
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,460
Are you saying the rumors are not true?

491
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,710
CEO Kang, I'm very picky when it comes to hiring crew.

492
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,600
My sous-chef might not be the most confident,

493
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,730
but she has solid basic skills, is hardworking, and

494
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,940
her sincere approach toward ingredients is admirable.

495
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,750
She's so much better than show-offs who attended famous schools.

496
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,920
There are reasons I suggested bringing her along.

497
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,970
So you'd still like to bring her with you?

498
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,850
Why shouldn't I when the rumors are not true?

499
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,480
   

500
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,860
Thanks for your cooperation.

501
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,220
No worries. Misunderstandings need to be cleared up.

502
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,590
Please let me know if you have any more questions.

503
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,670
Yes, I'll be in touch.

504
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,940
Yes.

505
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,600
Take care.

506
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,660
Chef, are you okay?

507
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,880
Goodbye.

508
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,840
   

509
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,080
   

510
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,840
Did you check the two-year gap in Chef Han's résumé?

511
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,710
You were right.

512
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,530
His ex-colleagues confirmed  his right wrist had neurological surgery.

513
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,440
Also, see this.

514
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,250
 Right. Do you stir fry this? 

515
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,870
 I will when it's ready later. 

516
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,450
This was his last TV appearance before he stopped.

517
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,260
When did Chef Yu Hae In become sous-chef?

518
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,000
Right when Chef Han Jeong Won stopped appearing on TV.

519
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,800
There was a different reason why he needed her.

520
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,990
 Now, you can see how he's stir-frying. 

521
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,240
 Rocambole garlic, shepherd's purse...  

522
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,090
Yes, it's true that my wrist has issues.

523
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,730
It was fine after the surgery but since a few years ago,

524
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,720
it's been acting up again.

525
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,570
That's why I need the sous-chef's help.

526
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,530
That's why a rumor like that started.

527
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,390
Hae In is the only one who knows about my wrist.

528
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,520
I'd like to keep it that way.

529
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,900
Please keep it a secret from the Hotel Ganiel .

530
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,720
You'd like to change jobs without coming clean about that?

531
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,620
Do you see this? This hand works just fine.

532
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,640
Most of the time, it's fine.

533
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,040
Just every once in a while, I get cramps.

534
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,400
I'm getting treatment regularly, and I can keep cooking.

535
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,060
I can't give up my career like this.

536
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,750
It took a lot for me to get here.

537
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,080
I've handled much more difficult situations.

538
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,090
Hae In and I work together well. There won't be an issue.

539
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,770
So please move forward with the new position.

540
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,320
Did Sous-chef Yu Hae In agree as well?

541
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,830
Of course.

542
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,740
This is the best career Hae In could have.

543
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,170
   

544
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,990
   

545
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,970
   

546
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,400
   

547
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,170
   

548
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,920
   

549
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,290
She's not unskilled. Her skills were just hidden.

550
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,030
Coffee.

551
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,520
I pressed the wrong button, and it made two cups.

552
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:49,580
Want to drink coffee together?

553
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,730
Have you decided what to do?

554
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:10,390
I need to tell my client the truth. Now that I know, I can't hide it.

555
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,310
Did you have an inkling?

556
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,880
When I worked in HR,

557
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,210
we often had to respond to workplace rumors.

558
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:22,850
Once investigated, they often were baseless lies,

559
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,100
which were accepted as fact.

560
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:30,800
As I saw how distorted rumors would sometimes change people's lives,

561
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,060
I felt bad.

562
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,220
I forgot.

563
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:46,360
What experiences have you had in HR?

564
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:51,680
 Anything from scheming, affairs, betrayal, conspiracy... 

565
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,220
I've experienced all kinds.

566
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,110
What were you caught in the middle of?

567
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,550
Termination through betrayal, schemes, baseless accusations,

568
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,970
and a cliché ending.

569
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,400
Betrayal and schemes...

570
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,210
I've experienced that.

571
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,160
Why are you nodding?

572
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,140
Do you think I'll betray someone or be betrayed?

573
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,680
No comment, I got it.

574
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,850
What kind of person do you think I am?

575
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,450
Oh, right.

576
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,630
I've been a villain to you from the start, Secretary Yu.

577
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,520
That's why I want to know the real you.

578
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,310
Then tell me, what do you think I am like?

579
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,840
I'm not sure yet,

580
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,210
but I'm certain about one thing:

581
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,460
You take great care of candidates

582
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,350
but never take care of yourself.

583
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,930
You should take care of yourself,

584
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,300
not just the candidates, please.

585
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,110
I had no capacity to take care of myself as well.

586
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,190
For some people,

587
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:57,020
basic things are luxuries.

588
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:46,890
 I had no capacity to take care of myself as well. 

589
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,280
 For some people, 

590
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,110
 basic things are luxuries. 

591
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:41,050
♫  So we drive on the left lane out in a rush  ♫

592
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:50,370
♫  Looking back at the red lights passing us by  ♫

593
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:59,870
♫  Yes, I know we shouldn't go that far  ♫

594
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:08,280
♫  But I could wonder  ♫

595
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,060
♫  Give me a feeling  ♫

596
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,920
♫  Slowly in a déjà vu  ♫

597
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,690
♫  Give me a feeling  ♫

598
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:26,440
♫  Do you want to feel it, too?  ♫

599
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:31,300
♫  Give me a feeling  ♫

600
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,020
♫  Slowly in a déjà vu  ♫

601
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:40,870
♫  Give me a feeling  ♫

602
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:45,740
♫  Because you want to feel it, too  ♫

603
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,800
You're awake.

604
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,180
How many times did you circle?

605
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:26,290
Good work.

606
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:44,170
 Our research confirmed that the rumor about the two chefs is not true. 

607
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,020
However, Chef Han is experiencing issues with his wrist.

608
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,310
Chef Yu Ha In has been supporting him,

609
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,470
due to a flare-up in the surgery area from nine years ago.

610
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:58,590
From our perspective, it will be challenging for Chef Han Jeong Won

611
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,800
to oversee the kitchen alone without support.

612
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,550
Congratulations. Your position has been confirmed.

613
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,190
So they chose me even after knowing the truth.

614
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:17,410
Hotel Ganiel needs you and your star power right now.

615
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,570
But there's one condition: the position is for you alone.

616
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:25,960
The rumors will only follow if you bring the sous-chef without disclosing why.

617
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,650
Ganiel does not want to risk creating unnecessary controversy.

618
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,730
No one can replace your star power...

619
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,430
But plenty of people can serve as a sous-chef...

620
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,660
Understood. Let's proceed as such.

621
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:58,710
Please tell them to hire someone useful who can keep things quiet.

622
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,780
You alone, Chef?

623
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,940
That's what they decided. What can I do?

624
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,420
I'm so disappointed to go alone.

625
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,140
What about me then?

626
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,170
Why are you asking me that?

627
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,130
You should figure out your own path.

628
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,870
You said you'd be responsible.

629
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,660
As long as I assisted you and kept the secret,

630
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,060
you said I can keep cooking...

631
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:41,550
I gave up other opportunities and endured rumors to assist you.

632
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:44,400
I've kept you this long despite rumors and taught you.

633
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,900
Isn't that enough? You could fend for yourself now.

634
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,630
You know me, Chef.

635
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,400
I still lack confidence to be on my own.

636
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,850
Without you,

637
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,860
the kitchen crew won't listen to me.

638
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:04,410
Please take me with you. I'll do even better.

639
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:08,570
- I'll do better so no one notices your wrist pain. 
 - Hush...

640
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:13,510
You said I'm your best helper.

641
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,120
You worked so hard all this time.

642
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,800
I'm sure your future is bright.

643
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,510
Please keep my secret.

644
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,930
We work in a small industry.

645
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,720
 This is why a background is important. 

646
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,980
 I know. She ended up getting used. 

647
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,190
 What's wrong with her? 

648
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,280
 What's she going to do? 

649
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,770
   

650
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,370
Director.

651
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,140
Is this right?

652
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,890
Is this really the right decision?

653
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,890
 I tried so hard. 

654
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:05,150
I tried my best to keep the chef's secret; look where that got me.

655
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,940
You should have kept it a secret.

656
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,890
If only you kept it a secret...

657
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:15,780
What can I do now? I put all my trust in Chef Han.

658
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,620
I just wanted to keep cooking.

659
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,810
I'm scared to be on my own.

660
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:31,090
I'm scared of people. The kitchen frightens me.

661
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,690
No secret in this world is forever.

662
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,980
Relying on another never lasts either.

663
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,600
Did you enjoy cooking alongside Chef Han?

664
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:54,490
A chef who doesn't believe in herself can't enjoy life anywhere.

665
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:01,450
Hae In, you're an amazing chef.

666
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:06,050
From now, don't rely on others. Trust yourself.

667
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,380
   

668
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,240
Kang Seok.

669
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,510
The book I asked for.

670
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,770
Yes. Just a second.

671
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,340
- Hi, Child. 
 - I can read now.

672
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,260
Really?

673
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:37,090
"Travel if you want to learn about the bigger world." 
    

674
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,830
"The open road awaits you,"

675
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,920
"as long as you embark on the journey."

676
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,420
Not bad. You've got some grit.

677
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:11,590
"The road remembers everything."

678
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,810
"The big and small moments in life,"

679
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,390
"the times when you fell with a thud,"

680
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,980
"times you persistently got back up,"

681
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:28,170
"where you started your journey, where you went,"

682
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:30,820
"what dreams you held,"

683
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:34,320
"and even things you didn't plan."

684
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,360
 The road makes its way back. 

685
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,460
"The road makes its way back."

686
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,930
 You will see so many things on your journey, 

687
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:47,260
 but you will miss the warmth of your home. 

688
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,320
 Once you've seen all you wanted to see, 

689
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,980
 the road will take you to your place. 

690
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,890
   

691
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,290
- Fold your arms. 
 - Okay.

692
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,570
- This shot here. 
 - Oh, okay.

693
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,840
- Hello. 
 - Thank you for the interview.

694
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,880
Don't mention it.

695
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,050
Congratulations on your new start.

696
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:19,670
   

697
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,470
Thank you for everything, CEO Kang.

698
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,400
Thanks for going through the interview process.

699
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,390
No, it's okay.

700
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:55,860
Don't worry. She's a new candidate of mine.

701
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:02,220
Hae In, you should find your own name now.

702
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,420
All right then.

703
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,210
Let's go.

704
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:33,550
I thought she'd just hide.

705
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:35,220
So cool.

706
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,920
Was it too much that I wanted to meet here?

707
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,550
No, you did well. 
    

708
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,570
Did you decide?

709
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:50,130
Yes. I'd like to try being a food researcher.

710
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:53,540
It's a perfect position for a chef who fears the kitchen.

711
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,970
You said you didn't feel confident. What changed your mind?

712
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,830
Peoplez has quite a tenacious employee.

713
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,300
Thank you. I could muster the courage, thanks to you.

714
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:17,220
I'll do okay, right?

715
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,970
The résumé doesn't lie.

716
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:25,770
It is a reflection of the candidate's hard work, time, and the outcomes.

717
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,370
Hae In, your résumé may not be fancy,

718
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,060
but it reflects all the time

719
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,240
you studied food as a chef.

720
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,470
"The road remembers everything."

721
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:38,950
You've walked diligently thus far.

722
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,420
I'm sure you'll be your best self there, Hae In.

723
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:07,950
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

724
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,770
I keep seeing a new side of you.

725
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:16,860
I had no idea you knew how to say such things.

726
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,290
What do you mean by such things?

727
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,870
Warm, consoling, and encouraging things,

728
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,880
words like that.

729
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,370
A book, I read it in a book.

730
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,340
 Good work. 

731
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,900
Thanks to you, we wrapped this project successfully.

732
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,500
You made the decision, CEO Kang.

733
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,170
I didn't expect you'd recommend Hae In's new position.

734
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:21,090
The position simply suited her.

735
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,550
Each company needs unique talent.

736
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:28,610
Some places need flashy stars, and others require steady skills.

737
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,420
Also, people's strengths vary.

738
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,500
I think I'm starting to understand

739
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,490
what headhunting is about.

740
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:41,570
Finding a place where people fully utilize their abilities,

741
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,940
it's meaningful work, isn't it?

742
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,290
Impressive.

743
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:56,320
Work is just work, no need to assign extra meaning.

744
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:02,630
You adapted remarkably quickly.

745
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:05,910
It must be you work for a competent leader.

746
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:11,150
Learning fast has always been my strength.

747
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,730
Let's go before it starts to rain.

748
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,420
"Rain"?

749
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:19,040
But the sky is so clear.

750
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,430
What? How did you know?

751
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:19,590
What? Be glad I have this.

752
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,530
Gosh, really...

753
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:24,990
- It's not funny at all. 
 - It is funny.

754
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,630
Let's go.

755
01:06:55,050 --> 01:07:03,040


756
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,370
   

757
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:14,720
♫  Just like forever moonlight  ♫

758
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:22,250
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

759
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:26,680
♫  Just like a forever starlight  ♫

760
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:33,490
♫  I'm always by your side  ♫

761
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,660
♫  Until that day when your light dims  ♫

762
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:40,250
 CEO, do you love winning that much? 

763
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,800
 I hate losing. I want to win at everything. 

764
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,280
 Fine, I'll let you win from now on. 

765
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,700
 I contacted this candidate first. 

766
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,440
 - Manager, can't you let it go? 
 - How can you say that? 

767
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,380
 Gyeong Hwa and Manager Kim are still on awkward terms. 

768
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,510
 Get them to drink alcohol, and they'll be fine. 

769
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:57,950
 - A welcome party. 
 - "A welcome party"? 

770
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:01,280
 Line up if you want to drink with CEO Kang. This is a rare chance. 

771
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,130
 Have you seen the CEO? 

772
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,510
 CEO Kang always goes to the office when she's drunk. 

773
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,300
 CEO? 

774
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,700
 Secretary Yu.
