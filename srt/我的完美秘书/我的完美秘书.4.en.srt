1
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,378
THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS,
COMPANIES, AND PLACES

2
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,964
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,830
Welcome.

4
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,212
One moment.

5
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,344
Wait here. I'll bring the car over.

6
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,071
Mint chocolate?

7
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,491
Is that spicy?

8
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,493
It's not that spicy.

9
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,541
Shall we…

10
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,515
{\an8}ULTRA TTEOKBOKKI

11
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,923
It's hot.

12
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,682
- Let's make that.
- Okay.

13
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,933
That looks amazing.

14
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,477
And to kick it up a notch.

15
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,147
All done.

16
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,190
Maybe you have the wrong job.

17
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,360
Why are you so serious about food?

18
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,404
Eating good food is comforting.

19
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,074
Filling your stomach also fills the heart.

20
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,621
Try it.

21
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,772
It's a little spicy.

22
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,583
- Are you done?
- Yes.

23
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,363
I'll bring the car.

24
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,337
{\an8}GENERAL MEETING GUIDE

25
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,681
Wow.

26
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,224
Good morning.

27
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,059
{\an8}What's on today's schedule?

28
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,894
{\an8}EPISODE 4

29
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,981
{\an8}You have a luncheon at noon
with Global Talent Forum.

30
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,024
A meeting with Director Park
from Gangwoo Chemicals at 2 p.m.

31
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,610
An interview with
Business Magazine at 4 p.m.

32
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,279
What's this?

33
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,031
It's a guide to the Headhunting
Association's general meeting.

34
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,076
If you'd like to attend,
I'll adjust your schedule.

35
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,411
I'm not attending.

36
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,289
REPORT ON ESTABLISHING
HEADHUNTING ACADEMY

37
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,999
Headhunting Academy?

38
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,043
They're to name the academy
after CEO Lee Yong-hoon

39
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,045
- who was the association's president.
- Who?

40
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,630
CEO Lee Yong-hoon.

41
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,513
HEADHUNTING ASSOCIATION
CHAIRPERSON - KIM HYE-JIN

42
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,399
One, two.

43
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,277
As I told you, as a special article
on female CEOs

44
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,488
there will be about 20 pages.

45
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:13,117
Photos and interviews of seven CEOs
including Ms. Kang will be published.

46
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,995
Hello.

47
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,247
Gosh, Ms. Kim.

48
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,165
Hello.

49
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,291
You came early.

50
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,668
The previous photo shoot isn't over yet.

51
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,756
- I came early on purpose, so don't worry.
- Okay.

52
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,841
It must be Ms. Kang's photo shoot.

53
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,304
This one looks nice.

54
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,389
Please take good photos of Ms. Kang.

55
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,807
She represents our industry.

56
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,268
Aren't you rivals?

57
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,397
In the female CEO special,
you two are from the same industry.

58
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,442
It was for my own benefit.

59
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,070
"If the one in second is amazing,

60
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,406
the one who comes ahead of second place
would look even better."

61
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,699
Wouldn't people think that?

62
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,121
Ms. Kim, you're unbeatable.

63
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,376
I'd like to participate

64
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,669
in founding the academy.

65
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,506
Why all of a sudden?

66
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,051
Do you still need to mooch off
CEO Lee's glory?

67
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,889
Unless you want me to get involved,
take his name out.

68
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,224
Then I'll stay out of it.

69
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,561
How dare you pretend
to be considerate of his good name.

70
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,939
You're still the one who caused his death.

71
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,110
Do you really think so?

72
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,695
Do you honestly think…

73
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,073
that I have no idea?

74
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,495
Stop dirtying CEO Lee's name.

75
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,790
If you're human and have a conscience.

76
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,461
Let's go, Mr. Yu.

77
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:50,840
Ms. Kang.

78
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:56,971
Mr. Secretary.

79
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,225
What's on Ms. Kang's schedule
this weekend?

80
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,565
Yong-hoon's daughter entered
middle school this year.

81
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,025
We're having dinner together.

82
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,901
Join us if you're free.

83
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,322
Mrs. Lee would love to hear from you.

84
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,160
Relax.

85
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,999
Your behavior

86
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,627
makes it obvious

87
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,837
that you killed Yong-hoon.

88
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,179
Please check her schedule and let me know.

89
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,473
Shall we start?

90
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,338
Let's get going.

91
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,718
How about the <i>tteokbokki </i>place?

92
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,056
No, thanks. You can't even eat it.

93
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,141
Let's take a walk.

94
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,706
I can't…

95
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,376
I can't handle spicy food,

96
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,044
but I'm confident at walking.

97
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,780
Why did you suggest walking?

98
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,032
- Pardon?
- I didn't think

99
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,909
we'd walk for 30 minutes in silence.

100
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,873
Then would you like to jog?

101
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,961
Can't tell if he's attentive or not.

102
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,178
Why aren't you asking anything?

103
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,555
I'm sure you have many questions.

104
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,934
I don't want to pry.

105
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,770
Even being asked questions
could be hurtful.

106
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,232
You don't owe me any explanation.

107
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,776
I'll only believe what I see.

108
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,209
Pass it to me!

109
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,213
- Here!
- Over here!

110
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,339
- Pass us the ball!
- Here, please!

111
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,715
- Over here!
- Pass the ball!

112
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,091
- Over here.
- Excuse me!

113
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,384
- It's our ball!
- Over here!

114
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,555
Do you like

115
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,516
basketball?

116
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,736
Whoa, incredible!

117
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,029
That was amazing.

118
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,809
He's fast.

119
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,008
No! Block him!

120
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,852
Over here. No.

121
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,964
Here you go.

122
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,008
- Nice.
- What's that?

123
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,135
Thank you.

124
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,553
Thank you, sir!

125
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,554
Thank you.

126
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,144
You should exercise more.

127
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,229
You can't get exhausted from just that.

128
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,774
Just that?

129
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,484
I played so hard.

130
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,694
You didn't even go easy on me.

131
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,449
Sports are meant to be played fair.

132
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,952
Besides, you told me
not to go easy on you.

133
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,995
It'd be cheap to ask for it.

134
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,455
You just do it without being asked.

135
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,707
That's not right.

136
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,168
That's against the rules.

137
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,671
Is this a match?

138
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,798
An international game? The Olympics?

139
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,677
Do you like winning that much?

140
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,929
Yes, I hate losing.

141
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,472
I want to win at everything.

142
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,145
Then I'll always let you win from now on.

143
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,731
- Really?
- Yes.

144
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,191
- No matter what?
- No matter what.

145
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,026
- You'll let me?
- I'll let you.

146
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,152
That sounds good.

147
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,278
Oh, Eun-ho.

148
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,031
I heard that Ji-yun saw
CEO Kim Hye-jin today.

149
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,615
Did anything happen?

150
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,873
Ji-yun has a long history with Ms. Kim.

151
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,834
It's something you should know
as her secretary.

152
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,921
At Career Way,
Kim Hye-jin was Ji-yun's mentor.

153
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,008
Before what happened to CEO Lee,

154
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,926
Ji-yun looked up to her a lot.

155
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,386
A few years ago,

156
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,557
Career Way was scammed
by a paper company.

157
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,516
WAS CAREER WAY REALLY OBLIVIOUS?

158
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,351
<i>Thinking it was a promising start-up,</i>

159
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,313
<i>Career Way formed a group
of founding members.</i>

160
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,939
<i>It shut down within a few months.</i>

161
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,359
<i>Their goal had been investment fraud.</i>

162
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,445
<i>Career Way had no idea?</i>

163
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,363
<i>That's what they stated officially.</i>

164
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:59,161
<i>Then Ji-yun was informed that someone
from Career Way was involved in the fraud.</i>

165
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,747
<i>She asked for an investigation,</i>

166
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,461
<i>but CEO Lee Yong-hoon left a will
and committed suicide.</i>

167
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,922
<i>He took the entirety of the blame.</i>

168
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,801
<i>He didn't want things to worsen further.</i>

169
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,929
<i>But that doesn't make it Ms. Kang's fault.</i>

170
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,722
<i>No, of course not.</i>

171
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,391
<i>At that time, they needed a common enemy.</i>

172
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,519
<i>It was perfect
for shifting the public eye.</i>

173
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,523
<i>A traitor who led the CEO to his death
with her whistleblowing.</i>

174
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,234
<i>The case was closed,</i>

175
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,277
<i>Career Way got away without charges,</i>

176
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,363
<i>and at the helm was Kim Hye-jin.</i>

177
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,782
<i>After the situation subsided,</i>

178
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,575
<i>she took over as CEO.</i>

179
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,785
<i>To sugarcoat it,</i>

180
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,870
<i>Ji-yun became independent.</i>

181
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,163
<i>In reality, she was kicked out.</i>

182
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,541
<i>Even I was scared as a bystander.</i>

183
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,210
<i>People's attitudes changed
completely overnight.</i>

184
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,465
Ji-yun endured a lot to get here.

185
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,717
She blamed herself a lot too.

186
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,220
It's not surprising
that her brain is overloaded.

187
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,223
She couldn't rely on anyone getting here.

188
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,060
She had no choice but to get strong.

189
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:11,400
And that's how she became the invincible
Kang Ji-yun as we know her today.

190
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,562
Hello, Mr. Park.

191
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,815
Did you take a look
at the client's sales analysis?

192
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,861
I made a list of their sales and profits
these past three years.

193
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,238
One moment, please.

194
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,533
I'm sorry. Hold on.

195
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,453
WORLD CORPORATION
PROFIT ANALYSIS

196
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,247
Yes, Mr. Park.

197
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:12,294
The client obtained the patent
before the competitors, so that's fine.

198
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,547
Then I'll send you the SWOT analysis

199
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,009
{\an8}of the client and their competitors
by tomorrow morning.

200
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,093
{\an8}ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS FACTORS
OF A COMPANY

201
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,680
{\an8}Of course. You should take a close look
before making the decision.

202
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,640
Bye.

203
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,313
Are these data for one project?

204
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,612
{\an8}Since I became a consultant
from being a researcher,

205
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,240
{\an8}I haven't gotten any results of my own.

206
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,244
I can't spend all my life
assisting someone.

207
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,329
I want to make this successful

208
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,248
and prove my competence.

209
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,045
I'll make this successful no matter what.

210
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,300
You're doing very well already.

211
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,761
Don't push yourself too hard.

212
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,179
Do it as you always do.

213
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,598
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

214
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,517
Please, head home.

215
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,661
I've tried it so many times…

216
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,037
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

217
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,957
Did you recommend Mr. Park Geun-ha
to change jobs?

218
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,668
- Let's talk later.
- Okay.

219
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,585
Yes.

220
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,796
Kyung-hwa, how do you know Mr. Park?

221
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,549
Kyung-hwa has been working hard
on him as her candidate.

222
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,302
- Hasn't she contacted him for a while?
- Yes.

223
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,095
What are you talking about?

224
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,888
He didn't mention that on the phone.

225
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,558
At my previous company,

226
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,518
I helped Mr. Park change jobs.

227
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,104
A good position came up,
so when I called him,

228
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,606
he was just ecstatic.

229
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,235
I've been contacting him for a month
regarding the World Corporation case.

230
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,153
World Corporation?

231
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,946
They haven't picked a candidate yet.

232
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,989
You never reported it to me.

233
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,034
Yesterday, he made his decision
to apply to World Corporation

234
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,119
until you called him this morning.

235
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,747
Now, he says he's reconsidering it.

236
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,750
I'm sorry, but I already told him.

237
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,925
He's my candidate whom I contacted first.

238
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,512
I must make this project successful.

239
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,806
World Corporation's JD is strict,

240
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,726
so you know how long it takes
to find the right candidate.

241
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,561
Can't you just let this one go?

242
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,439
It might be easy for you
because you have connections,

243
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,650
but I spent many sleepless nights
on this case.

244
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,696
You think it's easy for me
because I have connections?

245
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,406
How can you say that?!

246
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,244
I had reasons of my own to call Mr. Park.

247
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,537
Let's be brutally honest.

248
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:56,416
If Mr. Park liked your proposal,
he would have refused mine.

249
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,877
Aren't you forcing
your suggestions on them

250
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,046
to increase your performance?

251
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,297
- Mr. Kim…
- What?!

252
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,424
What's all this fuss about?

253
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,269
Are you saying that both of you

254
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,897
will proceed your project
with this candidate?

255
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,148
Yes.

256
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,442
He's my candidate,
and I contacted him first.

257
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,403
I helped him change his job last time.

258
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,988
He wants to work with me again.

259
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,326
Does any of you think about the candidate?

260
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,079
Keep your personal feelings out of it.

261
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,747
Analyze this with your teammates,

262
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,833
and whoever is better
for the candidate's career

263
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,917
should be in charge.

264
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,315
- Mr. Kim.
- What happened?

265
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,859
Who will be in charge?

266
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,985
Kyung…

267
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:05,944
Kyung-hwa…

268
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,279
Kyung-hwa, are you crying?

269
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,446
Why is she crying?

270
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,532
Mr. Kim.

271
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,410
Why don't you yield to her this time?

272
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,871
Kyung-hwa worked really hard on it.

273
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,833
She's right.
Kyung-hwa always helps with your work.

274
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,334
She searches for your candidates.

275
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,003
Listen, Mr. Kim.

276
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,714
Just be the bigger man this time

277
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,841
and throw it away like this.

278
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,094
Candidates aren't objects
that you throw away.

279
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,849
{\an8}Where's the JD for World Corporation?

280
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,644
{\an8}It should be at Kyung-hwa's desk.

281
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,689
{\an8}DETAILED JOB DESCRIPTION
FOR AN OPEN POSITION

282
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,319
Since when did you know

283
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,614
that Kyung-hwa contacted Mr. Park?

284
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,825
Did everyone know except me?

285
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,285
So only I didn't know?

286
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,496
Just great.

287
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,833
Just absolutely great.

288
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,961
Mr. Kim, I can explain…

289
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,844
Mr. Yu?

290
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,107
It's really refreshing.

291
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,906
You didn't have to follow me.
I won't be long.

292
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,367
You must feel terrible.

293
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,245
It's not because I don't want to yield.

294
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,913
She didn't follow protocol.

295
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,748
If she had reported it to me,

296
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,250
I wouldn't have called Mr. Park.

297
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,086
I was the only one in the dark.

298
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,005
They all team up on me
and tell me to give it up.

299
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,215
Because Kyung-hwa worked hard.

300
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,342
What about me? Didn't I work hard?

301
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,010
Do I just sit around?

302
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,806
I'm well aware that Kyung-hwa worked hard.

303
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,516
I care about her, too.

304
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,601
Never mind.

305
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,687
It just makes me look cheap.

306
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,153
Why am I even telling you all this?

307
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,490
I can't stand it!

308
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,033
I'll go and tell them off.

309
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,455
Forget it.

310
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,334
It's my fault for being ignored.

311
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,129
Tell Kyung-hwa to take it.

312
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,133
Mr. Park would be better off
at World Corporation.

313
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,760
I'll explain it to him.

314
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,471
Thank you.

315
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,199
Kyung-hwa.

316
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,578
This is the special coffee
usually for our high-maintenance Ms. Kang.

317
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,079
Drink it while it's still warm.

318
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,081
Thank you.

319
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,961
Are you working late again?

320
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,340
I think I made a mistake.

321
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,051
Kyung-hwa.

322
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,513
Mr. Kim may not seem like it,

323
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,099
but he actually cares about you a lot.

324
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,560
Don't worry, and don't be discouraged.

325
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,023
Even if you work late, don't skip dinner.

326
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,149
I'll get going.

327
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,984
Remember the list of tasty restaurants.

328
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,906
I recommend Grandma's Gukbap.

329
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,367
Have a good evening.

330
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,933
What's going on with World Corporation?

331
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,436
Candidate Park Geun-ha has
his final interview to go.

332
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,980
World Corporation has been waiting
to fill this position,

333
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,191
so things are proceeding quickly.

334
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,109
And the candidate?

335
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,530
Right.

336
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,491
Thankfully, he's cooperating with us.

337
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:26,037
Mr. Kim, did you find another candidate
for the position you offered Mr. Park?

338
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,747
I'm still searching.

339
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,083
I'll find a list of candidates

340
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,877
that fit the JD by this week.

341
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,003
Good.

342
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,172
Try not to overlap this time.

343
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,258
The rest of you can help him
with his search.

344
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,551
- Yes, ma'am.
- Meeting's over.

345
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,390
Mr. Kim, do you need help with the search?

346
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,308
It's okay. I'm sure you're all busy.

347
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,103
Let's go and have lunch.

348
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,020
That sounds good.

349
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,772
Let's go, Kyung-hwa.

350
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,774
I have a lot of work,

351
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,651
so go ahead without me.

352
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,863
- Don't skip lunch, Kyung-hwa.
- Okay.

353
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,072
All right.

354
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,867
What shall we eat today?

355
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,881
Here are the minutes for today's meeting.

356
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,135
Will Team One be okay?

357
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,888
What? Is there a problem?

358
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,224
It still seems awkward
between Kyung-hwa and Mr. Kim.

359
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,101
What's wrong with that?

360
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,520
I feel awkward with all my employees.

361
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,772
Isn't that normal at work?

362
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,734
Do you feel awkward with me?

363
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,361
Of course.

364
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,699
Do you think that we're friends?

365
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,912
Right.

366
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,834
It's unfortunate.

367
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,512
What was that about?

368
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,941
I should bring the kids here later.
It's so delicious.

369
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,692
You're just super hungry.

370
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,277
You must've been nervous.

371
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,155
Meeting with editors
always gives me butterflies.

372
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,950
No matter how many I publish,
I can't get used to it.

373
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,912
By the way, Daddy Yu,
I signed contracts with two more books.

374
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,123
- Really?
- Yup. This will be on me.

375
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,334
You came all the way here. It'll be on me.

376
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,127
I also have to get something to go.

377
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,964
Moist salt bun.

378
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,050
Mocha salt bun only available here.

379
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,011
An egg tart.

380
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,181
And this one's for me.

381
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,108
- Is it the CEO's lunch?
- Yes.

382
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,944
Do you have to get her lunch too?

383
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,195
I don't have to,

384
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,489
but if I don't, she won't eat anything.

385
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,366
She likes bread from this bakery.

386
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,328
She had meetings outside this morning,
so she probably didn't eat anything.

387
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,456
Ms. Kang.

388
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,918
Sometimes, she needs more care than Byeol.

389
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,425
You must have
gotten the hang of things now.

390
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,718
You were a mess at first.

391
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,678
- Does it seem that way?
- Yes.

392
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,264
Is that so?

393
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,102
It's Ms. Kang.

394
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,022
She finished earlier than I thought.

395
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,899
Su-hyeon, I'd better go.

396
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,568
- See you.
- Okay, bye.

397
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,337
I didn't know his boss was a woman.

398
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,193
You probably didn't have lunch,
so here's some bread.

399
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,861
If you don't want...

400
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,824
For your thoughtfulness.

401
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,350
It's hot.

402
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,233
- Hello.
- Isn't it good?

403
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:06,901
Try some.

404
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,737
- Gosh, Mr. Yu.
- Ma'am.

405
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,907
- Thank you so much for last time.
- You're welcome.

406
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,158
I brought something for you.

407
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,744
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

408
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,996
You look amazing.

409
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,455
Work hard.

410
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,124
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

411
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,391
What are you looking at?

412
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,311
Mr. Kim and Kyung-hwa.

413
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:46,274
I was thinking about
how they could make up naturally.

414
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,402
Goodness.

415
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,988
I thought that it was something serious.

416
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,197
For something like this,

417
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,534
just grab a date, have a few drinks,
and things will smooth over.

418
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:01,205
They don't even eat together.
How would they grab a drink?

419
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,957
- They don't eat together?
- That's serious.

420
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,756
We can make an event
where they have to drink.

421
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,925
- A welcoming party.
- A welcoming party?

422
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,594
A welcoming party?

423
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,387
A welcoming party?

424
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,556
What welcoming party?

425
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,685
- A welcoming party for Mr. Yu.
- Yes, that's right.

426
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,480
My, my. I did not think of that.

427
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,984
We don't have company dinners
because of a certain someone.

428
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,736
Mr. Yu, I'm sorry for disappointing you.

429
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,197
I was disappointed.

430
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,159
We can't disappoint him!

431
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,954
Okay, let's hold a welcoming party.

432
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,707
Wouldn't that be nice, all around?

433
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,043
Listen, I'm the boss here.

434
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,544
I haven't given my permission yet.

435
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,881
- So you won't allow it?
- We won't hold a welcoming party?

436
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,008
There won't be any welcoming party?

437
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,805
Goodness.

438
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,974
It's up to you, but I won't be there.

439
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:02,892
Okay as long as I'm out.

440
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,519
But you have to be there…

441
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,229
Okay, I got it.

442
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,980
You can't cancel it, okay?

443
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,233
Thanks.

444
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,365
Thank you.

445
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,211
Lousy company dinner…

446
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,133
Thanks, Daddy Yu.

447
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,843
I'll call you later.

448
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:37,802
Bye.

449
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,195
{\an8}THE LATE PARK JAE-HOON
THE LATE JUNG SU-JIN

450
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,073
Su-jin, Jae-hoon, I'm here.

451
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,704
Mom still cries a lot.

452
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,916
Didn't Seo-jun grow up a lot?

453
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,170
He takes after you more and more.

454
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,963
It's unfair.

455
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,889
Don't be so sad
that you can't see Seo-jun.

456
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,725
When he gets a little older

457
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,227
and is able to understand everything,

458
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,563
I promise to bring him with me.

459
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,166
Does it still make you cry
when it's been so long?

460
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,588
Time doesn't heal

461
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,300
the loss of a child.

462
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,887
You just get more bitter.

463
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,313
Wait.

464
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,945
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- Hello.</i>

465
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,112
<i>- Hi.
- I won.</i>

466
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,949
<i>- I'll win next time.
- Yes, you won.</i>

467
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,368
Seo-jun is having a lot of fun.

468
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,869
Mom, look at this.

469
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,372
Look how big he's smiling.

470
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,165
<i>Let's see who does better.</i>

471
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,667
- Do you find him that adorable?
<i>- Rocks, paper, scissors, shoot!</i>

472
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,043
Don't you regret it?

473
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,337
Of course not. He's my son.

474
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,755
Why would I regret it?

475
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,216
I regret it.

476
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,469
I should have stopped you then.

477
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,930
You aren't even married.

478
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,141
There's no need to bring it up.
It's all in the past.

479
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,728
My daughter is more important
than my grandson.

480
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,775
Your happiness matters
more to me than Seo-jun's.

481
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,196
I am happy.

482
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,448
I got such a beautiful son for free.

483
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,617
Look, Mom.

484
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,369
Look.

485
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,247
<i>Mom, I won.</i>

486
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:17,503
Gosh, such a handsome boy.
Whose grandson is he?

487
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,213
Right?

488
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,424
Isn't he cute? He's your grandson.

489
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,261
Yes, he's very cute.

490
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,558
Did you like the food?

491
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,643
It was delicious.

492
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,063
She'd never say that it was bad.

493
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,566
You invited her home to serve her food.

494
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,526
Where are you going? We aren't done yet.

495
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,944
I'm going to take some of my stuff.

496
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,989
Why don't you move back in?

497
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,368
Don't say something so horrible.

498
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,080
Call me when he's done nagging.

499
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,001
I thought that he was grown up,

500
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,253
but he's far from it.

501
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,297
How is he doing these days?

502
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,133
He's doing better than you imagine.

503
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,428
You worked hard turning him into an adult.

504
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,306
See? Wasn't I right?

505
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,143
I picked you as soon as I saw you
at the mentor meeting.

506
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,355
Are you still sponsoring college students?

507
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,939
What's the point of earning money?

508
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,692
It's best to support those
who have potential.

509
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,903
I can't find any.

510
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,821
There's no one as good as you are.

511
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,865
It won't be easy to find.

512
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,454
How much longer do I have to
keep inviting you to come here?

513
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,957
Is Jeong-hoon not good enough for you yet?

514
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,796
Now that he's grown up,
you should move in together.

515
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,762
I got ahead of myself again.

516
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:50,679
Have your tea.

517
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,608
Did my father say something to you again?

518
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,111
You look a bit down.

519
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,238
Is he going to pull out his investment?

520
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,407
If he does, it would be his loss.

521
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,910
I knew it. That's Kang Ji-yun.

522
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,538
Don't push yourself too hard.

523
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,873
Don't worry. I'm strong.

524
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,543
Then why did you pass out
from overworking?

525
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,004
Seriously, be careful.

526
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,632
I'm just concerned.

527
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,260
I know. I won't overdo it.

528
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,471
Are you worrying about me?

529
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,974
Woo Jeong-hoon, you're all grown up.

530
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,144
When was the first time I saw you
at the society meeting?

531
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,022
Wasn't it before you even graduated
high school?

532
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,611
It would be problematic
if you still see me as a kid.

533
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,824
Look.

534
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,411
Don't I look more handsome up close?

535
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,539
Don't do this anywhere else.

536
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,879
Come on, what's the hold up?

537
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,673
Let's go, Mr. Woo.

538
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,676
Mr. Woo?

539
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,476
Hello.

540
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,770
Aren't you the CEO of Peoplez?

541
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,980
From the eighth floor.

542
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,356
Yes.

543
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,902
Mr. Yu brags about you a lot.

544
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,030
He says that you're very famous
and competent.

545
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,699
I thought that you were just pretty,

546
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:37,203
but you're also capable. I'm so jealous.

547
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,331
Here, this is for you.

548
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,374
Have a good day.

549
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,754
HEALTHY VEGETABLE JUICE

550
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,848
Come in.

551
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,853
It's your schedule this week.

552
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,691
Why do you have so much vegetable juice?

553
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,447
I heard that it's healthy.

554
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,035
Before my meeting with Mr. Jang,

555
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,496
- could you prepare...
- Excuse me for a moment.

556
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,837
Before your meeting with Mr. Jang,

557
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,883
I'm double-checking
the interview content with Mr. Kim.

558
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,302
Once it gets ready, I'll bring it to you.

559
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,597
You made a good choice.

560
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,308
Eat lots of that healthy stuff.

561
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,744
Are you going to Mr. Yu's
welcoming party tonight?

562
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,289
You think I dressed up for nothing?

563
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,501
The seat on Mr. Yu's right is
mine tonight.

564
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,299
I heard that many people
will be there at the party.

565
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,136
Unfortunately, people recognize
how handsome he is.

566
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,222
You'd better pull for me tonight.

567
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,725
Got it.

568
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,476
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

569
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,230
I can't wait.

570
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,698
Instead of working,
they spend energy on useless things.

571
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,500
Mr. Yu.

572
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,962
- Could you open this for me?
- Sure.

573
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,089
- Isn't it hard to open?
- Yes.

574
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,466
Here you go.

575
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,095
Ms. Kang, do you need anything?

576
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:01,930
No.

577
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,143
This is for you.

578
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,982
Come with us to the third round.

579
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:12,900
Okay.

580
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,735
- Thank you for the drink.
- That's a promise.

581
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,779
Well, isn't he excited?

582
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,552
Mr. Yu.

583
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,264
Mr. Yu!

584
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,437
What?

585
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,398
Did everyone leave already?

586
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,238
All right!

587
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,991
Check this out!

588
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,119
Attention, everyone!

589
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,912
Could you be quiet?

590
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,871
- Seriously.
- I'm sorry.

591
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,456
All the players are ready.

592
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,750
Players, you're ready to dive in.

593
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,876
Here they come.

594
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,086
- Dive!
- One, two, three.

595
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,129
Dive!

596
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,548
They're in!

597
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,759
Let's drink.

598
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,928
- Cheers.
- Thank you for the drink.

599
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,513
- Have a drink.
- Cheers.

600
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,098
- Have a drink.
- Kyung…

601
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,434
Here you go. Drink up.

602
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,935
Come on, have a drink.

603
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,980
That's mine. All right.

604
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,819
All right now!

605
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,070
Attention, everyone.

606
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,449
Today is Mr. Yu's welcoming party.

607
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,494
And to promote amity
among everyone at Peoplez,

608
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,372
we're holding this special party.

609
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,625
Don't even think about going home alive.

610
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,793
I'm unzipping it.

611
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,296
She's really prepping herself!

612
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,214
Is everyone ready to drink?

613
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,924
- Yes!
- Yes!

614
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,928
Ms. Seo, you're determined
to drink tonight.

615
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:06,889
Everyone.

616
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:10,058
As I'm occupied with work
and private life,

617
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,604
I won't be able to drink
with you until the end.

618
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,481
- Boo.
- Come on.

619
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:19,109
However, as I recognize
the virtue of being a boss,

620
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,654
I will treat you here tonight!

621
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,079
Praise be!

622
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,372
- Bon appétit.
- I will.

623
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,916
Thank you!

624
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,841
We'll order everything on the menu.
Feel free!

625
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,927
- Kyung-hwa, shall we?
- Cheers.

626
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,554
All right, Ms. Seo.

627
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,473
- Come on.
- Goodness.

628
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,312
- All right. Tonight,
- This is really good.

629
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:59,858
It's my treat, especially
because of Mr. Yu who's busy these days.

630
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,277
So Mr. Yu, please get intoxicated.

631
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,405
Let's hear a word from Mr. Yu.

632
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,243
- Good luck.
- You can do it.

633
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,661
Well,

634
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,123
thank you very much for coming
to my welcoming party.

635
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,460
Everyone at Peoplez have been kind to me,

636
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,296
especially Mr. Kim Young-soo.

637
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,425
He has been so kind to me.
Could I ask you to make a toast?

638
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,593
- No, no…
- Thank you!

639
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,512
A toast? No way.

640
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,888
Just do it.

641
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,390
- It's okay.
- Come on!

642
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,351
- When it comes to this, you're the best.
- You gotta do it.

643
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,269
I'm the best?

644
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,771
You should've told me.
If so, I should do it.

645
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,815
I didn't know I was the best.

646
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,442
I don't have anything
to say in particular.

647
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,527
Okay.

648
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,737
Octopus. Let's go with "octopus."

649
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,532
- "Oc."
- <i>Occasions</i> like today…

650
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,867
- "To."
- <i>Totally </i>requires me to…

651
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,203
- "Pus."
- <i>Push</i> your buttons!

652
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,039
Octopus!

653
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,459
Ha!

654
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,670
"Ha?"

655
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,922
Ha! That's funny.

656
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,716
- Did you just laugh?
- Hilarious. Cheers!

657
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,050
- That's it! Cheers!
- Cheers!

658
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,510
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

659
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,268
- Octopus, right?
- I've noticed it for a long time.

660
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:20,856
Your sense of humor isn't
exactly classy, with all honesty.

661
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,816
- If that made you laugh.
- Wasn't it funny?

662
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,318
- Exactly what part?
- Octopus.

663
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,444
Oh, don't push it.

664
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,571
Right, don't Kyung-hwa and Mr. Kim

665
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,448
have a similar sense of humor?

666
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,949
That's right.

667
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,784
So you should make up already.

668
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,203
It's unbearable to be walking
on eggshells around you.

669
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,538
- He's right.
- Seriously.

670
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,373
We never made you walk on eggshells.

671
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,583
What's there to make up for?

672
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,085
These things can happen from time to time.

673
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,003
Don't you agree?

674
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,797
Yes, I agree.

675
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,841
Right.

676
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,718
Okay.

677
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,387
Shall we lighten up and have a drink?

678
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,431
- That sounds great.
- Good idea!

679
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,516
There's nothing wrong between us.

680
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,477
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim!

681
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,854
Moving on,
I'll make sure to report to you.

682
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,275
I'm the one who should apologize.

683
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,611
Let's get along.

684
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,488
That's octopus for ya!

685
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,323
- Let's octopush it!
- Octopus it is!

686
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,283
Octopus!

687
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,911
- Octopus!
- Octopus!

688
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,413
We're all octopus!

689
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,755
The boss does all the work.

690
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,300
Is this a social club or something?

691
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,427
They don't even work.

692
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,560
MESSAGES

693
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,530
<i>Are you still at work?</i>

694
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,531
<i>Don't skip dinner.</i>

695
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,450
<i>Call me if you need anything.</i>

696
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,787
<i>Just in case,
here's the address to the party.</i>

697
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,664
<i>Join us whenever you change your mind.</i>

698
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,041
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

699
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,654
Byeol, what did you eat?

700
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,573
You had pasta?

701
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,284
Was it good?

702
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,954
Hold on.

703
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,080
Mr. Woo, are you leaving?

704
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,915
Hey, Mr. Yu.

705
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,711
Yes, I have something important,
so I'm disappearing.

706
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,379
- Have a good evening.
- You too!

707
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,676
What Auntie made couldn't have been good.

708
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,555
It sounds like someone is talking
about me behind my back.

709
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,432
<i>Were you listening?</i>

710
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,771
Come on, my cooking has gotten better.

711
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,397
All right.

712
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,899
I'm sorry about tonight.

713
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,776
I'll take care of the kids this weekend.

714
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,153
It's fine. We're close enough for that.

715
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,988
You haven't had a company dinner
in forever. Enjoy yourself.

716
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,240
I won't be late. Thank you.

717
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,326
Okay, but don't drink too much.

718
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:20,994
Bye.

719
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,539
All right.

720
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,002
<i>We're close enough for that.</i>

721
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,553
Mom, are you hot?

722
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,472
What?

723
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,724
You're blushing.

724
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,144
Me? You're right.

725
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,938
It must be hot in the house.

726
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,101
Kids!

727
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,648
Mr. Yu.

728
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,234
Mr. Yu?

729
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,195
Mr. Yu Eun-ho.

730
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,623
Are you okay?

731
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,211
I'm sorry.

732
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,296
You came.

733
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,380
- Should I tell…
- What?

734
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,216
Isn't that Mr. Yu and Ms. Kang?

735
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,093
No way. Ms. Kang wouldn't be…

736
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,220
- It's them.
- Hey, Ji-yun!

737
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,223
My goodness.

738
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,809
Are you here to see me? Are you?

739
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,604
- Ms. Kang!
- I can't believe it.

740
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,607
I've been looking for you.
Here are your things.

741
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,483
We're going to the second round.

742
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,444
- Kang Ji-yun!
- Let's go.

743
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,613
We should go.

744
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,740
- Second round.
- We should all go.

745
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,336
Kang Ji-yun.

746
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,673
Ms. Kang.

747
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,432
What?

748
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:48,850
She's not here.

749
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,688
I thought she'd be here alone.

750
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,573
I just missed her.

751
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:12,082
<i>I don't love you</i>

752
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:18,964
<i>There's no other reason</i>

753
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,927
<i>- I don't want to say sorry
- Sorry!</i>

754
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,680
<i>- </i>-<i>I don't want to ask</i>
- <i>Ask!</i>

755
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,475
<i>- For forgiveness
- Forgiveness</i>

756
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,768
There was a reason why.

757
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,312
This is why I hate company dinners.

758
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:38,858
<i>That is all…</i>

759
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,194
Hey, Ms. Kang.

760
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,490
I can't believe that you actually came!

761
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,574
Good girl.

762
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,035
Since this is very rare…

763
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,745
- Everyone.
- Yes?

764
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,331
Line up if you want to drink
with Ms. Kang.

765
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,041
This is a rare chance.

766
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,751
- I'm up for it.
- Thank you so much.

767
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:57,877
Line up here.

768
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,087
- Take a seat.
- I feel honored.

769
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:04,092
Ms. Kang, I know I disappointed you.

770
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,593
- Apologize.
- I'll clink glasses.

771
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,095
Thank you.

772
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,346
Come on over.

773
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,764
This is your chance.

774
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,433
It's rare.

775
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,268
- I'll work harder.
- Please remember me.

776
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,228
- Ms. Kang!
- Thank you, Ms. Kang!

777
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,941
You should join us often.

778
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,317
Cheers.

779
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,277
Cheers.

780
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,194
Cheers.

781
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,916
It's not coming out.

782
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,461
Where is…

783
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,670
Cheers.

784
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:28,384
<i>Did he hurt your feelings?</i>

785
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,011
<i>To me…</i>

786
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,971
Candidates aren't the only problem.

787
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,473
You got it wrong.

788
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,184
When I recommend a promising candidate,

789
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,310
she says no.

790
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,479
When I recommend another good one,

791
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,688
she says no again.

792
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,942
She brings up all possible excuses
to reject them.

793
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,736
So I tried to find out.
You know what I found?

794
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,737
What?

795
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,489
The person in charge

796
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:53,701
didn't want any candidate
who's more educated than her.

797
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,037
I almost cursed.

798
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,747
Is she kidding me?

799
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,124
That's wrong.

800
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,251
Our Mr. Yu.

801
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,170
Take our kind and handsome Mr. Yu.

802
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,631
Things weren't like that at HR, right?

803
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,633
- Mr. Kim, that department is…
- Right?

804
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,176
- …completely different from ours.
- Mr. Yu.

805
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,344
We can't compare them.

806
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:15,056
<i>I like it when you smile</i>

807
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,477
Mr. Yu!

808
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,813
Yes?

809
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,481
Never mind. Just drink.

810
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,150
- Just drink.
- Don't mind him.

811
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,194
- Drink.
- We're talking about life.

812
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,613
- Jeez.
- I'm sorry.

813
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:35,869
<i>It's okay even if I'm alone!</i>

814
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,288
<i>As long as I can see you…</i>

815
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,706
Kyung-hwa, we should…

816
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,749
- Kyu.
- It's Kyung. Let's do it.

817
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:42,917
Let's do it.

818
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,919
- I love parties like this.
- Really?

819
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,629
- I don't spend anything.
- Oh, gosh.

820
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,089
- We're leaving.
- We're off.

821
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,340
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

822
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,842
- Bye.
- See you.

823
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,428
- Goodbye.
- Let's go to the third round.

824
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,638
Are you going to another bar?

825
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,639
The third round?

826
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,433
- Octopus. Octopus!
- Round three?

827
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,409
Stay here for a minute.

828
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,869
I'll take you home.

829
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,500
Mr. Driver, where are you?

830
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,170
Okay.

831
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,469
Thank you.

832
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,054
Get in.

833
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,056
Take her as far as you go. Thank you.

834
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,724
- What? No.
- Can you go in?

835
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:40,892
Where do you think...

836
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,810
Mr. Kim gave us money for another round.

837
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,355
- Goodbye.
- Kyung-hwa.

838
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,190
- Bye.
- Get home safe.

839
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,484
Mr. Kim looks a little sad, so be careful.

840
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,322
Goodbye.

841
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,615
Kyung-hwa.

842
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,658
Wait.

843
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,076
Yes, Mr. Kim?

844
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,330
You had it hard with Mr. Park, didn't you?

845
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:03,873
Me too.

846
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,500
He's a good man,

847
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,585
but he's very indecisive.

848
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,963
Last time, he couldn't make up his mind
until the last moment.

849
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,173
What is there to think about?

850
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,098
It wasn't because of you.

851
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,477
That's just how he is,

852
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,187
so don't worry about it.

853
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,607
I think

854
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,652
I was being greedy.

855
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,904
You should have…

856
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,657
No, that's enough.

857
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,034
He's your candidate.

858
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,537
Just make the project successful.

859
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,998
Be confident.

860
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,459
You're doing a good job.

861
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,211
See you tomorrow.

862
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,757
Get home safe, sir.

863
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:41,638
Everyone went to the third round,
but I didn't join them.

864
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,973
Hurry up. Okay.

865
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,558
See you.

866
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,145
Have you seen Ms. Kang?

867
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:51,814
Ji-yun?

868
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,067
Did she disappear?

869
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,112
Don't worry. She went to the office.

870
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,030
The office?

871
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,990
Going home instinctively.

872
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,034
I mean, going to work instinctively.

873
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,745
Whenever she gets drunk,
she goes to the office.

874
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,873
You'll find her alive tomorrow morning.

875
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:12,251
Don't worry and go home.

876
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,253
Hey, Kang-seok!

877
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,841
Hey, you're here too.

878
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,553
Why did you drink so much?

879
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,222
I didn't drink too much.

880
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,394
- Let's see.
- Hold me.

881
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,853
- Did something good happen?
- Yes.

882
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,271
I had fun today.

883
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,108
- Kang Ji-yun was here tonight.
- She was?

884
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:36,734
See you.

885
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,600
We did drink a lot.

886
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:27,845
Ms. Kang.

887
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:30,556
Ms. Kang?

888
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:33,559
Ms. Kang?

889
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,742
I should be taking her home.

890
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,220
Mr. Yu…

891
01:06:58,889 --> 01:06:59,807
You're handsome.

892
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,562
Yu Eun-ho.

893
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:04,830
{\an8}Was that a dream?

894
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,040
{\an8}Did it really happen?

895
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,958
{\an8}After the company party,
