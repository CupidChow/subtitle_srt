THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS,
COMPANIES, AND PLACES

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,964
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,846
Mr. Yu…

4
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,474
You're handsome.

5
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,187
Yu Eun-ho.

{\an8}EPISODE 5

7
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,793
Gosh, my head.

8
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,059
What? Was that a dream?

9
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,563
No way. Seriously?

10
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,317
No, it must be a dream.

11
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,160
Did you go back home in the morning?

12
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,162
Honestly,

13
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,040
why do you crawl back
to the office after drinking?

14
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,293
Now that we're old,
sleeping on the couch hurts the back.

15
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,212
Your back doesn't deserve
to suffer like that.

16
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,425
Mi-ae, did everyone get home
safely last night?

17
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,720
Yes, I sent everyone home.

18
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,722
- Including Mr. Yu?
- Yes.

19
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,098
He was looking for you,

20
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,144
so I told him not to worry and go home
since you'll be in the office.

21
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,897
Why?

22
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,398
Nothing.

23
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,984
Give me five minutes.

24
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,865
Was it really a dream?

25
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,991
What did you say?

26
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,076
It's nothing.

27
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,369
Goodness.

28
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
KANG JI-YUN

29
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,416
You have the international
recruitment association seminar at 12 p.m.

30
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,711
You have the final interview
with <i>The Economy Herald</i> at 3 p.m.

31
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,338
Mr. Yu?

32
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,220
After the company party yesterday,

33
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,013
you didn't return

34
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,599
to the office?

35
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,855
No.

36
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,565
I didn't return here.

37
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,734
All right.

38
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,486
You may go.

39
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,283
I'll bring the documents
for the interview.

40
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,996
Hello, sir.

41
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,665
Okay.

42
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,588
It disappeared.

43
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,841
Pardon?

44
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,259
Oh, it's nothing.

45
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,931
Yes, I just finished the meeting.

46
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,307
Yes.

47
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,623
Yuseon Apparel is looking for a director
to lead their international sales.

48
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,085
Before entering the international market,
they plan to consolidate their teams

49
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,254
to establish a global business department.

50
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,466
I'm making a list of candidates
in high positions who made

51
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,886
significant results globally
during the last five years.

52
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,388
Gosh.

53
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,196
A bug.

54
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,031
Is there a bug?

55
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,491
There's a bug?

56
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,170
Yes, sir?

57
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,547
Yes, I'm aware of it.

58
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,808
Isn't his nose just a work of art?

59
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,602
Right.

60
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,940
Do you like this idol group too?

61
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,276
You agreed it was a work of art…

62
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,905
Yeah, what a piece of art.

63
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,910
That's surprising.

64
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,791
You don't need to join me.

65
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,834
I'm getting off work
directly from the meeting.

66
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,835
I'll take you there.

67
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,713
I'm going there alone, okay? Alone.

68
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,509
Ms. Kang?

69
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,555
Careful, you might fall.

70
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,103
You asked for these documents.

00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,617

00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,622
<i>If not, we usually forget about them.</i>

78
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,957
Hi, old lady.

79
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,418
Kiddo, you come here often.

80
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,003
I'm not a kiddo.

81
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,546
I'm not an old lady either.

82
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,506
What are you reading today?

83
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,968
It's about a new ice cream shop
in the snowman village.

84
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,887
There's a lot of delicious ice cream.

85
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,972
You must like ice cream.

86
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,056
Which is your favorite?

87
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,183
- Mint chocolate.
- You have good taste.

88
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,852
Do you like mint chocolate too?

89
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,145
Yes.

90
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,481
I'm not interested in food,
but I like mint chocolate milk.

91
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,318
Have you tried mint chocolate candy?

92
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,111
How about mint chocolate cookies?

93
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,237
Oh, right.

94
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,324
There's new mint chocolate bread.
Have you tried it?

95
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,575
Are there that many types?

96
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,243
So you haven't tried it?

97
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,495
They sell it at the supermarket.
Want to go with me?

98
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,040
Are you allowed to go?

99
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,626
By the way, where's your mom?

100
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,379
Uncle, can I go to the supermarket
with this lady?

101
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,964
What?

102
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,216
Sure, do you want to?

103
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,230
THREE-WAY SUPERMARKET

104
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,191
What do you think? Isn't it tasty?

105
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,985
It's good.

106
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,070
Help yourself.

107
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,700
You shouldn't ask just anyone
to come with you.

108
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,243
It's not just anyone.

109
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,245
I don't ask just anyone to come with me.

110
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,372
Then?

111
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,998
It's because I like you, sis.

112
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,376
You like me?

113
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,503
You just called me "sis."

114
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,296
Why? You don't like it?

115
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,715
What's your name?

116
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,550
I'm Byeol, seven years old.

117
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,095
Byeol, you're only seven,

118
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,639
but you have a good eye for people.

119
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,224
You can call me "sis."

120
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,568
Did you know that Byeol
and Ms. Kang got close to each other?

121
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,153
Byeol?

122
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,697
- Eun-ho's daughter?
- Yes.

123
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,991
They even went
to the supermarket together.

124
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,368
By the way,

125
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:46,038
it felt strange to see them together.

126
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,498
Goodness.

127
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,335
There's nothing strange about it.

128
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,463
What are you trying to imagine?

129
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:59,051
They get along as coworkers.
Don't try to tie them together.

130
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,595
I just thought…

131
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,722
You never know.

132
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,891
Aren't you going to work?
I want to go home.

133
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,353
Can't we even talk about it?

134
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,569
Ji-yun's too good for him.

135
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:27,997
Kwang-hee.

136
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,082
Kwang-hee.

137
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,210
Kwang-hee.

138
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,754
Goodness, you startled me.

139
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,214
You really did.

140
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,674
Nice going.

141
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,717
Take a look around.

142
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,177
Everyone else is working hard.

143
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,595
You're the only one dozing off.

144
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,971
I only slept three hours last night.

145
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,848
I had to wait in line early
to make a purchase this morning.

146
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,683
Did you sleep well?

147
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,852
Kwang-hee, when I was your age,

148
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,480
I saved every penny to buy a house.

149
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,608
What on earth is this?

150
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,776
Obsessing over dressing up
with luxury brands...

151
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,196
I dress up using the money I earn.

152
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,909
Oh, my.

153
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,119
That briefcase is really hard to get.

154
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,624
Who is that with a discerning eye?

155
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,209
Nice to meet you.

156
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,294
Oh, that person…

157
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,587
Who is he?

158
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,506
Come on, Mr. Kim.

159
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,634
He's the CEO of an online luxury brand
platform that's hot these days.

160
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,135
CEO Jin Sung-ho of Deluxe Line.

161
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,347
Oh, a luxury brand platform?

162
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,556
What is that anyway?

163
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,018
You can buy and sell luxury brands online.
You know that, right?

164
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,604
Of course, I do. A luxury brand platform.

165
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,484
So, what position does he need?

166
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,694
You're looking for
a luxury brand appraiser?

167
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,656
There's more demand
as the market increased,

168
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,575
but there are
only a few certified experts.

169
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,912
When I find someone competent,
a competitor snatches him away.

170
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,249
When I find someone certified, he
has one or two years of work experience.

171
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,751
It's almost impossible
to find an appraiser.

172
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,171
It's not surprising
that appraisers are rare.

173
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,008
The appraisal skills determine
the platform's credibility.

174
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,303
As we handle highly priced products,
when you make one mistake,

175
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,763
your credibility plummets.

176
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,848
That's why

177
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,727
I need an appraiser in charge
who can represent my platform.

178
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,854
Someone who trains appraisers.

179
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,649
An expert who evaluates
the final appraisal.

180
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,402
It's all about competence.

181
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,697
Competence is all I'm looking for.

182
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,283
We're the only headhunter, and they're
willing to negotiate the income.

183
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,870
As long as we find a good candidate,
they're willing to adjust the conditions.

184
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,582
Isn't the company size too small for us?

185
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,833
Is this really necessary?

186
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,835
They're preparing
an in-house examination center.

187
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,589
If we're successful, we'll be in charge
of hiring employees at the center.

188
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,050
Then it isn't a bad deal.

189
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,719
In that case…

190
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,930
He would be happy to take it.

191
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,223
Right?

192
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,391
He's an expert in that field.

193
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,479
What's going on?

194
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,522
Am I the only one out of the loop?

195
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,607
Who?

196
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,733
Who's going to take it?

197
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,320
Who is it?

198
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,822
Kwang-hee.

199
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,116
- Me?
- Yes.

200
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,952
Consultant Kim Kwang-hee from Team Two?

201
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,204
Consultant Lee Kwang-hee from Team One.

202
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,999
Yes, Lee Kwang-hee.

203
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,500
Excuse me.

204
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,627
What is it, Ms. Seo?

205
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,962
What is it?

206
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,303
NURI DREAM PUBLISHING COMPANY

207
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,431
Mr. Woo, I'll be counting on you.

208
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,060
Please work hard on it.

209
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:41,357
I'm still not sure about hiring someone
during this recession.

210
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,152
Instead of reducing the supply
during hard times, you should increase it.

211
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,988
When you supply books of good quality,
the demand will increase.

212
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,199
That's why even when I couldn't get paid,

213
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,826
I didn't stop publishing books.

214
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,788
That title sounds interesting.

215
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,790
<i>Rainbow Bingsu</i>?

216
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,793
Gosh, that's another amazing book,

217
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,962
but books like this don't sell.

218
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,673
The writer is such a nice person.

219
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,134
My editor tries really hard,
but the first edition hasn't sold out yet.

220
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,597
The writer looks so discouraged.

221
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,643
Yes, thank you for your concern.

222
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,395
Take care.

223
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,562
Thank you.

224
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,358
Ms. Jung, stay strong.

225
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,778
- Let's make your new book successful.
- Okay.

226
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,030
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

227
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,282
Ms. Jung, I wish you luck too.

228
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,581
JUNG SU-HYEON

229
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,168
Mr. Woo, do you know our writer, Ms. Jung?

230
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,380
Weren't you the one
who called me Father last time?

231
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,798
Right?

232
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,259
Hello.

233
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,846
What a small world.

234
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,226
So you're a writer.

235
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,146
As you're full of imagination,

236
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,522
you thought I was a dad.

237
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,066
I apologize.

238
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,028
- How do you write picture books?
- Oh my.

239
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,654
Pardon?

240
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,574
Do you get ideas easily
like surging water?

241
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,451
Do you get inspired?

242
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,661
- I dig a hole.
- What?

243
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,623
I concentrate hard for hours
tugging at my hair

244
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,583
to come up with ideas.

245
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,088
The pain of creation.

246
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,092
You can still write a few more books.

247
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,927
You still have lots of hair.

248
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,141
Can I get your autograph?

249
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,144
I like to make investments early.

250
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,022
I'll make use of it
when your book becomes a bestseller.

251
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,903
What's your name?

252
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,738
It's Woo Jeong-hoon.

253
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,032
Woo Jeong-hoon…

254
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,413
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

255
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,709
- Goodbye, then.
- Bye.

256
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,296
Ms. Jung!

257
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,091
The pain of creation, you can do it!

258
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,303
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

259
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,650
<i>Invest wisely.</i>

260
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,365
Where are we on the luxury brand
appraiser candidates?

261
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,158
{\an8}I made a long list

262
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,035
{\an8}and shared it with the HR at Deluxe Line.

263
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,996
{\an8}Currently, we have a total
of three candidates.

264
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,459
An employee at the customs
who only picks out the counterfeit.

265
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,585
<i>The logo is a bit off.</i>

266
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,963
The stitches are defective.
This part is wrong.

267
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,047
The label is defective.

268
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,591
Recently starred on <i>Genuine or Fake</i>,

269
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,677
a rising star appraiser who distinguished

270
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,346
the genuine article five times in a row.

271
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,140
I can distinguish between
the genuine and the counterfeit.

272
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,645
A duty-free shop manager of 20 years
at a top 10 luxury brand shop.

273
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,316
Okay, not too bad.

274
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,027
Proceed the meeting quickly
so the competitors don't hire them.

275
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,405
I will start by meeting the candidate

276
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,574
whom the client wants the most, Ms. Kang.

277
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,995
Min-seok.

278
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,581
- Hello.
- Hello.

279
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,374
Oh, here you go.

280
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,001
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

281
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,006
{\an8}ASSISTANT JUNIOR OFFICIAL
KANG MIN-SEOK

282
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,931
Hello, everyone! Ciao, hi, aloha.

283
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,270
What's going on here?

284
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,606
This feels like déjà vu.

285
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,570
What's with the vibe?

286
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,155
Why is it so down this morning…

287
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,200
What?

288
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,243
Even my lines are the same.

289
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,793
Kyung-hwa, what's wrong?

290
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,920
What's going on today?

291
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,840
The number one candidate
whom Deluxe Line wanted.

292
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,010
Today is his first day
at one of the competitors.

293
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,303
Whose work was it?

294
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,515
Career Way.

295
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,517
CEO Kim Hye-jin?

296
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,604
Mr. Kang Min-seok started work today
at Luxury Seller.

297
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,482
You seem used to the work already.

298
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,359
This is all thanks to you.

299
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,154
Please let me handle everything
related to Peoplez.

300
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,366
After all, I owe them.

301
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,077
I don't work with underqualified people.

302
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,913
I won't be seeing you again.

303
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,707
Not here, nor any other search firms.

304
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,926
I need you to explain
why we lost our candidate

305
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,552
to Career Way.

306
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,680
Didn't we contact him first?

307
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,516
The candidate needed more time...

308
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,518
You weren't aware that he was
in contact with another?

309
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,397
If the candidate is indecisive,
shouldn't you know

310
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,773
if he doesn't like the offer

311
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,483
or he's comparing us
with other headhunters?

312
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,487
What about replacing candidates?

313
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,489
Well, I've contacted a few,

314
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,242
but I haven't found anyone
who fits the description.

315
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,827
I need to start searching again…

316
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,037
Have you been waiting
for the candidate to decide?

317
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,372
Without any plan B?

318
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,254
Kwang-hee has a meeting with
the business team at Deluxe Line today.

319
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,630
Before the meeting,

320
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,383
it'd be good if you update them
on what's going on.

321
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,766
Get me a meeting with CEO Jin.

322
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,143
Is this a joke?

323
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,354
You told me that I could count on you,

324
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,982
but the result is losing the candidate
to a competitor?

325
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,109
I apologize.

326
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,694
It is my fault.

327
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,696
During the remaining period,

328
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,073
we'll find a better candidate.

329
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,710
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang.

330
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,004
There's no need to be sorry.

331
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,882
Find a new candidate
within the time period.

332
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,676
The client won't be satisfied
with our second best.

333
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,889
Find a more qualified candidate
than before and prove your skills.

334
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,308
What if I can't prove my skills…

335
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,978
When you lost the candidate
that the client wanted,

336
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,438
didn't you brace yourself?

337
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,106
Didn't you?

338
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,608
Yes.

339
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,906
I'll get fired if I can't find anyone.

340
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,410
Mr. Yu, please follow up on this project.

341
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,749
Eun-ho…

342
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,639
Hello, this is the search firm Peoplez.

343
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,057
Hello, sir.

344
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,518
About the designer you wanted to
recommend last time…

345
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,728
I'm calling you about your CV.

346
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,438
You work in street brands now?

347
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,233
Did you work in quality control at Pigaro?

348
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,944
Are you certified as an appraiser?

349
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,196
Yes!

350
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,698
How long have you been certified?

351
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,118
A year and a half?

352
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,539
I'll contact you again later.

353
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,165
Okay.

354
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,295
I called them all.

355
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,593
Mr. Kim, aren't you hungry?

356
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,264
- Shall I go and buy some bread?
- Bread sounds good.

357
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,224
Kwang-hee.

358
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,476
Would you like to come?

359
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,191
What if I get fired like this?

360
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,276
I have no solution.

361
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,945
I think the order is wrong.

362
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,364
There's time to worry later
after finding a candidate.

363
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,742
You aren't saying that I won't get fired.

364
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,121
Gosh, I'm choking up on bread.

365
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,711
Anyway, just where am I supposed to
find a candidate?

366
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,797
I looked through all my lists,
but I can't find the right one.

367
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,923
There isn't any.

368
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,843
DAEGIL MOTORS

369
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,640
They probably know everything about cars.

370
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,558
What?

371
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,937
It's needless to say
because they're experts.

372
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,524
Competent mechanics recognize problems
just by listening to the sound of the car.

373
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,444
They even distinguish models
by the engine sounds alone.

374
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,115
That would be the case for masters.

375
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,783
They've worked on so many cars.

376
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,287
Why do you keep changing the subject?

377
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,664
We're talking about
luxury brand appraisers…

378
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,418
When you've worked on
many luxury brand products…

379
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,794
I got goose bumps.

380
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,839
They would know instinctively.

381
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,049
What's real and what's fake.

382
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,138
I should make a new list
of candidates with expert repairers.

383
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,390
Let's start the search
with luxury brand repairers.

384
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,809
They must know repairing experts.

385
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,939
Online luxury brand communities.

386
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,942
There will be information
on hidden experts on social media.

387
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:31,029
Are you going to approach
luxury brand repairers?

388
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,658
The candidates on the existing database

389
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,160
have already been exposed to our clients.

390
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,996
They won't be good enough,
so I came up with this idea.

391
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,748
I can change it, if you'd like.

392
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,628
A luxury brand repair expert?

393
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,174
That's a good direction.

394
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,512
The veteran whom CEO Jin is looking for

395
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,097
could be hiding among them.

396
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,182
Good luck on your search.

397
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,433
Yes, Ms. Kang.

398
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,395
I'll make sure to find a good candidate.

399
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,438
You may go.

400
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,874
- Well done.
- You worked hard.

401
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,086
- Good job today.
- Thank you for your work.

402
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,421
Good work, all.

403
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,800
Eun-ho.

404
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,427
Thanks.

405
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,637
I'll go over it
before handing it to Ms. Kang.

406
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,222
- Head home.
- Thank you, Eun-ho.

407
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,557
Go ahead.

408
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,645
Good work.

409
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,352
Why is this here?

410
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,526
<i>Ms. Kang.</i>

411
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,652
<i>Ms. Kang?</i>

412
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,280
<i>Mr. Yu…</i>

413
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,979
It wasn't a dream.

414
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,374
Ms. Kang, if you're working longer,
shall I order food…

415
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,752
Ms. Kang?

416
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,641
There you are.

417
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,521
Are you okay? It's still chilly at night.

418
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,318
That day,

419
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,904
you returned to the office, didn't you?

420
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,619
This.

421
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,539
It was on the floor of my office.

422
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,755
On the day of our company party,

423
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,176
weren't you with me

424
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,428
in the office?

425
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,932
Yes.

426
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,146
Why did you pretend not to remember?

427
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,074
How much do you remember?

428
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,954
How much do you want me to remember?

429
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,964
Let's say that it didn't happen.

430
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,008
Just like now.

431
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,013
Okay.

432
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,725
Then I will remember it just like now.

433
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,239
Dad.

434
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,017
<i>How much do you want me to remember?</i>

435
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,771
Let's say that it didn't happen.

436
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,523
Just like now.

437
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,367
<i>How much do you remember?</i>

438
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,703
How much do you want me to remember?

439
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,873
Let's say that it didn't happen.

440
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,750
Just like now.

441
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,003
Okay.

442
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,632
Then I will remember it just like now.

443
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,804
DO YOU LIKE BRAHMS?

444
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,570
Eun-ho, over here.

445
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,238
A tasty twisted doughnut place.

446
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,990
Can I get another twisted doughnut?

447
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,450
- Did you find it?
- Yes.

448
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,538
I saw the Garim Repairing employees
go in with things to repair.

449
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,210
In the luxury brand repairing industry,
Garim Repairing is considered the best.

450
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:47,131
The master that the owner of Garim
Repairing kept as a secret. Exactly.

451
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,467
They're in this market.

452
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,554
Good job. So, where is this person?

453
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:55,932
About that,

454
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,226
I need to look for them now.

455
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,936
Me and you.

456
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,815
We have to look everywhere here.

457
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:06,901
The market looks

458
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,611
nice but big.

459
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,491
Has it always been this big?

460
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,914
Thank you.

461
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,083
Thank you.

462
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,087
I'm not sure.

463
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,047
Okay, thank you.

464
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,221
I haven't seen this
since I opened my shop.

465
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,098
- You haven't seen it?
- No.

466
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,142
I see. Have a good day.

467
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,938
- I don't know about that.
- Okay.

468
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,064
- How about this?
- Thank you.

469
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,983
It looks great on you.
How about a gift for your mother?

470
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,151
- Thank you.
- It's quite nice.

471
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,749
The market is big, but they're not here.

472
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,585
Thank you for everything.

473
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,837
I think that I'm done here.

474
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,715
- Yes?
- Can I get some tteokbokki and fish cakes?

475
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,926
Are you replacing your meal
with snacks again?

476
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,596
You should eat a proper meal.

477
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,891
Many people need my help again today.

478
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,060
One moment.

479
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,812
- Here you go.
- Okay.

480
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,565
- Good luck with business.
- See you.

481
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,400
I think I missed one.

482
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,278
This is called Good Lifestyle...

483
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,446
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

484
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,239
What kind of work does she do?

485
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,909
She repairs bags.

486
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,496
Let's see.

487
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,039
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

488
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,916
- Goodness.
- Have a good day.

489
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,460
Wait, you gave me too much.

490
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,761
She was here.

491
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,472
She was definitely here.

492
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,682
Eun-ho.

493
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,728
This alley wasn't on the map.

494
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,896
You're right.

495
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,983
Eun-ho, say something.

496
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,487
You need to direct me so that I can…

497
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,525
REPAIR REQUEST

498
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,951
Didn't we find the right place?

499
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,620
Yes.

500
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,628
Unbelievable.

501
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,172
You startled me.

502
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,173
When did you get in?

503
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,757
Are you here for a repair?

504
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,177
Hello.

505
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,637
How did you do this?
It became a new wallet.

506
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,808
My client left it with me with trust.

507
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,518
I should keep it clean.

508
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,104
The backstitches aren't consistent.

509
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,858
It must be precious to him
because he gets it repaired.

510
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,485
How do you know that?

511
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,363
It's what I do all day long.
It'd be strange if I didn't know.

512
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,365
Each brand and product has

513
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,492
its unique way of backstitching.

514
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,581
You know that it's different
for each brand and product.

515
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,381
{\an8}GARIM REPAIRING

516
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,636
Kwang-hee, that's…

517
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,598
I found it. This is it.

518
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:11,145
Ma'am, do you happen to
work with Garim Repairing?

519
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,271
Yes.

520
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,358
I also repair all of their items.

521
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,318
Ma'am, goodness!

522
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,695
- I'm sorry.
- Eun-ho, this is so…

523
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,156
- Your workplace is practically hidden.
- That's…

524
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,449
How could we find you?

525
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,368
Pearls are always found in the deep sea.

526
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,495
- That's loud.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

527
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,455
- Ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

528
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,958
- We're from Peoplez.
- That's right.

529
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,668
What?

530
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,045
<i>Ms. Cho Young-sook.</i>

531
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,381
<i>She learned how to repair
at the age of 17.</i>

532
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:42,343
<i>She's been doing it for 37 years.
She's an expert in luxury brand repair.</i>

533
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,722
<i>Including the material's color, thickness,
shape, and number of stitches,</i>

534
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,393
<i>she can make it exactly
like the real thing.</i>

535
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,479
<i>With years of experience
in repairing luxury brand goods,</i>

536
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,315
<i>she can distinguish counterfeits
instinctively at her fingertips.</i>

537
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,319
<i>In other words,
she has long, bona fide experience.</i>

538
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,471
Leyard Shoulder Bag, Kilin Mini Tote Bag,

539
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,015
and Haegas Belt.

540
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,772
Yes, Leyard.

541
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,482
Kilin. My goodness.

542
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,775
Gosh.

543
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,652
Haegas Belt.

544
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,655
Eun-ho, this is amazing.

545
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,948
You're exactly right.

546
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,116
You're a master.

547
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,498
A person like me at a company?

548
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,500
I only graduated from elementary school.

549
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,252
Your educational background
isn't important.

550
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,464
We're making this offer
based on your competence.

551
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,132
Thank you for the offer,

552
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,760
but Eun-ho, I don't feel comfortable.

553
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,720
You don't need to feel uncomfortable.

554
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,849
Think of it as continuing the same work
that you love doing.

555
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,854
I don't understand why.

556
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,898
There are many who are certified,

557
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,776
and there are many who studied a lot.

558
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,195
All I did was sew work.

559
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:28,741
All I did was sew, glue, and cut
every day.

560
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,576
At some point,

561
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:34,372
I naturally figured out
what's genuine and what's fake.

562
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:35,831
Your time spent.

563
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,793
You should be treated accordingly

564
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,295
for the time you spent
naturally gaining that knowledge.

565
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,634
Don't underestimate

566
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,511
the value of your time spent.

567
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,685
Your hands that have worked
for a long time.

568
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,145
They must find it unfair.

569
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,772
Ma'am,

570
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,774
your hands are very special.

571
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,697
It won't be late to refuse
after thinking about it.

572
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,534
We'll be waiting for your call.

573
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,100
KANG JI-YUN, PEOPLEZ

574
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,106
Dad, where's Ttosoon?

575
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,733
- And Gom?
- In the second drawer for toys.

576
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,031
Dad, what about my pajamas?

577
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,658
The nightstand next to your bed?

578
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,827
Not these.

579
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,287
My pajamas with teddy bears.

580
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,330
Those are too thin for now.

581
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,417
Aren't you taking this too?

582
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,546
Why do you look so happy?

583
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,465
Are you that excited to sleep
with your kindergarten friends?

584
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,716
You're making me sad.

585
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,301
Will you be able to sleep well without me?

586
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,635
Dad.

587
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,054
You should be independent now.

588
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,598
I can't be the love of your life.

589
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,310
Get yourself a girlfriend and go on dates.

590
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,352
It's TGIF.

591
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,939
TGIF? Where did you learn that?

592
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,109
Dad, I'm seven years old.

593
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,697
TG…

594
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,786
Be careful.

595
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,371
HANEUL KINDERGARTEN

596
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,789
How can they be so excited?

597
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,124
They're practically flying.

598
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,169
Jung Seo-jun woke up at six this morning.

599
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,296
- He did?
- Yes.

600
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,508
I feel betrayed by Seo-jun.

601
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,301
I know. I'm disappointed.

602
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,012
Children at Haneul Kindergarten.

603
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,390
Can you sleep
without your parents tonight?

604
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,600
- Yes!
- Yes!

605
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,769
Say goodbye to your mom and dad.

606
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,020
Go on.

607
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,567
- Eat.
- A lot of good food.

608
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,402
I love you, Byeol.

609
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,905
Mom, sleep with this if you get scared.

610
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,407
He'll protect you.

611
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,952
Thanks you, my son.

612
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,954
See you tomorrow, Dad.

613
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:20,913
Take care of Byeol.

614
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:21,997
- Okay.
- Bye.

615
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,791
Everyone, let's go inside.

616
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,668
- Okay.
- Okay.

617
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,794
Line up and go in.

618
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,129
Go inside.

619
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,008
HANEUL KINDERGARTEN

620
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,718
Moms and dads.

621
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,053
You're free tonight!

622
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,513
Enjoy yourselves!

623
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,021
- Ms. Seo.
- Hey.

624
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,148
Eun-ho.

625
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,443
I heard that you're free tonight
after a long time.

626
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,403
How did you know?

627
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,196
- Did Kang-seok tell you?
- Yes.

628
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,657
A Friday without kids.

629
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,994
Isn't this huge? It only happens
a few times in a year.

630
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,121
Do you have plans?

631
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,291
I do.

632
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,667
Gosh, what is it?

633
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,752
Getting documents ready
for Ms. Kang's lecture.

634
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,296
Her upcoming lecture is very...

635
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,006
What's wrong with you?

636
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,925
Have you become a workaholic like her
now that you work as her secretary?

637
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,846
What happened to our employees?

638
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,763
Ji-yun must be the problem.

639
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,099
I won't stand for this. Tonight,

640
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,892
all of you should come to my house.

641
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,104
So… Hey, Mr. Woo.

642
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,564
You have no plans tonight, right?

643
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,524
Even if you do, come to my house.

644
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,359
I'll treat the board of directors tonight.

645
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,444
All of a sudden?

646
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,404
Ms. Kang has been sensitive these days.

647
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,656
I meant to invite her over
and make her food.

648
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,450
Let's eat together.

649
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,162
But you're a bad cook.

650
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,039
I've never had braised ribs
like yours before.

651
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,166
You should change the name
to braised rocks.

652
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,043
There's delivery food.

653
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,963
I can order what you want to eat
and treat you well.

654
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,425
Then come to my house.

655
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,177
- I'll treat you.
- Really?

656
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,178
- Yes.
- Is that okay?

657
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,473
- Yes, please come.
- Then I'd be so grateful.

658
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,184
Eun-ho's cooking is amazing.

659
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,103
Last time, I went to his house

660
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,314
and fell in love with his cooking.

661
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,858
Can we really come?

662
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,026
Please come.

663
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,695
Okay, let's meet at Eun-ho's place.

664
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,406
Everyone is required to come.
You'll be there, right?

665
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:21,825
Well, I…

666
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,202
Is Ms. Kang going?

667
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,495
She'd never go
to the house of an employee.

668
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,955
But it's Eun-ho's. I'll persuade her.

669
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,249
What's so different about Mr. Yu's house?

670
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,212
Anyway, it's up to you.

671
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,172
Why is he being so fussy?

672
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,426
I sent you the address.
Come to Eun-ho's house by 7 p.m.

673
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,803
I'm not going.

674
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,179
Why not? Let's go.

675
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,931
We can have delicious food,

676
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,683
drink wine, and have fun.

677
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:46,975
We don't have time for that.

678
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,602
Besides, why would I go to Mr. Yu's house?

679
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,312
You still have to eat.

680
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,689
It's a board of directors meeting.

681
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,274
Why at that place?

682
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,943
Mi-ae, that's a nuisance.

683
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,946
Not going when invited is
more of a nuisance.

684
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,490
If you get that,
just come with a delicious cake.

685
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,369
No, I'm not going.

686
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,787
I made myself clear.

687
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,955
Don't wait for me.

688
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,375
That would be your loss.

689
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,794
I made myself clear
that his cooking is amazing.

690
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,130
She's as stubborn as a mule.

691
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,847
I'll call you back after checking
Ms. Kang's schedule.

692
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,056
Talk to you soon.

693
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,862
Make all the afternoon schedule
happen in one place.

694
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,823
Go and meet Ms. Cho with Kwang-hee.

695
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,782
Yes, ma'am.

696
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,660
The fact that she called us means
that she's considering it.

697
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,745
Please persuade her in person.

698
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,330
Understand what her concerns are.

699
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,707
If there are conditions she wants...

700
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,624
Ms. Kang.

701
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,835
Don't worry so much.

702
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,546
She'll be persuaded.

703
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,756
It's the right position for Ms. Cho.

704
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,263
It will come to a decision in a week,
whatever it may be.

705
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,265
You may get off work from there.

706
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,808
Okay.

707
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,644
Are you also coming tonight?

708
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,521
No, I'm not going.

709
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:15,981
Please come.

710
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,527
I'd like to make
a home-cooked meal for you.

711
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,284
I'll get going.

712
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:43,926
As you can see,

713
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:47,095
the demand continues to increase.

714
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,972
There will be more
during the second half of the year.

715
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,354
As you may already know,

716
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,898
headhunting is especially important
for product buyers.

717
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,776
We will consider what's important…

718
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,570
Please take a careful look

719
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,155
and let us know.

720
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,099
Please come.

721
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,768
I'd like to make
a home-cooked meal for you.

722
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,689
What's so special about food?

723
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,439
DEAR MR. DELIVERY MAN,
PLEASE HELP YOURSELF, THANK YOU

724
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,120
Sure…

725
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,374
it's just a group dinner.

726
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,558
Ms. Kang?

727
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,228
Sorry, I ran a bit late.

728
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,444
Is no one else here?

729
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,447
It got canceled because no one could come.

730
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,157
A notice was sent in the group chat…

731
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,329
You aren't in the group chat.

732
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,628
MI-AE

733
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,088
<i>Where are you? What's this?</i>

734
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,673
<i>Why didn't you come?</i>

735
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,632
<i>Because of you...</i>

736
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,800
Ms. Kang.

737
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,308
Yes?

738
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,980
Would you like to have dinner?

739
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,401
No, I only stopped by.

740
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,236
I happened to be in the neighborhood.

741
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,910
I also happened to find this on the way.

742
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,539
I mean, I was just in the neighborhood.

743
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,458
- And...
- Thank you.

744
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,254
I bought all the ingredients.
I was bummed out when it got canceled.

745
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,465
Do you like bean paste stew?

746
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,350
Are you uncomfortable?

747
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,563
No.

748
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,774
Just give me a moment.
I'll make it with care.

749
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:10,942
Do it carelessly.

750
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,695
Carelessly…

751
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,378
YELLOW PRINCESS

752
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,738
What the heck?

753
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,249
It turn off on its own
if you leave it alone.

754
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,130
There, it's off.

755
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,331
What is Byeol's dad doing tonight?

756
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,709
Call him instead of waiting.

757
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,755
I wasn't waiting for him.

758
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:59,551
You're free from kids tonight.
Go out to the movies.

759
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,970
What was that? Chimaek?
Have some fried chicken and beer.

760
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,432
I didn't know you knew things like that.

761
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,684
That's not all.

762
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:11,021
If you hesitate too long, you'll lose him.

763
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,940
What if he invites someone home

764
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,817
and cooks for her?

765
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,362
It's game over
once she tastes his bean paste stew.

766
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,409
Aren't you embarrassed to say that?

767
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,537
And how about that broad back of his
when he's cooking?

768
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,324
Here you go.

769
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,119
Try it.

770
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,745
I finally got to make you
a home-cooked meal.

771
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,665
That darn home-cooked meal.

772
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,085
What?

773
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,837
Did you put something in it?

774
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,840
Did you really make all of this?

775
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,093
I think I told you that I'm a good cook.

776
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,597
I think you're better as a cook.

777
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,849
Then make a reservation next time.

778
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,089
It's good to see you eat so well.

779
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:30,845
How pretty.

780
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,506
I admit that it was delicious.

781
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,926
Since when did you start cooking?

782
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,470
It's been 30 years.

783
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,723
This is my survival skill
I honed for 30 years.

784
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,561
I make one compliment
and you get ahead of yourself.

785
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,937
I know how old you are.

786
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,397
It's true.

787
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:27,360
Then have you been living alone
since you were in elementary school?

788
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,909
I grew up well, didn't I?

789
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,050
You did.

790
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,138
Well done.

791
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,027
You too, Ms. Kang.

792
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,832
What's this?

793
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,710
You did an excellent job.

794
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,302
A compliment should be done properly.

795
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,768
YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB

796
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,282
Excuse me, Ms. Kang. I have to take this.

797
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,827
I finished eating, so I'll get going.

798
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,412
You should stay for the cake.

799
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,872
Please wait a minute.

800
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,082
But…

801
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,963
Did you have fun?

802
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:13,925
Did you have dinner?

803
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,263
Are you sleeping in a tent?

804
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,974
Isn't it chilly at night?

805
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,688
Of course, I'm thinking a lot about you.

806
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,233
Dress warmly, okay?

807
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,971
How did you spend your day today?

808
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,639
<i>I did tons of stuff.</i>

809
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,601
We played Cowboys and Indians, soccer,

810
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,185
<i>and even a snack game.</i>

811
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,729
<i>Right, we also did treasure hunting.</i>

812
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,772
I found two pieces of treasure, Dad.

813
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,441
Byeol, that's impressive.

814
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,818
Your teacher prepared a lot.

815
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,069
Yes, it was really fun.

816
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,739
Is that why you didn't think
about me today?

817
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:20,199
To be honest, I didn't really.

818
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,784
Are you disappointed?

819
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:22,952
No.

820
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,622
I prefer that you have fun.

821
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,665
I'll think more about you.

822
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:28,875
Dad, I have to go.

823
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,585
Other kids have to call home too.

824
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,128
Good night, Dad.

825
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,297
You too. I love you.

826
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,423
<i>Bye.</i>

827
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,931
Ms. Kang, sorry for making you wait…

828
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,026
- What's going on?
- What?

829
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,069
What the heck?

830
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,862
What do you mean?

831
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,489
- The sun is up.
- What?

832
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,491
- What time is it?
- What time is it now?

833
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,703
What's going on here?
What am I doing here?

834
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,540
Dad, get yourself a girlfriend

835
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,916
<i>and go on dates.</i>

836
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,417
<i>It's TGIF.</i>

837
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,127
- You have to go now.
- Where?

838
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,629
- She's on her way.
- Who?

839
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,172
- My daughter!
- Your daughter.

840
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,882
What? Your daughter?

841
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,095
Goodness.

842
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,058
My bag!

843
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,393
Your bag? I'll get it.

844
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,645
- And my cell phone.
- Your cell phone?

845
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,066
What time is it?

846
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,694
Snap out of it.

847
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:29,907
The elevator.

848
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,002
Why did you sleep in?

849
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,378
You didn't set an alarm?

850
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,796
I did, but…

851
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:51,012
By the way, did we do anything?

852
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:51,929
Pardon?

853
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,681
We didn't even hold hands.

854
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,641
All we did was eat and sleep...

855
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:57,852
Is it good, Byeol?

856
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,567
Dad.

857
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,612
Byeol.

858
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:34,931
No.

859
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,062
Stop it.

860
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,403
Don't go.

861
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,034
No.

862
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,210
Don't go.

863
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,236
It's all right.

864
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,704
It's okay.

865
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,360
{\an8}<i>Let me ask you one thing.</i>

866
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,279
{\an8}<i>- Why did you kick me out?</i>
- Why did you run away?

867
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,572
{\an8}- Exactly.
- Exactly.

868
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,199
{\an8}<i>Are you saying that
we've been selling counterfeits?</i>

869
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,993
{\an8}<i>What happens if her appraisal is wrong?</i>

870
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,453
{\an8}Who would even believe me?

871
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,288
{\an8}Everyone says that I'm wrong.

872
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:05,956
{\an8}<i>The kiddo who comes often
to the book store.</i>

873
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,957
{\an8}<i>Is that Mr. Yu's daughter?</i>

874
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,417
{\an8}- Kitty!
- Byeol!

875
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,294
{\an8}<i>Eun-ho, did something happen to Byeol?</i>

876
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:13,005
{\an8}<i>- Are you okay?
- Actually, I'm not sure.</i>

877
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,924
{\an8}You're doing well now.

878
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,425
{\an8}<i>I'm sure that Byeol knows.</i>

879
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,135
{\an8}<i>That her dad is making an effort.</i>
