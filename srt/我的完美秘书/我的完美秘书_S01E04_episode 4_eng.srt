00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,380
    
 ♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,340
♫  I don't know why I'm being like this  ♫

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,270
    
 ♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,080
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,630
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

♫  Though it might be sudden  ♫

7

♫  So just test me, I'll tell you  ♫

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,960
♫  My sincere feelings for you  ♫

10

♫  Yes, whenever it is, just tell me  ♫

11

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,660
   

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,050
   

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:56,950


16
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,700
Wait a moment.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,190
Stay here. I'll get the car.

18
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,040
Mint chocolate...

19
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,060
Is that spicy?

20
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,270
- It's not that spicy. 
 - Really?

21
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,600
It's hot.

22
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,770
- What are they eating? 
 - Wow.

23
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,450
This is the spicy seasoning.

24
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,320
 There you go. 

25
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,050
 I think you chose the wrong career. 

26
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,520
 You're so serious about food. 

27
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,030
Good food is comforting.

28
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,650
If your tummy fills, your heart can fill.

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,130
 Try it. 

30
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,700
It's a little spicy.

31
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,100
All done?

32
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,550
Yes.

33
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,070
I'll get the car.

34
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,490
Good morning.

35
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,360
What's my schedule today?

36
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
   

37
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,090
Lunch at noon at the Global Talent Forum.

38
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,120
A 2 p.m. meeting with Director Park at Kangwoo Chemistry,

39
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,550
4 p.m. interview with Business Magazine.

40
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,820
What is this? 
    

41
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,250
It's info for Headhunters' Association's annual general meeting.

42
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,080
See if you'd like to attend. I'll schedule around it.

43
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,010
I don't go to such things.

44
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,320
   

45
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,300
"Headhunter Academy"? 
    

46
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,430
The committee head creates an academy named after CEO Lee Yong Hun.

47
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,630
Who?

48
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,730
CEO Lee Yong Hun.

49
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,580
   

50
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,480
One, two!

51
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,250
As I said, it's a special profile on female CEOs.

52
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,520
We devote about 20 pages to

53
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,360
interviews and photographs of seven people, including CEO Kang.

54
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,370
 Hello! 

55
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,460
Oh, CEO Kim!

56
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,690
- Hello. 
 - You're early.

57
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,600
We're not done with the current shoot yet.

58
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,990
I give myself extra time. Don't mind me.

59
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,080
Got it.

60
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,790
CEO Kang's photos are being taken.

61
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,230
This is nice.

62
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,640
Make sure CEO Kang looks good.

63
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,010
She's our industry's focus on women.

64
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,350
Isn't she your competition?

65
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,120
Only you two have the same industry in the article.

66
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,410
It's better for me.

67
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,520
If number two is so great, how great is the one ahead of her?

68
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,820
Isn't that what people will think?

69
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,720
CEO Kim, I can't keep up with you.

70
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,450
I'd like to participate in the academy.

71
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,530
Why all of a sudden?

72
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,540
Do you still need to use CEO Lee's name?

73
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,700
If you don't want to see me act up,

74
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,900
remove his name, and I'll go away.

75
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,130
How dare you pretend to care about him now?

76
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,830
You're the one who killed him.

77
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,470
Do you really think that?

78
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,470
Sunbae, do you really...

79
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,000
think I know nothing?

80
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,670
Stop tarnishing CEO Lee's name,

81
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,450
if you're human with a conscience.

82
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,460
Let's go, Secretary Yu.

83
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,810
CEO Kang.

84
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,710
Mr. Secretary, what's CEO Kang's schedule this weekend?

85
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,570
CEO Lee's daughter just started middle school.

86
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,360
We're having dinner together.

87
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,650
You should join.

88
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,070
His wife wonders how you're doing.

89
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,040
Relax.

90
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,300
It shows you killed Sunbae.

91
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,570
It's written on your face.

92
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,690
Please check her schedule and let me know.

93
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,550
Let's proceed.

94
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,220
Let's go.

95
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,550
Should we go to the tteokbokki place?

96
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,110
No, thanks. You can't eat it.

97
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,620
Then let's go for a walk.

98
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,010
 I might not... 

99
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,880
 I might not eat spicy things, but I can walk. 

100
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,940
- Why did you ask me to walk? 
 - Pardon?

101
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,110
I didn't realize we'd walk in silence for 30 minutes.

102
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Would you like to jog instead?

103
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,820
I can't tell if you're ignorant of it or not.

104
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,030
Why aren't you asking anything?

105
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,970
I'm sure you're curious.

106
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,230
I don't need to probe.

107
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,810
Sometimes, just asking can be hurtful.

108
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,910
You don't need to explain anything.

109
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,880
I trust only what I see.

110
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,950
 Pass, pass! 

111
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,880
 Excuse me! Please give us the ball! 

112
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,170
 Over here! The ball! 

113
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,520
 Over here! 

114
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,600
Do you like basketball?

115
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,620
- Wow! Daebak! 
 - Daebak!

116
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,870
Wow!

117
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:19,110
♫  What should I say about your facial expression?  ♫

118
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,740
♫  There's something there. I can see it, so strange  ♫

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,180
Thank you!

135
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,210

137
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,230
Ma'am, you need to work out more.

138
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,320
You should last longer than that.

139
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,690
What?

140
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,170
"Longer"? I played so hard just now.

141
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,900
Spare me.

142
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,500
A sports match should be fair.

143
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,890
Also, you told me not to go easy on you.

144
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,980
So should I have clarified?

145
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,620
Just go easy on me anyway.

146
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,570
I can't.

147
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,020
That would defy rules.

148
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,820
Are you training for a match?

149
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,850
Is it international competition or Olympics?

150
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,590
Do you love winning that much?

151
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,960
Yes, I hate losing.

152
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,590
I want to win at everything.

153
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,300
Fine, I'll let you win from now on.

154
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,890
- Do you mean it? 
 - Yes.

155
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,360
- No matter what? 
 - No matter what.

156
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,320
- For me? 
 - For you, CEO Kang.

157
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,250
Good.

158
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,360
Eun Ho. I heard Ji Yun saw CEO Kim Hye Jin today.

159
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,910
Did anything happen?

160
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,260
Ji Yun and CEO Kim Hye Jin have conflict.

161
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,290
Since you work here, I'll tell you.

162
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,850
Back at Career Way, Kim Hye Jin was her mentor.

163
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,990
Until that happened to CEO Lee,

164
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,590
Ji Yun trusted Kim Hye Jin.

165
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,630
A few years ago, Career Way was the victim of a shell company.

166
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,450
 Career Way thought it was 
   

167
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,260
 a solid venture business and formed its early team. 

168
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,220
 But they closed in a few months. 

169
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,370
 Their goal was investment fraud from the start. 

170
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,460
 So Career Way didn't know? 

171
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,360
 That was their official position. 

172
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
 But Ji Yun got a tip that an employee  

173
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,190
 might be involved in the investment fraud. 

174
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,980
 So she pushed for an investigation... 

175
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,500
 but CEO Lee Yong Hun committed suicide and left a note. 

176
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,980
 He took responsibility for everything. 

177
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,340
 He didn't want things to worsen. 

178
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,900
 But that's not CEO Kang's fault. 

179
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,550
 Of course not, but they needed a scapegoat. 

180
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,520
 It was a perfect chance to change the subject: 

181
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,830
 A traitor drove her benefactor CEO 

182
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,300
 to suicide with an unfair accusation. 

183
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,280
 The incident was buried. Career Way was cleared of charges. 

184
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,860
 Kim Hye Jin led that blame. 

185
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,770
 She handled it to become the new CEO. 

186
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,620
 You could say 

187
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,050
 Ji Yun went independent, but she was kicked out. 

188
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,540
 It was scary to see 

189
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,070
 how people's attitudes changed overnight. 

190
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,080
Ji Yun persisted and got to where she is now.

191
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,040
She felt a lot of blame.

192
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,870
No wonder she's overstressed.

193
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,080
She grew up without anyone to rely on.

194
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,510
She had no choice but to be strong.

195
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:12,070
That's how she became Kang Ji Yun, the superwoman.

196
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,920
 Yes, Deputy. Did you see the detailed customer report I sent yesterday? 

197
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,400
I analyzed it for the last three years for you.

198
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Wait. One second.

199
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,590
I'm sorry. One second.

200
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,080
   

201
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,120
Yes, Deputy!

202
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,530
Our client obtained the patent before the competition; that's all good.

203
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,650
Then, Deputy, I'll send you the

204
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:20,070
SWOT analysis tomorrow morning. (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats)

205
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,770
No worries. You need to see the details before deciding.

206
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,560
Okay, bye.

207
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,590
Is all this material for one project?

208
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,670
Ever since I went from researcher to consultant,

209
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,900
I haven't achieved anything by myself.

210
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,190
I can't be in a support role forever.

211
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,240
I really want to prove myself with this.

212
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,270
I will make this happen.

213
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,170
You're already doing a great job.

214
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,180
Don't push yourself too hard. Just be yourself, Gyeong Hwa.

215
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,200
Thank you, Executive Secretary.

216
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,460
You should go home.

217
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,760
I already looked and...

218
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,090
- Manager. 
 - Yes.

219
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,490
Did you offer Deputy Park Geun Ha a position?

220
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,900
- Let's talk later. 
 - Okay.

221
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Yes. How do you know Deputy Park?

222
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,590
He's a candidate Gyeong Hwa has been working with lately.

223
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,470
- She approached him a while ago, right? 
 - Yes.

224
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,240
What are you saying? He didn't mention that on the phone.

225
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,660
I helped Deputy Park move from his previous company.

226
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,570
I called him when I saw a great open position.

227
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,690
He was so happy about it.

228
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,280
I contacted him a month ago about World Commerce.

229
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,250
"World Commerce"?

230
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,070
You said you didn't have candidates yet. You didn't report it to me.

231
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,180
He finally decided to apply for World Commerce yesterday.

232
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,800
Then you called him this morning, and

233
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,660
now he wants to think it over again!

234
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,110
What should I do? I already talked to him.

235
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,030
I contacted this candidate first.

236
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,360
I really need to complete this project.

237
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,010
World Commerce's job description is so particular.

238
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,620
It took me forever to find the right candidate.

239
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,600
Manager, can't you let it go?

240
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,350
It might be easy for you to clinch it by networking,

241
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,880
but I stayed up nights and labored on it!

242
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,770
Gyeong Hwa. "Easy" for me? "Networking"?

243
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,060
How can you say that?

244
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,600
I called Deputy Park because I had ideas.

245
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,400
Frankly, he would have refused mine if your offer was good.

246
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,080
Gyeong Hwa, you pushed it on him for your benefit.

247
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,400
- Manager— 
 - What?

248
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,330
What is all of this?

249
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,980
So you both want to do your project with this candidate?

250
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,260
Yes.

251
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,430
I contacted him first.

252
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,520
I found his position before.

253
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,190
He wants to go with me this time, too.

254
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,270
Do either of you think what's best for the candidate?

255
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,260
Don't put your personal interests first.

256
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,940
Analyze with the team

257
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,100
and decide who would best benefit the candidate's career.

258
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,930
Manager, what happened?

259
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,260
Who's in charge?

260
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,910
G-Gyeong Hwa...

261
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,440
Wh-Why are you crying? Gyeong Hwa, why are you crying?

262
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,690
Manager, could you let her take it this time?

263
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,330
Gyeong Hwa has put so much work into this.

264
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,590
That's right. She helps you out so much.

265
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,630
She does candidate research for you all the time.

266
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,610
Manager, be generous now.

267
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,970
Be nice and let it go, okay?

268
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,240
"Let it go"? Is the candidate an object?

269
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,970
Where's the World Commerce job description?

270
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,600
I-I think it's on Gyeong Hwa's desk.

271
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,890
All of you.

272
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,770
How long have you known she contacted Deputy Park?

273
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,240
Did everyone know except me?

274
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,270
Was I the only one in the dark?

275
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,170
Good going,

276
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,320
just really great.

277
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,230
M-Manager...

278
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,480
Hyungnim...

279
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,980
It's really refreshing.

280
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,360
Why did you follow me? I'll be back soon.

281
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,110
You must be upset.

282
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,340
It's not that I don't want to give it to her.

283
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,170
The protocol was wrong!

284
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,010
If she reported it to me, I wouldn't have called Deputy Park.

285
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,130
They all knew but me.

286
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,460
Look at them gang up on me because she worked so hard.

287
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,740
How about me? Don't I work hard?

288
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,960
Do I just sit around?

289
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,880
I know Gyeong Hwa works hard.

290
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,620
I care about her, too.

291
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,440
It's fine.

292
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,480
I'm the bad guy.

293
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,050
I don't know why I tell you this, Secretary Yu.

294
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,070
All right. I'll go reprimand them.

295
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,490
Please don't.

296
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,210
It's my fault that she felt sidelined.

297
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,290
Here.

298
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,150
Tell Gyeong Hwa to take it.

299
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,940
World Commerce is better for the candidate.

300
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,710
I'll talk to the candidate.

301
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,500
Thanks.

302
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,730
Gyeong Hwa, this is a special coffee usually reserved for the picky CEO Kang.

303
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,700
Drink it while it's hot.

304
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,060
Thank you.

305
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,990
Will you work late tonight?

306
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,390
I think I made a mistake.

307
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,150
Gyeong Hwa.

308
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,650
Manager Yeong Soo might not look like it, but inside...

309
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,180
he cares about you a lot.

310
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,530
Don't worry about it. Don't be intimidated.

311
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,340
Don't skip dinner even if you work late.

312
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,570
I'm heading out. You have the restaurant list, right?

313
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,740
I recommend Granny's Rice Soup.

314
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,170
Good night.

315
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,960
What's going on with World Commerce?

316
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,540
Candidate Park Geun Ha will have his final interview.

317
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,390
The position has been vacant a while so it proceeds quickly.

318
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,190
How about the candidate?

319
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,110
Thankfully, he's cooperating.

320
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,240
How about you, Manager Kim?

321
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,640
Did you find an alternative for the job you recommended to Park Geun Ha?

322
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,230
I'm still looking. I'll find someone to fit the job description

323
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,920
and update the list within the week.

324
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,380
That's good.

325
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,070
Make sure you don't overlap this time. Everyone else, help him.

326
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,230
- Got it. 
 - Meeting adjourned.

327
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,510
Manager, do you want help with the search?

328
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,610
No, thanks. You guys must be busy.

329
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,550
- Let's go eat. 
 - Sounds good.

330
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,890
Gyeong Hwa, let's go.

331
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,210
I have a lot of work.

332
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,760
Please go ahead.

333
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,050
- Gyeong Hwa, make sure you eat. 
 - Yes.

334
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,180
 Okay. 

335
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,640
What should we eat today?

336
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,780
Here are today's meeting minutes.

337
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,990
Do you think Team 1 will be okay?

338
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,040
Okay with what? Is there a problem?

339
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,020
Gyeong Hwa and Manager Kim are still on awkward terms.

340
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,780
So what about it?

341
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,930
I feel awkward around all my employees. That's just work.

342
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,240
Are you awkward around me?

343
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,930
Of course.

344
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,490
Then are we close?

345
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,490
I see.

346
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,440
I'm disappointed.

347
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,240
Really?

348
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,060
We should bring the children here. It's so good!

349
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,140
You must have been hungry.

350
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,680
- Were you really nervous? 
 - Yes.

351
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,670
The Chief Editor's meetings are unnerving.

352
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,580
I never get used to it.

353
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,800
Guess what? I got two new book deals.

354
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,280
- Really? 
 - Yes.

355
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,420
This is on me.

356
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,860
No, you came all this way. It's on me.

357
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,730
I want some things to go anyway.

358
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,750
Fluffy salt bread...

359
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,940
Mocha salt bread sold only here...

360
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Egg tart.

361
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,220
This one's for me.

362
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,530
- Is it lunch for the CEO? 
 - Yes.

363
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,050
You also manage her lunches?

364
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,590
I don't have to, but she won't eat unless I do.

365
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,010
She likes bread from this place.

366
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,150
She had offsite meetings all morning. She probably didn't eat.

367
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,190
The CEO...

368
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,900
Sometimes, she's more work than Byeol.

369
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,100
You were struggling at first, but you seem used to it now.

370
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,150
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

371
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,930
Is that so?

372
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
Oh, it's the CEO.

373
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,100
She's back sooner than I thought.

374
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,480
I have to get going now.

375
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,300
- I'll see you later. 
 - Bye.

376
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,220
So the CEO is a woman.

377
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,890
I thought you skipped lunch. Here's some bread.

378
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,250
If you don't want it—

379
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,810
I appreciate the gesture.

380
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,160
It's hot.

381
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,480
Hello!

382
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,420
Hello.

383
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,250
- Oh, Secretary Yu! 
 - Hello, Ma'am.

384
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,940
- Thank you so much for last time. 
 - It's no problem.

385
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,020
I brought you this.

386
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,700
- Have some. 
 - Thank you!

387
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,760
You're the best. Fighting!

388
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,690
 Bye! 

389
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,260
What are you staring at?

390
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,200
Manager Kim and Gyeong Hwa.

391
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,700
I'm wondering if there's a way for them to reconcile.

392
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,920
Goodness.

393
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,310
I thought it was a serious issue.

394
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,900
Pick a date, get them to drink alcohol, and they'll be fine.

395
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,340
They don't even eat together. Drinks won't happen.

396
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,040
- "They don't even eat together"? 
 - That's serious.

397
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,210
What if we set up a party?

398
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,730
- A welcome party. 
 - "A welcome party"?

399
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,250
"A welcome party"?

400
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,880
"A welcome party"?

401
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,760
What welcome party?

402
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,940
- A welcome party for Secretary Yu. 
 - Yes, a welcome party.

403
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,200
Aigoo, I didn't think to have one.

404
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,190
Thanks to her, no staff dinner culture is here.

405
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,690
I'm sorry, Eun Ho. You must have felt disappointed.

406
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,740
Very much so.

407
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,960
"Disappointed"? That's unacceptable.

408
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,050
Okay, I'm in! Let's make it happen.

409
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,320
Let's do two things at once.

410
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,570
Look, I'm the CEO. I didn't approve it.

411
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,600
So you're saying no?

412
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,050
So you don't want a welcome party?

413
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,520
So is there no welcome party?

414
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,430
What the heck?

415
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,170
Do whatever, but I won't go. Then I approve.

416
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,590
But you should be there—

417
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,610
Okay, great!

418
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,300
Just don't cancel it.

419
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,990
Thanks!

420
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,180
Thank you.

421
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,580
Geez, what the...

422
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,950
Thanks, Mr. Yu. I'll call you later.

423
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,500
Okay.

424
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,290
   

425
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,890
Unnie and Brother-in-law, I'm here.

426
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,670
Our mom still cries a lot.

427
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,410
Seo Jun has grown so much, right?

428
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,770
He increasingly resembles the best in you two.

429
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,900
It's not fair.

430
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:24,070
So don't be too sad you don't see Seo Jun much.

431
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,350
When he's a little older and can understand,

432
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,780
I'll make sure to bring him.

433
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,150
Mom, how many years was it? You still cry so much.

434
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,990
Burying a child...

435
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,140
you can't get used to it over time.

436
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,680
It hurts only more.

437
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,890
Hold on.

438
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,970
 Hi, Mom! 

439
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,190
 I won. 

440
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,930
 I will win next time. 

441
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,620
Jeong Seo Jun is so happy.

442
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,180
Mom, look at Seo Jun's big smile.

443
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,010
Are you happy?

444
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,790
Don't you regret it?

445
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,200
Of course not. He's my son. Why would I regret it?

446
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,460
I regret it.

447
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,450
I should have talked you out of it.

448
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,590
You're not even married...

449
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,360
It's all in the past. Don't dwell on it.

450
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,810
My daughter is more concern to me than my grandson.

451
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:58,690
I worry for your happiness over Seo Jun.

452
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,470
I am happy. I got an adorable son for free.

453
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,570
Look, Mom.

454
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,430
Just look.

455
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,640
 I won! 

456
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,960
Aigoo, my grandson is adorable.

457
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,150
Right? He's cute, right? He's your grandson.

458
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,950
That's right. He's cute.

459
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,380
Did you like the food?

460
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,700
It was delicious.

461
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,060
She won't say it was bad.

462
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,640
You brought us all the way home to feed us.

463
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,710
Where are you going? I'm still talking.

464
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,440
I'll take some stuff home.

465
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,730
Why don't you just move in?

466
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,400
How could you say something so horrible?

467
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,800
Call me when he's done nagging.

468
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,560
I think he's grown up, but when I see him like that,

469
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,150
he has a long way to go.

470
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,120
How has he been doing?

471
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,320
He's doing better than you think.

472
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,930
You've done a lot to make him decent.

473
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,450
See? I have good taste in people.

474
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,840
I immediately chose you at the mentors' meeting.

475
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,700
Are you still supporting college students?

476
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,640
It's more fun to help smart youngsters than to hoard money.

477
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,180
No one is better than you, CEO Kang.

478
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,850
It won't be easy to find one.

479
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,520
So how much longer do I keep inviting you over?

480
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,230
Are you still not impressed with Director Woo?

481
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,370
You've raised him long enough. Why don't you get together?

482
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,660
That was my selfish desires talking. Eat.

483
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:05,150
What did my dad say? Your face is kind of gloomy.

484
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,290
What? Will he withdraw his investment?

485
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,490
If he pulls out now, it'd be his loss.

486
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,970
Of course. That's Kang Ji Yun.

487
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,100
But don't work too hard.

488
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,600
Don't worry. I'm strong.

489
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,760
If you're strong, why did you collapse from overwork?

490
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,240
Be careful, seriously.

491
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,660
I'm worried about you.

492
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,290
I know. I won't overwork.

493
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,010
Do you worry about me?

494
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,060
You've grown up, Woo Jeong Hun.

495
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,170
When did I first see you at the sponsor meetup?

496
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,830
It was before you graduated high school, right?

497
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,600
I'd be disappointed if you still saw me as a youngster.

498
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,720
Look.

499
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,690
I'm even more handsome from this angle, right?

500
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,540
Don't go around doing this.

501
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,740
What are you doing? Hurry up.

502
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,490
Let's go, Secretary Yu.

503
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,580
"Secretary Yu"?

504
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,650
Hello!

505
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,230
- You're the CEO of Peoplez, on the eighth floor, right? 
 - Yes.

506
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,920
Secretary Yu Eun Ho brags about you so much.

507
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,120
He says you're so famous and talented.

508
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,860
I thought you were just pretty,

509
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,900
but it must be great to be so capable.

510
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,120
Here, have one of these.

511
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,150
Have a good day.

512
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,640
   

513
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,620
Yes?

514
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,480
Here's your weekly schedule.

515
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,720
Why do you have so much green juice?

516
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,260
I heard it's good for you.

517
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,890
Before the meeting with Chief Jang, get the files ready—

518
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,240
Excuse me, Ma'am.

519
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,370
Manager Kim and I are double checking the interview files

520
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,010
before your meeting with Chief Jang.

521
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,230
I'll get it to you as soon as we're done.

522
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,850
Good choice.

523
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,180
Keep eating healthy.

524
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:50,810
♫  A hidden world that only you know  ♫

525
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,650
♫  Can you tell me?  ♫

526
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,130
♫  Let me see you now, Baby  ♫

527
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,240
You'll go to Secretary Yu's welcome party, right?

528
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,060
Do you think I dressed up for nothing?

529
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,690
I claim the seat on Secretary Yu's right tonight.

530
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,050
I think many people will be there.

531
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,330
People know what "handsome" is.

532
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,530
Support me, okay?

533
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,270
Got it, Unnie.

534
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,800
- Shall we go? 
 - Okay.

535
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,630
♫  Baby, know you more and more  ♫

536
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,880
 What a waste of energy. They should be working. 

537
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,510
♫  There's something there. I can see it, so interesting  ♫

538
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,210
♫  I want to know more  ♫

539
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,650
Executive Secretary.

540
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,120
Could you open this for me?

541
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,000
Oh, sure. This is hard to open, right?

542
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,800
- Yes. 
 - Here you go.

543
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,030
Ms. CEO, do you need anything?

544
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,820
No.

545
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,490
Drink this.

546
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:10,460
♫  When I see your heart, will you tell me?  ♫

547
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,250
 You're joining us for a walk, right? 

548
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,830
 Okay. Thanks for the drink. 

549
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,140
No problem. Promise!

550
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,690
He's the most excited one.

551
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:23,340
♫  Watching you all day, the day passes by  ♫

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,280
♫  Baby, know you more and more  ♫

554
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,570
Secretary Yu.

555
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,250
Secretary Yu!

556
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,990
What?

557
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:53,210
Is everyone gone already?

558
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,000
Let's go!

559
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,260
Here we go!

560
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,160
Attention, everyone!

561
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,900
- Seriously! 
 - All right, sorry.

562
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,360
Players, are we ready?

563
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,290
The shots are ready. Here we go!

564
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,110
One, two, three! Go!

565
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,920
Let's go!

566
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,450
- Cheers. 
 - Thank you.

567
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,020
Enjoy.

568
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,590
Hey, hey, cheers.

569
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,450
Cheers.

570
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,970
Cheers, everyone.

571
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,210
Cheers, cheers.

572
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,390
Come on, everyone.

573
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:35,200
Here, here, cheers!

574
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,940
Hey, hey, hey!

575
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,870
Attention, everyone. This is a welcome party for Eun Ho...

576
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,080
and a bonding for all Peoplez employees.

577
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,730
It's a very, very special occasion.

578
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,970
Don't even think of getting out of here alive.

579
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,990
Loosen your belts, everybody.

580
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,680
- Cheer if you can drink! 
 -  Yes! 

581
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,280
Director, you're so determined tonight.

582
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,400
Everyone, I like to separate work and life

583
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,240
so I can't drink hard tonight.

584
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,480
 Boo! 

585
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,950
But I also know the generosity a boss must have so...

586
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,910
this is on me tonight!

587
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,200
Thank you!

588
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,640
- Enjoy! 
 - Yes, thank you.

589
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,970
Okay, let's pass the menu around. Order anything.

590
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,720
Gyeong Hwa! Cheers.

591
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,770
Okay, Director!

592
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,100
Also, tonight is for Secretary Yu, whose work and life are

593
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,890
very challenging. So Secretary Yu, please get drunk.

594
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,420
Please say a few words, Secretary Yu.

595
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,550
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

596
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:15,240
I'm grateful so many of you came to my welcome party.

597
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,530
Everyone at Peoplez has taken such good care of me.

598
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:21,370
But in particular, without anyone noticing...

599
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,500
Manager Yeong Soo has been so good to me.

600
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,560
Could I ask you to make a toast?

601
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,180
- Oh, come on... 
 - Thank you!

602
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,330
"A toast"? No, thanks.

603
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,700
Just do it!

604
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,420
- No. 
 -  Just do it. 

605
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,410
Manager Yeong Soo is best at speeches.

606
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,630
Am I the best?

607
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,860
If you told me earlier, I would have done it.

608
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,920
I guess I'm the best.

609
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,170
I don't have anything too special. Okay.

610
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,890
Squid. Let's do squid.

611
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,560
S. Q. "Shall" we "Quest"?

612
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,480
U. I. "Unendingly Intertwined."

613
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,580
D. "Doggedly" march on!

614
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,130
S.Q.U.I.D!

615
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,810
- That was great! 
 - Did you just laugh?

616
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,670
- That was so fun! Cheers! 
 - Funny!

617
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,330
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

618
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,440
I've always felt this, but Gyeong Hwa...

619
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,610
your sense of humor is a little weird, honestly.

620
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:25,400
- Wasn't it funny? "S.Q.U.I.D." 
 - S.Q.U.I.D.

621
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,450
Well, Gyeong Hwa and Manager Kim always had the same sense of humor.

622
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,700
I know, right?

623
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,490
So can you reconcile? It's awkward to be around you two.

624
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,640
That's right.

625
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,430
When did we make you feel awkward?

626
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:42,190
Who needs to reconcile? Sometimes things just happen.

627
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,500
Isn't that true, Gyeong Hwa?

628
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,770
Yes, I mean, same here.

629
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,530
That's right.

630
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,620
Now we've restored harmony, should we drink?

631
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:56,600
- Great idea! 
 - There's nothing to restore.

632
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,130
I'm sorry, Manager!

633
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,870
I'll report things to you from now on.

634
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:06,300
No, I'm sorry.

635
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,380
Let's do our best going forward.

636
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,680
It's S.Q.U.I.D. then!

637
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,170
Cheers to that!

638
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,530
 S.Q.U.I.D! 

639
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,170
 S.Q.U.I.D! 

640
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,280
Let's drink!

641
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,660
The CEO does all the work.

642
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,940
Is this just a club?

643
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,260
They should be working.

644
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,600
   

645
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,480
   

646
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,820
 If you need anything, let me know. 

647
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,870
 Here's the address of the dinner, just in case. 

648
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,370
 If you change your mind, come anytime. 

649
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,120
   

650
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,300
What did you eat, Byeol?

651
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,230
You had pasta?

652
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,990
Was it good?

653
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,010
One second.

654
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,370
Director, are you going home?

655
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,940
Yes, Secretary Yu.

656
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,720
I have important business so I'm leaving.

657
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,360
- Get home safely. 
 - I will!

658
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,620
If Auntie made it, it can't be good.

659
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:59,260
Oh! I think someone is criticizing me.

660
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,810
 What? Were you listening? 

661
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,060
Hey, my cooking has improved.

662
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:11,040
Got it. I'm sorry about today. I'll watch the children this weekend.

663
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,220
It's all good. It's us. No worries.

664
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,280
It's a rare staff dinner. Have fun.

665
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,290
I won't be too late. Thank you!

666
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:20,020
Okay, don't drink too much.

667
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,800
Bye.

668
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,490
Okay.

669
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,780
 It's us. No worries. 

670
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,490
Mom, are you hot?

671
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:40,540
What?

672
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,300
Your face is all red.

673
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:48,900
It is? I think Mommy is a little warm.

674
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,390
 Secretary Yu. 

675
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,910
 Secretary Yu. 

676
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,190
Yu Eun Ho!

677
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,740
Are you okay?

678
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,360
I'm sorry.

679
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,650
You made it here.

680
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,280
Wait, isn't that Secretary Yu and the CEO?

681
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,900
- No way. Why would CEO Kang be here? 
 - It is!

682
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,310
Hey, Kang Ji Yun!

683
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,080
Hey!

684
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,520
You're here to see me, right?

685
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,640
No, no...

686
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,920
I was looking for you! Really!

687
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,310
Round two!

688
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,130
Let's go, let's go!

689

Let's go!

690
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,720
- Another round! 
 - Let's go!

691
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,590
Let's go! Round two!

What?

695
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,780
She's not here.

696
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,730
I thought she'd be here alone.

697

Wait here for a second. I'll walk you to the car.

Hello, Driver, where are you?

762
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:27,820
Got it.

Deputy, I'll get out soon.

00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,310
Good night.

773
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,890
Hey, Gyeong Hwa, one second.

774
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,930
Yes, Manager.

775
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,810
You've been stressed about Park Geun Ha, right? Me, too.

776
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:07,730
He's great, but so indecisive.

777
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:13,090
He had to think it over until the last minute. But why?

778
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:22,360
I'm saying it's not your fault. Okay?

779
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:27,140
He's just like that. Don't worry about it.

782
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,610
I should have just...

783
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,770
Wrong! It's fine.

784
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:43,820
This is yours, Gyeong Hwa. Get this project done.

Instead of going home, the office is her primal instinct.

♫  Just like a forever starlight  ♫

819
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:05,000
♫  I'm always by your side  ♫

820
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:51,510
We did drink a lot.

821
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,810
CEO.

822
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,540
CEO?

823
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,450
CEO?

824
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,500
I should take her home.

825
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,150
Secretary Yu.

826
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,930
You're so handsome.

827
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,560
Yu Eun Ho...

828
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:23,150


829
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:29,090
♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

830
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:32,080
♫  I don't know why I'm being like this  ♫

831
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,850
   

832
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,910
♫  It's a difficult feeling  ♫

833
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:40,830
♫  This strange sensation  ♫

834
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:43,810
♫  Feels more like excitement than nerves  ♫

835
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,710
♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

836
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:49,660
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

837
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:55,090
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

838
01:07:55,090 --> 01:08:00,500
♫  Though it might be sudden  ♫

839
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,680
♫  So just test me, I'll tell you  ♫

840
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,980
 What? Was that a dream? It can't be... 

841
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:09,030
 You didn't come here after the staff dinner, did you? 

842
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:09,760
 No. 

843
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,740
 You called me "Abeonim" that time, right? 

844
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:12,830
 I'm sorry about that. 

845
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:14,390
 You won't look for your parents tonight. 

846
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,130
 - We can sleep well on our own, right? 
 - See you tomorrow, Daddy. 

847
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,800
 We're gathering at Eun Ho's place. 

848
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,610
 - Make sure everyone shows up! 
 - CEO? 

849
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:22,700
 Is no one else here? 

850
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,040
 They said they couldn't make it so we canceled— 

851
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,100
 - CEO! 
 - Yes? 

852
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,410
 Would you like some dinner? 

853
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:31,540
 Why did you pretend you didn't recall the night of the staff dinner? 

854
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,580
 What do you remember exactly? 

855
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:36,400
 What do you want me to remember? 

856
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,930
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫
