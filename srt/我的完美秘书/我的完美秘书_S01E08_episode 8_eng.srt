 ♫  Don't know who I am when I'm with you  ♫

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,340
♫  I don't know why I'm being like this  ♫

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,240
    
 ♫  When I looked into your eyes  ♫

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,090
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

5

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,450
   

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,990
   

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,990


16
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,580
Why didn't you go to the movie?

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,200
   

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,560
Because I wanted to see you, CEO Kang.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,800
Are you really the Eun Ho I know?

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,900
Why did you call me?

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,170
It felt unfair working late by myself.

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,090
I'm...

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,200
used to being alone.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,490
I thought solitude was a luxury,

25
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,930
but I guess I missed the feeling of warmth.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,420
The day I returned from your house,

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,710
my home felt cold for the first time.

28
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,250
I was so used to it that I didn't even realize it was cold.

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,020
I think I had forgotten

30
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,930
that a home could be warm.

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,400
Isn't it strange?

32
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,800
The things that were natural to me before I met you...

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,940
don't feel so natural anymore.

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,330
But strangely, I didn't hate it.

35
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,800
It's not my style to mix work with my personal life and date a co-worker.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,630
But I failed hugely.

37
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,630
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,880
It doesn't seem you can run away,

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,480
like when you told me how you felt last time.

40
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,240
It's hard for me to keep things in, unlike somebody.

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,800
So you didn't like it?

42
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,750
No, I liked it.

43
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:09,020
I never imagined I could like someone again.

44
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,600
My child filled my world.

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,810
I never thought there was room for anyone else.

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,740
But I got excited.

47
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,180
I tried so hard to keep it in, but...

48
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,710
I failed, too.

49
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,730
I get it. I'm way too attractive.

50
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,150
Eun Ho,

51
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,090
let's not make this complicated.

52
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,220
Let's just like each other.

53
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,070
I'll be good to you.

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,890
I like you a lot.

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,430
Me, too.

56
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,370
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

57
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,200
Don't worry about me. Just drive.

58
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,920
So this is what you look like from the side.

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,900
Not too shabby.

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,630
Don't get out of the car.

61
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,850
If you get out, I won't want to let you go.

62
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,820
Bye.

63
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,500
Forehead.

64
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,900
Close your eyes.

65
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,280
Done.

66
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,660
- Hey, Byeol? 
 - Yes?

67
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,750
How would you feel...

68
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,010
if I had...

69
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,420
someone I liked?

70
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,320
Appa, do you have a girlfriend?

71
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,370
I want to hear your thoughts.

72
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,860
I would like it.

73
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,600
Appa, I'm seven already!

74
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,910
I'm not little anymore.

75
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,840
I want you to smile a lot.

76
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,670
I'm sleepy, Daddy.

77
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,450
   

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,890
I'm sorry I told you to muster the courage for nothing.

79
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,130
It's okay.

80
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,160
I can't torture myself forever. It's better sooner than later.

81
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,600
It's not me, right?

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,830
No matter how urgent, if you like someone,

83
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,330
you wouldn't cancel plans like this, right?

84
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,970
I mean, it really depends.

85
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,970
Maybe something really urgent happened at work.

86
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,650
Really?

87
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,450
I can't! I might start feeling hopeful again.

88
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,640
See, you have a serious case of unrequited love.

89
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,570
As if you're not in the same boat.

90
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,420
Hey, I'm doing better than you.

91
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm not.

92
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,430
We're in the same dilemma.

93
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,150
The person I like doesn't see me as a man.

94
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,800
She still thinks I'm a high-schooler.

95
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,570
When he is with me, all he talks about is children.

96
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,140
I shouldn't have asked him to be parent buddies.

97
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,470
I look only at her at work, but she looks at someone else.

98
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,720
You work together?

99
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,460
Then you have to see her daily.

100
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,340
Correct. What do you think? I win, right?

101
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,920
Am I a little more tragic?

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,660
I walk the children to school with him daily. Tomorrow too.

103
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,270
- Really? 
 - Yes.

104
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,890
- The day after you got rejected? 
 - Yes.

105
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,200
Wow, that's quite bad.

106
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,210
I hate my father.

107
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,530
Come on. This is why she thinks you're a child!

108
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,920
Don't be like that. You're not an adolescent.

109
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,320
It's not like that.

110
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,650
I really... I really don't understand.

111
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,190
After burying a child, how could he...

112
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,240
Like it was nothing...

113
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,270
I must be drunk. I'm talking nonsense. I'm sorry.

114
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,080
Gosh, I'm drunk, too. I won't remember any of this.

115
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,210
If you want to say something, do it.

116
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,260
I...

117
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,080
I miss my brother.

118
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,450
My older brother was such a good, kind person,

119
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,850
the opposite of me.

120
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,550
But...

121
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,580
he left too soon.

122
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,500
I don't know why good people get taken from us so early.

123
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,660
I...

124
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,040
haven't found the answer yet, either.

125
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,540
My older sister and brother-in-law died together in an accident.

126
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,340
I held their child, who kept asking for his parents. I asked many times,

127
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,250
but I didn't get the answers.

128
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,010
We have so much in common, even this.

129
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,140
Right?

130
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,730
Then is your son...

131
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,890
Yes. He is my sister's son.

132
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,020
But now, no matter what anyone says, he's my son.

133
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm always worried I'm not a good mom

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,690
because I'm not his biological mother.

135
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,940
I started drawing picture books for Seo Jun too.

136
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,750
Because there's a story I want to tell him.

137
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,730
Geez. That guy is so dumb.

138
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,840
He is missing out on someone amazing.

139
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,420
Right? That's what I'm saying.

140
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,680
If he lets me go, it's his loss.

141
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,760
Agreed! Let's toast to that.

142
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,540
Let's do that. Cheers!

143
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,850
Let me fill your glass.

144
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,460
Thank you.

145
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,400
 You were flying earlier. Do you have wings? 

146
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,770
 I have wings on my back. 

147
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,440
 - Oh, really? 
 - Yes. Didn't you see? 

148
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,400
 I didn't see them. 

149
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
 Only nice people can see them. 

150
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,210
 - Cheers! 
 - Cheers. 

151
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,550
Ms. Jeong, I'm really sorry about last night.

152
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,400
- Did you get home okay? 
 - Yes. You should be sorry.

153
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,630
I got bailed on and wasted the tickets.

154
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,420
That was not very nice of you, Mr. Yu. Right?

155
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,840
Right, it wasn't.

156
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,050
Keep scolding me. I'll accept it.

157
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,980
If you're that sorry...

158
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,410
you can pay for the tickets next time.

159
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,550
Is that enough? Of course, I can.

160
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,360
But Ms. Jeong, next time, let's take the children with us.

161
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,170
The children like seeing movies, too.

162
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,070
Right. They do.

163
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,460
- Hey, Mr. Yu. 
 - Yes?

164
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,540
The urgent thing last night...

165
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,110
Was it because of CEO Kang?

166
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,650
What?

167
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,940
Yes.

168
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,390
I see.

169
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,240
- I had a feeling. 
  - Rock, paper, scissors! 

170
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
 - Yay! 

171
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,810
Byeol!

172
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,720
That's dangerous! Stop.

173
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,000
Wait a minute.

174
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,070
 Hello! 

175
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,830
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

176
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,280
Hello.

177
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,080
- Hello, Secretary Yu! 
 - Hello.

178
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,430
 You're fine to keep it a secret at work, right? 

179
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,350
 - Yes. 
 - Be strict at the office. 

180
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,780
 Keep work and life separate. Okay? 

181
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,750
You have a meeting with Attorney Jang Seon Woo at 1 PM,

182
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,180
Jaein Pharmaceuticals at 4, and Gloss Apparel at 5.

183
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,270
Is there anything else you need to report?

184
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,960
No.

185
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,830
Should I close the blinds?

186
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,560
Secretary Yu,

187
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,530
let's do this right. Don't make it obvious.

188
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,500
Yes.

189
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,380
Just leave.

190
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,780
Close what?

191
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,800
That was embarrassing.

192
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,560
Hey, Hyungnim. Did you screw up with CEO Kang?

193
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,280
She's a bit icier than usual today.

194
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:47,200
You need some special caffeine at times like this.

195
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,980
Hyungnim.

196
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,830
She's so good at keeping work and life separate.

197
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,980
What else is new?

198
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,100
Yes. Not bad, right?

199
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,600
Fine. Take it all. If you're hurt, I'm hurt.

200
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,610
   

201
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,010
Gyeong Hwa.

202
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,090
Fighting today.

203
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,000
The statute of limitations had expired.

204
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,900
Likely, it won't be regarded as filing a lawsuit. Yes.

205
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,260
Yes, I'll give you a call. Thank you.

206
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,320
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

207
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,270
I ordered first because I'm short on time.

208
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,790
I don't have much time to eat. Is that okay?

209
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,150
Yes, I heard.

210
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,650
- Let's chat while we eat. 
 - Okay.

211
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,560
Migang Law Firm chose me?

212
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,330
I heard I was competing with another candidate until the end.

213
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,180
Yes. You both possess administrative litigation expertise that Migang needs.

214
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,990
That's why they took so long to finally decide.

215
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,830
What helped our client decide—

216
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,790
It was probably my win rate.

217
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,920
I guess big law firms also obsess over win rates.

218
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,410
No, it was your leading case.

219
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,780
You've dealt with many cases that required an adventurous,

220
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,680
fresh approach to interpreting the law.

221
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,690
Migang has no reason to forgo a lawyer like that.

222
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,420
What I'm about to say may sound careless.

223
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,530
I have some terms before I agree to the position.

224
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,010
- "Terms"? 
 - Yes.

225
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,170
After 4 PM, I need to work remotely.

226
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,620
Of course, court days are an exception.

227
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,650
I want to decrease my cases to about half of my current load.

228
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:56,110
Also, I need two junior lawyers who are exclusive to me.

229
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,980
Can I ask why?

230
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,310
Work-life balance?

231
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,520
I want a healthier balance now.

232
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,970
If they don't want to miss out on me like you said,

233
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,690
I think they can make that investment.

234
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,580
In return, I promise to deliver my win rate.

235
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,250
I have to take this. One moment.

236
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,200
Wow, this won't be easy to negotiate.

237
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,920
Has she said anything to you separately?

238
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,350
No.

239
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,210
There must be a reason why she's suddenly doing this.

240
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,860
Find out if other search firms are in touch with her.

241
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,050
Yes, understood.

242
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,410
There has to be a reason why a famous workaholic

243
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,770
suddenly wants work-life balance.

244
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,780
   

245
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,160
I emailed you everything so take a look.

246
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,390
Yes, thank you.

247
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,370
If you can reply promptly...

248
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,350
We can go.

249
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,460
Should we go to the office?

250
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,610
No, let's have coffee first.

251
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,970
Then I'll search for a nearby coffee shop.

252
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,910
Why aren't you going?

253
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,670
- We should resist during work hours. 
 - But we're not at work.

254
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,150
But it's work hours. Let's keep work and life separate.

255
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,100
- You're strict in that so— 
 - Wait, are you upset?

256
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,860
No, I'm not upset! It's because you're right.

257
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,360
Moving forward, I will strictly hide what's going on.

258
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,520
You say that, but you haven't let go of my hand.

259
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,650
Because we're not at the office.

260
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,570
That's what I'm saying.

261
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,000
- Mocha salt bread? 
 - Yes.

262
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,830
What? Why do they look so serious?

263
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,700
How did it go... Oh, my gosh!

264
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,650
Wh-Why are you here?

265
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,710
 The meeting! Didn't you just meet with Attorney Jang Seon Woo? 

266
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,960
Yes.

267
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,340
How did it go?

268
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,810
It went well.

269
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,640
Yu Eun Ho, seriously?

270
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,690
Oh, he's so darn cute.

271
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,460
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

272
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,690
Who? Me?

273
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,820
You were doing this just now.

274
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,520
My head...

275
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,780
- Do you have a headache? 
 - Yes.

276
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,690
Let me get you some medicine.

277
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,530
I don't think so.

278
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,000
She definitely said something doing this.

279
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,770
"Oh... he's... so darn cute"?

280
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,030
Who?

281
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,180
I wonder how Ms. Jeong is doing.

282
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,690
   
   

283
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,680
   

284
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,400
   

285
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,670
Drinking lightweight.

286
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,210
   

287
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,820
   

288
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:01,740
Thank you for listening to my useless stories.

289
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,430
Why do we drink when we see each other?

290
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,470
What an interesting guy.

291
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,450
He makes me say whatever I want to say.

292
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,960
Yes?

293
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,760
- How is work progressing? 
 - Quite well.

294
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,110
- Have this. 
 - You can leave it there.

295
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,960
I'll eat while working. Thanks, Mom.

296
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,150
What? Why do you look so curious?

297
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,860
If you have a question, just ask it.

298
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,110
I'm just frustrated.

299
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,090
I made time for your date, but Byeol's dad came home early.

300
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,730
Yet you came home drunk in the morning. What happened?

301
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,610
What? Didn't it go well?

302
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,640
- Mom, breathe first. 
 - I know!

303
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,670
So answer me before your mom stops breathing!

304
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,260
Did it go well or not?

305
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,800
We didn't go to the movie, and we won't see a movie by ourselves.

306
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,130
So let's stop useless expectations.

307
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,250
This case is from 2021.

308
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,880
They filed a lawsuit challenging the authority's procedural errors.

309
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,230
They decided it was a violation, not a crime.

310
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,900
That worked out. Good. Okay.

311
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,640
- Then let's focus on targeting this part. 
 - Attorney Jang,

312
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,350
shouldn't you answer your phone? It's been ringing.

313
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,640
Can you hand me the files?

314
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,020
Gosh, this is crazy. I can't work. One second.

315
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,400
I'm sorry, but...

316
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
I need to leave.

317
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,790
Can you find similar precedents?

318
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,940
I'll check them in the evening. Sorry!

319
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,340
Okay! See you later!

320
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,310
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

321
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,840
It's going to voicemail.

322
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,120
It's been 30 minutes now.

323
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,620
- She's still not answering? 
 - No. I texted her too, but no response.

324
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,940
She's so different from what I know of her. I'm confused.

325
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,730
Have you called the office?

326
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,930
Thank you. One second.

327
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,570
Attorney Jang.

328
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,110
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry!

329
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,720
One second.

330
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,280
Tae Yun!

331
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,040
Let's talk upstairs.

332
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,810
There's a big trial in the afternoon; the office should be empty.

333
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,930
I'm sorry I couldn't attend our meeting. Something unexpected happened.

334
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,630
I think we should know what that thing is.

335
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,990
Can I ask?

336
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm going through a divorce and a custody battle.

337
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,910
I'm being attacked for being negligent to my child due to work so...

338
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,410
I need time to be with my child.

339
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,510
Is this why you insisted on those terms?

340
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,880
Yes.

341
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,860
I have too much on my plate here.

342
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,410
My husband knows that, too. Thus,

343
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,640
it's beneficial if I get a new job,

344
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,020
cut back on work, and make a big effort.

345
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,810
The other side argues that

346
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,270
I neglected my family for work so he had to have an affair

347
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,460
and our child didn't get proper care.

348
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,110
The babysitter suddenly got sick today,

349
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,690
but there was nowhere to take him.

350
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,080
So I took him today, and...

351
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,550
Here I am at the office with my child.

352
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,530
I guess you can't stop working.

353
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,400
Of course, I can't.

354
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,950
But I could have cut back, I guess.

355
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,730
I didn't want to lose my career after I had him so I was greedy.

356
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,900
But it appears, in both work and childcare,

357
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,040
I can't do anything right.

358
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,710
Maybe I have no right to be a mom like my husband said.

359
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,140
I have no way to properly take care of him.

360
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,750
And is it right to be greedy?

361
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,010
Is it right to bring him just because I want to?

362
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,140
I always find a solution for people's cases,

363
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,180
but I struggle with mine.

364
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,470
Why don't you have the right?

365
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,300
It's not easy to raise a child.

366
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,880
At times, you want to give up and leave,

367
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,270
but you didn't.

368
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,280
You're trying to protect both your child and your career.

369
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,770
That's already incredible.

370
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,800
No parent is perfect.

371
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,430
Even if you're inadequate, do your best, and it improves daily.

372
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,860
You're doing that...

373
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,050
and so am I.

374
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,420
You have every right.

375
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,610
 My Byeol... 

376
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,420
 Eun Ho. 

377
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,160
 I want a divorce. 

378
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,250
 Seeing you holding Byeol... 

379
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,090
 I feel suffocated. 

380
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,030
 It'll be hard for Attorney Jang to get the job, right? 

381
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,940
 Even if we explain to the client, 

382
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,010
it won't be easy for them to accept it.

383
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,760
But...

384
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,080
why haven't you asked me? You must be curious.

385
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,860
I am, but...

386
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,950
it might be painful.

387
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,090
You haven't asked me, either.

388
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,660
She was struggling.

389
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,440
When she felt suffocated,

390
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,820
I couldn't hang on to her.

391
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,960
Don't you resent her?

392
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,850
A little, at first,

393
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,230
but I barely recall her anymore.

394
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,320
Do you keep in touch?

395
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,510
Not even once. I don't know what she's doing.

396
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,840
Does Byeol know?

397
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,110
I wish she didn't, but

398
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,910
she naturally understood things as she grew.

399
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,750
But Byeol...

400
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,470
has never made it obvious to me.

401
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,640
After that, when it was just us two feeling lost,

402
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,010
my little girl just squeezed my finger, really hard.

403
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,560
I totally came to my senses then.

404
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,950
That vital responsibility keeps me going.

405
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,490
I didn't raise Byeol. I think Byeol raised me.

406
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:05,570
I should thank Byeol for raising you so well.

407
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:12,240
She's one of the two people who made me who I am today.

408
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,570
Who is the other person?

409
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,920
It's a long story.

410
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,150
I'll tell you another time.

411
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,460
So you acknowledge that you're amazing, right?

412
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,880
Well, I'm not too bad, right?

413
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,760
Eun Ho, you're clueless. "Not too bad"?

414
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,960
That's not it. You're absolutely amazing.

415
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,190
You're blushing!

416
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,570
A sudden compliment.

417
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,380
You must like it.

418
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,220
- Yes, CEO. 
 -  Hi, Eun Ho. 

419
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,070
I met someone who said they remembered the fire incident.

420
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,300
- Really? 
 -  Yes. 

421
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,180
I have their contact info.

422
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,600
 I'll text it to you. Get in touch. 

423
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,390
Understood. Thank you.

424
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,950
- Thank you, CEO. 
  - Sure. 

425
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,650
Eun Ho!

426
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,040
Hurry.

427
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,900
♫  Let me see you now, Baby  ♫

428
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,100
♫  I can see you now  ♫

429
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,620
♫  Can you teach me everything?  ♫

430
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,710
♫  I can hear it  ♫

431
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:46,370
♫  When I see your heart, will you tell me?  ♫

432
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,110
♫  I want to know your heart  ♫

433
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,060
♫  Can I trust it?  ♫

434
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:58,730
♫  Watching you all day, the day passes by  ♫

435
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,610
♫  I want to know your everything  ♫

436
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,740
♫  Baby, know you more and more  ♫

437
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,830
Migang Law Firm has a new candidate.

438
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,730
Contact Attorney Ahn Jeong Min.

439
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,510
Understood.

440
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,760
What should we do about Attorney Jang?

441
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,090
There's nothing we can do.

442
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,860
It won't be easy to find a law firm who will agree to her terms.

443
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,880
I'll call her.

444
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,970
Is there anything else?

445
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,290
Attorney Jang.

446
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,210
What if she was an in-house counsel?

447
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,290
An in-house attorney has regular work hours

448
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,630
and has fewer trials and cases than law firms.

449
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,210
So she could do childcare...

450
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,640
Just because you sympathize, we can't give her a job tailored to her situation.

451
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,170
Right.

452
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,130
Understood.

453
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,020
She needs an offer.

454
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,360
Is there an offer for her to be an in-house counsel?

455
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,130
She's talented.

456
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:05,490
Matching a skilled candidate to a job... is our task.

457
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,650
This is what I've researched so far.

458
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,660
I can look for more places that fit Attorney Jang's expertise.

459
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,650
What would you have done if I said no?

460
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,250
Condense the list, and we will meet with the point person.

461
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,140
Is a high-five okay?

462
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:42,330
♫  Giving in to this feeling, guide me closer  ♫

463
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:48,760
♫  Yes, I'll dive in deep into your heart  ♫

472
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,320
 ­  

473
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,320
Uncle, I think my dad has a crush on someone.

474
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,300
- What? 
 - Why are you so surprised?

475
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,010
No, no.

476
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,560
I'm not surprised.

477
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,540
How do you know, Byeol?

478
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,850
There's evidence.

479
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,370
E-Evidence? You know what that word means?

480
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,230
First,

481
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,790
 Dad keeps staring into the mirror. 

482
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,300
Second, he has his phone in his hand all day.

483
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,190
 Yes. 

484
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,800
 - Is your hair bothering you? 
 - Yes. 

485
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,480
 Daddy, this isn't my hair tie. 

486
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,390
 I just got it. 

487
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,030
 Third, there was a hair tie from another girl. 

488
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,590
Yu Eun Ho, what kind of daughter are you raising?

489
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,370
Byeol, you're the smartest seven-year-old I've ever seen.

490
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,900
This is basic stuff.

491
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,210
Oh, yes? "Basic"?

492
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,980
- But Byeol, how do you feel? 
 - About what?

493
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,470
Your dad having a crush on someone.

494
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,400
Are you upset about it?

495
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,720
I told him I liked the idea.

496
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,610
You did?

497
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,690
Byeol, you're such a good girl!

498
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,250
Uncle, when you find out whom it is, tell me.

499
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,750
- Promise? 
 - Yes.

500
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,340
Okay. Promise!

501
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,430
 ­  

502
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,570
What lovely weather we have.

503
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,070
 Should we get some beer? 

504
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,260
Why are you in such a good mood?

505
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,500
Did you win the lottery or something?

506
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,230
The lottery is not a big deal.

507
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,970
If the person I like is happy, that's winning the lottery.

508
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,690
That's because we have never won the lottery. What is it?

509
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,620
- I think Eun Ho... 
 - Yes?

510
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,200
has a girlfriend.

511
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,290
Really? Daebak.

512
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,010
That's great!

513
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,010
Eun Ho should be dating!

514
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,290
He was so hesitant and timid before.

515
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,450
I'm so proud of our Eun Ho.

516
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,310
It's time for Eun Ho to be happy.

517
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:59,710
That's right. You gave birth to him.

518
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,950
When did he even have time to meet a girl?

519
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,150
He's always with Ji Yun these days.

520
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,160
I know.

521
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,430
Maybe those two...

522
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,400
What in the world? Seriously!

523
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,100
Why do you keep sticking them together?

524
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,320
It's possible! They look good together.

525
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,700
You're being weird, Mi Ae. Can't they date?

526
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,980
Ji Yun is single and Eun Ho...

527
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,920
What about him?

528
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,620
A-Anyway, those two are not it.

529
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:34,050
Ji Yun already asked me to get her a different assistant.

530
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,500
What? What is it?

531
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,670
Darn it. Let's get some beer. W-Wait...

532
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,700
When we're at work, please respect my boundaries, Eun Ho.

533
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,160
I'm already off work, Ji Yun.

534
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,010
This guy is getting more shameless by the second.

535
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,050
♫  I realized my true feelings  ♫

536
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:41,560
♫  Feels like something is changing between us  ♫

537
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,470
♫  Though it might be sudden  ♫

538
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,970
Then I'm off work, too.

539
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,870
♫  My sincere feelings for you  ♫

540
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,390
♫  Yes, whenever it is, just tell me  ♫

541
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,490
♫  Whatever it is, I can do it  ♫

542
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,760
♫  Test me, I'll tell you  ♫

543
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,570
♫  My feelings whenever, wherever  ♫

544
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:11,200
♫  Right now my heart, heart is going straight to you  ♫

545
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,110
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

546
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,380
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

547
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,870
♫  Test me if you feel it like I do  ♫

548
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,990
I'm hungry.

549
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,990
 The door is closing. 

550
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,380
Darn it!

551
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,700
 Why are we out here so early? 

552
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,900
Well, l-let's get some hangover food first.

553
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,590
I drank due to you so you should pay!

554
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,160
Thank you.

555
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,580
 You got me pickles and olives, right? 

556
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,800
 So picky. Of course, I did. 

557
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,520
 - Double sauce, right? 
 - Yes! 

558
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,140
 Hey, Ji Yun... 

559
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,380
 You... 

560
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,190
 You're not, right? 

561
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,170
 Not what? 

562
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,230
How am I supposed to know what you mean? Be clear.

563
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,390
You and Eun Ho...

564
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,050
Yes, I like Eun Ho.

565
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,600
Wh-What are you going to do? Are you actually dating?

566
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,750
What? Am I not allowed?

567
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,470
 Hey. I know Eun Ho is a good person. I do. 

568
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,840
But... still.

569
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,270
Why... why do you want to go down a difficult road?

570
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,230
Because I like him.

571
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,380
Do I need another reason?

572
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,630
Why do you have to like Eun Ho out of all people?

573
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:08,190
You finally meet someone after being alone forever, and why...

574
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,500
 a guy with a child? 

575
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,610
 What? Fine, call me shallow if you want to. 

576
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,770
 Hey, I know what kind of life you've had. 

577
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,760
Without parents, you went from relative to relative...

578
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,150
 Ji Yun, I... 

579
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,340
 I just want you... 

580
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,370
 to meet someone without issues like everyone else, 

581
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,530
 and have an ordinary relationship. 

582
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,220
 I know what you mean. 

583
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,530
But Unnie, why is that an issue?

584
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,350
It's the life he has led.

585
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,330
I like Eun Ho as he is now.

586
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:58,460
I like the man from the life he's had.

587
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,780
 So don't say that stuff from now on. 

588
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,970
 I just really... whatever, I don't know. 

589
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,440
 Then don't do anything. I'll take care of myself. 

590
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,760
For now, act clueless at work. And don't say anything weird to Eun Ho.

591
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,240
 You're totally smitten, aren't you? 

592
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,390
   

593
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,510
Hello.

594
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,450
Are you alone?

595
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:35,120
 Ahjussi, please go to this address. 

596
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,550
What is it regarding? I thought the Migang Law Firm was settled.

597
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,590
Did something go wrong? Do I need to take care of anything?

598
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:54,420
No. We wanted to offer you a new position.

599
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,950
No, it's all right. I'm wrapping things over here too.

600
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,670
I'll stop working and focus on my child for a bit.

601
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,520
Will you stop working altogether?

602
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,980
Is it due to the custody case?

603
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,040
You know quitting work won't help you in the lawsuit.

604
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,630
It might even be a disadvantage.

605
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,720
Yes, I know.

606
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,400
They'll attack me, saying I can't care for him financially.

607
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,080
If I work, they say I lack time for the child.

608
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,470
If I don't, I lack money for the child.

609
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,760
They say I'm not qualified as a mom.

610
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:38,880
I tried my best to do both, but...

611
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,910
So I can keep my child...

612
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:46,050
But my Tae Yun...

613
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,960
said he wants to go to his dad.

614
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,340
He wants to live with his dad.

615
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,280
But I'm not letting that man have him.

616
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,730
I'll keep him somehow.

617
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,530
One second.

618
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,990
Hello?

619
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,290
Tae Yun isn't home yet?

620
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,970
He should be long done at the academy by now.

621
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,340
Got it. Let me call him.

622
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:30,880
Why isn't he picking up? Where did he go?

623
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,610
I don't know what to do.

624
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,520
He must have gone to his dad.

625
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,190
Attorney Jang, calm down.

626
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,110
Hello?

627
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,800
I'm here to meet with CEO Kang Ji Yun.

628
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,810
So you're Attorney Jang Seon Woo's son?

629
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,300
Yes.

630
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:40,050
- Want this? 
 - Thank you.

631
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,990
How did you know our address?

632
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:47,020
I took CEO Kang's name card in my mom's office.

633
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,380
Wow, you're so smart!

634
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,820
You deserve that Yakult. Wow...

635
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,590
Tae Yun!

636
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,630
What happened?

637
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,230
I was so worried about you!

638
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:06,030
I have something to ask CEO Kang.

639
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,880
Me?

640
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,470
Yes.

641
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,350
What is it that you want to ask me?

642
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,390
Please let my mom work.

643
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,390
What do you mean, Tae Yun?

644
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,260
I heard it at your office.

645
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,030
I know you can't work for my sake.

646
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:34,710
I don't want you to quit work for me.

647
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,450
 The babysitter suddenly got sick today, 

648
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,560
 but there was nowhere to take him. 

649
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,340
 So I took him today, and... 

650
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,570
 Here I am at the office with my child. 

651
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,990
 I didn't want to lose my career after I had him so I was greedy. 

652
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,460
 But it appears, in both work and childcare, 

653
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,760
 I can't do anything right. 

654
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,380
 Maybe I have no right to be a mom like my husband said. 

655
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,960
If it weren't for me, you could work.

656
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,120
Is that why you said you wanted to live with Dad?

657
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,610
I'm in your way so...

658
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,260
Tae Yun.

659
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,870
Tae Yun, it's not like that.

660
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,930
How could you be?

661
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,750
Here.

662
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,940
You're the reason I live.

663
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,210
You're the reason...

664
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,670
You're the reason I live.

665
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,790
I'm not in your way?

666
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,550
Then can I live with you?

667
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,550
Of course.

668
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:57,860
Mommy really wants to live with you, too.

669
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,060
Tae Yun, in that case, I think we can help.

670
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,070
He found a perfect job for your mom,

671
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:18,900
where she can work and spend time with you.

672
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,370
   

673
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,980
Taesun Electronics seeks an in-house attorney.

674
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,650
"In-house counsel"?

675
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,630
Yes. You will take a pay cut,

676
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,990
but the company is very interested in land development,

677
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:43,400
and it will help you expand your expertise.

678
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,530
The work hours are short and regular.

679
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,830
You can spend a lot of time with Tae Yun.

680
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,490
   

681
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:00,230
Think it through and let us know.

682
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,230
Thank you for the great offer.

683
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:25,260
I'll try to both protect my career and my child.

684
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,350
I'll be rooting for you.

685
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,650
I'll be rooting for you, too, Secretary Yu. Fighting.

686
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:33,090
Fighting, Tae Yun!

687
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,440
Thank you.

688
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,970
- Get home safe. 
 - Thank you!

689
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:43,390
Bye!

690
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:45,620
How lovely.

691
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,460
So cute.

692
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,380
Good job.

693
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,740
   

694
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,240
   

695
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,230
   

696
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,330
- Hello? 
 - You're not asleep?

697
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,570
 Not yet. 

698
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,650
What are you doing?

699
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,320
I just put Byeol to bed.

700
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,730
 Is she sleeping well? 

701
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:04,450
She's asleep the moment her head hits the pillow. She isn't like me.

702
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:08,240
How do you feel when that happens? Are you disappointed that she's not like you?

703
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,840
 No, I'm more relieved. 

704
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,100
If she took after me fully, it would be a lot of pressure.

705
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,060
 If something went wrong, I'd feel it's my fault. 

706
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,020
I don't think you need to worry about that.

707
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,970
 Byeol is much smarter than you. 

708
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,700
Parents worry needlessly so much.

709
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,830
Attorney Jang, too. Children grow up well.

710
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,590
 Right. I do think I worry too much. 

711
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,460
Do you still struggle to fall asleep?

712
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,270
See? More worrying.

713
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,480
How long have you struggled to fall asleep?

714
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,400
Way too long. I don't even remember when it started.

715
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,710
Do you have bad dreams?

716
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,750
 It's just that... 

717
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:56,230
whenever I dream, I see my late father.

718
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,070
 You must miss him a lot. 

719
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,770
Not really.

720
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,580
I don't really miss him that much.

721
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,070
He wasn't a good dad to me.

722
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,720
 Want me to read to you? 

723
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,820
I'm quite sure I told you I'm not a child.

724
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,330
 It's a book for adults, too. Super boring. 

725
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,650
It's basically a sleep aid.

726
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,380
How boring is it?

727
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,350
Go ahead then.

728
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,930
 I won't let you down. 

729
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:40,320
But later.

730
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,030
- Later? 
  - Yes.  
 - You don't have the book with you?

731
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,660
No.

732
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,430
I just want to talk to you longer.

733
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,360
 Are you tired? 

734
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,090
No. I'm not yet tired at all.

735
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,540
♫  Just like you  ♫

736
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:14,500
♫  A star shining in your eyes  ♫

737
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,000
♫  Just like moon  ♫

738
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,970
♫  Even when darkness falls, it shines  ♫

739
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,330
♫  Just like forever moonlight  ♫

740
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,900
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

741
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:39,380
The boring book didn't work. I'll try a heartwarming book.

742
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,820
It starts with an inspiring phrase.

743
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,980
 "Perhaps comfort is not something that comes to you," 

744
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,970
"but I realized it's something you seek out."

745
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,390
 "I must get closer to comfort," 

746
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,660
 "and I think I must speak to comfort." 

747
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,810
 "Maybe people around me" 

748
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:05,230
 "have been waiting for me to get well enough to bring up something sad." 

749
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:11,490
 "Maybe they've been waiting to offer the comfort they've readied." 

750
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,920
 "This thought made me cry." 

751
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,290
Yes, Chairman.

752
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,310
Tomorrow?

753
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,200
Got it. Okay.

754
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,730
Please clear my schedule tomorrow afternoon.

755
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,940
Got it, but why suddenly?

756
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:57,610
I need to go to an event Chairman Woo is hosting.

757
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:00,980
An event? Tomorrow?

758
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,910
You know how my dad is.

759
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:07,330
He gathers all companies he invested in to brag about his achievements, his network.

760
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,140
I got the call only today.

761
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:12,720
Just go and clap a little.

762
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,880
We can feel it out and leave quickly.

763
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,830
Still, it's really odd to tell us the day before.

764
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:23,790
Is this some kind of investor power play?

765
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:36,850
 The Ministry of Economy and Finance's National Investment Corporation will fill a position. 

766
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:40,070
 Vice President Lee Seok Jin of Yoosung Finance. 

767
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,570
   

768
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,320
 I'll take care of the rest. 

769
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,350
 You just make the recommendation. 

770
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,960
 CEO Kang... 

771
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,390
 You're going in the right direction. 

772
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,090
CEO Kang looks especially irritated today.

773
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,760
I wonder if something's up.

774
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,690
I wonder. All the projects are running smoothly.

775
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:18,470
She doesn't have anything to be upset about.

776
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:22,860
Mr. Lee Gwang Hee. Did you make some kind of mistake?

777
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,010
Manager Kim, why are you picking on Oppa?

778
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,730
"Oppa"?

779
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,480
Oppa?

780
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,820
She meant extra... "extra."

781
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,480
She meant, "Don't be extra."

782
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,500
"Oe-xtra." It's trending these days. Right, Gyeong Hwa?

783
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,660
Yes. "Oe-xtra."

784
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,090
Stop being oe-xtra!

785
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:47,860
Extra? Why did I hear "oppa?" My hearing these days...

786
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,640
I definitely heard the double p.

787
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,700
I thought Gyeong Hwa called Gwang Hee "oppa."

788
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,930
Wh-Why would I do that?

789
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,030
Th-The elevator's here. It's here.

790
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,140
Aren't you two getting in? So extra.

791
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,580
Oh, I left some materials behind.

792
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,570
- Gyu Rim, I need to check it. Wait. 
 - Okay.

793
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,720
- Go ahead. 
 - See you tomorrow!

794
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,440
It's so fun to be extra!

795
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,170
Let's be extra!

796
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,320
Those two, how long will they keep that up?

797
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,170
Just let them be. It's funny.

798
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:43,540
   

799
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,960
   

800
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,850
Is this about tomorrow's event?

801
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:10,330
When I started Peoplez, Chairman Woo helped me a lot.

802
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:15,010
If not for his help, I couldn't have even started.

803
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:19,740
But... it feels like a burden now.

804
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,870
Maybe I'm being ungrateful.

805
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,640
Does he tend to be very involved?

806
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,570
It's not like that, but

807
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:37,050
at this rate, if he decides to, he can do whatever he wants with Peoplez.

808
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,440
You can't let him do that.

809
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:45,170
I started it so it's my responsibility to protect it.

810
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,440
That's my job.

811
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,100
CEO Kang, look at me.

812
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,090
Just think about one thing.

813
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,990
You're the one who started Peoplez and got it to where it is now.

814
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:06,200
No one else in the world can lead Peoplez.

815
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:21,280
You're doing such a good job.

816
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:29,300
So stop worrying... and let me go home.

817
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,990
Everyone left.

818
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,120
   

819
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:57,020
Chairman.

820
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,040
Congratulations.

821
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,840
Thank you. It's all thanks to you, Chairman.

822
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,220
CEO Kang. Over here.

823
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,060
I'll do my best. I won't forget your help.

824
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,730
Father, CEO Kang is here.

825
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:23,300
Hello, Chairman.

826
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,470
You made it, CEO Kang.

827
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,830
I must be late.

828
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:30,620
Welcome, CEO Kim!

829
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:37,080
You know each other well. Have you met Director Woo yet?

830
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,190
A few times. Nice to see you, Director Woo.

831
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,850
Yes. I didn't know you'd be here.

832
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:46,400
The Chairman is helping me a lot these days.

833
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,030
Here, here!

834
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:54,300
I've gathered all of you here tonight to celebrate something.

835
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,960
Director Lee Seok Jin.

836
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,850
Our Director Lee Seok Jin will...

837
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:05,320
lead the National Investment Corporation under the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

838
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,480
- You're starting next week? 
 - Yes, Chairman.

839
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,770
Moving forward, he will be a great help to our members.

840
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:15,150
I'm Lee Seok Jin. Thank you for having me.

841
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,400
Wait, wait, wait!

842
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,180
And CEO Kim...

843
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,840
CEO Kim Hye Jin worked hard on this.

844
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,270
My pleasure.

845
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:32,380
It's my job to recommend the right candidate for the position.

846
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:35,610
If you have other great candidates, let me know anytime.

847
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,980
Everyone, recommend some!

848
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:44,260
All right! Let's toast to the infinite growth of our members.

849
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,340
Cheers!

850
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,860
 Cheers! 

851
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:57,630
I thought CEO Kang took care of your business, Chairman Woo.

852
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,610
Is CEO Kang not as good as she used to be?

853
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:03,650
If she was no good, she would be gone long ago.

854
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,990
But I can't turn my back on her.

855
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:10,200
All she has to trust is her own brain.

856
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,430
If you need someone, ask CEO Kang.

857
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,820
Chairman Park, weren't you looking for a son-in-law?

858
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:23,450
CEO Kang, why don't you find a son-in-law for Chairman Park?

859
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,160
What? You do that kind of thing too?

860
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:29,230
Can you find me a professional golfer I can take lessons from?

861
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:32,450
Preferably someone decent-looking.

862
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,260
You'll have to pay her a hefty fee.

863
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,160
- Father. 
 - What is a headhunter anyway?

864
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,830
Someone you pay to find a person you need.

865
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:45,200
Isn't that right, CEO Kang?

866
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:59,100
Seeing you still misunderstand what I do, I should work harder.

867
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:09,110
I'm sorry. That's not my expertise.

868
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,590
CEO Kang, don't be so serious.

869
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:19,470
Let me handle it. I'll find someone you'd like.

870
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,670
I'm sorry, but I have plans. I'll get going.

871
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:27,580
Sure, go ahead.

872
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,880
Stay until the end.

873
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,720
This is my event.

874
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:41,170
I think you're smart enough to know your place, CEO Kang.

875
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,340
Here!

876
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,290
Give her a glass.

877
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,130
Drink.

878
01:06:56,210 --> 01:07:01,040
♫  Come to me  ♫

879
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,580
I'm Yu Eun Ho, CEO Kang Ji Yun's assistant.

880
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:11,920
I'm sorry. I didn't organize her schedule efficiently.

881
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,990
She has to go to her next meeting right now.

882
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,530
You're way too loyal.

883
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:25,750
You should know better than to intervene right now.

884
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,510
I'm sorry if I was rude,

885
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:33,650
but I learned that an assistant must first be loyal to the boss.

886
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:43,250
Let's go, Ms. CEO.

887
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:46,280
♫  Show me everything and our something  ♫

888
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:51,270
♫  Never, ever, you can come right to me  ♫

889
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:54,310
♫  My heart is heading to you  ♫

890
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:58,720
   

891
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:05,650
♫  Just trust me whenever; just trust me whenever  ♫

892
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:14,460
♫  Just trust me whenever; just trust me whenever  ♫

893
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:24,010


894
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,950
 You don't have to be perfect. It's okay to look pathetic. 

895
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:33,250
 I'll be by your side, no matter what you're like. 

896
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,370
 CEO Min Jeong Hyeok 

897
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:36,730
  runs a very successful interior design firm. 

898
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:38,510
 Do you have time for dinner? 

899
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:41,020
 I wonder if our CEO would be interested in him. 

900
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,800
 - Do you two know each other? 
 - We're buddies. 

901
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,130
 - One-sided— 
 - No, no! 

902
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,790
 How do you know Su Hyeon? 

903
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,140
 What a taste you have in women. Do you even know how she is? 

904
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,440
 I got a text saying he's not coming in. 

905
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,470
 Did something happen? 

906
01:08:55,470 --> 01:09:00,020
 Today... I paid my respects to your father, Ji Yun. 

907
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:04,570
♫  Embrace me  ♫
