00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,640
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:57,314 --> 00:01:58,914
Why did you come back so early?

4
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,673
Because someone might need me.

5
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:06,834
Thank you for your concern.

6
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:12,946
But it's a rare opportunity

7
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:15,145
to meet the noblemen
from the Central Plains.

8
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:17,306
If you don't seize it,

9
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,466
don't blame me
if you regret it in the future.

10
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,344
Today's goal has been achieved.

11
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:22,586
It's bad to overdo it.

12
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:26,186
I heard that you went shopping today.

13
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:28,065
Did you enjoy it?

14
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:36,306
I suddenly want

15
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:39,946
to wear a beautiful dress.

16
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,856
Is it because of Tushan Jing?

17
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:50,145
It has nothing to do with him.

18
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,386
So, why?

19
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:54,666
I've been a man for so many years.

20
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:57,265
I almost forgot that I'm a girl.

21
00:02:58,705 --> 00:02:59,826
Sometimes,

22
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,625
I want to wear a beautiful dress.

23
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,307
Isn't that simple?

24
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:14,866
Our grandmother
controls the world's silkworms.

25
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:17,866
The most exquisite silk and clothing

26
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:19,986
in this world come from her disciples.

27
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,547
I will have them make
beautiful dresses for you.

28
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:26,866
But,

29
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,506
I'm afraid to wear a beautiful dress.

30
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,027
I'm afraid I won't be used to it.

31
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:35,467
What is your concern?

32
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:39,107
I'm different from Nian and Xinyue.

33
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,786
I'm afraid I will disappoint you.

34
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:47,307
Because of that,

35
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:49,747
I will be disappointed.

36
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,547
Who are you referring to?

37
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:55,747
If it refers to me and Master,

38
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:57,586
we will never be disappointed in you.

39
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:01,346
But if you mean someone else...

40
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:04,467
Xiaoyao, don't give yourself hope,

41
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:06,387
and there will be no disappointment.

42
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:11,547
I was expecting better ideas.

43
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:16,147
Stop overthinking. Have a rest.

44
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,987
We've spent too much time in Zhiyi.

45
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:21,587
After daybreak tomorrow,

46
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,587
we will set off for Mount Jade.

47
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,587
Put the unhappy things

48
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:27,186
behind you.

49
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:29,147
Okay.

50
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:40,466
Wen Xiaoliu can accompany Xuan
to Mount Jade.

51
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:41,306
Why can't I go with him?

52
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:43,776
I got a letter from Master.

53
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:45,984
He asked me to take you back to Haoling.

54
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:49,504
Father has allowed me
to go out with Xuan.

55
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:51,506
So why call me back suddenly?

56
00:04:57,306 --> 00:05:00,506
Did you tell on me to my father?

57
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:02,346
How could I?

58
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,906
Cang Xuan will go to Mount Jade
for business.

59
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,947
So, he won't have time
to take you around.

60
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:09,626
I'm here for fun?

61
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:11,306
I'm here to help.

62
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:13,987
You are not helping.

63
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,107
What can you do here?

64
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,427
What are you mumbling about?

65
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:18,786
Nothing.

66
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:20,867
I'm praising you.

67
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,506
Jing. Fenglong
made you drink a lot last night.

68
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,267
I'm worried you'll have a hangover,

69
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,466
so I made you something for sobering up.

70
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,427
I didn't know you were changing.
I'll get out of here.

71
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,466
Master. I was just away for a moment.

72
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,786
I didn't expect Miss Fangfeng
would break in without permission.

73
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:24,066
Don't let it happen.

74
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:24,707
Yes.

75
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:35,186
I noticed she didn't look well.

76
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:38,547
She saw the wounds on you.

77
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:40,707
I hope so.

78
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:45,786
The sooner she realizes

79
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,626
I'm not the ideal husband
as she imagined,

80
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:49,547
the sooner she can find a better man.

81
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:58,746
Miss. What happened?

82
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:06,427
Xuanzhou, if someone tormented you
for years,

83
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,387
making you covered with wounds,

84
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:10,667
will you forget that?

85
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:12,267
Absolutely not.

86
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:14,466
If you survived

87
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:16,147
and returned safely,

88
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:17,147
what would you do?

89
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:19,968
I would revenge myself
on the person who harmed me.

90
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,226
Let him experience the pain
I've suffered.

91
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:26,506
That's it.

92
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:29,947
Having suffered the torment
and humiliation,

93
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,306
how could he possibly forget?

94
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,387
He must be back for revenge.

95
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:39,506
He's so troublesome.

96
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,186
He survived
even when he was badly injured.

97
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:43,987
Why did he come back?

98
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,306
Xuanzhou, pack up immediately.

99
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,827
We'll hurry back to Qingqiu.

100
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,107
Aren't we leaving with junior master?

101
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,066
Tushan Jing doesn't want
to travel with me.

102
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:06,306
And I'm sick of seeing him again.

103
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:08,867
Let's go our own way.

104
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:12,096
(Tushan Mansion)

105
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:48,064
Hou.

106
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:50,746
I miss you very much.

107
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:53,312
So do I.

108
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:58,506
With a perfect man
like Tushan Jing by your side,

109
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:01,907
would you still remember Tushan Hou

110
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:03,506
who is not as good as him in every way?

111
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:04,546
Hou,

112
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:06,707
don't you know my feelings for you?

113
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,426
Why are you saying such things
to upset me?

114
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:12,096
No matter how others think of you two,

115
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,866
he isn't as good as you in any way.

116
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,347
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,707
I shouldn't say that.

118
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,186
I'm just jealous of him.

119
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,827
That is because he can possess you.

120
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,707
Tushan Jing wanted
to break off the engagement.

121
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:34,626
Since I don't like him,

122
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,426
why not I agree?

123
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:40,666
Do you know the reason?

124
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,027
Who knows?

125
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:46,947
Has he fallen for another woman?

126
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,546
My younger brother is picky about women.

127
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,746
Ordinary women can't catch his eye.

128
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,866
He doesn't even like you.

129
00:09:58,387 --> 00:09:59,387
Who else could he like?

130
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:03,147
It makes me feel disgusted
to look at his body.

131
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:08,066
Perhaps he's sensible of it.

132
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,347
So, he doesn't want
to humiliate himself.

133
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:12,546
Exactly.

134
00:10:13,587 --> 00:10:16,186
Tushan Jing
is no longer the Master Qingqiu.

135
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:23,947
Hou, I don't want to marry him.

136
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,027
I also don't.

137
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:38,746
But bear with it.

138
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,306
I will take back everything
that belongs to me,

139
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:44,986
including you.

140
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:49,106
Tushan Jing has complex thoughts.

141
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:51,746
He's being quiet.

142
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,496
He must be planning for a deadly blow.

143
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:56,546
You should be careful.

144
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:58,066
Don't worry.

145
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:01,587
Since I could destroy him once,

146
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:04,707
I can do it again.

147
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,984
(Mount Jade)

148
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,506
Hundreds of years have passed.

149
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:53,666
The scenery here
is exactly the same as when I left.

150
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,587
It seems time has stopped at Mount Jade.

151
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,147
Plants are flourishing here,

152
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,907
and flowers always bloom.

153
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,186
It is the paradise that people dream of.

154
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:22,066
Mother,

155
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:26,746
where are you exactly?

156
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:31,186
Father,

157
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:33,306
Xuan,

158
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,947
when will you come to pick me up?

159
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,186
One day.

160
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,746
Two days.

161
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,787
23,581 days.

162
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,426
23,582 days.

163
00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:05,907
If I could choose again,

164
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:09,066
I would still choose
to escape from here.

165
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:11,027
I'd prefer to drift from place to place

166
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,787
rather than enjoy
the deathlike tranquility.

167
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:21,907
The Queen Mother is waiting for you.

168
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:43,626
Greetings, Queen Mother.

169
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:51,261
(Queen Mother)

170
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:56,707
Master.

171
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,426
Get up.

172
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:30,027
As long as you stay in Mount Jade,

173
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,986
I can recover your mighty spirit power.

174
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:39,267
I only have less than 200 years to live.

175
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:41,186
If you want,

176
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,147
you can be the next Queen Mother,

177
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,666
being in charge of Mount Jade.

178
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,267
Does she have to stay
to recover her spirit power?

179
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:52,626
Yes.

180
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,066
I would rather be like I am now,

181
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:59,227
knowing what will happen tomorrow,

182
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,426
but not knowing about it next year.

183
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:03,866
It will be neither too exciting

184
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:05,947
nor too boring.

185
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:09,387
As you wish.

186
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:28,106
I can't remove the Rejuvenating Flower
from your body,

187
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:31,426
but I can restore your look.

188
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,907
The Flower is a rare weapon
of Mount Jade.

189
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,947
Why can't you remove it?

190
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:37,467
In this world,

191
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:39,306
there are many things

192
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,186
I can't do.

193
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:44,467
So when can I restore my look?

194
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,027
Enter the water.

No.

00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:13,587
What's wrong?

242
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:18,666
Xuan?

243
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:25,347
Nothing.

244
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:36,587
Thank you for restoring my look.

245
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,947
Now the Rejuvenating Flower in your body

246
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:42,867
only has the effect of retaining beauty,

247
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:44,107
but has no power for changes.

248
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,707
If possible,

249
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:49,747
its power could be restored.

250
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:52,827
I've had enough of transformation.

251
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:54,867
I don't care about that.

252
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:56,786
I was entrusted to take care of you.

253
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:59,146
I haven't fulfilled my responsibility,

254
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,707
but now you've grown up.

255
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:04,146
If you don't want to stay,

256
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,947
take care of yourself.

257
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,426
I will, Master.

258
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's go back to Wushen Mountain.

259
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:32,987
Okay.

260
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,632
(Haoling, Wushen Mountain)

261
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,248
Why are you hiding behind Cang Xuan?

262
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:00,160
You have always
wanted to restore your look.

263
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,417
Now it happens.
But you're afraid to see me?

264
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:08,738
I-I'm a bit nervous,

265
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:10,537
I'm not ready yet.

266
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:16,777
So when will you be ready?

267
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,497
Very soon.

268
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:47,257
I remember when I was little,
I looked quite like you.

269
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:49,897
But I don't know why.

270
00:24:50,818 --> 00:24:54,698
Now I don't look like you,
nor like my mother.

271
00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:57,257
I don't hope you resemble your mother,

272
00:24:58,257 --> 00:24:59,698
nor do I dream of you looking like me.

273
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:02,458
I just hope you are healthy.

274
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:07,137
Now you are healthy and beautiful.

275
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:09,698
I am happy about it.

276
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:19,537
All fathers in the world think

277
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:22,058
their daughters are the most beautiful.

278
00:25:34,377 --> 00:25:37,818
Father, what are you thinking about?

279
00:25:40,578 --> 00:25:41,218
Nothing.

280
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,777
How time flies.

281
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,417
My little girl has grown up,
and I am getting old.

282
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:48,978
Let me see.

283
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:53,497
You're still as young as before.

284
00:25:53,738 --> 00:25:54,698
You never change.

285
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:56,297
Am I right, Cang Xuan?

286
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:58,537
Yes, Xiaoyao is right.

287
00:25:59,017 --> 00:25:59,818
Master is still young.

288
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:16,537
Why haven't father and Xuan come yet?

289
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:20,338
They have things to do. Be patient.

290
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,497
Your Majesty.

291
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:35,897
Father. Xuan.

292
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:49,280
Have a seat.

293
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,297
Father, who is she?

294
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:15,978
Why can she sit here?

295
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:24,288
She is my eldest daughter Jiuyao.

296
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:34,177
Xiaoyao, curtsy to Consort Jing'an.

297
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,858
Greetings, Your Highness.

298
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:03,098
Nian, curtsy to your sister.

299
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:07,578
Why should I?

300
00:28:07,657 --> 00:28:09,458
I don't have a sister.
She is not my sister.

301
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:13,858
Are you really my father's daughter
with another woman?

302
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:14,978
Nian,

303
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,578
Xiaoyao's mother
is the person I admire most.

304
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:21,497
She was the disciple of Xiling Xie,
the Queen of Xiyan.

305
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:23,777
She was also the bravest
Princess General.

306
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:25,978
Master married her

307
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:27,818
with the grandest ceremony.

308
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:29,657
She is one of the family.

309
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:31,657
You speak up for her.

310
00:28:32,297 --> 00:28:34,738
What about me?

311
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:37,938
Master is like my father.

312
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:41,537
I practically watched you grow up.

313
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:43,978
You are also one of the family.

314
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:52,738
Who will you speak up for

315
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,657
between her and me?

316
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:11,978
Answer me.

317
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:19,897
Tell me what you will do?

318
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:32,777
I hope you and Xiaoyao get along well.

319
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,417
Don't be silly.

320
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:42,177
If I ask you

321
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,738
who you like better
between your mother and me,

322
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:47,218
can you make a decision?

323
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:53,537
Nian.

324
00:29:55,297 --> 00:29:56,578
Xiaoyao is Xiaoliu.

325
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,257
When we parted in Zhiyi,

326
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:01,417
you secretly told me

327
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,338
you thought Xiaoliu was not bad.

328
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,338
With your personality,

329
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,098
if you say so,

330
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:09,698
it means you think Xiaoliu is good.

331
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:12,897
You have a good sister
to care for you with me.

332
00:30:13,657 --> 00:30:14,458
Aren't you happy?

333
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,377
I don't want any sister.

334
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:34,657
Things happened suddenly.

335
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:37,377
Nian still needs time to accept it.

336
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:42,978
Guiwen.

337
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:45,600
Yes.

338
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,297
Send some food to princess.

339
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:51,058
Yes.

340
00:30:57,497 --> 00:31:00,058
Father, do you still have the appetite?

341
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,978
Do you know how many things happen
in a country every day?

342
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:07,818
If I could not eat
because of such things,

343
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:09,858
I would have starved to death.

344
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:42,058
Princess, be careful not
to hurt yourself.

345
00:31:42,377 --> 00:31:43,698
You tell my father

346
00:31:44,218 --> 00:31:45,818
not to send the food anymore.

347
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:46,738
I won't eat.

348
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:49,098
Where is my father?

349
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:53,458
His Majesty
is accompanying Great Princess.

350
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:57,218
Get out, all of you!

351
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:50,816
(Mingse Hall)

352
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:58,257
What else do you need?

353
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:01,377
You have prepared anything I need.

354
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:05,600
But this house is a bit small.

355
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:07,897
My place is close to Xuan's.

356
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:10,137
Father, I'm afraid of nothing

357
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,417
but loneliness.

358
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,458
I want to be closer to Xuan.

359
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:15,657
Alright.

360
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:20,058
Father, this place is really nice.

361
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:23,618
I have wandered around for many years
and have developed many habits.

362
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:24,938
I like to eat,

363
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,818
because delicious food
is the most practical.

364
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:31,257
And I can sleep anywhere.

365
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:33,218
I know possessions are hard to carry,

366
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,218
so I don't have a material desire.

367
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:38,257
Xiaoyao, you are no longer a wanderer.

368
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:44,578
I know. I have come back to you.

369
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:47,738
But my old habits are not bad at all.

370
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:51,058
Moreover, habits formed in youth

371
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:52,818
are almost impossible to change.

372
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:55,297
The deity has a long life.

373
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:57,098
Nothing is impossible.

374
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,417
I will make you get used to everything
that belongs to you.

375
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,458
You can replace old habits
with new ones.

376
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,178
Alright.

377
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:16,017
Different people have their duties.

378
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:18,237
They do their own jobs

379
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,497
in a ceremony.

380
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:21,937
When the bell rings,

381
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:25,457
the attendants help princess
out of the curtain,

382
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:26,497
and step on the stairs.

383
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:56,457
Princess performs obeisance.

384
00:34:57,457 --> 00:35:00,058
Princess, be sure to stand straight.

385
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:03,977
Raise your hands to forehead.

386
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:10,898
Make a bow, parallel with the ground.

387
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:17,618
Straighten up.

388
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:21,578
Kneel down.

389
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:26,138
Raise your hands to forehead.

390
00:35:29,178 --> 00:35:29,858
Kowtow.

391
00:35:30,977 --> 00:35:33,178
Palms on the ground,
and forehead on palm.

392
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:34,898
Straighten up.

393
00:35:37,297 --> 00:35:39,578
Princess, your hands are not
in the right place.

394
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,896
Let's do it again.

395
00:35:41,297 --> 00:35:42,560
Raise your hand to your forehead.

396
00:35:44,618 --> 00:35:48,098
Kowtow. Palms on the ground,
and forehead on palm.

397
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:50,418
Straighten up.

398
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:57,297
My knees really hurt.

399
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:58,977
Can you cast a magic spell on me

400
00:35:58,977 --> 00:36:00,937
to prevent knee pain?

401
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,618
I've been kneeling for so long.
It really hurts.

402
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:05,977
That's inappropriate.

403
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,737
Forget it.

404
00:36:15,378 --> 00:36:17,858
Princess. You made a mistake.

405
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:19,818
I've practiced for two hours.

406
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:21,297
I think it's enough.

407
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:24,737
The celebration is a national event.

408
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:26,178
There can't be a single mistake.

409
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:29,017
I know. But let me rest for a while.

410
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:31,178
Can I? I'm exhausted.

411
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,217
Princess. Please mind your manners.

412
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:38,178
There are no outsiders here.

413
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:39,378
Don't be afraid.

414
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:41,138
Sit. Let's take a break.

415
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:42,058
You also take a break.

416
00:36:42,138 --> 00:36:43,818
Sit, please.

417
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:46,497
Take a break.

418
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:49,457
Your Highness.

419
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,098
I heard father is inviting all the clans
in Dahuang over

420
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:57,378
to announce you to the world.

421
00:36:58,058 --> 00:36:59,257
Are you happy now?

422
00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:02,178
Yes. I'm going to cry

423
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,338
with happiness.

424
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:05,658
You horrible woman.

425
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:07,658
You've badgered my father,
and you live next to Xuan.

426
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,178
You stick around.

427
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,178
I'll hit you.

428
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:11,618
Princess.

429
00:37:14,937 --> 00:37:16,297
His Majesty is busy with court affairs.

430
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:18,697
It's been a while
he hasn't heard you play the zither.

431
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:20,578
So he ordered me to invite you over.

432
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,217
Did you get hurt, Great Princess?

433
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:37,457
I'm fine.

434
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:41,058
I hope you could forgive Second Princess

435
00:37:41,777 --> 00:37:43,217
for the sake of His Majesty.

436
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:45,858
I've said I'm fine.

437
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:47,457
You go check on her right away.

438
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:50,378
You're magnanimous.

439
00:37:50,858 --> 00:37:52,658
It's a blessing
for Nian and His Majesty.

440
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,898
The pharmacy has been arranged
according to your request.

441
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:19,737
What else do you need?

442
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,098
Good. Not bad.

443
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:34,297
I heard you asked for
precious medicinal materials.

444
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:36,818
Are you going to study medicine again?

445
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:39,937
I'm not.

446
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:41,937
I'm doing it for self-defense.

447
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:45,378
Why?

448
00:38:46,138 --> 00:38:47,658
My spirit power is too weak.

449
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:50,418
Nian can even push me down easily.

450
00:38:51,257 --> 00:38:53,777
I need to protect myself.

451
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:56,858
Medicine is the only thing
I can be proud of.

452
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:00,618
I originally wanted to say
you don't have to work so hard.

453
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:03,257
I'll protect you.

454
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:10,138
But I realize
I have no confidence to say that.

455
00:39:15,378 --> 00:39:16,138
Cang Xuan.

456
00:39:16,977 --> 00:39:17,977
No matter when,

457
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:19,338
I don't want to be your burden.

458
00:39:20,537 --> 00:39:21,658
You protect yourself,

459
00:39:22,017 --> 00:39:23,338
and I protect myself.

460
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:26,697
That's the greatest protection
for each other.

461
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,017
You've never been my burden.

462
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:32,378
Instead, I have always dragged you down.

463
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:33,658
What are you talking about?

464
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:35,818
That's not true.

465
00:39:36,338 --> 00:39:38,977
We're in the same boat.

466
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:50,257
Since King of Haoling
ascended to the throne,

467
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:53,898
he has been keeping a low profile.

468
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:55,697
But this time,

469
00:39:56,138 --> 00:39:59,537
he has sent out invitations

470
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,578
to all the clans in Dahuang,

471
00:40:02,297 --> 00:40:03,697
inviting them

472
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:06,537
to come to Haoling Kingdom

473
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,537
(Luochang Clothing)
|to attend the return celebration

474
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:12,697
of Great Princess of Haoling.

475
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,658
This shows the deep love

476
00:40:15,658 --> 00:40:20,618
King of Haoling has for Great Princess.

477
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,098
Great.

478
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,378
Great Princess
has such a legendary experience,

479
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,418
drifting around for hundreds of years.

480
00:40:31,977 --> 00:40:33,600
Maybe she's been to Qingshui Town

481
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,977
and ate the meat buns I made.

482
00:40:35,178 --> 00:40:37,737
Well, she must not be interested
in my small clinic.

483
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,138
Otherwise, I could brag about it.

484
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:41,658
Put up a sign

485
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:44,058
saying princess was treated here
when she was in trouble.

486
00:41:01,178 --> 00:41:04,737
(Since King of Haoling
ascended to the throne,)

487
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:08,338
(he has been keeping a low profile.)

488
00:41:08,937 --> 00:41:10,138
(But this time,)

489
00:41:10,658 --> 00:41:13,457
(he has sent out invitations)

490
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:16,017
(to all the clans in Dahuang,)

491
00:41:16,378 --> 00:41:17,858
(inviting them)

492
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:20,658
(to come to Haoling Kingdom)

493
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,058
(to attend the return celebration)

494
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:27,058
(of Great Princess of Haoling.)

495
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:29,017
(So,)

496
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:32,058
(it shows the deep love)

497
00:41:32,418 --> 00:41:34,697
(King of Haoling has
for Great Princess.)

498
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,257
I am just an abandoned person.

499
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:43,217
I can't protect myself.

500
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:46,338
I have nobody to rely on.

501
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:49,658
I have nowhere to go.

502
00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:04,818
You can't protect yourself.

503
00:42:07,008 --> 00:42:08,178
You have nobody to rely on

504
00:42:10,257 --> 00:42:11,378
and nowhere to go.

505
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:16,898
