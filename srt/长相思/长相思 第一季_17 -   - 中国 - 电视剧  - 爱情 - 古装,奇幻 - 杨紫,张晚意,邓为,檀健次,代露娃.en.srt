=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,512
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:56,443
Can you do this yourself?

4
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,443
I can.

5
00:01:59,003 --> 00:01:59,643
Remember.

6
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:01,562
No matter what happens, don't come out.

7
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:02,282
Hide well.

8
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:18,802
Everything settled?

9
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:22,843
Yes.

10
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:24,043
Thank you.

11
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,683
We are family. No need for formalities.

12
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:28,082
It's getting late.

13
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:29,242
We should go back.

14
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,403
Let's go back then.

15
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:31,963
What a disappointing night.

16
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:39,442
Wait.

17
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:53,123
Xiaoliu?

18
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:59,483
Give me a hand.

19
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:00,522
Here.

20
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:03,362
Slowly.

21
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,162
You're very brave.

22
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:33,963
Don't be scared. It's okay now.

23
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:35,802
I always carry herbs on me.

24
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,923
Creatures like snakes and insects
don't dare to approach me.

25
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:40,323
Stay close to me.

26
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:41,642
You won't be scared.

27
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:43,602
Follow me.

28
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,763
Come on. Keep up with me.

29
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:55,442
Watch out.

30
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:56,642
Are you okay?

31
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,680
Watch your step and walk slowly.

32
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:04,963
Aren't you scared?

33
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:07,002
I am.

34
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:10,080
The first time I walked
through the wilderness at night,

35
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:11,563
I was scared to tears.

36
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:13,442
And then?

37
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:15,442
Later I realized

38
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:18,443
even if I cry,
I have to walk my own path.

39
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:19,922
I can't escape it in the end.

40
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:22,163
Instead of shedding tears,

41
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,762
it's better to open your eyes wide

42
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:25,443
and see the road ahead clearly.

43
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:37,603
What's wrong? Let's keep going.

44
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,003
Coming.

45
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:42,642
Slowly.

46
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,482
Somebody, somebody!

47
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,322
Someone!

48
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,163
We're coming.

49
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:09,563
Let me see.

50
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:19,042
It's okay. All limbs are intact,

51
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:20,928
and no injuries.

52
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:23,403
As long as you're here,

53
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,082
I know there won't be peace.

54
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:27,123
Either small or big,

55
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,683
but there couldn't possibly be peace.

56
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:31,522
Xuan is missing.

57
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:33,184
Send people to find him now.

58
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:34,403
What happened?

59
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,322
Tell me the whole story,
from beginning to end.

60
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:43,883
That's what happened.

61
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:46,322
Quickly find a way to bring Xuan back.

62
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:49,683
Do you know who attacked him?

63
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,362
I don't know.

64
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:52,922
The one attacked him is Fangfeng Yiying.

65
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:54,642
It's her?

66
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:57,202
Is she famous?

67
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:58,403
Which family is she from?

68
00:05:58,482 --> 00:05:59,482
How come I don't know her?

69
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:02,322
She is the lady from Fangfeng Family.

70
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,482
Fangfeng Family is nothing,

71
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:05,163
but Fangfeng Yiying

72
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,522
is the fiancee
of Master Qingqiu, Tushan Jing.

73
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,482
What? This is outrageous.

74
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:12,922
I have to go
to the Tushan Family and ask

75
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:15,163
if they want all of their businesses
in Haoling to close down.

76
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:18,443
Although Miss Fangfeng
started the fight,

77
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:20,802
she was standing up for that miss.

78
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,563
Even if this matter escalates,

79
00:06:22,922 --> 00:06:24,683
it is just a conflict
between that miss and you.

80
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,163
Besides, you didn't
reveal your identities,

81
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:29,443
so you can't blame them
for unintentionally hurting you.

82
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,443
That's right.

83
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,202
Now

84
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,922
it's not the time to go after someone.

85
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:35,443
We should quickly find out

86
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:36,683
where Cang Xuan went.

87
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,762
As long as we can find Miss Fangfeng,

88
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:49,603
we will definitely find
Cang Xuan's whereabouts.

89
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:51,202
I will handle this matter.

90
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:55,003
Nian, you go take a bath first

91
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:56,603
and change into clean clothes.

92
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:04,642
Ru Shou, be more efficient
with your tasks,

93
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,202
or I'll tell my father to hit you.

94
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:15,163
You let the princess leave

95
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:16,883
because you have instructions for me?

96
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:20,642
Be careful of Miss Fangfeng.

97
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:21,723
I suspect

98
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:23,843
she wasn't just avenging
her good friend.

99
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,603
She recognized Cang Xuan.

100
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:28,322
Thank you for reminding me.

101
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:29,683
I will be vigilant.

102
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:30,723
Once there is news,

103
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:32,762
I will send someone to notify you.

104
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:34,963
Thank you.

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,112
(Chenrong Mansion, Zhiyi City)

106
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,163
Fortunately, it was only
a shoulder wound.

107
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:33,682
It didn't hit any vital parts.

108
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:51,762
Do you think this bamboo flute is his?

109
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:54,363
We can ask when he wakes up.

110
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:58,163
I hope we didn't save the wrong person.

111
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:04,002
You're awake.

112
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:08,923
Where am I?

113
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,522
Don't get up, or you
may tear your wound.

114
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,082
This is the Chenrong Mansion.

115
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:15,682
Chenrong Mansion?

116
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,448
May I ask if Chenrong Yi is...?

117
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:22,562
Chenrong Yi is my father.

118
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:23,882
My name is Chenrong Xinyue.

119
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,363
Our young lady saved you

120
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:29,682
and called a physician
to treat your wound.

121
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:34,442
Thank you, Miss Chenrong.

122
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:38,002
Is this yours?

123
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:40,442
Yes, this is mine.

124
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:44,363
I thought I lost it
when I fell into the water.

125
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:48,082
Is it you who was playing
the flute on the lake?

126
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:48,882
It was me.

127
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,283
Because I heard someone
playing the guqin.

128
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:54,283
The skill was so exquisite

129
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,043
that I couldn't resist

130
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,122
playing the flute in harmony.

131
00:09:58,522 --> 00:10:00,483
Why did you suddenly stop?

132
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:02,522
My sister was motivated by mischief

133
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:04,082
and took away the flute.

134
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:07,363
I see.

135
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,122
How did you know about this?

136
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:15,202
Could it be that you were the one
who played the guqin?

137
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:20,002
It was really you?

138
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,283
What is your name, sir,
and where are you from?

139
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:28,202
I'm Xuan, from Haoling's Dragon Squad.

140
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,882
You are from Haoling,

141
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:31,963
but you don't know how to swim?

142
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:37,163
I've been here for a while.

143
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,243
My family will definitely worry.

144
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,082
I'll leave now

145
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:43,043
and visit you another day
for my gratitude.

146
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:46,002
The physician said
you'd better rest and not move.

147
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,202
You should stay here to recover.

148
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,843
If you don't want your family worried,

149
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:53,642
I'll have someone
deliver a message for you.

150
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:02,122
Thank you.

151
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:04,522
Sorry for the trouble, Miss Chenrong.

152
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:08,322
Miss,

153
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:12,562
after Miss Chenrong leaves,

154
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:15,122
I will find an opportunity
to assassinate Xiyan Cang Xuan.

155
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,483
No, this is the Chenrong Mansion.

156
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:20,603
Don't act rashly.

157
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:22,483
Yes.

158
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:30,122
Xinyue,

159
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,122
how is this gentleman's injury?

160
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:35,603
The physician said it was not serious.

161
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:37,082
This is Miss Fangfeng.

162
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,762
Yiying, this is Xuan
from Haoling's Dragon Squad.

163
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:42,082
Mr. Xuan.

164
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:44,522
It was all my fault for injuring you
in a moment of anger.

165
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:46,762
Please forgive me.

166
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:48,082
No big deal.

167
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,963
It was not only your fault.
I was wrong too.

168
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:00,122
Since his injury is not serious,

169
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:01,202
why hasn't Xuan come back yet?

170
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:05,682
Miss Chenrong invited him
to stay in the mansion to recover.

171
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:08,923
Then why doesn't he come back but stay

172
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:10,202
at a stranger's place to recover?

173
00:12:10,603 --> 00:12:11,403
And you.

174
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,043
Why not ask him to come back?

175
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:16,122
Am I such an insensitive person?

176
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:22,682
And you.

177
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:25,043
All you know is to eat.

178
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:26,522
He shouldn't have treated you so well.

179
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:28,002
Isn't he alright?

180
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:29,163
Are you serious?

181
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:31,243
Chenrong Xinyue
is a vile woman, full of schemes.

182
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:32,483
Who knows what she wants?

183
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,322
Aren't you worried at all?

184
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:42,642
Yes, we're very worried.

185
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,562
Thank you, sir,
for agreeing to play with me.

186
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:53,923
Miss Chenrong, you're too polite.

187
00:12:54,562 --> 00:12:55,923
Compared to your favor
of saving my life,

188
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,002
playing a song is just small-fry.

189
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:01,002
The flowers in the garden
are in full bloom today.

190
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:02,882
I'll take you around.

191
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,243
It's time for me to take my medicine.

192
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:06,803
I need to go back to my room now.

193
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:08,843
Then next time.

194
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,522
This way, please.

195
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,562
Mr. Xuan is handsome,

196
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:26,642
talented,

197
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:27,963
and speaks with great erudition.

198
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,442
He is very compatible with you.

199
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:35,522
Although the four squads in Haoling
are similar to

200
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,002
the six families in the Central Plains

201
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:38,923
and have a high status in Haoling,

202
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:42,442
Mr. Xuan is just an ordinary member
of the Dragon Squad.

203
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,723
As a noble lady,

204
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:46,642
even if you don't marry a prince,

205
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,642
at least you should marry
the head of a family.

206
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,363
No matter how good Mr. Xuan is,

207
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,442
he's not worthy of you.

208
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:53,762
You talk too much.

209
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:13,522
You want to talk to me?

210
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:17,603
Do you still remember
we came out this time

211
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,202
to help Xuan with serious matters?

212
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:20,803
I do.

213
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:22,642
If you do, hurry up and bring Xuan back.

214
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,322
Cang Xuan must have
a reason for not coming back.

215
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,043
I think it's better...

216
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:29,562
Better what?

217
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:31,562
If he doesn't come back,
won't you persuade him?

218
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:33,762
Even if you become
an official in Haoling,

219
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,603
you will be a sycophantic one.

220
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:40,192
You can't tolerate
a frank and outspoken adviser, can you?

221
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:41,043
What did you say?

222
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:42,363
Nothing.

223
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:43,723
You're right.

224
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:45,882
I'll go and bring Cang Xuan back now.

225
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:54,122
That's more like it.

226
00:14:58,642 --> 00:14:59,803
Where's Wen Xiaoliu?

227
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:01,603
He hasn't shown up all afternoon.

228
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,784
Even if I call Shiqi again,

229
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:01,843
no one will appear by my side.

230
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:07,843
I'm here.

231
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:18,803
This is Zhiyi City.

232
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,202
Aren't you afraid of being followed?

233
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,600
My ancestors
are the nine-tailed deity foxes.

234
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,963
Only I can track others.

235
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,882
Very few people can track me.

236
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:51,843
Why did you come to Zhiyi City?

237
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:53,403
I came...

238
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:00,082
I'm here to handle
a very important matter.

239
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,363
I'll tell you about it later.

240
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,283
Okay.

241
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:06,523
I also have a very important matter
to tell you later.

242
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,082
Then we'll tell each other together.

243
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:10,483
Alright.

244
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,003
I have to go.

245
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,282
When are you going back?

246
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:25,763
I should be heading back too.

247
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:26,963
Then go ahead.

248
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:28,523
Why?

249
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,643
I want you to see me when you look back.

250
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:33,723
I don't want you to feel
that parting is lonely.

251
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:40,603
Alright, I'll leave first then.

252
00:17:56,603 --> 00:18:00,643
(Tushan Jing, are you truly calculating
or simply foolish?)

253
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:46,496
(Inn)

254
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:50,243
Alright, my wound doesn't hurt anymore.

255
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,442
I just can't move freely.

256
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:56,202
The physician
from Chenrong Family is good.

257
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,082
Just continue taking good care of it.

258
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,723
I gave you quite a scare.

259
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:03,682
Don't be angry with me.

260
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,282
You know I wouldn't be.

261
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,042
Unless life is threatened,

262
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,442
no one likes

263
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,643
to act by hurting themselves.

264
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:16,042
I had someone investigate
Fangfeng Yiying

265
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:18,282
after the last time I got hurt.

266
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:19,922
She was probably instructed by someone

267
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,322
to assassinate me.

268
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:24,082
Instructed?

269
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,402
Could it be someone from Xiyan?

270
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:27,682
You guessed it.

271
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,322
This matter is most likely
related to my uncle.

272
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:33,442
It seems that the Fangfeng Family

273
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,883
has likely sided with him.

274
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,562
That day on the lake,

275
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:43,643
I felt they were in great numbers
and had the upper hand.

276
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:45,282
I wanted to avoid conflicts with them,

277
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:47,082
so I intentionally got hurt

278
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:48,483
and dived into the lake.

279
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:51,922
Who'd have thought Chenrong Xinyue
would jump in to save me?

280
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:54,763
You should thank me for that.

281
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:57,243
If it hadn't been for me wanting
to hear her play the guqin,

282
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:59,562
you wouldn't have had
the chance to play the flute,

283
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,243
and Chenrong Xinyue
wouldn't have developed

284
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:03,723
a liking for you.

285
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:06,843
I should thank you?

286
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,802
If I hadn't played the flute for you,

287
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:11,243
I wouldn't have lured their boat over.

288
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,363
If I hadn't lured them over,

289
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:13,562
I wouldn't have encountered them

290
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:15,402
and wouldn't have had
all these troubles.

291
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,723
I was the victim
of your unintended harm.

292
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,643
If you hadn't met Chenrong Xinyue,

293
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,202
how would you have met people from
the Chishui and Chenrong Families?

294
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:24,800
It was a blessing in disguise.

295
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:28,442
Well, thanks a lot.

296
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:34,723
However, the influence
of the Central Plains clans

297
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,763
is extensive and complicated.

298
00:20:36,963 --> 00:20:38,643
The Chenrong and Chishui Families

299
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:41,042
were clans you wanted
to get acquainted with and win over.

300
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,003
I didn't expect such a chance,

301
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,760
and we actually met Chenrong Xinyue.

302
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,682
You look like seeing through everything,

303
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,042
but in reality,
you're still a dreamy girl.

304
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:58,282
What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?

305
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,843
Whether the Chenrong
and Chishui Families

306
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,802
will stand on our side or out

307
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:04,603
doesn't depend

308
00:21:04,603 --> 00:21:06,912
on Chenrong Xinyue's
trivial liking for me,

309
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,282
but on the benefits
I can bring them in the future.

310
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,042
With or without this matter,

311
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,442
it doesn't matter at all.

312
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:15,562
You are

313
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:18,682
too clear-headed, too rational.

314
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:24,442
I'm still dreamy?

315
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:26,682
How nice.

316
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,003
(Chenrong Mansion)

317
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,843
How come you suddenly
want to host a banquet?

318
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:35,003
A few friends are here in Zhiyi City.

319
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,802
I want to use your mansion
to host a feast.

320
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:40,082
This is a good chance
to make acquaintance.

321
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:42,162
Great, I love making friends.

322
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:44,603
I'll let Xinyue prepare the banquet.

323
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:46,402
Thank you.

324
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:47,562
What are you talking about?

325
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:49,162
Aren't your friends my friends too?

326
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,162
Deliver it to the Haoling Inn.

327
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:01,682
Yes.

328
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:16,883
Pack your things.

329
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:18,682
Set off for Mount Jade
early next morning.

330
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:21,042
Alright.

331
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:24,928
Your Highness, an invitation
from the Chenrong Mansion.

332
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:29,922
Chenrong Mansion?

333
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:33,003
Is it from Miss Chenrong?

334
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:33,843
Let me see.

335
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,442
The invitation is sent out
by the Chenrong Mansion.

336
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:39,682
(Invitation Letter from Tushan Jing)
The host is Tushan Jing.

337
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:45,123
Shall I decline the invitation?

338
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:47,723
We can't afford any more delays
in our plan to go to Mount Jade.

339
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:48,723
Brother,

340
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:51,322
you should go.

341
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:57,363
Are you reluctant to miss
the opportunity to meet Tushan Jing?

342
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:01,202
Yes, I am reluctant.

343
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,162
But I'm more reluctant to

344
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,562
miss the opportunity for you
to meet Chishui Fenglong.

345
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:07,483
He is the son of Chenrong Yi

346
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:10,442
and the future leader of Chishui Clan,
one of the Four Great Clans.

347
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:13,162
I've heard that the young descendants
of the Central Plains clans

348
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:14,523
follow his lead.

349
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,763
If you get to know him

350
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,162
and gain his support,

351
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:20,003
your future path
will surely be much easier.

352
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:25,562
Brother, delaying the trip
to Mount Jade by one day

353
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:26,763
won't cause any problems.

354
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:28,402
You should go.

355
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:34,843
Alright, let's stay one more day.

356
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:37,682
But Nian has always disliked
such gatherings.

357
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:39,843
I'll let Ru Shou stay with her.

358
00:23:40,082 --> 00:23:41,883
You accompany me to the feast
at the Chenrong Mansion.

359
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:44,643
You're afraid she'll get into a fight
with Chenrong Xinyue again, right?

360
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,162
Fenglong, let me introduce you.

361
00:23:58,643 --> 00:24:00,363
This is Xuan
from the Dragon Squad of Haoling.

362
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,240
This is his cousin, Wen Xiaoliu.

363
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:05,042
Nice to meet you.

364
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:09,682
Xuan, these are Chishui Fenglong
and Chenrong Xinyue.

365
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,643
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Chishui and Miss Chenrong.

366
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:16,202
So the friend of Jing is you.

367
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:17,562
You know each other?

368
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:23,243
In this case,

369
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:25,082
it's fate that you and Xuan
know each other.

370
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:26,682
You must keep it a secret.

371
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:28,162
Don't tell Father about it.

372
00:24:28,682 --> 00:24:29,952
If he knows,

373
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:31,202
Mother will nag me.

374
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:34,162
Father doesn't have the time
to discipline you lately.

375
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:37,802
I heard that a court official of Xiyan

376
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:39,082
impeached Mr. Chenrong

377
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,963
for colluding with Chenrong rebels,

378
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,883
harboring rebellious intentions
and plotting something big.

379
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:47,922
Yes, our father has been worried
about this matter recently.

380
00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:50,243
I would like to share his worries,

381
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,963
but he won't let me
get involved in court affairs.

382
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:56,802
Jing, what do you think
about this matter?

383
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:00,763
I wonder what Xuan thinks about it.

384
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:07,442
If one must say that Mr. Chenrong
is colluding with the Chenrong rebels,

385
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:10,763
harboring rebellious intentions
and plotting something big,

386
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:15,483
there's nothing wrong with that.

387
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:21,162
What did you say?

388
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:25,082
Fenglong,

389
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:27,523
let him finish speaking.

390
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,682
Alright, for Jing's sake,

391
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:36,963
I'll let you finish.

392
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:43,200
Hundreds of years ago, when Mr. Chenrong
took over the Central Plains, he said

393
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:44,843
his loyalty belongs to common people,

394
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,442
and his pursuit is peace

395
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:48,162
and well-being all over the world.

396
00:25:48,562 --> 00:25:50,562
He never said
he would be loyal to a single man.

397
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:53,082
What he has been striving for is great.

398
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:56,363
Isn't the peaceful hand-to-mouth life
of Central Plains' civilians

399
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,082
important?

400
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:03,843
But the crime of
colluding with the betrayers...

401
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:05,562
After Mr. Chenrong
took over Central Plains,

402
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:07,922
with private negotiations,

403
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:10,643
many betrayers surrendered,

404
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:12,523
which stopped many wars.

405
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,603
If it weren't
for Mr. Chenrong's collusion,

406
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:17,682
as Central Plains enjoyed many people,

407
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:20,243
there wouldn't be

408
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:22,368
just tens of thousands
of betrayers left,

409
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:24,082
hiding in Qingshui.

410
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:54,282
Well said. Let me toast you.

411
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:03,363
Jing.

412
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:23,523
Yiying, why are you only here now?

413
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:25,363
Take a seat next to Jing.

414
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:48,640
I was feeling a bit unwell earlier.

415
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:50,144
Jing...

416
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,442
Jing's always been

417
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:53,282
considerate and thoughtful
towards Yiying, so admirable.

418
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:57,523
Jing and Yiying, this toast is to you.

419
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,042
We're all waiting
to take part in your wedding.

420
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,802
He's just recovered from an illness
and can't drink much.

421
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:18,282
I'll drink this one for him.

422
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:25,603
Yiying truly cares deeply

423
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,643
for Jing.

424
00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:51,402
Excuse me, I need to change.

425
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:00,682
Xiaoliu can't hold his liquor.

426
00:29:00,802 --> 00:29:02,322
Let's continue drinking.

427
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:03,883
No going home sober today.

428
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:29,162
Boatman.

429
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:30,643
Boatman.

430
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:32,763
Boatman.

431
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,442
Give that man a ride.

432
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,082
I was ordered to send you out
of the city as quickly as possible

433
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:43,322
without attracting others' attention.

434
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:45,472
With so many eyes in this city,

435
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,424
we'd better avoid trouble.

436
00:29:47,922 --> 00:29:51,243
Didn't Chenrong Yi tell you who I am?

437
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:11,603
Thank you, boatman.

438
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:12,523
It's the...

439
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,024
The lady on the boat.

440
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:23,603
Thank you, Miss.

441
00:30:58,682 --> 00:31:01,082
Miss, it's raining outside.
May I come in to take shelter?

442
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:03,723
Thank you, Miss.

443
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:14,643
The rain stopped.

444
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:24,883
Miss, it's raining again.

445
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:38,603
Sir, you might as well sit down.

446
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:43,883
If heaven asks you to sit,
you have to sit.

447
00:31:44,922 --> 00:31:45,162
Sit.

448
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,763
I'll have to trouble you then.

449
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:00,883
Where are you heading, sir?

450
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:08,282
Just wandering aimlessly.

451
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:11,003
I didn't know someone was on this boat
when I called the boatman.

452
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:13,883
If it's inconvenient for you,
I can get off immediately.

453
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:15,442
It's not a problem.

454
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,243
I'm also wandering

455
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:18,802
aimlessly.

456
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,763
Didn't you say
the provision matter can't be delayed?

457
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:42,763
I'm sorry, Miss.

458
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:50,723
I'm sorry.

459
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:55,763
I'm really sorry, Miss.

460
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:57,056
I'm really sorry.

461
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:01,442
The current here seems quite gentle,

462
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,723
but the boat is rocking so much.

463
00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:08,682
Boatman, could you please

464
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:09,802
row slower?

465
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:10,643
Thank you.

466
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:12,202
So dense.

467
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,003
Sir,

468
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:15,243
move a bit closer.

469
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,322
Lean towards the middle.

470
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:17,723
The boat will be stable?

471
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:25,562
My apologies, Miss.

472
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:31,072
Judging from your accent,
you aren't from the Central Plains.

473
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:35,562
I came out to handle
some affairs with a friend

474
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:36,843
and passed through here.

475
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:38,802
Since you came with a friend,

476
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:42,363
why are you wandering around alone?

477
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,162
Did you have a disagreement
with your friend?

478
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,322
I had a few drinks
at a banquet just now.

479
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:51,363
I was afraid that I would
lose my sobriety if I got drunk,

480
00:33:51,523 --> 00:33:52,843
so I left in advance.

481
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:55,680
You're afraid of losing

482
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,922
your sobriety in front of friends.

483
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,363
It seems that they are not

484
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:00,763
your true friends.

485
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:04,282
In that case, why not go home?

486
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:09,283
I go with the flow,
and the world is my home.

487
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:10,922
Wherever I go is home.

488
00:34:11,323 --> 00:34:12,483
Isn't there

489
00:34:13,323 --> 00:34:16,162
anyone special on your mind?

490
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:45,882
What's wrong? Haven't you seen a demon?

491
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,352
In this city,

492
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,963
it's not rare to see aquatic creatures.

493
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:52,483
I just didn't expect it.

494
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:56,162
After turning into a human form,

495
00:34:57,003 --> 00:35:00,682
I discovered the world is not
as beautiful as I imagined.

496
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:03,202
Luckily, there are two things

497
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:05,243
that can fill this meaningless life.

498
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:06,963
Delicious food and fine wine?

499
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:09,963
Want to eat?

500
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:16,362
Are you afraid I've poisoned it

501
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,483
or do you look down on demons' food?

502
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:24,563
I happen to think of

503
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:26,882
a friend who's a demon too.

504
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:32,083
But I get eaten by him every time.

505
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:36,003
My food is eaten by him.

506
00:35:36,642 --> 00:35:38,402
I've never eaten his food before.

507
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:41,602
It sounds like this friend
of yours isn't very friendly.

508
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:44,483
You still consider him a friend.

509
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:48,922
He may be fierce, but...

510
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:51,043
He's good.

511
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,243
He's really good.

512
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:15,488
(Chenrong Mansion)

513
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:16,963
Jing.

514
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,842
Wait for me, Jing.

515
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:22,202
Jing.

516
00:36:27,202 --> 00:36:29,083
Miss Fangfeng, please respect yourself.

517
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:31,642
I'm drunk.

518
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:33,922
My head is spinning.

519
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,362
Can't you help me?

520
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:38,723
I'm sorry, but I should keep
a respectful distance from ladies.

521
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:40,763
Jing,

522
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:43,402
I am your fiancee,

523
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:44,723
not some other woman.

524
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:46,963
Before you left Qingqiu,

525
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:48,882
Grandma asked you to take care of me.

526
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:50,243
Have you forgotten?

527
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:53,483
I will call a maid to take care of you.

528
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:55,323
- I...
- In some time,

529
00:36:55,803 --> 00:36:57,243
when everything is arranged,

530
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,243
I will talk to your family
about breaking off the engagement.

531
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:03,803
No, I don't agree.

532
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:09,323
Jing.

533
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:32,202
Don't misunderstand.

534
00:37:32,842 --> 00:37:33,642
Fangfeng Yiying and I...

535
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,003
Thank you for today, Master Qingqiu.

536
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:38,043
Without you,

537
00:37:38,642 --> 00:37:41,162
I wouldn't have become
friends with Fenglong so soon.

538
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:42,323
I won't take credit.

539
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:45,283
It's your words and actions
that won Fenglong's approval.

540
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:47,283
Although I am grateful to you,

541
00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:49,483
there are some things

542
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,043
that need to be clarified first.

543
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:55,523
Xiaoyao deserves
the best man in the world.

544
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:57,842
Whether it's me or her father,

545
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:01,362
we cannot bear
her being hurt even a little bit.

546
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:03,362
