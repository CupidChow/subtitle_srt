=Episode 1=

3
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:45,984
(Xiyan Mountain)

4
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:04,000
(Zhaoyun Hall, Xiyan)

5
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:41,636
Granny.

6
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:42,397
Look.

7
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:44,796
I'm swinging even higher
than the Poinciana flower.

8
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,917
(Xiling Xie)

9
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:47,917
Cang Xuan.

10
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:49,397
Look at me.

11
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:54,076
Your Majesty, it's time for medicine.

12
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:10,757
Why didn't you look at me?

13
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,156
Between you and the book,

14
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:18,277
of course, I prefer the book.

15
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:19,636
Granny.

16
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,076
Cang Xuan is bullying me again.

17
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:23,677
Watch your tone.

18
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:24,677
I'm your big brother.

19
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:29,356
I fight better than you.

20
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:30,636
And I'm taller.

21
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,236
What makes you my big brother?

22
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:33,236
How about this?

23
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:34,236
Whoever gets

24
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:36,236
the Poinciana flower on the top

25
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:37,317
is considered older.

26
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,037
Childish.

27
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:40,477
How is it childish?

28
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,636
It's more than natural

29
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:42,677
to respect

30
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,076
the powerful as an elder.

31
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,197
I see.

32
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:47,596
You're afraid you'd lose.

33
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,117
Fine.

34
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,156
You're cheating.

35
00:03:57,757 --> 00:03:58,996
All's fair in war.

36
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,636
Fourth Uncle, what brought you here?

37
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:03,197
Father?

38
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:15,917
All's fair in war, silly.

39
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:17,997
Your father is leading the army
on the front line.

40
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:19,516
How can he suddenly be home?

41
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:20,877
I won.

42
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:21,837
Call me big sister.

43
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:30,636
Are you mad?

44
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:38,397
Cang Xuan.

45
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,796
My big brother.

46
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:51,997
I was messing with you.

47
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:53,036
Don't be mad.

48
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:54,916
Take this as my apology.

49
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,756
It's from a nine-tailed fox.

50
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:57,957
It's really rare.

51
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,076
Big brother.

52
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:02,397
My dear brother.

53
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:07,397
Pretty, right?

54
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,076
Yeah.

55
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:11,916
I forgive you.

56
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,636
This is your favorite accessory.

57
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:21,356
Just keep it.

58
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:22,516
I knew it.

59
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:23,877
Cang Xuan is the best.

60
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:25,316
Big brother.

61
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,076
My big brother is the best.

62
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:31,557
Granny.

63
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:33,997
When are my parents coming home?

64
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:35,117
Didn't you say

65
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:36,636
that the war was going to end?

66
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:54,076
Granny.

67
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:56,717
- Granny.
- Granny.

68
00:05:57,117 --> 00:05:57,796
Granny.

69
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,196
- Granny.
- Granny.

70
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:02,397
- Granny, are you okay?
- Granny.

71
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,356
- Granny.
- Granny.

72
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:06,916
Granny, wake up.

73
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:08,877
Granny.

74
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:10,997
- Granny.
- Granny.

75
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:24,576
(Xiyan Zhongyi's tomb)

76
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:40,356
(Xiling Heng)
Mother, I want to talk to my brother.

77
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:49,796
Why hasn't your mother come?

78
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:52,756
Your Majesty.

79
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,437
It's time to seal the tomb.

80
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:57,787
(King of Xiyan)

81
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:01,437
Seal the tomb.

82
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,557
Grandpa.

83
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:04,717
This is my father's funeral.

84
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,636
We must wait for my mother.

85
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:08,677
My father's decree shall not

86
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,236
(Xiyan Yipeng)
be disturbed by an ignorant kid.

87
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:12,837
On your knees, now.

88
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,516
You're the ignorant one.

89
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:15,756
You grow old

90
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:17,356
without growing a brain!

91
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:18,356
What did you say?

92
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:19,437
Ninth Uncle.

93
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:21,196
This is my father's funeral.

94
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:23,916
If I don't get a say here,

95
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,236
who are you to talk!

96
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,677
The Five Classics presenting the rituals

97
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,236
prioritize sacrifices.

98
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:31,636
The ritual shall not

99
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:32,997
be delayed by a second.

100
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:34,397
Xiyan Yipeng!

101
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:41,476
Mother.

102
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,677
Auntie.

103
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:56,957
Mother.

104
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:01,504
(Chang Pu)

105
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,236
Xiyan Yipeng.

106
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,476
As the prince of Xiyan,

107
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,597
you intercepted the letters

108
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:17,997
for a hidden motive,

109
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,316
which delayed the reinforcement.

110
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:22,877
We lost the war on Mount Xun.

111
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,397
My husband Zhongyi became a martyr.

112
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:30,316
Six thousand
Ruoshui Clansmen lost their lives.

113
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,397
Sister-in-law.

114
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:34,957
My brother died for the kingdom.

115
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,037
I truly respect him.

116
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:40,597
And I understand your grief.

117
00:08:43,477 --> 00:08:44,157
Father.

118
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:47,037
My sister-in-law misspoke due to grief.

119
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:49,597
Please don't blame her.

120
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,277
Chang Pu is confused

121
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:54,116
due to her losses.

122
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:56,516
Guide them to leave.

123
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,316
I'm perfectly sane.

124
00:08:59,037 --> 00:08:59,717
Your Majesty.

125
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:01,876
My father led us to submit to you.

126
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:04,597
The Ruoshui Clan
has been a part of Xiyan ever since.

127
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:07,436
But Yipeng concealed
military information

128
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:10,316
and sacrificed the soldiers
for his own benefit.

129
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:12,316
As the head of the Ruoshui Clan,

130
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:14,277
I can't forgive him.

131
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:16,196
If I do,

132
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:17,876
I can't face my hometown.

133
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:20,837
As Zhongyi's wife,

134
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:26,477
I can't possibly spare him.

135
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:30,756
Brother!

136
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,636
Put Chang Pu in jail.

137
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,116
Put her under trial.

138
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,597
Punish her accordingly without mercy.

139
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:45,957
Your Majesty.

140
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:47,957
They fought so many battles for you.

141
00:09:48,157 --> 00:09:49,237
Please spare her.

142
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:57,157
My Ninth Uncle got my father killed.

143
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:59,316
Why can't my mother avenge his death?

144
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:01,316
Why are you arresting her?

145
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:02,556
Arrest her.

146
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:03,397
Stop.

147
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:04,876
Bad people.

148
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,037
You're bad people.

149
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,237
Sweetheart.

150
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,237
I want to watch you grow up,

151
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:15,556
but I can't.

152
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,116
I miss your father too much.

153
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:21,277
You will understand when you

154
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:22,277
find your love.

155
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:32,116
When you meet her,

156
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,957
give her this Ruomu flower.

157
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:36,477
Mother.

158
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:39,116
I'll protect you.

159
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:41,477
Don't be scared.

160
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:42,717
Silly boy.

161
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,037
Your Majesty.

162
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:45,797
It's Zhongyi's funeral today.

163
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,837
At least wait until the funeral ends.

164
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,196
Listen to your auntie.

165
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:58,717
I'm going to see your father.

166
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,037
Mother.

167
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,076
Mother.

168
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:23,676
Auntie.

169
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,837
Mother.

170
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:30,316
Mother.

171
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,756
Auntie.

172
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:40,837
Mother.

173
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,756
Mother.

174
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:44,717
Sister.

175
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,756
Take care of Cang Xuan for me.

176
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,316
Mother.

177
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:52,917
Mother.

178
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:55,037
Mother.

179
00:11:57,436 --> 00:11:59,397
Mother.

180
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,797
Mother.

181
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:30,996
Auntie.

182
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:35,636
Auntie.

183
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:36,996
Mother.

184
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:16,597
Cang Xuan.

185
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,957
Look what I picked.

186
00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:23,837
The Poinciana flower
I picked is so sweet.

187
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:25,037
Try it.

188
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:36,676
Cang Xuan.

189
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,797
I know you're upset.

190
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:42,717
But you have to eat.

191
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:44,676
Put that Ruomu flower away.

192
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,196
Eat something.

193
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:47,597
Why

194
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:50,516
did my mother abandon me?

195
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:51,516
You're so nice.

196
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,957
She would never abandon you.

197
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:56,436
She just went to join your father.

198
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:59,436
Otherwise, he'd be so lonely.

199
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:01,436
Am I not lonely here?

200
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:03,157
You have your granny,

201
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:04,196
your auntie,

202
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,397
and me.

203
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:12,717
It's really sweet.

204
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:27,076
So bitter.

205
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,316
It's not sweet at all.

206
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,076
The Poinciana flower is sweet.

207
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:50,636
It's just that you're too sad

208
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:53,116
to taste the sweetness.

209
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:58,037
Big brother.

210
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,397
Cry out loud if you want.

211
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:02,636
If you cry,

212
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,237
you may feel better.

213
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,556
My mother often says that

214
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,076
the mulberry honey from Zhaoyun Peak

215
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:11,436
takes away sorrow.

216
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,477
I got some

217
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,717
from her.

218
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:17,636
Let's drink some.

219
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,157
Come on. Drink some.

220
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:36,676
Don't be scared.

221
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:39,837
Mother,

222
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:41,837
Granny,

223
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,357
and I

224
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:45,556
will keep you company.

225
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:02,676
Master.

226
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:08,797
I am

227
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,957
so useless.

228
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:15,917
I can't even protect my son

229
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,756
and daughter-in-law.

230
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:21,357
Cang Xuan

231
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,837
lost his parents

232
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:28,556
at such a young age.

233
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,037
Master.

234
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,157
Rest well and get better.

235
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:33,797
I will stay on Zhaoyun Peak

236
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:36,076
to look after Cang Xuan.

237
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,316
From now on, he's my child

238
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:40,237
just like Xiaoyao.

239
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:42,116
You...

240
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,436
You are not going back to Haoling?

241
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,917
I've divorced the King of Haoling.

242
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:53,237
From now on, I'm only a Xiyan citizen

243
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:56,516
and no longer the Queen of Haoling.

244
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:10,757
I'll get the physicians.

245
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:15,997
Get those two kids

246
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:18,796
here.

247
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:25,477
Granny.

248
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:26,916
Granny.

249
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,556
Cang Xuan.

250
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:36,957
Now,

251
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:40,357
you're the only man

252
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:42,117
on Zhaoyun Peak.

253
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:43,997
From now on,

254
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,076
you shall shoulder the responsibility

255
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:51,117
of protecting Zhaoyun Peak.

256
00:17:53,877 --> 00:17:54,757
All right.

257
00:17:58,316 --> 00:17:59,076
Cang Xuan.

258
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:00,637
Xiaoyao.

259
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,316
Life hasn't been fair to you.

260
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:05,357
Your life

261
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:08,837
may remain tough.

262
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,597
I'm not afraid.

263
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:12,916
I have you,

264
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:14,396
my auntie,

265
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:16,477
and Xiaoyao.

266
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:20,076
I am the princess of Haoling.

267
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,757
Who dares to bully me?

268
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,076
Granny, rest assured.

269
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,036
I'll protect Cang Xuan.

270
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:30,076
No one can bully him.

271
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:32,837
You two

272
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:35,036
are the closest

273
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:36,837
ones

274
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:40,676
in the world.

275
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:43,957
The world is unpredictable.

276
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:46,597
People may bear evil intentions.

277
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,556
No matter

278
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,637
how people treat you,

279
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:54,357
you must

280
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,717
cherish and support

281
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:02,517
each other.

282
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,156
- Granny, rest assured.
- Rest assured.

283
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:06,757
- We will.
- We will.

284
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:09,637
I want you to take a vow.

285
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,076
Forever and ever.

286
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,837
You shall trust

287
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,637
and look after each other.

288
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:25,916
Never go back on your word.

289
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:28,316
I swear.

290
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:29,916
I swear.

291
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:31,997
- Me and Xiaoyao...
- Me and Cang Xuan...

292
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:35,517
We will trust and look after
each other forever and ever.

293
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:39,357
We will never go back on our word.

294
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,877
- Granny.
- Granny.

295
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:51,517
- Granny.
- Granny.

296
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:52,877
Granny.

297
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:54,396
Granny.

298
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:58,076
- Granny.
- Granny.

299
00:19:58,637 --> 00:19:59,796
Granny.

300
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,276
Granny.

301
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:18,957
(Granny told me to guard Zhaoyun Peak.)

302
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,196
(But I didn't protect my mother.)

303
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:24,837
(Neither did I look after my granny.)

304
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,396
(I couldn't do anything.)

305
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:34,436
What are you doing?

306
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:35,676
Can't you tell?

307
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,796
Bullying you, of course.

308
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,796
An unwanted wild kid
without a mother and a father

309
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:43,357
will get kicked out sooner or later.

310
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:44,757
If we don't bully you now,

311
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,316
we may not have a chance later.

312
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:50,156
Wild kid.

313
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:53,477
Wild orphan kid.

314
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:10,757
Yue Liang, stop it.

315
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:11,877
Otherwise,

316
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:12,676
I'll ask my father

317
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:13,757
to arrest you all.

318
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:15,117
You wretched girl.

319
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:17,436
The King of Haoling has announced

320
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:19,676
that he divorced your mother.

321
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,196
Divorced?

322
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:23,237
What do you mean?

323
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:24,916
I mean,

324
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,316
your father doesn't want you anymore.

325
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:28,276
No one is there to back you up.

326
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,477
How dare you play tough here?

327
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:31,796
Get lost.

328
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,477
Or I'll beat you up as well.

329
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:40,637
How dare you hit me?

330
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:41,796
You deserve it.

331
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:43,076
Hit her!

332
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:49,717
Stay put.

333
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:51,196
I'll avenge you.

334
00:22:11,637 --> 00:22:12,957
Who's the wild kid?

335
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:15,076
Who's unwanted?

336
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:16,156
I'm the wild kid.

337
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:17,597
I'm unwanted.

338
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:19,957
Who's the wretched girl?

339
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:21,717
Sorry. Sorry.

340
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,196
Big sister.

341
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,664
(Poinciana Wood, Zhaoyun Peak)

342
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:31,357
If anyone bullies you again,

343
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:32,597
don't fight them alone.

344
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:34,436
Call me. I'll do it.

345
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,156
A gentleman doesn't seek violence.

346
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:37,877
Just watch us on the side.

347
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:39,916
Don't be scared.

348
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:41,757
As long as I cultivate hard,

349
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,597
my spirit power will keep growing.

350
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:45,357
I will protect you.

351
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:49,597
Once we go back,

352
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:51,556
just say that you tripped

353
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:54,357
to not get my mother worried.

354
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:55,436
Okay.

355
00:22:56,196 --> 00:22:57,957
That bad Yue Liang said

356
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:00,597
my parents got divorced.

357
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,276
Is it true?

358
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:11,357
I guess I don't have a father anymore.

359
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:17,156
Anyway, I'm used to
living on Zhaoyun Peak.

360
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,396
I will stay here and keep you company

361
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:20,877
forever, okay?

362
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:22,237
Okay.

363
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,837
But you will grow up.

364
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:29,517
You'll make a living and start a family.

365
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:31,556
Then

366
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,556
you have to leave Zhaoyun Peak

367
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:35,477
and me.

368
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:41,597
We won't ever be parted

369
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:43,757
as long as I'm your little sister.

370
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:46,556
Alright, you're my little sister.

371
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:48,156
And I'm your big brother forever.

372
00:23:48,316 --> 00:23:49,117
No matter what,

373
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:50,436
we'll be together forever.

374
00:23:50,957 --> 00:23:51,916
Deal.

375
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,036
Together forever.

376
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:54,957
We will never be parted.

377
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:55,837
Deal.

378
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,760
(Classic of Herbs, Classic of Poisons)

379
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:10,957
Auntie.

380
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:12,597
Why are you crying?

381
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:13,717
Nothing.

382
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:23,276
I just hate to leave Xiaoyao and you.

383
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,316
Leave?

384
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,957
Where are you going?

385
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:29,597
After your father passed away,

386
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:31,796
Xiyan has been losing the war.

387
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:34,036
Now, Chenrong's army

388
00:25:34,237 --> 00:25:35,556
is right outside the city.

389
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,316
I am told to lead the army

390
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,757
on short notice.

391
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,477
There are so many civil

392
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:43,036
and military officials.

393
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:44,396
Can they find a man

394
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:46,237
to lead the army?

395
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,196
Why do they have to put you to do it?

396
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:52,117
I have to talk to my grandpa.

397
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:52,757
Cang Xuan.

398
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:54,916
I am indeed a woman.

399
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:56,717
But I'm also a soldier

400
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,477
of Xiyan just like your father.

401
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,357
Although Xiyan is not my last name,

402
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:02,637
I've been taught by your grandma

403
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,276
to protect this kingdom

404
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:07,556
and its people.

405
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:09,117
But...

406
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:10,477
Auntie.

407
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:12,877
I'm scared...

408
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:14,837
Don't be.

409
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:16,997
I promise

410
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:18,517
I'll come back.

411
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,757
Auntie, I'm also a Xiyan citizen.

412
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:23,717
I want to fight alongside you

413
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,036
on the battlefield.

414
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:27,436
Silly boy.

415
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,237
You're still young.

416
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:38,436
This is the wedding gift
from the King of Haoling

417
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:41,237
when your parents got married.

418
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:43,556
Your mother

419
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,076
even took her life with it.

420
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:50,237
Now,

421
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,316
I'm giving it to you.

422
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:58,997
Only Xiaoyao and you
will be guarding Zhaoyun Peak.

423
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:02,237
When I'm not around,

424
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:05,916
protect yourself

425
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:08,997
and Xiaoyao.

426
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:10,997
Cang Xuan.

427
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:12,477
Xiaoyao...

428
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,036
Xiaoyao is different from you.

429
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:18,637
You must

430
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,796
protect her well.

431
00:27:22,316 --> 00:27:23,997
This is an order.

432
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:26,517
Can you do it?

433
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,637
I swear I'll protect Xiaoyao.

434
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:47,744
(Zhaoyun Hall)

435
00:27:58,877 --> 00:27:59,757
Mother.

436
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:02,036
Do you have to go?

437
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:16,637
Xiaoyao.

438
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:18,957
I

439
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:20,637
care

440
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:22,916
and worry the most

441
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:24,916
about you.

442
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:30,517
When I'm not around,

443
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:34,637
take care of yourself.

444
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:38,357
If you're worried about me,

445
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:40,796
then just stay

446
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:43,517
and don't go to the war.

447
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,076
I'm a citizen of Xiyan.

448
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:48,276
This is

449
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:50,477
something I have to do.

450
00:28:58,517 --> 00:28:59,676
I promise

451
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:02,316
I'll be back soon.

452
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:04,877
Mother.

453
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:08,117
Keep your word.

454
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:16,196
Pinky promise.

455
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:27,796
By the King of Xiyan's decree,

456
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:31,597
Xiling Heng is made the Princess General

457
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:33,676
to lead the army.

458
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:35,957
Wish Princess General

459
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:37,676
take down the enemies

460
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,556
and come home with a victory.

461
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:42,757
Wish Princess General

462
00:29:42,757 --> 00:29:46,517
take down the enemies
and come home with a victory.

463
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:53,477
Mother.

464
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,436
Xiaoyao, don't worry.

465
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:17,796
I will be with you.

466
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,837
We'll wait for her together.

467
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:31,036
Mother.

468
00:30:38,556 --> 00:30:39,796
Mother.

469
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,528
(Shangyuan Palace, Xiyan)

470
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:24,036
Grandpa, let us in.

471
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:26,076
Grandpa, let us in.

472
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:28,196
Let them in.

473
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:30,916
Let us in.

474
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:39,436
Where is my mother?

475
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:41,117
Give her back.

476
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:43,316
Grandpa.

477
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:45,597
We heard people saying that

478
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:47,916
Auntie...

479
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:49,597
She...

480
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:51,556
She is...

481
00:31:54,436 --> 00:31:55,196
Xiaoyao,

482
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:58,676
to protect the people of Xiyan,

483
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,156
your mother chose to take down

484
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:03,276
the devil Chi Chen

485
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,196
at the cost of her own life

486
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,837
in the last battle.

487
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,717
Xiaoyao.

488
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:11,997
You're all a bunch of liars.

489
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:13,396
I don't believe you.

490
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,396
My mother said she'd come back.

491
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,477
She wouldn't leave me alone.

492
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:19,637
She will definitely come back.

493
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:20,436
Xiaoyao.

494
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:21,357
Cang Xuan.

495
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,117
Grandpa.

496
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:31,196
Cang Xuan.

497
00:32:32,436 --> 00:32:35,196
Xiaoyao needs some time to accept it.

498
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:36,717
Try your best

499
00:32:37,076 --> 00:32:38,957
to comfort her these days.

500
00:32:39,117 --> 00:32:39,837
Grandpa.

501
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:43,436
Did Auntie really die in the battle?

502
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:00,477
Cang Xuan.

503
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,237
Your aunt and your father

504
00:33:03,877 --> 00:33:06,757
died for the Xiyan people.

505
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:08,916
Once you grow up,

506
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:12,316
you should be a hero

507
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,916
who protects the kingdom just like them.

508
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:17,117
No.

509
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:20,357
I swear I won't be a hero like them.

510
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:24,237
I swear I won't do what they did

511
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:27,316
and leave my wife,
my mother, and my children,

512
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:31,117
in endless grief and pain
without someone to rely on.

513
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:38,076
I will live on. I will live on well.

514
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:39,957
And be the King of Xiyan.

515
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:46,637
To be the King of Xiyan

516
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:51,477
is even harder than being a hero.

517
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:58,237
It's an arduous and dangerous journey.

518
00:33:58,796 --> 00:33:59,637
I'm not scared.

519
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:02,477
I promised my granny and auntie

520
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,597
to protect Zhaoyun Peak and Xiaoyao.

521
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:06,877
There is nothing I won't do

522
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,077
to grow powerful.

523
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:11,116
Sure.

524
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:13,916
I will wait to see that.

525
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:15,797
Grandpa.

526
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,037
I have to leave now.

527
00:34:18,876 --> 00:34:19,757
Cang Xuan.

528
00:34:21,997 --> 00:34:25,836
I'm planning
to send Xiaoyao to Mount Jade

529
00:34:26,636 --> 00:34:29,876
and learn from the Queen Mother.

530
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,517
Why are you sending her away?

531
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:36,836
Why can't Xiaoyao stay on Zhaoyun Peak?

532
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:39,676
Mount Jade is isolated.

533
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,277
It's a simple place.

534
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:43,436
Queen Mother has strong spirit power

535
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:45,477
and she knows your grandma.

536
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,237
She will surely
raise Xiaoyao wholeheartedly.

537
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,636
Trust me.

538
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:53,356
I'm doing this

539
00:34:53,876 --> 00:35:00,156
- to keep Xiaoyao safe.
- Grandpa.

540
00:35:00,997 --> 00:35:03,477
Please don't send Xiaoyao away.

541
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:05,116
Grandpa.

542
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:06,636
Please.

543
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,356
I will protect her.

544
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,317
Grandpa, please.

545
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:16,156
Cang Xuan, with your current abilities,

546
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,237
you can't protect her at all.

547
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:21,916
If anyone wants to hurt her,

548
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:26,957
are you going to beg them
like what you're doing right now?

549
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:31,876
I...

550
00:35:41,757 --> 00:35:42,836
Cang Xuan.

551
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:45,156
You

552
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:48,757
will never reach
this position on your knees.

553
00:36:10,797 --> 00:36:12,636
Xiaoyao.

554
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,277
Where are you?

555
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:24,797
Why are you hiding here?

556
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:28,757
I'm feeding wine
to this Jasper Mulberry.

557
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:31,997
This Jasper Mulberry

558
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,208
is a real alcoholic.

559
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,196
Princess, time to set out.

560
00:36:51,116 --> 00:36:52,237
When I'm not around,

561
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:54,356
remember to water
the Jasper Mulberry with wine.

562
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:56,717
Once you collect mulberry honey,

563
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,436
wait to share it with me.

564
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,356
Don't drink any without me.

565
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:01,196
Okay.

566
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:02,876
Little foodie.

567
00:37:04,317 --> 00:37:05,277
Big foodie.

568
00:37:08,116 --> 00:37:09,876
Take care of yourself.

569
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,676
Don't worry.

570
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,636
I'm awesome.

571
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:17,477
I can do well both on Wushen Mountain

572
00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:19,116
and Xiyan Mountain.

573
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:21,636
Surely, I'll be fine on Mount Jade.

574
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,237
I brought you a bag of iced mulberries

575
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:30,916
and a jar of Poinciana flower
I picked this morning.

576
00:37:32,037 --> 00:37:33,676
Eat as many as you want.

577
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,596
I'll send them to you very often.

578
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,557
When you miss me,

579
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:42,676
take it out and look at it.

580
00:37:43,757 --> 00:37:46,717
Check it often. Don't forget about me.

581
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:54,517
I will bring you back

582
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:56,596
from Mount Jade as soon as possible.

583
00:37:57,237 --> 00:37:57,836
Okay.

584
00:37:58,997 --> 00:37:59,836
I'll wait for you.

601
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:26,368
(Three hundred years later)

602
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:28,717
(The world came into being.)

603
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,237
(Mortals, deities, and demons
reside together in Dahuang.)

604
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:33,396
(Haoling Kingdom)

605
00:39:33,396 --> 00:39:33,596
(Haoling)

606
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:35,676
(is in the greatest state of affluence.)

607
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:38,037
(Chenrong)
(Chenrong Kingdom features fertile land)

608
00:39:38,156 --> 00:39:39,317
(and the greatest population.)

609
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,876
(Xiyan)
(The Xiyan Kingdom features strict law)

610
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,317
(and great military power.)

611
00:39:44,277 --> 00:39:45,557
(The three deity clans)

612
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:48,717
(divided the world
into three evenly-matched adversaries.)

613
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,836
(Xiyan's Princess General
was assigned at the last minute)

614
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:55,077
(and fought
General Chi Chen of Chenrong.)

615
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:04,557
(After they both died in the battle,)

616
00:40:04,957 --> 00:40:08,196
(Chenrong Kingdom
lost all its momentum.)

617
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:12,356
(Xiyan took over Chenrong.)

618
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:13,997
(Three kingdoms)

619
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:17,477
(became two rivalries.)

620
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:23,196
Previously.

621
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:27,797
We mentioned the two orphans
on Zhaoyun Peak

622
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:31,116
parted for good,

623
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,116
never to see each other again.

624
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:37,797
Bravo!

625
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:43,636
Xiaoliu.

626
00:40:45,037 --> 00:40:45,477
Xiaoliu.

627
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:46,797
Xiaoliu.

628
00:40:46,997 --> 00:40:47,557
Sit here.

629
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:49,636
Xiaoliu.

630
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:50,957
Your medicine is amazing.

631
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,596
I got pregnant almost right away.

632
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:53,356
Now

633
00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:54,517
I'm about to give birth.

634
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:55,196
Of course.

635
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:56,997
This is how good I am.

636
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:02,037
Here we go.

637
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:09,504
(Rejuvenation Hall,
A cure for infertility)

638
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:13,757
Utterly vulgar.

639
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:18,477
Young man.

640
00:41:18,757 --> 00:41:19,997
Want some of my medicine?

641
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,277
My medicine

642
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:23,436
guarantees

643
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:24,596
a harmonious married life

644
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:25,876
and many kids.

645
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:26,436
I...

646
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:27,676
I'm not sick.

647
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:28,876
You're sick.

648
00:41:30,997 --> 00:41:31,916
Don't go.

649
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:36,436
Xiaoliu.

650
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:38,557
Shall we try to be decent

651
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:40,317
in public?

652
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:42,636
What does that offer me?

653
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:43,957
Can I feed on decency?

654
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:44,596
Look at me.

655
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:46,836
I prefer money over decency.

656
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:50,477
The Queen of Xiyan on Zhaoyun Peak

657
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:52,836
has three sons and one disciple,

658
00:41:53,317 --> 00:41:55,037
all well-versed in letters

659
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:56,477
and military technology.

660
00:41:57,317 --> 00:42:00,676
Unfortunately, they all died in wars.

661
00:42:01,196 --> 00:42:02,957
The only two orphans

662
00:42:03,077 --> 00:42:05,836
were forced away from the Xiyan Kingdom.

663
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:07,156
That is to say.

664
00:42:07,596 --> 00:42:10,317
The prince and princess parted ways.

665
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:15,997
With tears dripping, they sadly waved.

666
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:18,317
Bravo!

667
00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:21,557
Nonsense.

668
00:42:21,757 --> 00:42:23,517
Both were forcing a smile

669
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:25,116
to not make each other sad.

670
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,517
"With tears dripping"?

671
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:29,237
Storytellers are so dramatic.

672
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:38,277
The princess
gave the prince a jade pendant

673
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:39,557
and said,

674
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:43,396
"The jade pendant
will accompany you just like me.

675
00:42:43,717 --> 00:42:46,277
I hope we can meet soon

676
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:49,636
and no longer suffer from parting."

677
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:56,797
Nonsense.

678
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:57,757
Jade pendant?

679
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,477
It was a fox tail.

680
00:43:00,517 --> 00:43:02,237
The princess waited

681
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:04,876
for the reunion on Mount Jade.

682
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:08,557
The little prince had to leave Xiyan

683
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:10,916
due to the exclusion of his uncles

684
00:43:11,037 --> 00:43:13,396
and be a hostage in Haoling Kingdom.

685
00:43:14,596 --> 00:43:16,517
He regarded

686
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:20,037
that alluring and thriving
foreign land as his home,

687
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:23,477
spending his days accompanying
the second princess

688
00:43:23,596 --> 00:43:25,156
on nature walks,

689
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,916
unconcerned with worldly affairs.

690
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:54,676
Brother.

691
00:43:58,797 --> 00:43:59,356
What's wrong?

692
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:01,436
Are we there?

693
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:02,517
Yeah.

694
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:05,436
This is Qingshui Town?

695
00:44:05,836 --> 00:44:06,797
I need a walk.

696
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,037
Easy. Slowly.

697
00:44:14,144 --> 00:44:16,887
(Qingshui Town)

698
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:19,277
It looks quite ordinary.

699
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:20,116
What makes it

700
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,436
the place for the outlaws?

701
00:44:21,477 --> 00:44:22,997
(Qingshui Town)
Don't underestimate it.

702
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:24,596
This is the only place

703
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:26,037
throughout Dahuang

704
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:27,596
that belongs to neither Xiyan

705
00:44:27,596 --> 00:44:28,477
nor Haoling.

706
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:31,116
I'd like to see

707
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:32,317
how many outlaws there are.

708
00:44:32,477 --> 00:44:33,077
I will get them

709
00:44:33,077 --> 00:44:34,277
back to Wushen Mountain

710
00:44:34,277 --> 00:44:35,436
and make them my servants.

711
00:44:36,196 --> 00:44:36,876
Let's go.

712
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:52,836
Mr. Stone.

713
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:53,997
Did that Xiyan prince

714
00:44:53,997 --> 00:44:55,077
pick up the princess

715
00:44:55,077 --> 00:44:56,116
from Mount Jade?

716
00:44:56,477 --> 00:44:57,557
Didn't you hear him?

717
00:44:57,797 --> 00:44:59,116
Mr. Stone just said that

718
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,037
the little prince roamed around with

719
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:02,196
the second princess of Haoling

720
00:45:02,317 --> 00:45:03,277
and forgot all about

721
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:04,356
his sister on Mount Jade.

722
00:45:04,356 --> 00:45:05,557
Really?

723
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:06,957
So heartless.

724
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,237
Outrageous.

725
00:45:13,156 --> 00:45:14,077
My belly is hurting.

726
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:14,517
I...

727
00:45:14,596 --> 00:45:16,077
I'm about to give birth?

728
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:16,717
Xiaoliu.

729
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:17,957
Check on her.

730
00:45:17,957 --> 00:45:18,797
I'm a grown man.

731
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,557
How can I be a midwife?

732
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:22,037
It's urgent.

733
00:45:22,196 --> 00:45:23,836
Where can I find a midwife now?

734
00:45:26,676 --> 00:45:28,156
It hurts very much.

735
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:34,717
Xiaoliu.

736
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:36,277
Physician Wen.

737
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:39,116
There are only male and female demons.

738
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:40,636
There are no men or women.

739
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:42,636
Please help me.

740
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,356
I'm hurting so much.

741
00:45:45,596 --> 00:45:46,116
Alright.

742
00:45:46,317 --> 00:45:47,037
Coming.

743
00:46:03,676 --> 00:46:05,277
Ancestral recipe.

744
00:46:05,277 --> 00:46:06,757
Feel free to try it.

745
00:46:07,037 --> 00:46:07,836
Alright.

746
00:46:08,717 --> 00:46:09,317
Come on, sir.

747
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:15,757
Sweet soy milk.

748
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,876
Sweet soy milk.

749
00:46:18,596 --> 00:46:20,237
Sweetness guaranteed.

750
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:21,676
Try it.

751
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:24,436
They look vulgar,

752
00:46:24,436 --> 00:46:25,596
but it seems quite fun.

753
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:27,116
Brother, let's look around.

754
00:46:28,196 --> 00:46:28,997
Sure.

755
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:38,797
Seven bunny babies.

756
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:40,876
The mother and the kids are fine.

757
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:42,557
Yes!

758
00:46:45,277 --> 00:46:46,077
Congratulations.

759
00:46:46,077 --> 00:46:46,676
Thank you.

760
00:46:46,676 --> 00:46:47,797
Thank you, Xiaoliu.

761
00:46:48,477 --> 00:46:50,277
Thank you, guys.

762
00:46:50,396 --> 00:46:52,317
The tea is on me today.

763
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:54,396
Yes!

764
00:46:55,717 --> 00:46:57,517
You must thank him!

765
00:46:57,517 --> 00:46:58,517
Thank you, Xiaoliu.

766
00:46:58,517 --> 00:46:58,997
It's nothing.

767
00:46:59,356 --> 00:46:59,797
Yeah.

768
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:01,237
He basically saved your life!

769
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:04,517
My fellow villagers,

770
00:47:04,676 --> 00:47:06,356
uncles and aunties,

771
00:47:06,436 --> 00:47:07,676
brothers and sisters,

772
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:09,116
if anyone can't have a child,

773
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:10,596
come to my Rejuvenation Hall

774
00:47:10,676 --> 00:47:11,957
(Rejuvenation Hall)
and look for me, Wen Xiaoliu.

775
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:14,277
I guarantee you a cure.

776
00:47:14,436 --> 00:47:15,436
You'll have many kids

777
00:47:15,477 --> 00:47:16,997
coming nonstop.

778
00:47:17,156 --> 00:47:19,557
Bravo!

779
00:47:20,717 --> 00:47:21,356
Brother.

780
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:23,757
The rouge is of poor quality.

781
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:25,116
Why would anyone get it?

782
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:26,636
And the cloth

783
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,037
is so rough and stiff.

784
00:47:28,116 --> 00:47:30,037
Doesn't it scratch their skin?

785
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:31,596
Want some accessories?

786
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:32,836
These are handmade.

787
00:47:32,957 --> 00:47:34,077
It's like a talisman.

788
00:47:34,237 --> 00:47:35,596
Get one for your loved one.

789
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:36,957
He will like it.

790
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:38,077
Will he?

791
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,916
Get one and you'll see.

792
00:47:47,037 --> 00:47:47,636
Bro...

793
00:47:56,277 --> 00:47:57,037
Young man.

794
00:47:57,477 --> 00:48:00,317
Can I help you?

795
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:03,636
Sorry.

796
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:05,277
I mistook you for someone else.

797
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,916
Ornate headdresses.

798
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:19,436
All kinds of styles. Good prices.

799
00:48:19,517 --> 00:48:21,196
Ornate headdresses.

800
00:48:21,196 --> 00:48:22,196
Come and take a look.

801
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:27,277
Ornate headdresses.

802
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:31,156
All kinds of styles. Good prices.

803
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:35,156
