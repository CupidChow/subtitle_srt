3
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,219
(I don't want to be Tushan Jing.)

4
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,419
(Whether I can be with you
openly and honorably is not important.)

5
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:48,419
(Even if I don't get
recognition for a lifetime,)

6
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,300
(even if I'm your servant
for a lifetime,)

7
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,340
(it doesn't matter,)

8
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,580
(I just want to be by your side.)

9
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,220
There are things I can't figure out.

10
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,739
I thought I'd be enlightened

11
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,340
during the walk.

12
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,140
Did you figure it out?

13
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,060
No.

14
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,019
Can you tell me about it?

15
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,860
I don't think we have a say in life.

16
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,620
No matter how powerful we are,

17
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,539
we can't control

18
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,179
the two most important things

19
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,060
in life.

20
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,900
Which two?

21
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,220
Life

22
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,860
and death.

23
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,900
We can neither decide how to be born

24
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,739
nor how to die.

25
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,739
If we don't have a say

26
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,099
in these two things,

27
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,500
I sometimes wonder

28
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,299
why we bother

29
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,780
to fight for and long for

30
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:13,780
something else.

31
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,179
It's so pointless.

♪I couldn't walk out of the memories♪

33
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,140

34
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,539
See it from another perspective.

35
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,099
We can't control life and death.

36
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,659
That's exactly why we should

37
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,980
have a say in everything

38
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,539
between life and death.

39
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,719

We've come this far.

46
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,939
Won't you see the view from the peak?

47
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,980

How do we admire the amazing view

51
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,660
if we don't take
the rugged mountain road?

52
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:21,660
Tushan Jing.

53
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,179
You broke your promise.

54
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,620
You broke your promise.

♪You appear as the smoke rises♪

Xuan. Find a man for me.

57
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,780
What kind of man?

58
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,780
Someone to live with.

59
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:41,940
I don't mind anything,

60
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,060
but he can't have another lover.

61
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:47,220
Otherwise, I'll castrate him.

62
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,139
Maybe Grandfather is right.

63
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,940
It's hard to find the one and only.

64
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,259
But if we choose the right person,

65
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,739
it's not so hard

66
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,299
to respect each other

67
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,139
and live together for life.

68
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,060
I no longer trust my judgment.

69
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,739
Choose for me.

70
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:07,380
Alright.

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,139
I'll choose for you.

72
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,139
If he lets you down,

73
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,100
I'll kill him

74
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:15,979
before you castrate him.

75
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,100
I know I can count on you.

76
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:45,900
Father.

77
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,220
Your Majesty. Time for medicine.

78
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:09,179
Those memorials are handed in
to impeach Cang Xuan?

79
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,340
Yes.

80
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,019
Father.

81
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,340
Cang Xuan married Miss Shen

82
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,979
and started forming alliances
to establish influence,

83
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,299
which displeased the old clans of Xiyan.

84
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,579
Even some local clans found it unacceptable

85
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:22,739
and handed in reports.

86
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,579
These are the accusations.

87
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,060
Please take a look.

88
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,299
You've always prevented those clans

89
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:36,699
from forming alliances,

90
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:38,940
so that they don't group up against us.

91
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,620
But Cang Xuan

92
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,299
is doing the opposite

93
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:44,179
and mingling with them.

94
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,380
I'm afraid

95
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,019
someone may use him

96
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,780
as a disguise

97
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,259
to set up an independent regime.

98
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,220
Since you've investigated everything,

99
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:00,500
I won't read the memorials.

100
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,060
The palace
on Chenrong Mountain is completed.

101
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,859
I intend to visit the Central Plains

102
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,780
and ascend the Zijin Peak

103
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,620
to worship heaven and earth.

104
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,380
Your Majesty, please think twice.

105
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,620
Although all the clans

106
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,060
have submitted to you,

107
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,060
they're not our kind.

108
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
We can't trust them.

109
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:37,579
There was an assassination

110
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,060
during your previous trip.

111
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,139
If you visit the Central Plains,

112
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,380
some sinister people

113
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,859
may try to launch another attack.

114
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,579
I've been ruling
the Central Plains for years.

115
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,699
If someone harbors evil designs

116
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,179
and wants to rebel,

117
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,259
I will happily take them down.

118
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,859
The law of heaven is written.

119
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,859
Fate is not easily changed.

120
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:02,940
We hope that virtues

121
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,780
will preside over Dahuang.

122
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,739
In mid-spring,

123
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,540
head to the Central Plains

124
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,579
and ascend Chenrong Mountain

125
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,299
to worship heaven and earth.

126
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,459
Pay tribute to all gods and deities

127
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,299
and pacify all rivers and lakes.

128
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,579
Xiyan Deyan is made

129
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,699
envoy of the journey

130
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,500
to keep His Majesty company.

131
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,500
Xiyan Yuyang

132
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,060
and General Yinglong

133
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,220
will stay in Xiyan Town

134
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,179
and assist in state affairs.

135
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,379
Your Majesty, you are truly wise.

136
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,740
(Zezhou)

137
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,980
For hundreds of years,

138
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,459
our Xiyan Kingdom hasn't had any wars.

139
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,980
But our soldiers

140
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,780
practice day and night

141
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,340
without any days off.

142
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,699
I invited you
to review troops with me today.

143
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:24,660
How do you feel about it?

144
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,780
They stick to the letter of the law.

145
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,259
Very good.

146
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,780
Very good.

147
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,180
Father's fierce troops

148
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,059
will triumph over

149
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,300
any foreign intruders

150
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,379
or domestic rebels

151
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,819
without a doubt.

152
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,139
This troop review is not a show-off.

153
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,819
It's meant to show you

154
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,059
that you can rest assured
and live in peace

155
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,100
with our soldiers defending the kingdom.

156
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,300
Your Majesty, you're truly wise.

157
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:57,220
It's a blessing for the people.

158
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,860
You may all rise.

159
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:00,819
Tomorrow,

160
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,420
I will hold a feast in Zezhou

161
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,579
to share a few drinks with you.

162
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

163
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:14,139
Your Majesty.

164
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:16,660
Prince Cang Xuan is here.

165
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,980
Would you like to see him?

166
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,379
I don't need his company.

167
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,340
Tell him to stay on Chenrong Mountain.

168
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,259
And the feast tomorrow?

169
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,632
He doesn't have to come.

170
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,300
(Sifang Hall)
Understood.

171
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,019
His Majesty has refused
to see you many times.

172
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,059
He's clearly distancing himself.

173
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,740
Let's go back.

174
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,780
Your Highness.

175
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:03,579
The King of Xiyan

176
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,819
is holding a feast in Zezhou.

177
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,220
Chenrong Mountain is right there.

178
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,660
But he refused

179
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,900
to see Cang Xuan many times.

180
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,900
Everyone knows that he's trying

181
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,100
to suppress Cang Xuan.

182
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,660
Once he makes up his mind,

183
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,819
Cang Xuan may be in danger.

184
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:24,980
Qin Mang,

185
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,220
head to Xiyan Town now

186
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,860
and give it to General Yinglong.

187
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,100
Ru Shou,

188
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,540
go to Chenrong Mountain

189
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,019
and get Xiaoyao and Nian back.

190
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,340
Yes.

191
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,019
Don't touch anything.

192
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:57,699
Sister.

193
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:02,019
The King of Xiyan
has come to the Central Plains.

194
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,540
Why doesn't he meet Xuan?

195
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,499
Is he still mad at him?

196
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,740
How can it be?

197
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,139
Cang Xuan built

198
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,740
the palace
on Chenrong Mountain very well.

199
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,660
That's why the king came.

200
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,019
How can he be mad?

201
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,540
That's good.

202
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,499
Princess.

203
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,619
Ru Shou is here.

204
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,740
Master has something urgent
to discuss with you.

205
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:35,139
Please come back with me now.

206
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,420
What's so urgent?

207
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,819
Is he picking a husband for me again?

208
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,980
Maybe. Maybe not.

209
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:42,499
You will find out.

210
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,420
Tell Father

211
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,340
that I can't go back yet.

212
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,939
He will understand.

213
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,420
Take Nian back with you.

214
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:52,740
Sister.

215
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,660
Why can't you come yet?

216
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,660
The King of Xiyan
will ascend the Chenrong Mountain.

217
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,379
I haven't greeted him

218
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,740
as his granddaughter.

219
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,259
How can I leave now?

220
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:05,180
True.

221
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,740
Good girl. Leave.

222
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,100
I'll be back once I make things clear

223
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,660
with Father.

224
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,740
Alright.

225
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,259
Great Princess, take care.

226
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,340
I will.

227
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:47,980
Be careful.

228
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,059
Master is worried about you.

229
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,340
He sent Ru Shou
to take you back to Wushen Mountain.

230
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,699
Why didn't you go back?

231
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,699
Didn't we have a deal?

232
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,980
We leave or stay together.

233
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,459
You'll be in danger if you stay.

234
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,459
Grandfather invited
all those clans in Zezhou.

235
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,860
Both Fenglong and Xinyue got invited,

236
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
but not me.

237
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,900
Grandfather is suspecting me

238
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,100
due to my uncles' slander.

239
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:15,980
Can you deal with it?

240
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,180
Of course, I can.

241
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:18,860
Then don't drive me away.

242
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,220
Okay, to be honest.

243
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,139
No.

244
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,220
So I can't leave.

245
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,300
You need my protection and support.

246
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,379
Xiaoyao, I beg you.

247
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,939
Leave.

248
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,499
Chenrong Mountain is dangerous now.

249
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,939
No need to worry about me.

250
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm not my mother.

251
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,139
King of Xiyan never raised me.

252
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,699
If he dares to come after us,

253
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,220
I will fight back.

254
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:00,860
He raised you for decades.

255
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,459
If things go wrong

256
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,660
and you can't do it, leave it to me.

257
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,672
(Zezhou Residence)

258
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:35,939
Your Majesty, it's been tiring
for you to hold feasts

259
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,540
and meet the clan chiefs

260
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:38,980
these days.

261
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,900
Please take the medicine and go to bed.

262
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:54,980
Assassins!

263
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:17,740
Keep them alive.

264
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,459
- I failed to keep you safe.
- I failed to keep you safe.

265
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,860
- I deserve any punishment.
- I deserve any punishment.

266
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,220
Investigate it.

267
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,900
Understood.

268
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,860
How did it go?

269
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,420
Your Majesty.

270
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,139
There are ten assassins.

271
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,579
Two of them have tattoos.

272
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,660
The patterns are ordinary,

273
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,939
but they were tattooed with Ruomu syrup.

274
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,540
You can tell how old the tattoos are.

275
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:03,300
Have you checked them?

276
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,259
I've inspected them.

277
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,379
The tattoos

278
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:10,339
are at least 30 years old.

279
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,060
Ruomu is the sacred tree

280
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,339
of the Ruoshui Clan.

281
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:17,900
It's heavily guarded,

282
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,099
so ordinary people can't approach it.

283
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,339
Our aunt was the chief
of the Ruoshui Clan.

284
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,460
After she passed away,

285
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,739
the clan only listens to Cang Xuan.

286
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,499
Is he holding grudges because
Grandfather hasn't paid any attention to him

287
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,859
ever since we came
to the Central Plains?

288
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:40,900
Get Cang Xuan here right now.

289
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,820
His Majesty was attacked due to
the weak defense system in Zezhou.

290
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,300
Triple the guards

291
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,619
to defend Zezhou.

292
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:52,460
Yes.

293
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,739
Uncle, they're all here.

294
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:14,460
Listen up.

295
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,259
Once Cang Xuan enters Zezhou,

296
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,139
do not let him out alive.

297
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,420
Understood.

298
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,660
You have only one mission.

299
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,660
Kill Cang Xuan.

300
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,259
Understood.

301
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:50,739
His Majesty was attacked.

302
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,219
You are summoned

303
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:54,660
to the Zezhou residence

304
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,300
right now.

305
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:58,700
Is Grandfather fine?

306
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:00,060
It was a narrow escape.

307
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,139
Everything is fine.

308
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:02,940
Sorry to disappoint you.

309
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,300
Yue Liang, mind your attitude.

310
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:09,660
Brother.

311
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,460
Grandfather wants to see you. Let's go.

312
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,379
Your Highness.

313
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,780
What on earth is going on?

314
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,259
I have no idea.

315
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,820
Get up.

316
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,019
Something's fishy.

317
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,180
Your Highness can't go.

318
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,460
Zezhou is heavily guarded.

319
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,060
I'm afraid it's a trap.

320
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:37,460
Your Highness can't go.

321
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,820
If you go,

322
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,780
you leave your fate to His Majesty.

323
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,259
Even if he lets you go,

324
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:43,700
Fifth King will try to kill you.

325
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
It's like treading dangerous ground.

326
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:46,848
Your Highness.

327
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:53,499
- Please stay here.
- Please stay here.

328
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,940
I have to go.

329
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,460
Your Highness.

330
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,780
If I don't go,

331
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:11,219
my uncle can frame me
for planning a coup.

332
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,420
Grandfather will send troops

333
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,259
to siege us.

334
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,300
I can't possibly

335
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,739
fight the Xiyan Army.

336
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,219
Once they barge in,

337
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,180
all my followers will be executed.

338
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:22,780
I don't want to die like that.

339
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,499
Neither do I want you talented people

340
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:28,460
to die like that.

341
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,859
I'd like to follow you to Zezhou.

342
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,460
It won't help
if Grandfather wants to kill me.

343
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,859
It only attracts attention.

344
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:37,379
Jun Yi, come with me.

345
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,900
The others shall
wait for me outside Zezhou.

346
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:40,979
Understood.

347
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,940
I'll send you back
to the Shen Mansion just to be safe.

348
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,339
Your Highness.

349
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:02,780
Cang Xuan.

350
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,700
I'll go with you.

351
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,300
You don't have to.

352
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,820
I dare to go

353
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:16,780
because I'm sure I'll make it back.

354
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,900
Why can't I come if you're so confident?

355
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,660
Besides, I want to see my grandfather.

356
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,379
Why are you playing dumb?

357
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,739
Does it make a difference?

358
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,619
You have little spirit power.

359
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:29,499
If something happens,

360
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:30,379
you can't even run.

361
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,379
You'll slow me down.

362
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,660
Do you know you'll cause me trouble?

363
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,339
I'll go even if I cause you trouble.

364
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:37,420
Don't worry.

365
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:39,379
I'm the Princess of Haoling.

366
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,139
Your uncles dare not hurt me.

367
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,580
Even if you tell me to walk away,

368
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,820
I'll secretly follow you to Zezhou.

369
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,099
Let's go.

370
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,739
Do you think Cang Xuan

371
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,300
arranged the assassination?

372
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,019
It doesn't matter who did it.

373
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,460
It's all about who the king suspects.

374
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:16,940
Fifth King may stir things up.

375
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:18,499
Then the King of Xiyan

376
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:20,339
may blame everything on Cang Xuan.

377
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,540
Even if Fifth King didn't stage it,

378
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,060
he wouldn't miss the chance

379
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,499
of killing Cang Xuan.

380
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:31,900
Master, news arrived.

381
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,460
Prince Cang Xuan and Princess

382
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,619
are heading to Zezhou.

383
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,139
- Xiaoyao as well?
- Xiaoyao as well?

384
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:36,859
Yes.

385
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,780
I have to go.

386
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:42,180
I'll go with you.

387
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:43,780
If anything happens to them,

388
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,139
I can help.

389
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,660
Where are you going?

390
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,499
Are you rushing to Zezhou?

391
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:59,379
All the evidence points to Cang Xuan.

392
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,060
Everyone is trying to avoid him.

393
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,619
Aren't you scared
to be seen as his accomplice?

394
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,379
Cang Xuan is obviously framed.

395
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,580
He wouldn't do such a dumb thing.

396
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,979
At this moment,

397
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,780
even if you and Jing rush there,

398
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,940
you can't help him.

399
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,019
You may even offend His Majesty.

400
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:18,499
It's not worth it.

401
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,060
I will go no matter what.

402
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,900
Cang Xuan is my brother.

403
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,180
How can I sit back and do nothing?

404
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:28,099
Jing.

405
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:29,139
Fenglong.

406
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,019
Fenglong.

407
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:37,219
Your Majesty.

408
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:40,099
Prince Cang Xuan arrived at midnight.

409
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,099
He's waiting in the main hall.

410
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,139
Princess Jiuyao is also here.

411
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:49,780
Your Majesty.

412
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,499
King of Haoling, General Yinglong,

413
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,979
and some senior ministers
handed in urgent letters.

414
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,019
They want to plead for Cang Xuan?

415
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:09,859
Your Majesty, Chief Tushan
and Chishui Fenglong are here.

416
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,300
They dare to come at this point.

417
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,379
Are they too young to fear death

418
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:23,019
or do they not believe
I dare to touch them?

419
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:25,900
Bring them in.

420
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,139
His Majesty is in a meeting.

421
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:38,060
Please wait here.

422
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,940
I wonder how Cang Xuan

423
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,019
and Xiaoyao are doing.

424
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,139
May you be well.

425
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,139
May you be well.

426
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,460
Get up.

427
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:11,019
Thank you.

428
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:11,700
Thank you.

429
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:14,900
Xiaoyao, sit.

430
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:18,219
Thank you, Grandfather.

431
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:30,780
Cang Xuan.

432
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:33,619
How is it going

433
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,379
with the renovation?

434
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,499
Grandfather,

435
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,180
the palace is completed

436
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,780
just like the old one.

437
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,700
Cang Xuan has been industrious.

438
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,780
You made all the clans

439
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:47,619
so grateful to you.

440
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:49,339
I'm just...

441
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:52,099
I'm just worried that

442
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,619
you've been there for too long,

443
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,420
thus forgetting your surname

444
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,379
and mistaking it as home.

445
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,300
You should have married someone

446
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,979
from the old clans of Xiyan as your wife.

447
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:04,499
But you married Miss Shen

448
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,979
and truly hurt our feelings.

449
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,379
Your Highness,

450
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:11,180
you probably forgot all about

451
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:12,700
our old clans of Xiyan.

452
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,739
I dare not.

453
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,820
As the Prince of Xiyan,

454
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,339
I only married Miss Shen
to promote harmony with the clans.

455
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:25,259
I didn't mean to drift away from you.

456
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,619
Father, at your service.

457
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:30,979
Deyan.

458
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,460
If you were the King of Xiyan,

459
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:37,900
how will you treat the clans
of the Central Plains?

460
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,060
I dare not.

461
00:26:43,739 --> 00:26:45,180
I'm asking you a question.

462
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,379
Just tell me the truth.

463
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,580
I believe

464
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:55,259
your current method

465
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:56,219
shows true wisdom.

466
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,700
We cannot exclude them

467
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,180
from the court,

468
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,739
but we can't trust them.

469
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,099
Meanwhile, we can't be too on guard.

470
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,060
For long-term peace and stability,

471
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:08,660
we must count on

472
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,739
the old clans of Xiyan

473
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,619
and handle the other clans

474
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,180
with weapons in one hand

475
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,700
and wine in the other.

476
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:21,139
Get up.

477
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:23,859
Thank you, Father.

478
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:25,019
Cang Xuan.

479
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:27,739
What do you think?

480
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:39,540
I believe

481
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:41,820
one can only be their king

482
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,660
once he sees those clansmen

483
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:46,219
as his own citizens.

484
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,460
What are citizens?

485
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,820
What is a king?

486
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:54,780
In the beginning,

487
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,540
Dahuang was a united territory.

488
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,499
If Pangu, Fuxi,

489
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:00,379
or Nuwa comes back to life,

490
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,859
they will see
the Xiyan clan and Chenrong clan

491
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,820
as their own citizens.

492
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:08,060
The Xiyan family
already rules the Central Plains.

493
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,460
How is Zhiyi different from Xiyan Town?

494
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:14,619
How is Chenrong Mountain
different from Xiyan Mountain?

495
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:17,139
They are just cities

496
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:19,780
and mountains of Xiyan Town.

497
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,379
How dare you.

498
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:42,259
He's bold indeed.

499
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,219
Fine.

500
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,219
Get up.

501
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,460
Father.

502
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,940
We haven't figured out

503
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,019
who sent the assassins.

504
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,700
The major suspect is Cang Xuan.

505
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,900
I hate to believe it,

506
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,499
but the tattoos

507
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:40,780
with Ruomu syrup
on the assassins date back decades.

508
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,700
It's solid evidence.

509
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,859
Please look into it, Grandfather.
I have no idea.

510
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,019
The tattoo is the only evidence.

511
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,780
But for your safety,

512
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:51,499
Your Majesty,

513
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:52,700
please put Cang Xuan...

514
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:54,700
Grandfather, I have something to say.

515
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,384
Go ahead.

516
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:57,859
Thank you.

517
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,859
Chief Huhe and Fifth King
are quite sharp-tongued.

518
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,460
Let me ask you something.

519
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,780
Do you find Cang Xuan foolish

520
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,099
or smart?

521
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,780
Of course, His Highness is smart.

522
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,420
Everyone knows

523
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,259
his tie with the Ruoshui Clan.

524
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:16,859
Having a tattoo with Ruomu syrup

525
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:21,019
is like having "Cang Xuan"
tattooed on the assassin's chest.

526
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,099
Fifth King, will you tattoo "Deyan"

527
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:27,820
on your assassin's chest?

528
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:30,499
Nonsense. This is ridiculous.

529
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:33,219
The person
who framed Cang Xuan is clever.

530
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:36,739
He knows that as long as
the king suspects someone

531
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,940
and wants to kill him,

532
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:39,859
the tattoo is just a trigger.

533
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,499
There is always evidence
of treacherous intent.

534
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:46,219
After all, both Cang Xuan and Fifth King

535
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:47,700
are royal descendants.

536
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,940
Who doesn't want to ascend the throne?

537
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,580
Fifth King, you must have

538
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,739
worked hard in secret.

539
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:56,460
Stop slandering me.

540
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,379
Grandfather, you heard him.

541
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,339
Fifth King had no ambition
of taking the throne.

542
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,219
He has never worked on it.

543
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:04,099
Haoling Jiuyao.

544
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,820
Who are you to talk nonsense
and intervene in the regime

545
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,739
of the Xiyan Kingdom?

546
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,139
When my mother led the troops to war,

547
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:11,259
where were you?

548
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,820
If you had stepped out to stop my mother

549
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,700
from intervening in the regime,

550
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,979
I wouldn't have grown up without a mom.

551
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:18,499
You...

552
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:19,060
Cang Xuan.

553
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,940
Do you want to kill me?

554
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,379
Grandfather.

555
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:29,259
It wasn't me.

556
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,820
Were you only building the palace
on Chenrong Mountain?

557
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:37,019
I remember your teaching

558
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:40,619
and only do
what the Prince of Xiyan should do.

559
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,099
Enough.

560
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,499
I believe

561
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:00,420
you didn't organize this assassination.

562
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:03,180
Go back.

563
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:06,139
Thank you, Your Majesty.

564
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,859
I shall take my leave.

565
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:15,619
Thank you, Grandfather.

566
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:39,700
Xiaoyao usually looks easygoing.

567
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,900
But she's really sharp.

568
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:43,580
It was such a tricky question

569
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,580
that Deyan began to stagger.

570
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:45,940
You...

571
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:46,780
You...

572
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,739
She's so articulate.

573
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,780
If someone marries her,

574
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:53,420
he has to lay low

575
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:56,180
to avoid any fights.

576
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,660
They kind of passed a test today.

577
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,379
It calls for a celebration

578
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:07,060
over fine wine in Zhiyi.

579
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,460
I'm afraid that
it won't be easy to leave.

580
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:14,979
What do you mean?

581
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,019
Your Majesty.

582
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:26,740
I heard about the assassination

583
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:28,700
and came to visit.

584
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,339
Since you're all well,

585
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,900
we shall let you rest.

586
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,539
I heard you're
the best chess player in Dahuang.

587
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,700
Since you're here,

588
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:38,740
play a set with me.

589
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:42,420
Yes.

590
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:07,339
Be careful.

591
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:17,900
You'll defend. I'll attack.

592
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,460
Well done.

593
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,940
My spirit power
is enough for three shots.

594
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,660
That's enough.

595
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,099
The arrow is poisoned.

596
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:45,859
You're really outperforming your master.

597
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,700
This is the last shot.

598
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,700
Grandfather lives behind that.

599
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:56,900
I was thinking the same thing.

600
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,940
Assassins!

601
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:31,660
I shall take your life next time.

602
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,339
Your Majesty.

603
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:37,460
There are assassins.

604
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:39,099
We came to your protection.

605
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,700
You may be busy.

606
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,020
I shall take my leave.

607
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,460
I shall take my leave.

608
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,980
Go.

609
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:14,660
Not bad.

610
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,980
Using someone's strength
against himself.

611
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:25,220
General, have you

612
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,740
seen Prince Cang Xuan and Princess?

613
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,020
They have left safe and sound.

614
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,339
So smart.

615
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,220
She managed to escape
from Fifth King's trap

616
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,940
and caused him some trouble.

617
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,539
Yeah.

618
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,180
Cang Xuan is so impressive.

619
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,900
He created something out of nothing

620
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,859
and planted evidence
to frame the culprit

621
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:47,420
with a crafty escape plan.

622
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,859
Let's get out of the city.

623
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,500
We may still catch up with them.

624
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,339
Alright.

625
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,948
(Zezhou)

626
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,460
I can't wait anymore.

627
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:04,420
Get ready.

628
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:05,700
Gather the people.

629
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:07,339
Save His Highness.

630
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:12,539
Your Highness.

631
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,700
Sorry I made you worry.

632
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,180
Why did you come?

633
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:31,339
I toast you

634
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:33,500
with water as wine.

635
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,579
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

636
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,900
Don't mention it.

637
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,779
Fenglong insisted on it.

638
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,339
I only companied him here.

639
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,819
Besides, I didn't really help.

640
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,700
Thankfully, you're safe.

641
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:47,819
We're brothers.

642
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,260
I'll stop the cliché.

643
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,379
Let me toast you

644
00:39:58,539 --> 00:39:59,299
with water too.

645
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,299
Your escape plan

646
00:40:02,379 --> 00:40:03,740
deserves a nice pot of wine.

647
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,099
We'll do it another time.

648
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:06,619
All thanks to the person

649
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,180
who came up with the sneaky plan.

650
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,940
You're the one who planned it?

651
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,700
That's right.

652
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:47,859
Chief Tushan, thanks for coming

653
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,180
to our rescue.

654
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,900
See you around.

655
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,020
See you around.

656
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,139
Stay alert.

657
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,420
Jing.

658
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:46,339
May I talk to you?

659
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:48,940
Xiaoyao...

660
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:52,779
Xiaoyao...

661
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,220
I think...

662
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,900
If you truly like her,

663
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,379
I have no right to object.

664
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:04,539
Jing.

665
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,220
I feel sorry

666
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,339
that I like Xiaoyao.

667
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,460
I wouldn't have done this if you hadn't

668
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,660
gotten married and gotten a kid.

669
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:15,020
I understand.

670
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,420
Xiaoyao is a good girl.

671
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,819
I also hope that

672
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:20,900
she can find someone

673
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,579
who loves her and deserves her.

676

Miao Pu said that

677
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,740
Shen Shutong left

678
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,299
after we came back.

679
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,220
No wonder people want
connection by marriage.

680
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:42,700
At this critical moment,

681
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,299
only the Shen family

682
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:46,099
would dare to come and visit.

683
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,500
Grandfather is worried because

684
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:50,660
the clans of the Central Plains

685
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:52,619
are all connected by marriage.

686
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,700
When are you going to marry Xinyue?

687
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,900
If you get married,

688
00:42:58,339 --> 00:42:59,819
we have a better chance.

689
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,260
It's not up to me.

690
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:04,539
Right now,

691
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,339
she wouldn't even see me,

692
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:07,660
let alone marry me.

693
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:10,099
Apart from you silly girl,

694
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:13,500
people only help me
to get things they want.

695
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:15,819
Do you feel bad?

696
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,420
Why would I?

697
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,900
Life is hard for everyone.

698
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:21,500
Shouldn't we

699
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,460
think for ourselves?

700
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,059
Love is not everything in life.

701
00:43:26,379 --> 00:43:27,900
You can't feed on it

702
00:43:28,379 --> 00:43:30,020
and warm yourself with it.

703
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:32,579
Not many people have unconditional love.

704
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:34,779
Xinyue seems to be demanding,

705
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,740
but she also offers a lot.

706
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
I give her what she wants.

707
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:39,539
Vice versa.

708
00:43:40,379 --> 00:43:41,020
It's fair.

709
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:43,980
I'm glad you got over it.

710
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:46,579
Have I ever been troubled?

711
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,940
You're the troubled one.

712
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:51,339
Yeah.

713
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,099
That's the way it is in this world.

714
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:55,020
But people are greedy.

715
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,859
I just hope that

716
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,940
you can be unique

717
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,660
to Xinyue.

718
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,619
That's enough.

719
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:03,099
I don't care at all.

720
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:04,500
Besides,

721
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,900
she's not unique to me, either.

722
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:09,020
Why do I get to ask her
to find me unique?

723
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:11,579
Stop feeling aggrieved for me.

724
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,660
Hop on. Piggyback.

725
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,539
For real?

726
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:23,940
You think I'm kidding?

727
00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:25,260
I said piggyback.

Alright, alright.

729
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,779
You offered it.

730
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,619
Let's go home.

731
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:34,819
Why don't you want piggyback now?

carry her to save her from walking?

Fine.

00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:43,020

735
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,099
