00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,640
(Chenrong Mansion)

4
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:45,139
When I invited you to stay in Zhiyi,

5
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,538
I didn't expect you to accept.

6
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:48,178
I can't believe you actually agreed.

7
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,139
Living on the mountain is too boring.

8
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:53,139
I'm glad you invited me down
to have some fun.

9
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:56,818
Cang Xuan specifically
told me not to restrain you,

10
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,898
so I arranged
a separate courtyard for you.

11
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:00,779
Do you like it?

12
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:03,979
I like it very much.
Thank you for your kindness.

13
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,779
It's no trouble at all.

14
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:08,299
You don't know how happy I am
that you agreed to come.

15
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,859
My father and brother
are busy most of the time,

16
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,779
and my mother lives
in Chishui for years.

17
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,818
It's nice to have you here
to keep me company.

18
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:16,339
Sure.

19
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:18,699
Xiaoyao.

20
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:24,939
Xiaoyao,

21
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,738
I've prepared a gift for you.

22
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:27,939
I didn't even know

23
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:29,738
that my brother had a gift for you.

24
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,018
Where's the gift? Bring it out.

25
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,139
Bring it in.

26
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:57,139
This is what you mean by a gift?

27
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:58,098
Yes.

28
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,139
I remember it's her favorite.

29
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:02,779
Xiaoyao, eat as much
as you like and let me know

30
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:03,859
if it's not enough.

31
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:06,139
Sure.

32
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:07,618
Idiot.

33
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:10,618
Come in.

34
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,139
Fenglong, are you silly?

35
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,178
That's the Great Princess of Haoling.

36
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,018
I can't believe you gave her

37
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,779
two baskets of melons
for her first gift!

38
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,898
Didn't I give her what she liked?

39
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,939
I specifically sent that
because she likes to eat it.

40
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:31,499
Fenglong, if you give gifts
to girls like this,

41
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:34,098
you won't be able
to get married in this lifetime.

42
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:35,579
No!

43
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,258
So what should I give her?

44
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:38,818
Xinyue, you teach me.

45
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:44,098
The gift you give your crush

46
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,699
should not only suit their interests

47
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:47,499
but also match their status.

48
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:49,458
Xiaoyao is a princess,

49
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:51,538
so the gift you give
should be more valuable

50
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:52,779
and worthy of her.

51
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,018
I see.

52
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:02,378
So it has to be something she likes,
and it has to be valuable.

53
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,859
It should match her status
and show my sincerity.

54
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,299
You're quite teachable.

55
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:32,338
You lost. Drink up.

56
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,378
I have a new game. Want to play?

57
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:55,019
Let's play. Who's afraid?

58
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:56,619
I'll show you. Watch it.

59
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:03,258
Fenglong.

60
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:06,179
What are you doing?

61
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,778
Didn't you say
you brought a gift for Xiaoyao?

62
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:09,979
Why are you drinking now?

63
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,619
I have given the gift.
She loves it very much.

64
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:14,658
What did you give?

65
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:16,019
Just these.

66
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,459
Fenglong gave me a few jars

67
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,776
of wine brewed by the Monkey King.

68
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,459
The taste is indeed extraordinary.

69
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:24,818
Not just wine,

70
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,419
but also the dice made
from a dragon ball.

71
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:31,179
Come with me.

72
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,139
Excuse us for a moment.

73
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:35,019
What? Where are we going?

74
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:36,938
We'll continue when I get back.

75
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:38,299
Sure.

76
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:46,778
Xinyue,

77
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:48,699
I gave Xiaoyao gifts as you suggested,

78
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:49,699
and she really likes them.

79
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,459
As I suggested?

80
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,579
When did I suggest you
give a girl dice and strong liquor?

81
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:58,899
And you even let the girl
drink large bowls of wine?

82
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:01,299
Didn't you say
the gifts should be valuable?

83
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:03,179
The wine I gave is no ordinary wine.

84
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:06,579
It's made by the Monkey King
with thousand-year-old fruits.

85
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:09,098
It's not as good
as Mount Jade's immortal peach wine,

86
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:10,258
but it's still one of the best.

87
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,378
And the die is made from a dragon ball.

88
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,658
The gems embedded in it
were also carefully selected.

89
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:17,579
Xinyue,

90
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,419
for the first time in my life,

91
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,818
I've ever met a girl
so compatible with me.

92
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:24,459
Many other girls are spoiled

93
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,139
and afraid of many things.

94
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:27,739
Xiaoyao is straightforward

95
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:29,338
and will do anything.

96
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,179
Playing dice and drinking games

97
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:36,019
with her is a blast.

98
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,699
You've turned your crush

99
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:39,739
into a buddy.

100
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:41,419
No wonder it's really fun.

101
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:42,859
What?

102
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:43,899
I said...

103
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,179
Stop giving gifts to Xiaoyao.

104
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,098
Just leave it to me.

105
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,979
I noticed you were missing
some make-up stuff,

106
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,139
so I took the liberty
of getting you some.

107
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:02,859
Do you like them?

108
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:17,938
But I don't even know

109
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:19,579
how to use this rouge.

110
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,538
I will teach you.

111
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:23,538
I have spent many years in Xiyan Town,

112
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:26,338
so I know the hairstyles
and makeup that are popular there.

113
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,778
You have spent time in Xiyan Town?

114
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:30,019
Yeah.

115
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,258
After my father took over
the Central Plains

116
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:33,338
as Lord of Zhiyi,

117
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,378
my mother and I went
to Xiyan Town, where we lived

118
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:36,859
for many decades.

119
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,098
What about Fenglong?

120
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:42,880
He's a Chishui, so he stayed in Chishui.

121
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,818
Then you and your mother...

122
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,459
This rouge is quite good-looking.

123
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:58,338
Leave.

124
00:07:59,136 --> 00:07:59,619
Yes.

125
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:09,312
You've seen it.

126
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,120
My mother and I were actually
in Xiyan Town as hostages.

127
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:17,538
Your father was in Zhiyi,

128
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:18,976
your brother was in Chishui,

129
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:20,768
and you and your mother were in Xiyan.

130
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:22,619
You lived in three different places.

131
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,058
There must be some compelling reasons.

132
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:29,818
My father comes
from the Chenrong royal family.

133
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,419
The court was almost unanimous
in its opposition

134
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,619
to handing over
the Central Plains to my father.

135
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,218
Although His Majesty
boldly appointed my father,

136
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:39,698
he's always had doubts about him.

137
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:41,979
So my mother and I
had to be left in Xiyan Town.

138
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,458
We lived there for decades.

139
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,138
Only when His Majesty was sure
that my father had no ulterior motives,

140
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:51,680
did he let my mother and I leave Xiyan.

141
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:56,098
Leaving your homeland
and living in a foreign place

142
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,792
must be hard to get used to, right?

143
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:05,018
At first, it was a bit hard.

144
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:08,299
I didn't understand
why my brother could be in Chishui,

145
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,144
and I had to stay in Xiyan.

146
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,499
I was so young that I even made

147
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:13,979
a scene with my mother.

148
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:18,538
But gradually, I came to understand.

149
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:20,939
Later, I got used to it.

150
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,499
When I left there,
I even felt some reluctance.

151
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:25,819
Right,

152
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,939
when my mother took me
to meet His Majesty,

153
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,218
I also visited the Zhaoyun Hall.

154
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,458
But you and Cang Xuan
were not at Zhaoyun Peak.

155
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,808
Otherwise, we could have become friends
when we were young.

156
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,419
My brother and I also left home

157
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:40,458
when we were very young.

158
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,538
I wandered around Dahuang,

159
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:44,928
and my brother became
a hostage in Haoling.

160
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:48,218
I've never told anyone what I just said.

161
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,458
I just felt that you would understand,

162
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:51,698
so I told you.

163
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:52,778
I understand.

164
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:58,499
Although we can't be childhood friends,

165
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:00,338
it's never too late for us

166
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:01,698
to be besties from now on.

167
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:03,299
Okay.

168
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:05,538
You should try it now.

169
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:08,619
This one.

170
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:11,104
How is it?

171
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:13,056
Don't you like it?

172
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:13,739
Then this one.

173
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:17,248
This one.

174
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:19,098
You like this one?

175
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,578
Jing is very reliable.

176
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,218
He gathered funds
and supplies so quickly,

177
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,338
solving the expenses
for our troop training.

178
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:30,138
He knows we...?

179
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:30,939
Nope.

180
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:33,458
Although I'm daring and reckless,

181
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:35,658
I also know that troop training
must be kept secret

182
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:37,338
and must not be leaked.

183
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,619
Doesn't Jing suspect the purpose
of these funds and supplies?

184
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:44,819
Don't worry.

185
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,018
I've followed him since I was young,

186
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:48,698
calling him "brother" as I grew up.

187
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,218
I know him very well.

188
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:53,619
He must know that something is fishy,

189
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,419
but for my sake,

190
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:57,338
he just helps without asking questions.

191
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:00,458
I gave the palace renovation business
to the Tushan Family

192
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:02,218
just to return the favor.

193
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,098
But instead, I ended up
getting his help again

194
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,698
in gathering military pay and supplies.

195
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:09,819
But we're not trying to exploit him.

196
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,379
Jing helping you is a win-win situation.

197
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:18,138
I hope what he wants is truly money.

198
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:21,419
At least, I can afford that.

199
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:23,898
Jing and I are different.

200
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:26,739
He has no intention of being an official
and just wants to make money.

201
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:28,179
Besides,

202
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:30,698
if he really wants power and position,

203
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:32,379
you can give it to him in the future.

204
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,538
I hope so, as you say.

205
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,018
Come sit here.

206
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:54,698
Are you making medicine?

207
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:57,728
I made some pills to kill time.

208
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:03,698
This one is Jade Skin Pill.

209
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,218
You can put one in the bath.

210
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,458
It can make your skin
as white and smooth as jade.

211
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:11,379
The rest are fragrance pills.

212
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:13,419
Put them in the bath,

213
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:15,018
and they can make your skin smell nice.

214
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:17,619
There are different fragrances
for you to choose from.

215
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:19,499
I'll try it today. Thank you.

216
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,098
You've given me so many gifts before.

217
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:24,658
I just made some small things
to give back to you.

218
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,179
I hope you won't dislike them.

219
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,698
You made them especially for me.

220
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:28,898
I'm more than happy.

221
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:29,979
How could I dislike them?

222
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,138
There's something
I want to ask you in advance.

223
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:39,338
What is it?

224
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,059
Jing is coming to Zhiyi.

225
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,898
My brother and I want
to invite him to stay for a while.

226
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:45,698
I want to ask if you mind.

227
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,299
The mansion is so big.

228
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:51,979
Naturally, the more people, the merrier.

229
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:52,739
That's great.

230
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,379
I'll have someone clean up
the Muxi Garden for Jing right away.

231
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,658
Will Miss Fangfeng come with him?

232
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,619
No, he is coming alone.

233
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:02,698
I don't want to entertain her.

234
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:08,018
I saw you with Miss Fangfeng
all the time before.

235
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,059
I thought you two were very close.

236
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:11,218
Close?

237
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:13,979
I hate her pretentiousness.

238
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,578
People say she deeply cares for Jing,

239
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:20,018
but I think that's all fake.

240
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,218
Why would you say she was insincere?

241
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:25,859
One winter,

242
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,419
our elder celebrated his birthday.

243
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:29,179
We all gathered together.

244
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:32,179
It happened to be snowing,
and the men all went hunting.

245
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,939
Jing couldn't go

246
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,419
because he had injured his leg.

247
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:38,458
But Fangfeng Yiying went hunting

248
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,499
with some other women
who were good at hunting,

249
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:42,458
along with the men.

250
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:44,619
Xiaoyao,

251
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:46,538
what would you do

252
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,778
if your loved one couldn't go hunting

253
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:49,578
due to a leg injury?

254
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:53,098
I would stay with him.

255
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:54,939
Exactly.

256
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:58,658
Later, my brother
came back with the game,

257
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:01,338
but Fangfeng Yiying
was still playing in the mountains.

258
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,379
My brother thought Jing was alone

259
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,338
and felt Fangfeng Yiying
was too playful.

260
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:10,098
My stupid brother didn't understand.

261
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:11,698
Even the most playful woman,

262
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,819
if she cares for a man,

263
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:15,538
will restrain her playful nature.

264
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:19,098
But if she doesn't like him,

265
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:20,939
why doesn't she cancel the engagement?

266
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:22,499
Canceling the engagement?

267
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,338
Would Fangfeng Yiying give it up?

268
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:27,898
Even if she doesn't care about Jing,

269
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,538
she still cares about the position
of the Tushan Family chief's wife.

270
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,338
Why am I talking about her?
So depressing.

271
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:49,898
I didn't expect you
to come to Zhiyi at this time.

272
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,259
I thought you'd be evicting
your family's rule-breakers now.

273
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:54,739
It's all done.

274
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,299
You should have done this long ago.

275
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,979
In my opinion,
you've been too patient with Tushan Hou.

276
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:10,538
Let's not talk about it.

277
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,739
Since you're here this time,
stay for a few more days.

278
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:16,338
Sure.

279
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,698
Jing, don't be nervous.

280
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:26,259
Although there's one more person,
just act as usual.

281
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:28,898
Xiaoyao seems cold
and not easy to approach,

282
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,259
but once you get to know her,

283
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,778
she's more open and bold than men

284
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:32,859
and easy to get along with.

285
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:35,619
Jing.

286
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:00,499
Master Qingqiu, greetings.

287
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:04,098
Your Highness, greetings.

288
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,698
Why are you being so formal?

289
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,419
It's just us today.

290
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:13,179
We're not strangers.

291
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:14,098
Just be casual.

292
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:21,619
Thank you both for your hospitality.

293
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:47,619
Xiaoyao, let me toast you.

294
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:55,179
Sure.

295
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:00,819
Xiaoyao, pace yourself.

296
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,179
Don't worry.

297
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:04,859
My tolerance can make
all three of you fall.

298
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,139
Well, let's see
how you make us three fall.

299
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,418
Xiaoyao is not your buddy.

300
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:14,938
Though we are not buddies,
we are more than them.

301
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:16,818
Come on, Xiaoyao.

302
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:18,818
Cheers.

303
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:38,539
Your Highness.

304
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,739
Any news from Miao Pu?

305
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:43,499
How was Xiaoyao's day today?

306
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,098
The princess is as usual today.

307
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,178
Everything is fine.

308
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:51,779
Did Fenglong take the opportunity
to get close to Xiaoyao?

309
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,859
Miss Chenrong has been trying
to matchmake the princess and him.

310
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:56,779
But according to Miao Pu's observation,

311
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:59,698
they are more like good buddies.

312
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:04,539
Xiaoyao has been disguised
as a man for years.

313
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:06,859
Surely, she can hang out with Fenglong.

314
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:09,019
Your Highness,

315
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,578
Tushan Jing has arrived in Zhiyi

316
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,280
and has moved into Chenrong Mansion.

317
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:51,698
Good.

318
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:53,739
You're flattering me.

319
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:56,298
You wouldn't say that
if you'd heard Jing play.

320
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,338
Right. I haven't heard him play.

321
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,539
Jing hasn't played the guqin
for a long time. Or may I?

322
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,739
Fenglong, when did you
become proficient in the guqin?

323
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:04,779
I didn't know.

324
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:06,338
Playing the guqin isn't my forte,

325
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:07,619
but I have other skills.

326
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,859
Fenglong, no.

327
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,058
Fenglong.

328
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:05,739
Are you gonna drink
because you're happy

329
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:07,739
or because you're sad today?

330
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,379
I'm both happy and sad.

331
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:13,818
Why?

332
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:16,539
Because of you.

333
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,178
Xiaoyao, do you like watching fireworks?

334
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:29,418
I can even conjure them.

335
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,818
- Wait, don't be reckless.
- Catch the ball.

337

Jing, what happened?

345
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:31,298
Jing, are you alright?

346
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:33,458
Yeah, I'm okay.

347
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:34,979
I didn't sit steady

348
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:36,379
and tripped.

349
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:38,899
Fenglong, are you stupid?

350
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:42,098
How could Xiaoyao catch the fireball
condensed by your spirit power?

351
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:44,979
I was thinking
that when Xiaoyao caught the fireball,

352
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,619
the fireworks would bloom in her hand.

353
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,499
I didn't realize she couldn't do it.

354
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:49,418
I was careless.

355
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:52,779
Do you think Xiaoyao is like
your tough-skinned buddies?

356
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:54,418
What if you hurt her?

357
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,418
Jing is beside her, isn't he?

358
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:57,619
I'll be careful next time.

359
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:00,178
Come.

360
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,098
Sit back.

361
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:06,098
Take a drink.

362
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:23,818
Cheers.

363
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,139
Xiaoyao, it's your turn.

364
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:38,178
I haven't formally learned
anything similar.

365
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:41,979
Then I'll sing a folk song for everyone.

366
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:05,196
♪You're like the wind on the water♪

367
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,959
♪I'm like the lotus in the wind♪

♪I'm like the moon in the cloud♪

00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,072
♪We fall in love. We cherish each other♪

373
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:30,720
♪We fall in love. We cherish each other♪

374
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:35,298
Give Tushan Jing 15 years.

375
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:38,304
And 15 years later,
Ye Shiqi will be back to you.

376
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:41,408
Let's high five as an oath.

377
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:47,744
♪Accompany and depend on♪

378
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:53,440

♪Never to part♪

387
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:43,058
Xiaoyao, let's dance.

388
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:43,578
Okay.

389
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:36,448
(Chenrong Mansion)

390
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:40,659
Job well done.

391
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:41,979
Isn't it pretty?

392
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,418
It's pretty,

393
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:48,338
but once I put on shoes and socks,

394
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:49,458
I can't see anything.

395
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:51,259
What's the point of all this effort?

396
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:53,338
How can you understand nothing?

397
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,578
I'll tell you.

398
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,859
Men prefer women's feet
more than their hands.

399
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:04,739
What's so funny about dressing up
for those who please you?

400
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,499
It's not funny at all.

401
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,298
One day when you meet a man you like,

402
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,418
you'll understand what I mean.

403
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:18,298
I want to ask you a question.

404
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:20,739
Your own guqin skills are very good,

405
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,218
but why did you speak so highly

406
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:24,608
of Master Qingqiu yesterday?

407
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:26,539
Is his playing better than yours?

408
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,019
Of course it's better than mine.

409
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:30,979
The sound of his guqin

410
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:32,379
has captivated countless people.

411
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:34,058
My poor skills

412
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:36,818
are nothing compared to his.

413
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,779
Speaking of which,
Jing is quite pitiful.

414
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,418
Master Qingqiu is prominent
around the world.

415
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:46,659
Why is he pitiful?

416
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:50,218
Jing was like a perfect jade,

417
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:53,698
and no members from the Four Great Clans
and Six Great Families could rival him.

418
00:27:54,098 --> 00:27:54,979
I'm not being modest,

419
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,698
but even my brother
couldn't be on par with Jing.

420
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:02,499
But several years ago,
he was missing out of the blue.

421
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,578
After he returned,

422
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:07,098
not only Jing's character was upended,

423
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,818
but also he was severely wounded.

424
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:11,019
One of his legs suffered from disease,

425
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:13,899
and he is not able to play pretty tunes
with his hands anymore.

426
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:17,259
Jing cannot exert his magic
without tunes.

427
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:19,539
So, his spirit power and cultivation
are cut in half.

428
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,779
Such a flawless person
fell from the top.

429
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:26,899
The perfect jade is dusty now.
Isn't he pitiful?

430
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:37,338
What's wrong?

431
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,058
Nothing.

432
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:45,019
I was imagining
Master Qingqiu's prime old days.

433
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:46,779
You could only imagine now.

434
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:51,938
Master Qingqiu's hands were injured,

435
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:53,338
which influences his playing,

436
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:55,859
but he could teach others

437
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:56,779
to play the guqin, right?

438
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,698
Do you want Jing
to teach you to play it?

439
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:06,698
It would be great if you can

440
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:07,859
persuade him to do so.

441
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:11,379
But I am afraid he won't say yes.

442
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:13,938
I can have a try.

443
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:15,659
Maybe he agrees

444
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:16,938
when he sees my sincerity.

445
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:39,659
I knew you wouldn't zone out.

446
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:41,418
Do you need me?

447
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:43,418
Yes. I want to ask you something.

448
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,218
Do you think Xiaoyao likes me?

449
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:04,218
Are we good buddies?

450
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,139
If so, give me some guidance.

451
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:08,619
You want the truth?

452
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,338
Of course.

453
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:13,298
She doesn't like you.

454
00:30:16,578 --> 00:30:17,979
Is it really because my method is wrong?

455
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:20,218
Xinyue scolded me again,

456
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:22,899
saying my actions last night
were utterly foolish.

457
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,178
I was just trying
to seize the opportunity

458
00:30:25,218 --> 00:30:26,779
to put on a good show
in front of Xiaoyao.

459
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:29,859
But nothing seemed to please her.

460
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:33,178
What should I do to make her like me?

461
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:43,298
I always keep Xiaoyao
at a polite distance

462
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:44,619
because I don't want

463
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:45,659
to annoy her.

464
00:30:46,818 --> 00:30:49,259
Is this way of pursuing
a girl too passive?

465
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:53,379
Or should I be more active
and enthusiastic in the future?

466
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:54,818
No way.

467
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:55,739
Why?

468
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,298
Isn't it said that women
can't resist persistent suitors?

469
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,232
You should continue
to treat her with respect.

470
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:06,178
Makes sense.

471
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,458
This way, I can show
my manners and charm,

472
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:11,818
completely different
from Fangfeng Bei's playboy behavior.

473
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:15,739
Alright, I've said what I needed to.

474
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:16,619
I'm leaving now.

475
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:22,659
Let me see you out.

476
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:24,979
Do I need you to walk me out
in my own house?

477
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,379
I want to go for a walk.

478
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:26,938
I'm in.

479
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:27,539
No need.

480
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:44,139
(Such a flawless person
fell from the top.)

481
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:47,098
(The perfect jade is dusty now.
Isn't he pitiful?)

482
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:50,058
Jing is not jade,

483
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:52,338
so there's no such thing as dusty jade.

484
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,659
Tushan Jing is like a bright moon.

485
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:03,298
Though the moon waxes and wanes,

486
00:32:04,032 --> 00:32:05,499
it remains untainted by the darkness,

487
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:07,379
and its radiance is always there.

488
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:10,659
He doesn't need anyone's pity.

489
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:18,976
It's untainted by the darkness,
and the radiance is always there.

490
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:48,178
Jun Yi.

491
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:50,139
Jun Yi.

492
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,338
Any news from the Chenrong Mansion?

493
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:00,859
Yes.

494
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:04,019
Miao Pu said that last night,
the princess, Fenglong,

495
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:06,218
Miss Chenrong and Master Qingqiu

496
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,098
played and feasted in the Muxi Garden.

497
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:11,818
What happened at the party?

498
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:13,899
The princess didn't bring her maids,

499
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,578
so Miao Pu doesn't know the details.

500
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,058
He only knows the princess was drunk

501
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:18,418
and did not return until midnight.

502
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,619
Until midnight?

503
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:24,178
Your Highness,
Miss Chenrong sent another letter.

504
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:25,899
Should I do it like before,

505
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,539
replying to her you are busy
with official duties today

506
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:29,578
and will reschedule?

507
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:32,859
Reply that I am free tomorrow.

508
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:33,979
Yes.

509
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:50,818
Does it look good?

510
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:54,218
Yeah.

511
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,938
I mean the color of my nails.

512
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:03,539
It is hard to match.

513
00:34:04,338 --> 00:34:06,298
I tried many flowers to make it.

514
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,658
I helped Xiaoyao dye
the same color too.

515
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:09,698
She said it was good too.

516
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,819
At the banquet for Jing a few days ago,

517
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,099
Xiaoyao sang a folk song,

518
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:33,299
which suits the scenery here.

519
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:35,019
I'll sing it for you.

520
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:36,579

I still have
a lot of official duties to handle.

539
00:36:03,698 --> 00:36:04,698
You should go back early too.

540
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:10,499
Can't you stay a little longer?

541
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:15,539
Lord Chenrong treasures the palace
on the Chenrong Mountain very much.

542
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:17,539
I can't let him down.

543
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:19,299
So you're so afraid of my father.

544
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,259
Alright, I'll listen to you.

545
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,138
Unlucky for me,

546
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:37,280
I got here just as you were leaving.

547
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,192
You're just in time.

548
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:43,898
Miss Jing Ye is skilled at tea ceremony.

549
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,779
Shan Hu, you've always wanted
to learn it.

550
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:49,539
Today, you can learn from her.

551
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:52,698
Yes, I've always wanted
to learn tea ceremony.

552
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:57,779
Please take good care of her.

553
00:36:59,138 --> 00:36:59,579
Yes.

554
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,019
Please follow me.

555
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:20,979
You are in the garden.

556
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:22,368
Why didn't you come to see me?

557
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:24,299
Can't you find a way to see me

558
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,938
if I don't come to you?

559
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:29,218
I have gone to see you.

560
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:32,539
You've gone to see me?

561
00:37:32,896 --> 00:37:33,779
How come I didn't know?

562
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:36,779
You did it secretly.

563
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:42,178
Do you miss me that much?

564
00:37:42,658 --> 00:37:43,779
I came to the Chenrong Mansion

565
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:45,378
just to see you.

566
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:49,539
I told Xinyue I wanted

567
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:51,539
to learn to play the guqin from you.

568
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:53,698
If you take me as your student,

569
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,259
you can see me every day.

570
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:57,618
Am I smart?

571
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:29,178
Sit down.

572
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:32,339
Sit.

573
00:38:37,658 --> 00:38:39,499
I want to check your leg properly.

574
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,259
In the past, I told you
your leg couldn't be healed

575
00:39:04,698 --> 00:39:06,779
because Wen Xiaoliu and Ye Shiqi

576
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:08,259
couldn't afford the medicine.

577
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:10,059
But now it's different.

578
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,579
No matter how rare the spirit herb is,

579
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:15,418
it's just a matter of time to find.

580
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:19,938
I can't say your leg
can definitely be cured,

581
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:22,259
but I'm sure it won't look abnormal.

582
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
Do you mind it?

583
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:02,698
Do you think I mind it?

584
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:11,979
Since you don't mind,

585
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:14,418
I don't need treatment.

586
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,218
There are more injuries
on my body anyway.

587
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:20,448
They have become a part of my body.

588
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:25,259
I don't mind it,

589
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:29,618
but I mind others mind it.

590
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:32,819
I don't want others to look down on you.

591
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:37,938
The present you are not inferior
to the past Master Qingqiu at all.

592
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:40,858
For me, the present you are even better.

593
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:43,418
I only hope that you could be happy.

594
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:45,458
I understand.

595
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:49,178
You are afraid that I will be upset
when others dislike me.

596
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:50,779
But I won't.

597
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:54,779
Xiaoyao,

598
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:57,378
as long as I have your eyes on me,

599
00:40:58,898 --> 00:41:00,579
I won't be sad

600
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:02,499
about whatever others say.

601
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:28,099
What's on your lips?

602
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:31,739
Rouge.

603
00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:08,378
It's sweet.

604
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:12,898
Your kiss

605
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:16,259
is sweet.

606
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:23,418
Because you are sweet.

607
00:43:30,698 --> 00:43:31,299
Why?

608
00:43:33,499 --> 00:43:34,658
What do you mean?

609
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:39,499
Last time at the beach,

610
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,618
I asked you to kiss me,

611
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:43,979
but you didn't.

612
00:43:45,779 --> 00:43:46,299
I don't know.

613
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,019
Maybe it's because you're too good.

614
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:53,458
I just want you to be mine.

615
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,378
Maybe because I'm very selfish,

616
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:58,739
only thinking about myself.

617
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:01,819
Maybe because

618
00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:06,858
you were too tempting just now.

619
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,299
Don't say anymore.
