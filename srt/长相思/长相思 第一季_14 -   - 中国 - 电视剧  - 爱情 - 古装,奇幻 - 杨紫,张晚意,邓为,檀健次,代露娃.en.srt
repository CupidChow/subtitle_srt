00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,608
=Episode 14=

3
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,593
I'll go with you
to meet King of Haoling.

4
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:10,593
You release Tushan Jing.

5
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,554
I can't trust you anymore.

6
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:16,834
Break his leg,

7
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:18,754
so he can't run anymore.

8
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:30,633
Xuan.

9
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:38,433
Xuan.

10
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,073
(You're really useless.)

11
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:47,754
(You got caught again.)

12
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:50,353
Go to Wushen Mountain.

13
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:56,873
Are you begging for mercy?

14
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,593
Since childhood,

15
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:07,904
I've suffered much more than this.

16
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,914
This pain means nothing.

17
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,754
Weren't you always good at playing coy?

18
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,554
Why are you starting to be tough now?

19
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:30,513
Take him to the prison cart.

20
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:31,274
Yes.

21
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:40,353
Shiqi.

22
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:42,713
Shiqi.

23
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:43,873
Shiqi.

24
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,834
Luckily, it's just a minor injury.

25
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:20,994
I've been testing you,

26
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,353
hoping to make you back off.

27
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:27,513
So, I can leave without any concerns.

28
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:29,473
But you...

29
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:33,994
For Sang Tian'er,

30
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:36,434
life is like a burning stove.

31
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,513
Skinny embraces her,

32
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:41,994
saving her from pain.

33
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:43,714
Indeed,

34
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:45,434
Sang Tian'er

35
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:47,313
stops the pain
of being tortured by life.

36
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,594
But she starts to fear
if Skinny abandons her.

37
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,714
Perhaps many women

38
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:57,994
would choose the latter.

39
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:02,313
So, they won't be tortured by life.

40
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:05,193
At least they can always hope

41
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,513
that the man won't abandon her.

42
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:11,513
But I would rather suffer in life.

43
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:14,554
At least my hands are still free.

44
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,233
I can try to save myself.

45
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,033
In my lifetime,

46
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:35,753
I've suffered too many hardships

47
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,954
and losses.

48
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,874
I don't want to be hurt anymore.

49
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:44,913
I just want to hide in a hard shell.

50
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:04,513
Shiqi.

51
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:06,674
Shiqi.

52
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,753
Careful.

53
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:11,954
How are you doing?

54
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,224
Blood.

55
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:28,554
Your blood?

56
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:35,353
Back then, without my blood
in your medicine,

57
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:38,033
how could you have survived till now?

58
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,633
Xiaoliu, you didn't…

59
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:53,954
Why are you laughing?

60
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,033
I have figured out something.

61
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:01,513
Is Xiang Liu using your blood to heal?

62
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:04,633
Yes.

63
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:07,473
Xiang Liu

64
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,513
has been treating me like a cure-all.

65
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,793
He drinks my blood
without any hesitation.

66
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:16,193
Why don't you take some more?

67
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,033
Don't do this anymore.

68
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,114
Wounds will heal eventually.
No need to use your blood.

69
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,594
You're such a fool.

70
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,192
(Haoling, Dragon Bone Prison)

71
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,513
It seems you're really mad at me.

72
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:54,994
Not everyone has the honor
to enter the Dragon Bone Prison.

73
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,994
Maybe you'll stay here
for the rest of your life.

74
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:03,073
Go.

75
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:28,753
I will save her. Wait for my call.

76
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,513
Your leg is injured.

77
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:57,154
Leaning on me can make you feel better.

78
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,073
It's really quiet here.

79
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:11,954
We can only hear our own heartbeats.

80
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:16,313
How about we never leave?

81
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's stay here forever.

82
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:18,753
Okay.

83
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:20,834
Okay?

84
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,513
Is that so?

85
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:25,234
What's so good
about staying in this prison?

86
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,394
Just you and me. It's serene.

87
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:32,993
Shiqi.

88
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,113
You've been so nice to me

89
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,834
because of your gratitude to me, right?

90
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:46,753
I saved you

91
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:49,073
and have sheltered you
for over six years.

92
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:52,673
You have paid me back this time.

93
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,113
After we get out,

94
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,394
we'll be square.

95
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,753
Rest assured.
I won't trouble you anymore.

96
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,673
I will stay far away from you.

97
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:18,394
I won't leave you.

98
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:20,673
Why?

99
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:22,633
You owe me nothing.

100
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:25,274
Do you still want to be
with me for the rest of your life?

101
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:26,873
Right.

102
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,914
But I'm a man.

103
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:32,113
Don't you think it's weird?

104
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:33,433
You're a woman.

105
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,034
How can you be so sure?

106
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:41,154
Even an astute guy like Xiang Liu

107
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,034
is not sure about it.

108
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:45,553
He hasn't seen part of you.

109
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:47,274
What do you mean?

110
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:52,394
What is it?

111
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:55,313
What do you mean?

112
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:57,513
Tell me.

113
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:58,794
What is it?

114
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:00,433
- Tell me.
- I...

115
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:04,673
When my injury was better,

116
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,073
I took a bath in the tub.

117
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:12,513
I have something else to do.

118
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,834
You bathe by yourself.

119
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:18,513
I saw it.

120
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:22,714
Your face turned red

121
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,154
when you watched my body.

122
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,394
No, you're talking nonsense.

123
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:31,673
I'm not.

124
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:33,113
Yes, you are.

125
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,873
I didn't blush. And I never blush.

126
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:37,073
Xiaoliu.

127
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:40,576
Xiaoliu.

128
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,113
When I was tortured
by my elder brother for three years,

129
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:51,034
I lived like a dead man,

130
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:53,633
hopelessly.

131
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:56,234
You saved me.

132
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:58,234
You told me jokes,

133
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:00,433
combed my hair,

134
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:02,954
and fed me.

135
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,594
My wounds looked horrible and ugly.

136
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:09,553
I didn't even have the courage
to face them.

137
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:12,914
But you took good care of me

138
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:14,954
without any disgust.

139
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,193
When I saw your face turn red,

140
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:21,154
at that moment,

141
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:24,193
I felt like I came back

142
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,433
to life.

143
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,354
In your eyes,

144
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:34,513
I'm still a man

145
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:36,673
who can make you...

146
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,834
Don't say it.

147
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,113
That day you looked at me

148
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,714
and ran away shyly.

149
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:46,993
How could I possibly see you as a man?

150
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:51,594
You're a cunning man.

151
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,354
I always thought you were honest,

152
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,274
but I was deceived.

153
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:00,633
From that day on, I decided

154
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:02,914
I would never leave you.

155
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:10,073
I don't want to be Tushan Jing.

156
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,154
And I don't want to seek revenge.

157
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:15,553
But I'm afraid
my brother will hurt you and others.

158
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:17,313
So I have to go back.

159
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:20,234
I'm my brother's target.

160
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,673
If he knows where I am,

161
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,154
he won't hurt you.

162
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,954
You don't hurt him,

163
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:31,274
but he will hurt you.

164
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,313
For your own safety,

165
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,113
you should kill your elder brother.

166
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:38,154
But if you do,

167
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,794
you will feel guilty,

168
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,633
carrying a burden
for the rest of your life.

169
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:43,834
Forget it.

170
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,873
So, you can't kill him.

171
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,234
I knew you would support me.

172
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:53,234
Jing Ye and the others don't understand

173
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:55,154
why I refuse to seek revenge.

174
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:56,274
I'm not like you.

175
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,633
You are kind-hearted,

176
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,513
while I am astute.

177
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,154
You're thinking for me.

178
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:02,113
Who told you?

179
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:13,394
My mother arranged my marriage
with Fangfeng Yiying.

180
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:15,673
There's only family interest between us,

181
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:16,954
no affection.

182
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,673
Before she came to Qingshui Town,

183
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:20,073
we were never in love.

184
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,073
We didn't even meet.

185
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:21,954
Stop it.

186
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:22,914
No, let me finish.

187
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:24,354
Xiaoliu.

188
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:26,914
I know I'm engaged.

189
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:29,474
I'm in no position to say this.

190
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:31,873
And I can't think about anything else.

191
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:33,914
But,

192
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,474
I will cancel the engagement.

193
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,313
I promise.

194
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:41,193
Give me 20 years.

195
00:14:42,474 --> 00:14:43,794
No, 15 years.

196
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:46,073
15 years later,

197
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:49,354
Ye Shiqi will be together with you.

198
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:58,394
How should I do?

199
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:02,794
You...

200
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,834
You don't fall in love

201
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,354
with any other men.

202
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:03,954
You still don't know me.

203
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:07,113
Well,

204
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,274
My heart

205
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,274
is like a hard shell.

206
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,234
Not to mention 15 years,

207
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:16,034
even 50 years later,

208
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:18,914
other men can't get in.

209
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:23,873
Did you agree?

210
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:28,673
Let's high five for an oath.

211
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:39,089

00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:47,113
I'm so happy.

215
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:57,513
You always say everything is business.

216
00:16:58,474 --> 00:16:59,954
Looking at you now.

217
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:01,954
Why do I feel like I lost?

218
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:03,394
Love

219
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:05,634
can never be measured by interests.

220
00:17:06,954 --> 00:17:08,313
The love between parents and children,

221
00:17:08,714 --> 00:17:09,954
the love between siblings,

222
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:11,634
friendship,

223
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:12,913
and romantic love.

224
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,393
These affections seem commonplace

225
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:17,834
and to be everywhere,

226
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:19,714
but they are hard to get.

227
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:25,536
♪That's our destiny♪

228
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:30,673

Tushan Jing is a good businessman.

230
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,954
They say you are witty and sharp

231
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,474
in business.

232
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:37,634
I never believed it.

233
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,393
I always thought you were dull

234
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:41,913
and inarticulate.

235
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:44,193
I just realized I was wrong.

236
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:48,514
Shiqi.

237
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:51,313
I'm different from you.

238
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:52,634
I'm not a businessman.

239
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,354
But I'm very clear about big things.

240
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:58,754
I'm ruthless to others,

241
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,073
but I'm even more to myself.

242
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:02,594
Can you understand?

243
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:03,673
I understand.

244
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,793
I don't know if you really do.

245
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,114
You don't give yourself hope,

246
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:12,193
don't trust people first,

247
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,313
and don't give first.

248
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:17,954
Sang Tian'er bets on a lifetime
with false heartiness.

249
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:21,073
You treat a man with all your heart.

250
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:22,793
But if he doesn't cherish you,

251
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:24,393
you will abandon him.

252
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,234
I'm willing to wait.

253
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,234
Until you're ready.

254
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:32,714
How?

255
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:37,033
What if I'm never ready?

256
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:38,553
I'll wait a lifetime.

00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:41,193

Go to the seaside.

272
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:39,594
Xiang Liu.

273
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:41,433
Are you desperate to kill me?

274
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:44,594
You even came here.

I'm not here to kill you.

276
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:54,464
What did you do?

277
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:56,954
You left Haoling's army in chaos.

278
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:00,594
Your leg was broken?

279
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:13,634
What can I do?

280
00:21:13,954 --> 00:21:15,634
It's just a misunderstanding.

281
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:20,634
The sea is below the mountain.

282
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:32,874
(I know what you mean.)

283
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:35,754
(As long as I leap into the sea,)

284
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:36,874
(you can take me away.)

285
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:40,114
(But we're in Wushen Mountain.)

286
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,673
(You came alone and got injured.)

287
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,114
(If you take me,)

288
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,273
(I'm afraid we both can't leave alive.)

289
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,153
(Moreover,)

290
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:49,474
(if I leave,)

291
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,033
(what about Shiqi?)

292
00:21:58,714 --> 00:21:59,474
I'm fine.

293
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,874
I don't want to owe you too much.

294
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,634
You should go.

295
00:22:07,474 --> 00:22:08,393
Don't forget

296
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:11,073
you still owe me a debt.

297
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:14,354
Dead people can't repay debts.

298
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:19,834
Don't worry. I'm afraid of death.

299
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:22,273
I'm waiting for you to collect it.

300
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,234
I'll take my leave.

301
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:35,392
Stay back.

302
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,673
Don't waste your efforts.

303
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,673
Since he can come through the sea,

304
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:41,273
he can leave too.

305
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:42,874
Strengthen patrols in the future.

306
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:43,714
Yes.

(Haoling, Wushen Mountain)

308
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:18,153
We've arrived.

309
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:23,136
(Haoling, Cheng'en Palace)

310
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:28,480
(Sunlight Hall)

311
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:57,714
Are you okay?

312
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:02,714
My leg suddenly hurts a bit.

313
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:21,033
This is where I live.

314
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:22,553
You two can stay here for now.

315
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:24,673
Wash up, get changed, and have a rest.

316
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:29,234
Thanks, Your Highness.

317
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:40,273
Today after the court session,
I will report to His Majesty

318
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:41,594
that you're already here.

319
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:43,793
Xiaoliu.

320
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,234
His Majesty could summon you
at any time.

321
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,153
Cure my leg.

322
00:24:57,834 --> 00:25:00,393
I can, but you'd better not run around.

323
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,354
If Nian sees you,

324
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:06,273
you might suffer more.

325
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:09,073
I'm hungry.

326
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:11,634
Prepare a meal.

327
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:13,193
Take them to bathe and get changed.

328
00:25:13,793 --> 00:25:14,594
Yes.

329
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:42,954
Be careful.

330
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,954
The physician warned not to walk around.

331
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:48,273
It will take one

332
00:25:48,793 --> 00:25:50,793
to three months to heal.

333
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,193
I have a special constitution
and will recover quickly.

334
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:02,714
There are nice things in this place.

335
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:05,433
Maybe they can heal your old injuries.

336
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:08,514
But you might have to suffer a bit.

337
00:26:12,714 --> 00:26:13,714
I don't mind.

338
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:21,474
Have a rest if you're tired.

339
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:41,553
You should rest too.

340
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,634
But,

341
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,393
I don't want you to leave.

342
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:52,193
Are you troubled by the King of Haoling?

343
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:27,193
No matter what,

344
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:29,954
I will be here for you.

345
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:42,913
Summon Wen Xiaoliu.

346
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:41,433
I'm Ye Shiqi. Greetings, Your Majesty.

347
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,234
Wen Xiaoliu's leg is injured
and he can't curtsy.

348
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:49,634
Please forgive him.

349
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:23,754
Who injured your leg?

350
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:27,033
I did.

351
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,594
He was trying to escape,

352
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:32,954
so I slightly punished him.

353
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,354
Stay for a meal together.

354
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:08,234
Shiqi.

355
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:54,474
Thanks.

356
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:05,393
I'm a countryman.

357
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:08,073
It's my first time
seeing so much delicious food.

358
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:09,994
Please forgive me
if I behave improperly.

359
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:11,673
What do you like?

360
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:14,673
I like money.

361
00:31:14,994 --> 00:31:16,433
It's best

362
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:18,313
if I have a magic money tree.

363
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:19,834
What kind of food do you like?

364
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:22,273
I'm not picky.

365
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:23,714
I eat anything like chitterlings,

366
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,193
and chicken arse.

367
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:27,234
I've already asked the chef
to prepare Qing'ai Cake.

368
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:28,834
If there's anything else
you want to eat,

369
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:30,234
I'll have the chef make it for you.

370
00:31:32,313 --> 00:31:33,433
You can eat some

371
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,234
while listening to a story before bed.

372
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:45,354
I don't like Longan.

373
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:49,073
You eat this.

374
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:56,553
Your favorite Qing'ai Cake.

375
00:31:58,393 --> 00:31:59,834
There's only one piece left.

376
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:01,354
I want to eat it

377
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,193
while my mother tells me a story.

378
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:06,553
Xiaoyao.

379
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:12,073
Did you not finish your dinner

380
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:13,714
for eating snacks before bed?

381
00:32:15,954 --> 00:32:16,994
You can't do this again.

382
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:22,433
But my father said

383
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:25,273
I can eat whenever I want.

384
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,073
I'm just a countryman.

385
00:32:46,913 --> 00:32:48,793
I'm not picky.

386
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:50,354
I've eaten enough.

387
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:55,714
I'm done. Let's go.

388
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:04,153
Thanks for your meal, Your Majesty.

389
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:05,754
I will take our leave.

390
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:06,754
You may go.

391
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:36,874
Master, who is Wen Xiaoliu?

392
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,136
Who do you think he is?

393
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:41,114
When you asked me to bring him back,

394
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:43,913
you said he was the son
of an old friend.

395
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:46,313
I thought he was the son of Fifth King.

396
00:33:47,514 --> 00:33:49,354
But Qing'ai Cake is Xiaoyao's favorite.

397
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:53,954
She liked eating snacks

398
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:56,954
while listening to stories before bed.

399
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:00,033
Wen Xiaoliu is...

400
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:04,193
He is Xiaoyao?

401
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:06,594
I couldn't
see through his illusion technique,

402
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,034
so I don't know

403
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:11,113
who he really is.

404
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:13,393
Master, you think the same, don't you?

405
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,593
I'm going to ask him who he is

406
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:19,873
and why he doesn't tell me.

407
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:20,954
Stop.

408
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,873
Don't you want to know the truth?

409
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:29,794
Xiaoyao is your daughter.

410
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,153
Nobody

411
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:32,714
can decide who he is.

412
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:35,193
It's up to him.

413
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:49,353
Some harm is caused not only

414
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:51,314
in the name of evil,

415
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,633
but in the name of love.

416
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:56,992
You want to know who he is.

417
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:58,314
So do I.

418
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:01,074
But don't press him to tell us.

419
00:35:01,673 --> 00:35:02,633
Give him more time

420
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:04,913
to tell us personally.

421
00:35:08,714 --> 00:35:10,193
I don't understand.

422
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:14,633
You will understand one day.

423
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:12,034
Hold on.

424
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:29,593
(In fact, you've already
told me who you are.)

425
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:33,754
(But I was blinded by cruelty)

426
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,274
(and failed to notice it.)

427
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:55,034
I don't eat Longan.

428
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:11,514
Your highness.

429
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:17,833
