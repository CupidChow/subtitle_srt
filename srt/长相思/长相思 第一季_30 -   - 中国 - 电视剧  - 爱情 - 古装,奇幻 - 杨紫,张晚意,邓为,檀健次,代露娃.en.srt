00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,444
=Episode 30=

3
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,699
You besieged me!

4
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,739
Come on. Come on.

5
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,747
Xiaoyao, help me.

6
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:13,786
Where is she? Where does she go?

7
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:16,586
Come and get me.

8
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,066
Come and get me.

9
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,747
Come on.

10
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:13,506
Don't you want me dead?

11
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:14,986
Go ahead.

12
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:18,387
Show me what else you're capable of.

13
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:30,667
Why?

14
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,506
We've never met before.

15
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,547
What have I done to you?

16
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:38,026
Why do you hate me

17
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:41,186
and want me dead so much?

18
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:42,906
(Mu Fei)

19
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,107
(Mu Fei)
What have you done?

20
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:48,066
The entire Mu family...

21
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,906
Chi Chen wiped out your clan.

22
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:51,226
What does it have to do with me?

23
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:53,226
What does Chi Chen have to do with you?

24
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:55,306
Stop pretending.

25
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:58,626
Chi Chen killed all our families.

26
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:02,306
Today, we will kill his only daughter.

27
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,587
You got it wrong.

28
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:06,147
I have nothing to do with Chi Chen.

29
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,267
My father is the King of Haoling.

30
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,066
Mu Fei.

31
00:05:44,026 --> 00:05:47,186
I have nothing to do with Chi Chen.

32
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,867
My father is the King of Haoling.

33
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:55,346
This bloodshed

34
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,066
is a tribute to the Zhan family.

35
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:14,506
My father

36
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:18,306
is the King of Haoling.

37
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:21,906
This bloodshed
is a tribute to the Jin family.

38
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:30,066
This bloodshed
is a tribute to the Shen family.

39
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,547
You...

40
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,066
You got the wrong person.

41
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:38,427
I am

42
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:44,267
the daughter of the King of Haoling.

43
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:51,506
Grandfather.

44
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:54,506
Father.

45
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:58,226
Mother.

46
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:02,906
Brother.

47
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:04,306
Sister-in-law.

48
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:10,026
Rest in peace.

49
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,587
Mr. Xiang. What's wrong?

50
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,987
Mr. Xiang. Mr. Xiang.

51
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,746
What's wrong, Your Highness?

52
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:03,867
My heart is racing for no reason.

53
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:06,107
Shall we get a physician
to check on you?

54
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,066
The last time my heart raced,

55
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:14,707
my father died in the war.

56
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:17,587
Jun Yi, Xiaoxiao.

57
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:22,226
Take some people to Zhiyi,
and bring Xiaoyao to me.

58
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:24,867
Keep her alive no matter what.

59
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:25,587
Understood.

60
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:26,547
Please rest assured.

61
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:27,547
The princess is in Zhiyi.

62
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:30,066
None of His Majesty,
the Chenrong and the Chishui families

63
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:31,267
would do anything to her.

64
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:33,106
I'm heading to Zhiyi.

65
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:36,467
Your Highness. Your Highness.

66
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:41,306
Grandmother.

67
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:43,746
Take medicine.

68
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:46,306
Don't bother

69
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:47,467
with those chores.

70
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:49,467
If you're really filial,

71
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:51,907
just stop going against me.

72
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:53,666
You wouldn't get married.

73
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:56,827
You wouldn't take over
and be the clan's leader.

74
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,546
How long are you going to stall it?

75
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:05,787
We searched all around
but couldn't find her.

76
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,027
If anything happens to her,

77
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:07,467
I...

78
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:08,787
It's too early for that.

79
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,066
Get reinforcement to look for Xiaoyao.

80
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:11,626
Okay.

81
00:09:11,787 --> 00:09:12,027
Split up.

82
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:14,666
Princess.

83
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,866
- Xiaoyao.
- Princess.

84
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:17,866
Xiaoyao.

85
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:37,907
Xiaoyao.

86
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:38,866
Xiaoyao.

87
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:07,986
Xiaoyao.

88
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,467
You'll be fine.

89
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:39,306
Xiaoyao.

90
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:41,066
You'll be fine.

91
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,347
You'll be fine
after having all my spirit power.

92
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:58,426
Xiaoyao.

93
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:00,666
Wake up. Don't sleep.

94
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:14,306
Xiaoyao.

95
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:15,866
Xiaoyao.

96
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:18,467
Wake up.

97
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,227
Don't sleep.

98
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:21,707
Xiaoyao.

99
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:25,707
Xiaoyao.

100
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,907
Xiaoyao, I'm begging you.

101
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:41,267
I'm sorry.

102
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,947
It was my fault.

103
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,106
I shouldn't have left you.

104
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,106
No matter what,

105
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,426
I shouldn't have left you.

106
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,186
I was too greedy

107
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:53,506
to give up my status as Tushan Jing.

108
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:00,064
Xiaoyao.

109
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,027
Please.

110
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,387
Open your eyes and look at me.

111
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:08,106
I'm your Shiqi.

112
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:09,827
Xiaoyao.

113
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:58,176
Xiaoyao.

114
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:02,347
I only want to be your Ye Shiqi.

115
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:09,027
Didn't we agree that
I'll be with you forever?

116
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:12,986
You can't abandon me.

117
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:18,387
Wherever you go,

118
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,027
I'll follow you.

119
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:11,147
Princess.

120
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:12,426
Xiaoyao.

121
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,267
Princess.

122
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:14,907
Xiaoyao.

123
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:23,546
Xiaoyao is in there.

124
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,907
She must be in there.

125
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,106
- Your Highness.
- Xiaoyao.

126
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:29,907
Let go of me. Jun Yi, let go of me.

127
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:31,227
Don't go in, Your Highness.

128
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,147
I have to save Xiaoyao.

129
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:35,584
- It's a deadly formation activated.
- She's in the fire. I must save her.

130
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:36,986
Let's save her.

131
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:38,027
Xiaoyao.

132
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,106
- Let go of me.
- Your Highness.

133
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,027
Protect him.

134
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:51,506
We're dead if we're not back in an hour.

135
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:53,467
And you'll escort him
back to Chenrong Mountain.

136
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:54,752
Go.

137
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:19,787
Princess.

138
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:20,866
Princess.

139
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,787
- Princess.
- Princess.

140
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:25,666
- Princess.
- Princess.

141
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,312
- Princess.
- Princess.

142
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,147
Protect the princess.

143
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:35,827
Princess.

144
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:50,827
- Get both of them out.
- Yes!

145
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:17,587
Xiaoyao.

146
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:19,666
Xiaoyao.

147
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:21,146
Xiaoyao.

148
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,146
Where is Xiaoyao?

149
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:30,546
I've brought her back from the fire.

150
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,266
I have to see her.

151
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:52,707
Your Highness.

152
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:54,146
How is she?

153
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,026
When will she wake up?

154
00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:58,227
The princess passed away.

155
00:17:58,386 --> 00:17:59,747
Don't talk nonsense.

156
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:04,867
No way.

157
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:08,026
Isn't she lying there?

158
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,266
How can she be dead?

159
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:10,747
She was badly injured.

160
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,146
She stopped breathing.

161
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:21,827
Xiaoyao.

162
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:28,707
No way.

163
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:32,000
She can't die.

164
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:43,426
If you can't heal her,
I'll get someone else.

165
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:45,666
In such a vast world,
I'm sure someone can cure her.

166
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:48,827
Jin Xuan. Ask His Majesty

167
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:50,627
to send best physicians
with best medicine now.

168
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:51,296
Understood.

169
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:06,707
Chubby. Faster.

170
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:23,867
- Give her spirit power.
- Understood.

171
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:44,587
Xiaoyao.

172
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:45,906
Don't be scared.

173
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:48,786
I'm here.

174
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,066
I know how tough you are.

175
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,347
You can pull it through.

176
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,107
Xiaoyao.

177
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:57,867
You know what it's like
to be left behind.

178
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,227
You can't abandon me.

179
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:04,186
Didn't we have a deal?

180
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:06,827
We will cover the Zijin Peak

181
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,026
in Poinciana trees.

182
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:13,426
And I will set up a swing
like the one we had.

183
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,426
We will make this place our home.

184
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,467
You must keep your word.

185
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:24,747
Stay with me.

186
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:40,906
Her hands got warm.

187
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:43,168
The spirit power worked.

188
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:45,827
Sang.

189
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,186
Gather all the guards
to give her spirit power in turn.

190
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:51,520
Understood.

191
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,827
Your Highness. Miss Chenrong is here.

192
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:35,426
They're the best physicians
in the Central Plains

193
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:38,666
who learned from the Chenrong Physician.

194
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,627
I brought them here for curing Xiaoyao.

195
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:42,546
Thank you.

196
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

197
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:54,386
Cang Xuan.

198
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:02,666
Thank you.

199
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,906
I will do everything to save Xiaoyao.

200
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:20,066
Your Highness. Sorry we failed to help.

201
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:28,426
You may leave.

202
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:29,426
Understood.

203
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:30,747
It's all my fault.

204
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,186
If I hadn't taken Xiaoyao
to the plum blossom wood,

205
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,186
it wouldn't have happened.

206
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:50,507
It's not your fault.

207
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:55,347
The murderer planned it well

208
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:58,906
and would have used anyone if not you.

209
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,546
Don't blame yourself.

210
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,306
I will start by talking to
my cousin Miss Shen.

211
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,467
I will get to the bottom of it.

212
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:10,386
Thank you.

213
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:14,386
My condolences. Xiaoyao has...

214
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:19,707
Take care of yourself

215
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:21,266
while you take care of Xiaoyao.

216
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:24,906
These are the rare spiritual medicines
of Chenrong Mansion.

217
00:24:25,227 --> 00:24:26,347
Try and see if they help.

218
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:28,426
Thank you.

219
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:31,186
You can't help around here.

220
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:32,827
Why don't you check with Shen Shuhui

221
00:24:33,627 --> 00:24:36,066
when the clues are still there?

222
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:37,186
I'm going now.

223
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:39,186
Don't worry.

224
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:41,146
I will find the truth.

225
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:42,227
Thank you.

226
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:45,507
This is what I should do.

227
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:59,386
The princess is dead for real?

228
00:25:00,587 --> 00:25:01,666
She is dead for real.

229
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:04,306
No heartbeats. No pulses.

230
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:06,827
The organs are still operating,

231
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,987
but it's all because of
the endless spirit power input.

232
00:25:10,786 --> 00:25:12,227
The moment they stop that,

233
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:14,347
her organs will stop operating.

234
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,747
Xiaoyao is gone.

235
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:20,426
But Cang Xuan wouldn't accept it.

236
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,707
He trusts you people.

237
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:24,347
Try to console him.

238
00:25:25,227 --> 00:25:26,786
His Highness understands everything.

239
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:28,947
But he doesn't

240
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:30,347
allow anyone to say it out.

241
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,026
No wonder you stopped me back there.

242
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:34,467
Thank you.

243
00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:37,026
Don't mention it.

244
00:25:56,587 --> 00:25:57,184
Back off.

245
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
(Chenrong Mountain)

246
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:02,186
Barge in.

247
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:44,026
Your Highness.

248
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:46,587
Someone is barging in for trouble.

249
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:47,507
I got him.

250
00:26:48,786 --> 00:26:51,467
His spirit power can sustain him
against our formation.

251
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:52,987
You shouldn't take the risk.

252
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:53,987
Please stay here.

253
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:55,467
This person came right now

254
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:57,827
most probably because of Xiaoyao.

255
00:26:58,306 --> 00:26:59,146
How can I let him go?

256
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:04,026
Protect the princess.

257
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:05,467
Understood.

258
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:23,906
An old acquaintance.

259
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:28,587
Did you come
all the way here to kill me?

260
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:41,107
I'm not here to kill someone,

261
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:46,066
but to save an acquaintance
back in Qingshui Town.

262
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:57,987
Standing in the way

263
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:02,666
would be sending her to die.

264
00:28:22,587 --> 00:28:23,947
I've concealed the news.

265
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:26,906
How do you know she's in danger?

266
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,987
Maybe you're the one who set this up.

267
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:30,347
Back then,

268
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,906
Xuan got poisoned by Wen Xiaoliu.

269
00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:35,987
Xiaoliu transferred it

270
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:38,906
to someone else to detoxicate Xuan.

271
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:41,426
You have the poisonous bug?

272
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,066
That's right.

273
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,026
Why did you agree to do that
for Wen Xiaoliu?

274
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:48,507
It's between me and Wen Xiaoliu.

275
00:28:54,987 --> 00:28:55,786
You can save her?

276
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:57,066
Let me take her.

277
00:28:58,666 --> 00:28:59,386
I can save her.

278
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:00,467
Take her?

279
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:03,227
What do you mean?

280
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:06,467
Can't you save her here?

281
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:07,347
No.

282
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:09,347
Xiang Liu.

283
00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:11,867
We're enemies.

284
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:13,906
Why would I trust you

285
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,827
and hand over Xiaoyao?

286
00:29:17,227 --> 00:29:18,546
If you don't,

287
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:22,227
she will be dead.

288
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:29,786
Come with me.

289
00:29:53,947 --> 00:29:55,306
I can't tell what's going on

290
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:57,947
without a thorough checkup.

291
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,107
Thankfully, you let so many people

292
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:38,426
keep giving her spirit power

293
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,146
and bought her some time.

294
00:30:42,186 --> 00:30:43,906
Otherwise, I can't save her

295
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:46,066
at this point.

296
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:48,587
How long do you need?

297
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:51,186
I don't know.

298
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:53,747
Maybe a year or two.

299
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:58,347
Maybe decades.

300
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:30,587
We're running out of time.

301
00:31:31,827 --> 00:31:32,987
Even I can't save her

302
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:35,867
if we miss the best timing.

303
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:44,146
(As long as you can recover,)

304
00:31:45,546 --> 00:31:46,627
(I will try anything)

305
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,587
(no matter what.)

306
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:54,867
Take her.

307
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:01,107
Xiang Liu.

308
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,627
If you dare to hurt her,

309
00:32:05,786 --> 00:32:07,786
I will wipe out the Chenrong Army

310
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:10,306
and shred you into pieces.

311
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:14,627
Even if I don't hurt her,

312
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:18,467
won't you still want to
wipe out the Chenrong Army

313
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,827
and shred me into pieces?

314
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:27,306
You're so crazy
that you're almost interesting.

315
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:31,306
No wonder Xiaoyao
became friends with you.

316
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:38,507
Give me your best spiritual medicines.

317
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:41,786
Jin Xuan.

318
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,107
Is that enough?

319
00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:49,467
I can get more if it's not enough.

320
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:54,386
It's enough.

321
00:32:56,227 --> 00:32:58,347
No wonder everyone craves power.

322
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:02,747
The power
to plead for spiritual medicines?

323
00:33:04,627 --> 00:33:05,987
If I'm truly in power,

324
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,026
I wouldn't be so helpless here

325
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:13,186
and let you do whatever you want.

326
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:15,906
Even your grandfather can't contain me.

327
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:22,546
Let's talk business

328
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:24,426
and agree on a deal.

329
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,666
If you can cure Xiaoyao,

330
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,827
I'll give you whatever you want.

331
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:34,507
Remember what you said.

332
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:38,186
Xiaoxiao.

333
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:40,747
Take him out from the secret path.

334
00:33:41,906 --> 00:33:42,560
Understood.

335
00:33:45,347 --> 00:33:45,867
Don't worry.

336
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:51,386
I won't let anyone gossip about
Princess and me, the furtive demon,

337
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:53,386
and ruin her reputation.

338
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,066
I only save her.

339
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:17,787
I won't let anyone gossip about

340
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:19,826
Princess and me, the furtive demon,

341
00:34:20,906 --> 00:34:22,186

was pierced by endless darts.

375
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:14,586
It was torture.

376
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:17,987
Such a murder method
is usually adopted in revenge.

377
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:21,027
Although we saw only the fire formation,

378
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:23,227
judging from her wounds,

379
00:38:23,747 --> 00:38:25,586
there were warriors
of Water and Wood spirits.

380
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:26,906
Preliminary speaking,

381
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,146
the formation was set up
by at least three people.

382
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:34,467
It was a well-planned assassination
with a clear target.

383
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,586
It took time to plan it.

384
00:38:37,826 --> 00:38:40,787
At least one of the murderers
knows Miss Shen well enough

385
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,826
to persuade her or get informed

386
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,906
that she would invite
Miss Xinyue and Princess over for fun.

387
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:47,507
Look into it.

388
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:50,707
Once you find them,

389
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:54,346
keep them alive at all costs.

390
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:59,586
Death is too much of a mercy for them.

391
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,386
Understood.

392
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:03,747
How is Tushan Jing?

393
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:06,626
I heard he wasn't badly injured.

394
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,987
But he committed suicide out of grief.

395
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:10,747
So he's still in a coma.

396
00:39:12,146 --> 00:39:13,666
He committed suicide?

397
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,507
He deserves to be favored by Xiaoyao.

398
00:39:20,106 --> 00:39:21,507
Feed him spiritual medicines.

399
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:24,787
He will naturally wake up

400
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:26,987
once Xiaoyao revives.

401
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,267
Due to his peculiar status,

402
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:30,787
you may be misunderstood

403
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:34,586
and be in trouble
if we don't handle it well enough.

404
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:38,787
I've written to
the Grand Madam of Tushan.

405
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:40,426
She was probably worried

406
00:39:40,426 --> 00:39:41,826
that someone would hurt him there,

407
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:44,027
so she told me to bring him here.

408
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:45,787
Don't worry.

409
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:47,626
I've explained to Grand Madam.

410
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,666
Both Jing and Xiaoyao are victims.

411
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:51,426
She won't blame it on you.

412
00:39:52,787 --> 00:39:53,626
Thank you.

413
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:55,987
Don't mention it.

414
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:08,666
But did you really
let Xiang Liu take Xiaoyao?

415
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:10,987
Physicians in Xiyan and Haoling

416
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:13,426
can't be better than
the disciples of the Yinhe Physician.

417
00:40:14,106 --> 00:40:16,067
He's the only one who can save Xiaoyao.

418
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:20,866
We don't know if Xiang Liu is honest.

419
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:22,586
But if I were you,

420
00:40:23,146 --> 00:40:24,307
I'd have trusted him too.

421
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:27,666
After all, that's
the only chance for Xiaoyao.

422
00:40:28,146 --> 00:40:28,826
Besides,

423
00:40:29,787 --> 00:40:31,507
Xiang Liu has to save her first

424
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:34,426
to talk business with you
or the King of Xiyan.

425
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:36,227
He will do his best.

426
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:38,906
That's what I thought.

427
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:45,987
Let me do it.

428
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,386
What on earth

429
00:40:58,067 --> 00:40:59,787
made Master suffer so much

430
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:01,227
that he wanted to die?

431
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,947
I hope the person

432
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:05,067
who made Master play the zither again
can recover soon.

433
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:07,826
Otherwise, I'm afraid that

434
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:09,547
there's no cure for Master.

435
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:10,987
What did you say?

436
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:19,267
I said I hope Master can wake up soon.
