00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 23=

3
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:07,513
Put on the mask.

4
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:10,074
Nobody will recognize you

5
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,913
while you enjoy yourself.

6
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:19,154
The Lirong Family owns this casino.

7
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:22,273
And their ancestors
were the Two-headed Hound.

8
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:26,193
Do I have to wear it?

9
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:29,753
As you wish.

10
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:40,553
I am Doggie Bei.

11
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,033
If you are beaten up

12
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,314
and thrown out by Lirong Family,

13
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:45,393
don't blame me for that.

14
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:49,273
Doggie Bei is quite nervous now.

15
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:52,753
Young lady.

16
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,553
Please. Be quiet.

17
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:57,434
I'm afraid of Lirong Family.

18
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:23,633
Kill him.

19
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:25,393
Hit him.

20
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:27,354
Come on.

21
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:28,753
Get him.

22
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:37,594
Get up.

23
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,954
Come on. Kill him.

24
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:40,553
Get up.

25
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:56,714
Keep going.

26
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:31,914
Bad luck.

27
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:33,233
Let's go.

28
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:23,953
He won't last much longer.

29
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:33,994
Once the heart dies,

30
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:36,673
he will feel hopeless.

31
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:45,314
Why don't we make a bet?

32
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,393
On what?

33
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,634
Bet on who can arouse his hope.

34
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:07,994
What? Can't you?

35
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:13,594
Interesting. You go first.

36
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:38,673
What are you doing?

37
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:44,233
Thank you.

38
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:57,434
What's your name?

39
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:09,194
Don't be afraid.

40
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:16,434
You have to believe

41
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:20,594
life is worth living
for something beautiful

42
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:22,673
in this world.

43
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,154
Stop laughing. It's your turn.

44
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:29,154
I won.

45
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:33,673
That's impossible. You cheated.

46
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,874
You must know him.

47
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:37,514
I swear.
I met him for the first time today.

48
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:40,913
What did you say to him?

49
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,194
It's a secret.

50
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,473
What did you say to him?

51
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:03,074
If you hug me,

52
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:04,473
I will tell you.

53
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,033
Beauty trap doesn't work on him,

54
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:08,634
but it works on me.

55
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:09,994
Forget it.

56
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,194
Fine, I'll tell you.

57
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:13,394
I'm not interested.

58
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:18,113
Are you sure?

59
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:18,713
Yes.

60
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:21,954
But I want to tell you.

61
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:23,353
I beg you.

62
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:26,113
Beg me?

63
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:29,233
Okay, how are you going to beg me?

64
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:31,233
I'll hug you.

65
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,793
I'm willing to throw myself at you.

66
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,194
Fangfeng Bei, are you making fun of me?

67
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:43,514
Are you going to say?

68
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,314
If not, I will really get angry.

69
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:47,434
Fine, I'll tell you.

70
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:51,954
I told that slave

71
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,834
I was once a slave in the arena,

72
00:09:58,074 --> 00:09:59,434
but I survived.

73
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:02,754
You lied to him.

74
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:05,634
About the hope,

75
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:07,593
it's elusive.

76
00:10:09,353 --> 00:10:10,713
Although he is locked in a cage,

77
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,832
he is very clever.

78
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:15,033
He won't easily believe what you said.

79
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:17,233
You must have done something else.

80
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:22,074
Because I talked to him
with a special language

81
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:25,634
of the demon slaves in the arena.

82
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:29,314
It's said even the slave owners
can't understand it.

83
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:30,994
How do you know it?

84
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:35,274
Maybe I was really a slave in the arena.

85
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:41,874
Who are you?

86
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,033
Who do you hope I am?

87
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:17,394
Our hearts beat at the same pace.

88
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:22,593
Right.

89
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:26,434
They're almost beating at the same pace.

90
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:12,194
You have to meet

91
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:13,952
with local managers and handle affairs

92
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,353
along the way.

93
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:17,634
You must be exhausted.

94
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:42,194
My second brother.

95
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:58,514
Stop.

96
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:08,353
Brother.

97
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:12,434
Yiying? It's been a long time.

98
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,913
This must be Master Qingqiu,

99
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:30,153
my famous future brother-in-law, right?

100
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:34,194
Nice to meet you.

101
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:36,874
This is my second brother.

102
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,553
He's always been casual like this.

103
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,113
Don't take it seriously.

104
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:43,233
May I know your name?

105
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:45,994
Fangfeng Bei.

106
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,634
Yiying's second brother.

107
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:49,954
If you want,

108
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:52,473
you can also call me Bei.

109
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:01,394
This lady is...

110
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,033
Great Princess of Haoling.

111
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:05,553
Haven't you met her before?

112
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,314
Your Highness, forgive me.

113
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:16,353
I didn't recognize you in the dark.

114
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,274
No need for formalities.

115
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:24,913
Bei, where are you living now?

116
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:27,994
The Tushan Family has a residence here.

117
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:29,553
If you want,

118
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,394
you can live with us.

119
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:35,233
No need.

120
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:38,754
The residence is big
without restrictions.

121
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:40,194
It would be my honor.

122
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:44,874
Alright, I can't refuse you.

123
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,994
But I won't bother you tonight.

124
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:48,713
I have to take Xiaoyao back.

125
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:50,514
I'll move in tomorrow.

126
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:54,793
Where are you going?

127
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:56,353
I can give you a ride.

128
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:57,274
No, thanks.

129
00:14:58,153 --> 00:15:01,033
Bei and I just sat
in the casino for hours.

130
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:02,394
Now we want to walk.

131
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:04,593
We have to go.

132
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:06,194
Let's go.

133
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,394
I heard Bei
and Great Princess are close.

134
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,384
I was always skeptical.

135
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,793
I didn't expect it to be true.

136
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:29,113
Only Great Princess of Haoling

137
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:31,314
can disregard family background

138
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:34,240
and do as she pleases.

139
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:55,233
Princess, I'm scared.

140
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,074
I think these guards are watching us.

141
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:01,434
It's okay. Don't look at him.

142
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:38,754
Let them pass.

143
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:50,304
We're out.

144
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:52,074
I told you this way would work.

145
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:08,960
I still feel uneasy to allow Nian

146
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,914
to go to Xiyan Town.

147
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:14,274
But if I don't let her go,

148
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,473
she'll be like a bird caged in,

149
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:20,113
depressed all day.

150
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,394
Don't worry, Master.

151
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:23,994
Haitang has high spirit power.

152
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:25,353
Guards will protect princess.

153
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:26,754
Moreover,

154
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:29,794
Cang Xuan
and Great Princess are in Xiyan Town.

155
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:31,833
They will
take care of the Second Princess.

156
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:33,994
As a father,

157
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,216
I am indulgent of my daughters, right?

158
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,794
Yes, you really are.

159
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,433
You always give them

160
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:49,473
what they want.

161
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:54,193
You're not indulgent of them at all.

162
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:56,593
Master, you're such a kind father.

163
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,274
They're lucky to be your daughters

164
00:17:58,634 --> 00:17:59,833
or your people.

165
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:10,688
(Qi Garden)

166
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:36,634
Jing,

167
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:38,514
please sit.

168
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:47,274
Sorry, my room is a bit messy.

169
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,473
I came quite unexpectedly.

170
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:52,994
I heard you have worked
as the Minister of Canal.

171
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:54,794
Is everything going smoothly?

172
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:57,833
To be honest,

173
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,073
my two uncles try
to make things difficult for me.

174
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,394
The subordinates are all acting
according to their intentions.

175
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:06,394
I can only do my best.

176
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,713
The Chishui Family
knows the river transport well.

177
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,274
Perhaps you can ask Fenglong for advice.

178
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:12,394
I hope to see him again

179
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:13,674
and ask him for advice.

180
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:20,914
I heard you arrived
in Xiyan Town last night.

181
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,353
I was planning to visit you later.

182
00:19:24,674 --> 00:19:26,154
But you came early in the morning.

183
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:28,113
Is there anything urgent?

184
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,914
I hear Xiaoyao is living here.

185
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:34,833
Can you pass a message for me?

186
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:35,953
I want to see her.

187
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,473
Unfortunately,

188
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:40,154
Xiaoyao said she missed our grandfather

189
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:42,193
and immediately went to Zhaoyun Peak.

190
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:44,034
She's away right now.

191
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,433
When will she be back?

192
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:47,034
I'm not sure about that.

193
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:50,433
Your Highness.

194
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,034
Princess is here.

195
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:57,233
Since Xiaoyao is here,

196
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:58,674
why doesn't she come in?

197
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,634
It's Second Princess,
not Great Princess.

198
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,754
Xuan.

199
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,233
Since you have a visitor, I'll go back.

200
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,073
I'll visit another day.

201
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:19,313
See you.

202
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:21,754
Sang, please see Jing out.

203
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:32,073
Are you surprised to see me?

204
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:34,833
Indeed, I'm surprised.

205
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:37,754
Actually, I've long wanted to see you.

206
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:39,233
But my father didn't agree,

207
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,514
being afraid I would cause troubles.

208
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:42,674
So, I made a trick

209
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:43,713
and sneaked out.

210
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,233
It's not easy to get in
or out of Cheng'en Palace.

211
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:50,154
What do you mean?

212
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:52,473
Nothing.

213
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,073
Since you are here,

214
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:58,394
if anyone asks,

215
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:00,674
you can say you're Xiaoyao's friend.

216
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,696
But why can't I say

217
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:06,794
I'm your friend?

218
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:08,274
I'm limited in ability right now.

219
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,233
If you say you're my friend,

220
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:11,874
you'll be in danger.

221
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:14,154
But if you say you're Xiaoyao's friend,

222
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,394
you will be safe.

223
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:25,113
But don't worry.

224
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:26,914
I know I'm not in Haoling.

225
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:28,593
I won't cause you any trouble.

226
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:30,754
You've been no trouble to me.

227
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:56,914
You seem restless today.

228
00:21:58,368 --> 00:21:59,674
Why did you suddenly come?

229
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:04,073
You could suddenly return
to Zhaoyun Peak last night.

230
00:22:04,713 --> 00:22:06,833
Can't I suddenly come to see you?

231
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:09,914
Grandfather, please sit.

232
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:17,274
Let me see your hands.

233
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,634
Such thick calluses.

234
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,233
When girls practice archery,

235
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:26,634
they are afraid of having calluses.

236
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:29,754
So, they wear specially made gloves.

237
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:31,754
I have a different purpose.

238
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:34,674
They do it for hunting in the autumn,

239
00:22:35,193 --> 00:22:36,353
while I do it to kill.

240
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:39,914
Would the enemy wait for me
to put on gloves before making a move?

241
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:50,794
You should find a good husband.

242
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:53,634
Before I die,

243
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:55,840
I can guarantee

244
00:22:56,634 --> 00:23:00,433
you can marry any man you like.

245
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,953
Anyone is fine?

246
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:06,193
What if this man is engaged?

247
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:11,473
What if this man

248
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,833
is your enemy?

249
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:19,593
What kind of man do you want to marry?

250
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:25,953
I have been through too much.

251
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:28,713
When other girls of my age are in love,

252
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:30,634
I didn't even know what I was doing.

253
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:32,713
Probably I was trying to survive.

254
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:36,394
Perhaps I've been alone for too long,

255
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,634
I just want
to find someone to accompany me.

256
00:23:40,313 --> 00:23:42,874
But I'm too timid to trust anyone.

257
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:46,554
After all,
even my mother could abandon me.

258
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,713
How could I believe

259
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:50,473
that a man wouldn't abandon me?

260
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,233
But I know

261
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:56,634
I'm afraid of men
like you and my father.

262
00:23:57,514 --> 00:23:58,713
Because in your hearts,

263
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,634
there will always be something
more important than women.

264
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:05,353
We are not suitable to be husbands.

265
00:24:06,953 --> 00:24:08,634
In this world,

266
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,193
if there is a man...

267
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,394
No matter what choice he faces,

268
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,473
I'm always his first choice.

269
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,874
No matter what happens,

270
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:18,593
he will never give up on me.

271
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:21,154
I will spend my life with him.

272
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:24,034
It's difficult,

273
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:26,874
more difficult
than me conquering the world.

274
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,433
I know.

275
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,514
So I never thought about being in love.

276
00:24:34,496 --> 00:24:35,754
I'm afraid once I think about it,

277
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:37,674
I'll lose myself.

278
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:40,154
Even if I feel restless,

279
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:41,833
I will try to control myself.

280
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:47,713
You have already had the answer

281
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:51,113
to the question you just asked me.

282
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,473
If that man has romance

283
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:55,634
with other women,

284
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:59,113
it proves you are not his first choice

285
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:00,994
in his heart.

286
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:05,433
If he chooses

287
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,514
to be the enemy of mine or Cang Xuan,

288
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:12,754
it proves you are not important to him.

289
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:16,193
He can abandon you at any time.

290
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:27,394
Child,

291
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,313
you think too much.

292
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:31,634
Well,

293
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:34,914
you don't have to figure out everything.

294
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,193
With your current status,

295
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:38,874
if you choose the right person,

296
00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:42,274
it's not that hard

297
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:43,833
to have a happy marriage.

298
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:46,514
I know.

299
00:25:47,424 --> 00:25:48,953
But this is not me.

300
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,514
If I don't meet that man,

301
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:54,113
I won't marry in my life.

302
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:56,433
With my status,

303
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:58,394
I can enjoy so many interesting things

304
00:25:58,554 --> 00:25:59,353
and beautiful scenery.

305
00:25:59,744 --> 00:26:00,674
Even without a husband,

306
00:26:01,313 --> 00:26:02,794
I can still live a happy life.

307
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:04,514
Alright.

308
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:09,794
Cang Xuan can't be self-willed like you.

309
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:11,233
Well,

310
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:15,953
you can live as you wish.

311
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,264
(Xiyan Town, River Transport Bureau)

312
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,274
Why are you still waiting here?

313
00:26:43,754 --> 00:26:45,634
Hasn't your ship been allowed to pass?

314
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:48,113
If these goods rot on the ship,

315
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:50,754
we'll all jump into the river.

316
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:51,313
Right.

317
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:03,514
Your Highness.

318
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:04,994
They have waited for so long.

319
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,313
Why not let them pass?

320
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:10,833
We have to follow the rules.

321
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,593
They have been waiting for two days.

322
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:15,833
The ship is loaded with fresh goods.

323
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:18,914
if it's delayed, the loss will be heavy.

324
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:20,034
Your Highness.

325
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,994
I didn't mean to make things difficult.

326
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:24,833
Everyone is waiting.

327
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,514
You just took over river transport,

328
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:28,914
not familiar with this.

329
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,473
If you break the rules,

330
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:35,874
all the boatmen will try to cut in.

331
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:38,034
It will not only congest the river,

332
00:27:38,592 --> 00:27:40,394
but also cause shipwrecks
and loss of lives.

333
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:48,914
How dare you! Step back!

334
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:51,634
Many boatmen are demons
who live by water.

335
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:54,073
They have a bad temper.

336
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:55,674
It's not easy to manage them.

337
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:05,216
Master, what brought you here?

338
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:08,193
My father said he wanted to find you

339
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:09,794
to discuss the ship transport
for next year.

340
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,754
I heard the ships have not set off yet,

341
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,113
so I came to check it out.

342
00:28:13,514 --> 00:28:14,914
These boatmen...

343
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,634
Their goods are scheduled
to be sold to the Tushan Family.

344
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:20,473
Don't worry.
I will deal with it right away.

345
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:25,193
Hurry up.

346
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:36,274
Thank you.

347
00:28:37,914 --> 00:28:38,994
Not at all.

348
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,233
My family has been running business
for many years.

349
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:42,833
I'm using its power.

350
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:45,034
Anyway, thank you for your help.

351
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,994
Otherwise, I would fall
into my two uncles' trap.

352
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:49,593
They will say I'm incompetent,

353
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:51,713
destroying many families.

354
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:54,394
Or they say I cause a riot,

355
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:55,713
causing loss of lives.

356
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:58,274
Don't worry too much.

357
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:01,473
The day you achieve your ambition
will come.

358
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:04,794
I hope

359
00:29:05,113 --> 00:29:07,953
that day could come soon.

360
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:12,160
(Zhaoyun Hall)

361
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:24,113
Grandfather.

362
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:25,514
Your Majesty.

363
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:29,073
Take a seat.

364
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:45,874
Your Majesty.

365
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:48,994
I heard a lot about you

366
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:50,073
from Xuan.

367
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:51,994
So, for me,

368
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:54,034
Your Majesty is like a familiar elder.

369
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,353
I have a request.

370
00:29:58,073 --> 00:29:58,634
Say it.

371
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:04,554
Can I also call you grandfather?

372
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,433
As long as your father doesn't mind,
of course you can.

373
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:13,193
Grandfather.

374
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:19,593
Zhoushan,

375
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:22,394
bring the Queen's jade bracelet.

376
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:23,713
Yes.

377
00:30:25,994 --> 00:30:28,154
You are more talkative than Xiaoyao.

378
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,634
Cang Xuan's grandmother wore it.

379
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,593
Xiaoyao has one.

380
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,554
And this one is for you.

381
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:50,034
Do you like it?

382
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:52,353
Yes, thank you.

383
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,514
Since you're here,

384
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,794
you stay here for a few more days.

385
00:31:00,473 --> 00:31:01,073
I will.

386
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:15,034
Nian is here.

387
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,874
I think I should report it
to grandfather.

388
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:19,953
So I brought her to see grandfather.

389
00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:22,473
Since she often causes trouble,

390
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,353
you should let grandfather know her.

391
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,953
Don't underestimate Nian.

392
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:28,713
She knows when to be smart.

393
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:31,353
Now she is learning chess

394
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:33,473
from grandfather.

395
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:35,994
I will practice archery.

396
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:38,034
Anyway, she will be angry to see me.

397
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:39,833
I won't go to greet her.

398
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,674
Are you avoiding Tushan Jing?

399
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:49,674
I'm not. Fangfeng Bei is waiting for me.

400
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:50,944
I have to go find him.

401
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:52,914
Fangfeng Bei is a renowned playboy.

402
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:54,994
He knows how to indulge in pleasures.

403
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,233
I'm okay if you hang out with him,

404
00:31:57,953 --> 00:31:58,833
but don't forget

405
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:01,113
the Fangfeng Family has sided
with uncles.

406
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:02,833
When you're with him,

407
00:32:03,274 --> 00:32:04,473
don't let your guard down

408
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:05,833
and put yourself in danger.

409
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:07,313
Don't worry.

410
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:08,953
I won't forget the moment

411
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:10,994
he pointed the arrow at us.

412
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:12,113
Good.

413
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:13,874
Go ahead.

414
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:24,593
Anything you want to tell me?

415
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:26,514
No.

416
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,034
You just mentioned Tushan Jing.

417
00:32:30,593 --> 00:32:31,794
Is it about him?

418
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,394
Actually, I just lied.

419
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:38,914
I'm indeed mad at him

420
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:40,274
and avoiding him.

421
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:42,593
Did he tell you

422
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:43,914
he wanted to see me?

423
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:46,874
Yes.

424
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:52,473
I do need his support now.

425
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,680
Can you meet him?

426
00:32:58,073 --> 00:32:59,193
It's just a meeting.

427
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:00,394
What's the big deal?

428
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:02,514
Even if it's not for you,

429
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:04,034
I will meet him sooner or later.

430
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,634
I'm such a terrible brother.

431
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,433
I asked you to hold your temper

432
00:33:11,914 --> 00:33:14,193
and bow to other men.

433
00:33:15,313 --> 00:33:17,034
If I refused to bow

434
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:17,994
and felt wronged,

435
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:21,353
I would have died
in the hands of the nine-tailed fox.

436
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:26,754
Xuan, where are we now?

437
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:28,113
Zhaoyun Peak.

438
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:33,914
Yes, we're in Zhaoyun Peak.

439
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:36,634
I see.

440
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,754
You seem very angry today.

441
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,193
Who are you?

442
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,633
I live
in my future brother-in-law's house,

443
00:34:17,994 --> 00:34:19,354
seeing my sister every day.

444
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:23,193
Who do you think I could be,

445
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:25,393
if not Fangfeng Bei?

446
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,594
If I find out you lied to me,

447
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,794
I will shoot an arrow into your heart.

448
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:37,834
So, who do you hope I am?

449
00:34:39,473 --> 00:34:42,754
The friend you want to poison?

450
00:34:54,496 --> 00:34:56,794
Good, I did teach you well.

451
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:08,754
You seem in a bad mood.

452
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,393
Why not skip practice today?

453
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:12,994
If I practice

454
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:14,754
as I please,

455
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:17,153
I will have many excuses

456
00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:18,794
to skip it.

457
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:20,873
Why not give up now?

458
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:37,433
Your shoulders are too tense.

459
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:41,514
Your arm is raised too high.

460
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,514
You really don't act like a princess.

461
00:36:02,274 --> 00:36:03,514
You know it.

462
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,074
I'm a wild princess.

463
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:12,433
Why not quit being a princess

464
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:14,794
and wander around with me?

465
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:31,153
Okay.

466
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:33,274
If you give up everything,

467
00:36:33,953 --> 00:36:34,953
I'll go with you.

468
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:53,794
Don't try to fool me.

469
00:36:56,873 --> 00:36:58,393
Don't think you're more bold than me.

470
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:16,576
(Qi Garden)

471
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:23,873
Master Qingqiu, you're here again.

472
00:37:24,354 --> 00:37:26,514
But now is not a good time.

473
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:27,673
His Highness was away.

474
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:28,834
He won't be back until tonight.

475
00:37:29,153 --> 00:37:30,794
Will the princess come back with him?

476
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:32,114
No.

477
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:35,433
I have important matters
to discuss with His Highness.

478
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,034
Please let him know.

479
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:38,153
Okay.

480
00:37:39,314 --> 00:37:41,354
I'll come back in the evening.

481
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:45,314
The princess is already back.

482
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:47,953
So, she won't come back with him.

483
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:53,193
Anything else?

484
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:54,754
Can you take a message for me?

485
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:57,233
Tell princess I want to see her.

486
00:37:57,554 --> 00:37:59,193
Okay, I'll tell her right away.

487
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:26,314
Please.

488
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:45,794
Prince Cang Xuan is at Xiyan Mountain.

489
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:47,913
Xiaoyao is resting in her room.

490
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:50,433
Sang told me you were here.

491
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:52,314
So, I invited you in.

492
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,433
Princess spent all morning
practicing archery.

493
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,994
She needs to rest for a while
before entertaining guests.

494
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:08,274
Please take a seat.

495
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:26,713
I heard from my sister

496
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:28,873
that you've been
visiting Prince Cang Xuan.

497
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:32,034
His Highness is a master of chess.

498
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:33,594
He's a good rival.

499
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:35,074
I enjoy playing it with him.

500
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:40,873
My sister loves lively places.

501
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:44,554
Thank you for taking care of her.

502
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:49,193
She has been very popular in Xiyan Town.

503
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:51,153
She has often held parties,

504
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:53,953
having a great time.

505
00:40:06,713 --> 00:40:08,034
You were resting,

506
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:10,953
so I invited Jing in
without telling you.

507
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:13,354
Fortunately, you let him in,

508
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:16,034
or I would offend Xuan's friend.

509
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:27,233
Master Qingqiu.

510
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:28,913
Xuan is at Zhaoyun Peak.

511
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,953
I will send someone to ask him back.

512
00:40:31,713 --> 00:40:32,834
If you have nothing else to do,

513
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:34,473
just sit here and wait.

514
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:36,994
If you have things to do,
you can go back.

515
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:38,354
Xuan will come to you.

516
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:41,193
I have something to do with Bei later.

517
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:43,233
So I have to go.

518
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:44,754
Let's go.

519
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,393
What are we doing today?

520
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:49,873
We can go

521
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:50,953
wherever you want.

522
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:52,873
I have to think about it.

523
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,354
Okay.

524
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:06,153
(I do need his support now.)

525
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:08,994
(Can you meet him?)

526
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:19,594
What's wrong?

527
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:22,673
I suddenly remembered

528
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:24,514
what Cang Xuan asked me to do.

529
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,433
I can't hang out with you today.

530
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:28,433
Take a rain check?

531
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:45,953
Okay, if you have something to do,

532
00:41:46,594 --> 00:41:47,433
let's do it another day.

533
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:23,994
Cang Xuan said you were looking for me.

534
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:38,673
What is this?

535
00:42:50,393 --> 00:42:52,554
It's a purple fish core?

536
00:42:53,794 --> 00:42:55,473
I wanted to find you a red one.

537
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,673
This purple one is not precious,

538
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,473
but it's also hard to get it.

539
00:42:59,873 --> 00:43:01,074
I only found a purple fish core.

540
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,193
It's not easy to find this, right?

541
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:06,393
Not that hard.

542
00:43:07,514 --> 00:43:08,233
Not that hard?

543
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,754
Even the wealthy Tushan Family

544
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:12,473
only found a purple one.

545
00:43:18,713 --> 00:43:20,554
When giving gifts to other girls,

546
00:43:21,153 --> 00:43:23,514
you should say

547
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:26,114
you spend much effort on this.

548
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:27,913
It will make your gift better.

549
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:28,754
No.

550
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:33,433
No other girls.

551
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:35,393
Only you.

552
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:44,354
Can I really breathe

553
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:47,114
in the water with this?

554
00:43:48,274 --> 00:43:48,873
I tried it out.

555
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:50,473
I could swim

556
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:51,953
for a day and two nights.

557
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,433
But I have spirit power.

558
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:54,633
For your safety,

559
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:56,554
you better not swim more than 20 hours.

560
00:43:59,713 --> 00:44:00,713
You stayed underwater

561
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:03,633
for a day and two nights to test it?

562
00:44:11,074 --> 00:44:11,754
Xiaoyao.

563
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:14,433
Are you alright?

564
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:16,193
I'm good.

565
00:44:18,144 --> 00:44:19,034
I just...

566
00:44:20,913 --> 00:44:22,193
I just really hate you.

567
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,354
Every time I decide to give up on you,

568
00:44:27,794 --> 00:44:29,433
you always find a way to soften me.

569
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:30,554
I'm sorry.

570
00:44:33,594 --> 00:44:34,794
I know I shouldn't show up.

571
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:39,233
You're such a fool.

572
00:44:39,794 --> 00:44:40,794
You don't know anything.

573
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:43,314
I don't understand
why people say you're clever.

574
00:44:48,274 --> 00:44:49,594
Why did you come alone today?

575
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:52,224
Where is the beautiful girl
coming with you last time?

576
00:44:54,314 --> 00:44:55,473
Can't I come alone?

577
00:44:57,673 --> 00:44:59,473
Yeah, you can.

578
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:02,193
Please sit for a while.

579
00:45:02,193 --> 00:45:03,794
I'll serve you right away.
