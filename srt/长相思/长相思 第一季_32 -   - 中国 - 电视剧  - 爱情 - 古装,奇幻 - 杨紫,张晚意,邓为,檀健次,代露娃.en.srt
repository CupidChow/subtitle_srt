1
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,760
=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,535
=Episode 32=

3
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,901
You let Yu Jiang go again.

4
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:42,822
Yeah.

5
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,941
Over the years,

6
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:48,661
Yu Jiang has always wanted to kill you,

7
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:50,301
but you always let him go.

8
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,261
What if he succeeds one day?

9
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:54,341
I believe he won't do it again.

10
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,341
What's wrong?

11
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,661
You didn't spare those who tried

12
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,142
to assassinate Xiaoyao back then.

13
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,782
You did whatever it took
to eliminate them all.

14
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:05,901
But you are so forgiving to a man

15
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:07,782
who tries to kill you.

16
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:10,022
It's different.

17
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,141
How is it different?

18
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,581
I'm willing
to endure injustice and hardship

19
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,982
just to give Xiaoyao a happy

20
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:19,542
and safe life.

21
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:22,342
You are so protective.

22
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:26,102
No wonder everyone
around you is so loyal,

23
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,022
including me.

24
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,742
My divine consciousness seems
to be getting stronger.

25
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,301
Xiaoyao.

26
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,941
I hope that when you wake up,

27
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:37,501
you won't hate me.

28
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:39,701
I promise I won't,

29
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:41,861
as long as you often talk to me.

30
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,061
You know

31
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:46,701
I've been bound here for years.

32
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,382
I'm afraid of loneliness.
It's even scarier than being in jail.

33
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,542
At least I can talk
to prison guards and cellmates in jail.

34
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,701
Have you become mute?

35
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:06,661
You don't come here very often.

36
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:07,982
And you're always quiet.

37
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:10,022
If you don't speak, I'll hate you.

38
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,102
I hate you

39
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:13,182
even though you saved me.

40
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,261
You were afraid of loneliness.

41
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:21,022
Are you bored?

42
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:25,182
Let me take you to see the moon.

43
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,141
Great.

44
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,381
It is the first quarter moon,

45
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:38,662
like a bow.

46
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:42,821
Every full moon, I have to heal you.

47
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:45,182
I can't get you out of the water.

48
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,861
It's been many years
since I saw the full moon.

49
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,942
Many years?

50
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,301
Has it been so many years?

51
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:09,541
Do you like it?

52
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:11,421
If you like,

53
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:13,861
I'll often take you

54
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,742
to see the full moon.

55
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,222
The moon back then

56
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,502
was a bit like your Ape Mirror.

57
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,301
You secretly kept memories
in that mirror.

58
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:31,342
How did you know?

59
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:33,301
When you wake up,

60
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,981
the memories
in that mirror must be erased.

61
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:41,662
No problem.

62
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:43,022
If you don't get mad,

63
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,141
I can even destroy the mirror.

64
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:18,981
This is the whirlpool of the sea.

65
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,141
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

66
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,981
When I escaped from the fighting arena,

67
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:39,981
I was full of wounds,

68
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:43,622
and almost died in the whirlpool.

69
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:47,182
My foster father saved me.

70
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,742
At that time,
Chenrong Kingdom had not yet fallen.

71
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,821
He was a general in Chenrong Kingdom,

72
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:55,701
equally famous
with Yanzhuan and Chichen.

73
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,662
He saved me,

74
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:02,581
but I stabbed him.

75
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,182
But he didn't mind.

76
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,381
He repaid evil with good,

77
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:10,701
teaching me healing methods.

78
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:14,222
He planned to take me
to King of Chenrong for treatment.

79
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:18,101
But I didn't believe him and ran away.

80
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:21,821
What happened later?

81
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,182
Later, I fled to the Far North

82
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,342
and hid for over 100 years.

83
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,981
The snow of the Far North

84
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:40,821
not only saved my life,

85
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,182
but also gave me enlightenment.

86
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,662
I developed a cultivation method

87
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,981
from his healing methods.

88
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:53,742
No wonder
every time you use your spirit power,

89
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,462
it seems like it's going to snow.

90
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,902
Snowflakes fly when you start killing.

91
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:01,861
People always think I wear white

92
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:05,261
because it's my hobby.

93
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:07,981
In fact,

94
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:12,821
it's just a habit of trying to survive.

95
00:08:13,782 --> 00:08:15,902
In the icy and snowy Far North,

96
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:19,981
white is the easiest color to hide in.

97
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:23,462
What happened
after you left the Far North?

98
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:26,821
Why are you silent?

99
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:31,662
Go on.

100
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,422
If you don't speak,

101
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:40,302
let me guess.

102
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,501
Chenrong and Xiyan had a great war.

103
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:47,621
Chenrong Kingdom was destroyed
and Hong Jiang fell into disgrace.

104
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:50,941
His friends
and family all left Hong Jiang.

105
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:55,902
But a nine-headed demon

106
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,621
found him to repay a favor.

107
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,982
Originally, he just wanted
to end this debt of gratitude,

108
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:05,662
but he didn't expect
to be adopted by Hong Jiang.

109
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:09,701
It's easy to repay kindness,
but hard to give up affection.

110
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:11,982
Speaking of which,

111
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:14,381
I'm starting to dislike Hong Jiang.

112
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:16,422
Without him,

113
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,102
you wouldn't be who you are now,

114
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:23,581
wouldn't bear the burden of Chenrong,

115
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,302
and wouldn't be Xuan's enemy.

116
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:30,621
Why are you frowning?

117
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:33,061
Unhappy?

118
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,342

(Xiaoyao.)

148
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,302
(You've been gone for 37 years.)

149
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:50,501
(I planted phoenix trees
on Chenrong Mountain.)

150
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:52,102
(They have grown tall.)

151
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:54,581
(When will you return?)

152
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,141
(Let's admire the flowers together.)

153
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:05,982
Cang Xuan.

154
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:13,462
I am sorry.

155
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,342
I've been delayed
due to the issue of grain supply.

156
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,102
It is not yet resolved?

157
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,862
We have thought
of all possible solutions,

158
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:21,022
but the funds we have are limited.

159
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:22,701
We can hold on
for another month at most.

160
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:26,621
We're not short
of good soldiers 40 years later.

161
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,741
No matter who we compete with,

162
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,902
we can give it our all to win.

163
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:32,782
But the grain supply

164
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,902
is indeed a big problem.

165
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,422
Because of Tushan Hou,

166
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:40,261
we can't tamper with accounts anymore.

167
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:42,022
I really don't know
how we can get money.

168
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,022
Jing is best at business.

169
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,982
If he were here,
it wouldn't be a problem.

170
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:50,261
How's Tushan Jing?

171
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,141
What happened?

172
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:30,862
He almost can't take any medicine.

173
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,501
Look at the life light sent
by Grand Madam,

174
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:36,261
and you'll know
about Master's condition.

175
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:40,022
If it goes on like this, Master may die.

176
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:43,181
No matter what,
keep feeding him medicine.

177
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,462
We can prepare more medicinal herbs.

178
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:51,621
I'll continue feeding him.

179
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:06,302
Why does he not want to live anymore?

180
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:09,542
Any news of Great Princess of Haoling?

181
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:11,261
No.

182
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:15,422
Otherwise, it should spread
around Chenrong Mansion.

183
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,381
I hope princess is safe and sound.

184
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:20,941
Otherwise, I'm afraid Master...

185
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:22,902
What do you mean?

186
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:26,102
Nothing.

187
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,662
Master.

188
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:36,302
Master.

189
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:38,862
Master.

190
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:41,302
Master.

191
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,422
Master.

192
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:02,741
How is he?

193
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:09,782
There is nothing I can do.

194
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:13,222
Master Tushan is dying.

195
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,342
I'm afraid he won't last a few days.

196
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:19,462
I had the same diagnosis for Master.

197
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,422
Jing.

198
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:26,741
How could this happen?

199
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:52,200

00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:57,888

00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:26,381
Where's Xiaoyao?

215
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,182
When you agree to my conditions,

216
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,501
Xiaoyao will come back.

217
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:32,302
So Xiaoyao is already better.

218
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,422
What do you want?

219
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:40,341
- A mountain of Chenrong Mountain.
- What do you mean?

220
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:44,422
All soldiers who followed Hong Jiang

221
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:46,542
can't forget their homeland.

222
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,141
They are displaced,

223
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:51,422
living a life of hardship.

224
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:54,221
Even if they die in battle,

225
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:57,422
they can't return to their homeland.

226
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:07,662
I want you to promise me.

227
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:08,942
If one day,

228
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:10,501
you become the ruler of Xiyan Kingdom,

229
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:13,022
make a mountain as a forbidden area,

230
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:14,741
and let the ashes
of all the deceased return

231
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,101
to the place that they've always missed.

232
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:20,422
If I can't become
the ruler of Xiyan Kingdom,

233
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,822
you'll be losing this deal.

234
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:24,501
I offer a deal.

235
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:27,662
- You just tell me if you do it.
- Fine.

236
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:30,022
I promise.

237
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,741
But if I can't become
the ruler of Xiyan Kingdom,

238
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,822
you absolutely cannot bother Xiaoyao
because of this.

239
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:38,101
Okay.

240
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:39,981
When can Xiaoyao come back?

241
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,022
It's been decades.

242
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,822
Cang Xuan has often sent me things.

243
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:52,422
But Tushan Jing has never cared for me.

244
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:58,381
People change.

245
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:00,182
Maybe Tushan Jing

246
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,782
has married Fangfeng Yiying

247
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,501
and even had children.

248
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:31,182
I can move.

249
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,702
I can touch things.

250
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,461
Xiang Liu.

251
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,302
Look, I can touch things.

252
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:48,221
Am I getting better?

253
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:57,302
What's wrong?

254
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:00,062
Why do you look so gloomy?

255
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:02,182
It's a full moon night.

256
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:05,621
I'll take you out for a while.

257
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:08,141
Great.

258
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:13,542
But on a full moon night,
shouldn't you treat me?

259
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:33,182
That turtle is bigger

260
00:20:34,422 --> 00:20:36,422
than your bed in Qingshui Town.

261
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:39,582
If you like it,

262
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,942
I can make you a bed with its shell.

263
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:43,381
I like it.

264
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,861
You make me a bed with it.

265
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:57,422
That's a fish demon.

266
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,062
Its fish core

267
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:04,341
should be better than your purple one.

268
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:07,022
But,

269
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:09,981
you won't need that thing in the future.

270
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,702
Why?

271
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,861
What is this sound? It's so pleasant.

272
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:30,341
Xiang Liu, let's move closer and listen.

273
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:32,822
It seems the merfolk are in heat.

274
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:35,968
That's their courtship song.

275
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:42,981
I see. Then we won't disturb them.

276
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,022
It's said
they sing the most beautiful song

277
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:50,861
in the world.

278
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:55,341
Neither mortals nor deities can hear it.

279
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,501
Perhaps after you wake up,

280
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:00,261
you can hear it.

281
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:02,182
Why can I hear it?

282
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:09,461
It's a pity.

283
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:12,741
We can't hear them sing
after they've chosen their mates.

284
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:14,702
Why not?

285
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:18,981
In midnight,

286
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,381
we must go back for treatment.

287
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,422
It's okay.
We can hear them sing another time.

288
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:32,621
You take me out another day.

289
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,822
Why do you act strange today?

290
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:48,662
You're unusually talkative today.

291
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:51,822
In the past, I begged you to talk.

292
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:04,582
You can see me?

293
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:15,062
I thought you had seen me.

294
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:17,182
Xiaoyao,

295
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:20,182
do you remember Tushan Jing?

296
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:27,141
You remember him.

297
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:30,582
That's Ye Shiqi.

298
00:23:31,981 --> 00:23:33,062
How can you forget?

299
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:36,341
I remember him,
but he may not remember me.

300
00:23:37,302 --> 00:23:40,582
How could the leader
of the Tushan Family be Ye Shiqi?

301
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:43,341
Since you fell into a coma,

302
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:46,702
Tushan Jing has also been unconscious.

303
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:50,981
But now he can't hold on much longer.

304
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:54,422
He's dying.

305
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:56,422
He is unconscious?

306
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:58,182
What happened?

307
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:02,942
Xiaoyao,

308
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,662
if Tushan Jing dies,

309
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,822
will you be very sad

310
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:09,741
and hate me?

311
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,221
I don't want him to die.

312
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:13,662
But why would I hate you?

313
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,782
You saved me.

314
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:16,741
Xiang Liu.

315
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:18,542
Xiang Liu.

316
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:20,542
Xiang Liu.

317
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,981
You can feel me, can't you?

318
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:56,662
He could have few drops of medicine.

319
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,341
But now he can't take any.

320
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:02,302
What are we going to do?

321
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:14,182
The life force

322
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:16,582
inside Master is running out.

323
00:26:21,662 --> 00:26:27,302
Master.

324
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,822
I'm back into my body.

325
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:10,902
Xiang Liu.

326
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:14,422
Where are you, Xiang Liu?

327
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:18,182
Xiang Liu.

328
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:20,782
Xiang Liu.

329
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:24,782
Chubby.

330
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:29,141
Chubby.

331
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:32,221
Have you gained weight?

332
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:36,981
I'm not teasing you.

333
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,621
You're the cutest bird.

334
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:42,381
Where's your master?

335
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:43,902
I don't see him.

336
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:50,022
Xiang Liu asked you
to take me to see him?

337
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:56,221
Xiang Liu asked you to take me back?

338
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:01,582
Does he not want to see me?

(Promise fulfilled. Xiaoyao will soon return.)

366
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,101
Is it news about princess?

367
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:06,861
Xiaoyao will be back soon.

00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,422
Jun Yi, you deliver my order.

369
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:13,542
Let the gate guards report to me
once they see Xiaoyao.

370
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:14,702
Yes.

371
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:17,582
- I'll prepare the room.
- Wait.

372
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:20,702
A man can't be
as considerate as a woman.

373
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:23,221
Leave it to Shan Hu.

374
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,141
Didn't you say

375
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:42,861
men aren't as considerate as women?

376
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:45,182
So what are you doing now?

377
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:48,702
Miao Pu.

378
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:50,741
Your Highness.

379
00:33:51,902 --> 00:33:54,022
I remember there's a pair of vases.

380
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,461
Find the other one.

381
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:56,702
Yes.

382
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:05,221
- Your Highness, is it the other one?
- Yes.

383
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:14,022
One vase looks lonely.

384
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:16,582
It's better if stuff is in pairs.

385
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:18,461
Good.

386
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:20,901
Then make all the stuff in this room

387
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,421
in pairs.

388
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:23,382
Yes.

389
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:44,302
(Chenrong Mansion)

390
00:34:44,302 --> 00:34:44,901
Xiaoyao.

391
00:34:48,142 --> 00:34:49,261
Is it really you?

392
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:51,822
Or am I someone else?

393
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:56,822
Thank heavens,
you're finally back safe and sound.

394
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,022
Don't worry.

395
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:00,901
How's Xuan?

396
00:35:02,862 --> 00:35:03,981
He is fine.

397
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:06,022
But he's been worried about you.

398
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,382
You haven't seen him yet?

399
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:13,022
When Cang Xuan knew you got better,

400
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,022
he sent someone
to take you back to Haoling.

401
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:19,062
I thought you went
to Chenrong Mountain before visiting me.

402
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:23,382
I actually wanted to visit him first.

403
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:26,062
But I heard Jing is critically ill.

404
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:28,022
I want to go to Qingqiu to see Jing.

405
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:29,741
Can you go with me?

406
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:31,741
You've come to the right person.

407
00:35:32,461 --> 00:35:34,022
Jing is not in Qingqiu.

408
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:35,941
He is here.

409
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:57,022
Master...

410
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:00,661
There's no sign of life.

411
00:36:01,862 --> 00:36:02,782
There's nothing we can do.

412
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:08,661
Send a message to Qingqiu right now.

413
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,421
Master...

414
00:36:14,421 --> 00:36:16,261
Grand Madam needs to decide

415
00:36:17,102 --> 00:36:18,382
how to do Master's funeral.

416
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:29,822
Jing.

417
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:34,022
I'll notify my brother,

418
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:36,102
my father and Cang Xuan immediately.

419
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:41,582
Princess, please save Master.

420
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,901
Please save Master.

421
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:09,022
Master is overly grieved.

422
00:37:09,582 --> 00:37:11,862
His spirit is shattered
and his organs are all injured.

423
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:13,661
He gave up surviving.

424
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:17,822
Princess, please save Master.

425
00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:19,382
I'm begging you.

426
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,501
Jing is seeking his own death?

427
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:26,342
What happened while I was away?

428
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:29,421
You were so heartbroken
that you didn't want to live?

429
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:33,622
Princess, don't you understand?

430
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:38,102
What do I need to understand?

431
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,941
When Prince Cang Xuan went to save you,

432
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:43,302
he saw Master holding you.

433
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:46,302
Back then, you've stopped breathing.

434
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:48,822
You were going to turn into ashes.

435
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:49,622
Master...

436
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:53,941
He has innate spiritual eyes
and is proficient in formations.

437
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:55,622
He was not injured.

438
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,261
He could get out of the formation.

439
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:01,622
But he was holding you,
waiting for death.

440
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:07,142
He would rather be burned by the fire

441
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:08,981
than leave you.

442
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:12,261
Don't you know what you mean to him?

443
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:14,342
He wants to be with you,

444
00:38:14,741 --> 00:38:17,622
dead or alive.

445
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:32,782
Jing,

446
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:37,661
did you really give up your life

447
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:41,342
because of me?

448
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,782
The room has been arranged
according to your instructions.

449
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:12,741
Good.

450
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,501
Your Highness,
there's news about princess.

451
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:20,022
Where's she? I'll go to her.

452
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:21,142
She went to Chenrong Mansion.

453
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:27,261
Alright.

454
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:30,461
It's good that Xiaoyao came back safely.

455
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:40,661
Give me the medicine.

456
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:42,302
I'll feed him.

457
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:44,582
Princess.

458
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,062
He can't take the medicine anymore.

459
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:48,302
You go out first.

460
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,941
I'll call you when I can't do it.

461
00:39:51,342 --> 00:39:52,981
- Is that alright?
- Thank you, princess.

462
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:40,261
The first time I saw you,

463
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:43,941
you were seriously injured,

464
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:47,102
but you still had the will to live.

465
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:50,542
Your throat was severely injured.

466
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:53,782
No matter how hard it was to swallow,

467
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:57,221
but you always tried your best to do it.

468
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:33,261
Do you remember this garden?

469
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,501
You taught me how to play the zither

470
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:38,501
in this garden.

471
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:42,542
I knew

472
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:47,221
you couldn't help wanting to kiss me.

473
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:50,782
But you always suppressed it

474
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:53,782
and deliberately avoided me.

475
00:41:57,421 --> 00:41:59,181
In fact, I can feel it.

476
00:42:01,022 --> 00:42:03,102
But I pretended not to know.

477
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:07,062
I liked you struggling with yourself.

478
00:42:08,288 --> 00:42:09,622
I liked teasing you.

479
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,022
But once you kissed me,

480
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:18,901
you turned from a rabbit into a wolf.

481
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:21,901
I can't even escape.

482
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:25,741
But now,

483
00:42:28,022 --> 00:42:29,542
you've become the little rabbit,

484
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:31,701
letting me bully you.

485
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:32,582
Can you wake up?

486
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:40,981
I like it when you're the wolf.

487
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:54,622
When did you sneak out?

488
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:56,741
Are you watching me?

489
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:04,102
You're its master.

490
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:06,421
It's crafty,

491
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:09,421
like you.

492
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:32,901
Your Highness, Miss Chenrong.

493
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,022
- Is princess inside?
- Yes.

494
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:39,981
I have something else to do,

495
00:44:40,102 --> 00:44:41,342
so I won't disturb your reunion

496
00:44:41,342 --> 00:44:42,221
with Xiaoyao.

497
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:43,822
I'll come back to see you and Xiaoyao.

498
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:44,981
Thank you.

499
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:46,582
There's no need of that.

500
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:52,062
Your Highness.

501
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:53,941
Princess is resting.

502
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:55,261
