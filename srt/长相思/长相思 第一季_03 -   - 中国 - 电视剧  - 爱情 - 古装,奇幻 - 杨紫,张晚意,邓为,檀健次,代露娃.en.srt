have healed.

21
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:25,058
As for your broken leg,

22
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:26,498
because it was treated late,

23
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:28,578
you may limp in the future,

24
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,018
but it won't affect your normal life.

25
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,337
Leave here tomorrow.

26
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:41,617
I

27
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,817
have nowhere

28
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:47,858
to go.

29
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:49,737
Nowhere to go.

30
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:51,298
Is that true?

31
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:52,697
Yes.

32
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:55,018
What's your name?

33
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:03,616
You don't know.

34
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,097
You have forgotten it,

35
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:07,058
or you don't want to tell me?

36
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:14,138
You

37
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:17,378
saved me.

38
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:19,177
So I

39
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:20,058
am

40
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:23,297
your servant now.

41
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:27,498
Please name me.

42
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,498
You don't really look like

43
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:32,258
someone who would listen to others.

44
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:34,258
I don't want you.

45
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:37,058
I will

46
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:38,137
listen to you.

47
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:40,577
Listen to me?

48
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:43,617
If you meet someone
who knows you in the future,

49
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,577
will you listen to me?

50
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,218
Yes.

51
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:00,457
Fine.

52
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:02,417
Stay here.

53
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:19,978
Take this to him and let him eat it.

54
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,297
Beggar.

55
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,218
It is licorice,
which is good for your throat.

56
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:33,577
Xiaoliu,

57
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:35,498
give him a new name.

58
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,297
We can't keep calling him Beggar.

59
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:41,378
Then let's call him Licorice.

60
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:44,058
Name a nicer one.

61
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,457
The one not as bad as our names.

62
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,297
Right.

63
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,617
What's wrong with my name?

64
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:49,737
Nothing.

65
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:50,617
Pimply means

66
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:52,577
this kind of name suits us.

67
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:53,297
But not

68
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:57,058
for him.

69
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:58,218
What do you mean?

70
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:00,538
You think I'm inferior to him?

71
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:03,457
Xiaoliu, do you want to
hear the truth or a lie?

72
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:05,857
Xiaoliu,

73
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:10,218
some people are born
as clouds in the sky,

74
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,218
while some are like mud on ground.

75
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:14,098
There's no comparison.

76
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,498
We should be ourselves,

77
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,258
and be the mud on ground.

78
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:19,417
Fine.

79
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:20,818
Then let's call him Mud on Ground.

80
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:21,737
No,

81
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:22,577
it's too casual.

82
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:24,258
At least give him a new one.

83
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:26,218
Choose a name

84
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:28,498
as nice as Xiaoliu.

85
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:36,337
Count them.

86
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:38,658
Let's call him according to
the number of the leaves.

87
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:47,577
Seventeen leaves.

88
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:51,218
Beggar,

89
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:54,577
from today on, your name is Ye Shiqi.
[*Ye Shiqi means seventeen leaves.]

90
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:56,017
Sounds good.

91
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:28,297
Incorrigible.

92
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:28,978
Mu,

93
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,098
can Pimply and Skinny learn well

94
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:32,538
following you?

95
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,058
What a bad mentor.

96
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,312
- I will wash.
- I will hit you even if you do it.

97
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:40,417
- You're still hitting me even if I wash?
- I'm hitting you because you are incorrigible.

98
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,137
- Mu.
- I'll hit you.

99
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:44,992
I'm hitting you
because you are incorrigible.

100
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:00,778
Xiaoliu.

101
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:36,657
Who exactly are you?

102
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:47,018
After taking off your noble clothes

103
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:49,338
and losing your noble status,

104
00:08:50,537 --> 00:08:51,777
you are nothing at all.

105
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:41,898
I am

106
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,737
Ye Shiqi.

107
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,818
I am Xiang Liu,
the nine-headed serpent demon.

108
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,138
You soldiers from Xiyan,

109
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:13,138
surrender now,

110
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:15,217
or I will eat you all.

111
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,537
Nine-headed serpent demon is coming.

112
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:24,777
Nine-headed serpent demon?

113
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,657
A nobody that I've never heard of.

114
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:29,018
The nine-headed serpent demon is also
known as Xiang Liu with nine lives.

115
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:29,984
The military adviser
of Chenrong's rebel army.

116
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:33,777
Rumor has it that he is crafty,
with nine heads and nine lives.

117
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:36,064
The King of Xiyan has offered
a rich reward for his capture.

118
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:39,657
It's been a hundred years, but no one has caught him.
He is one of the most formidable figures in Dahuang.

119
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:40,737
Nonsense.

120
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,018
Is he as powerful as my brother?

121
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:42,578
Of...

122
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:49,657
Let's go.

123
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,818
It seems that Fifth Uncle

124
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:08,097
has spent efforts over the years,

125
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:10,297
in order to eliminate Xiang Liu.

126
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:12,458
For more than a hundred years,

127
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:15,097
Xiang Liu has always ranked first
on the Xiyan wanted list.

128
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:16,177
He's very troublesome.

129
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:18,537
Not only is
Xiang Liu's spirit power strong,

130
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:19,938
but he is also brave and tactful,

131
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:22,657
and knows military law
and manages soldiers well.

132
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:24,217
With his assistance,

133
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:28,138
the tens of thousands of remnants of the Chenrong army
have actually left the entire Xiyan

134
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:29,417
at a loss.

135
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:31,378
We can see how talented he is.

136
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,018
True, My Lord.

137
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:34,578
If it weren't for Xiang Liu,

138
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:37,824
relying solely on Hong Jiang, the remnants
of the Chenrong army wouldn't have lasted this long.

139
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,617
My Lord, I am willing to do my utmost
to kill Xiang Liu.

140
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,818
It would be a pity
to kill such a person.

141
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:46,338
If I could use him,

142
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:48,378
I would have the wind at my back.

143
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:51,378
Go discuss with spies

144
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,217
in the Chenrong Army,

145
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,338
to see if there is any way

146
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:56,417
to make him abandon Chenrong Army

147
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:57,417
and work for me.

148
00:11:58,378 --> 00:11:58,938
Yes.

149
00:11:59,058 --> 00:11:59,857
Understood.

150
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:04,737
You'd better

151
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:05,938
keep the gift yourself.

152
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:06,777
Leave. Leave now.

153
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:07,338
Wait.

154
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:08,938
Both children are willing,

155
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,898
so you should reconsider.

156
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:12,217
There's nothing to think about.

157
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:13,818
I only have this one daughter.

158
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,458
I've raised her
by slaughtering pigs and sheep.

159
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,018
I'm relying on her
for the rest of my life.

160
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:18,977
If you can't make enough dowry,

161
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,818
don't mention the marriage anymore.

162
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:21,537
Go.

163
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:23,578
Chuntao!

164
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:24,018
Uncle Mu!

165
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,018
Chuntao!

166
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:25,977
Uncle Mu!

167
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:27,097
Chuntao!

168
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:42,297
Kudzu root, 1.2 Qian.

169
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:45,818
Great burdock fruit, 1.2 Qian.

170
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,657
Catnip, 1.2 Qian.

171
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:50,698
Hogfennel root, 1.2 Qian.

172
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,018
Fangfeng, 1.2 Qian.

173
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:54,818
Weeping forsythia fruit, 1.2 Qian.

174
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:56,537
Honeysuckle, 1.2 Qian.

175
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,417
Balloonflower root, 1.2 Qian.

176
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:06,258
Licorice, half a Qian.

177
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:08,938
The effect.

178
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:12,177
Dispelling pathogenic wind and heat.

179
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:13,824
Mainly for treating measles.

180
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,258
There is no small matter to a physician.
If you have any questions, just ask.

181
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:27,938
The effect of kudzu root soups

182
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,617
is to clear heat.

183
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,737
The resolving exterior method's effect
is to dispel pathogenic wind and heat.

184
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:35,617
Although both prescriptions
treat measles,

185
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:39,258
kudzu root soups
are for the initial stage,

186
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:41,898
and resolving exterior method is used
when there are lung manifestations.

187
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:47,898
From now on, I'll leave all work to you.

188
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,552
I have trained apprentices
for dozens of years.

189
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,058
There is finally an apprentice
who can work independently,

190
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,378
and I can enjoy my life now.

191
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:07,698
It's for buying herbs,

192
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,018
which can't be saved.

193
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:12,058
It's for the rent,

194
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:13,258
which also can't be saved.

195
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:16,378
It's for food.

196
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:20,737
We really can't spend less.

197
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:23,617
But

198
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:25,777
it isn't enough.

199
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,898
Butcher Gao is asking for a hefty dowry.

200
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:30,938
We really can't afford to give more.

201
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:33,258
Wait.

202
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:35,297
Does it cost so much to marry a wife?

203
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:37,498
Women are really troublesome.

204
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,698
It's okay, Pimply.
I'll treat you to a drink.

205
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:52,698
Go ahead.

206
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:55,537
Stop messing around.

207
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,498
Let's go, let's go. It's fine.

208
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:01,728
I'll treat you to a drink.

209
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,258
Let's go, let's go.

210
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:12,018
Let's go.

211
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,217
Let's go, let's go.

212
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:21,258
It seems that for Pimply's marriage,

213
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:24,498
we have to wait another two years.

214
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:47,818
Xiaoliu?

215
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:51,698
What are you...

216
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:56,938
You will go to the mountain
to collect herbs?

217
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:01,378
For the marriage of Skinny, we can wait.

218
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,537
But we can't wait
any longer for Pimply's marriage.

219
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:07,537
We can't let the woman Pimply likes
leave him because of dowry.

220
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:08,297
Moreover,

221
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:10,737
if I can find two or three spirit herbs,

222
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,777
dowry for marriages of Pimply

223
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:14,578
and Skinny will be sufficient.

224
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,938
But the spirit herbs grow
in the deep mountain,

225
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:21,097
which is Chenrong Army's territory.

226
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,818
Although the Hong Jiang
is strict and disciplined,

227
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,338
and does not kill innocents randomly,

228
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,458
his military advisor, Xiang Liu,

229
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:29,177
is very difficult to deal with

230
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:31,018
and ruthless.

231
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:33,617
I'm not spying on military information.

232
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:35,058
I'm just digging spirit herbs.

233
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:36,898
However ruthless he is,

234
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:38,977
he has to abide by
military discipline, right?

235
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:39,898
What's more,

236
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:41,938
I won't run into a big shot

237
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:43,578
like military advisor Xiang Liu.

238
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:44,297
Don't worry.

239
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,297
Xiaoliu.

240
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,458
I'll just dig some spirit herbs
and come back.

241
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:49,578
I'm not a spy.

242
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:50,617
I won't go deeper.

243
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:51,258
It's okay.

244
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:54,258
Be careful.

245
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:40,897
Shiqi?

246
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:52,858
I'm going to the mountain
to collect some herbs.

247
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:54,338
Why did you follow me?

248
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:55,458
Go back now.

249
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:56,177
Go back.

250
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,098
Didn't I tell you to go back?

251
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:05,017
Didn't you hear what I just said?

252
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,257
I told you to go back.

253
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:07,098
Stop following me.

254
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,818
In the Chenrong Army,

255
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:15,698
there is a nine-headed demon,

256
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:17,657
which looks incredibly terrifying.

257
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,657
It murders humans,

258
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:21,458
kills the deity,

259
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:22,858
and then eats them all.

260
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,897
Once you go in,
you won't be able to come out.

261
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:35,458
Do you have to follow?

262
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,897
Are you a deserter from Chenrong?

263
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:42,978
Are you a soldier from Xiyan?

264
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:46,218
Are you a spy from Haoling?

265
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:49,618
Then you can go to the mountain.

266
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:51,137
Follow me.

267
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:23,818
Quite particular.

268
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,698
You're so virtuous and capable.

269
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:59,098
It's lucky for the girl
to marry you in the future.

270
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:31,936
Once you pass this stone tablet,
you'll be in the Chenrong Army's territory.

271
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:33,978
Never ever step in.

272
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:36,618
Okay.

273
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:41,137
After Chenrong was destroyed by Xiyan,

274
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,458
all that was left is this small place
occupied by Hong Jiang.

275
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:47,297
Hong Jiang is strict and disciplined,

276
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,818
so if you accidentally run into the Chenrong Army
on the mountain, there's no need to panic.

277
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:52,777
But the nine-headed serpent, Xiang Liu,

278
00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:54,297
is quite troublesome.

279
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:55,818
He is ruthless

280
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,377
and acts without regard.

281
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:58,537
I heard

282
00:20:58,938 --> 00:20:59,978
when he kills the deity,

283
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:01,177
he doesn't even blink.

284
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:03,458
Someone like you

285
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:05,377
tries not to enter the mountain.

286
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,098
Someone like me can't enter.

287
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:10,218
Someone like you

288
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:11,497
shouldn't enter either.

289
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:27,537
Feifei's excrement.

290
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:34,417
Shiqi,

291
00:21:35,218 --> 00:21:35,698
come here.

292
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,098
This is the excrement of Feifei.

293
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:41,818
Mortal also calls Feifei
a worry-relieving beast.

294
00:21:42,657 --> 00:21:44,297
The nobles like to domesticate it.

295
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,297
It's quite expensive
because it's hard to catch.

296
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:47,458
Wait for me here.

297
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:48,618
I'm going to catch Feifei.

298
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:54,137
I'll go with you.

299
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:56,338
Feifei is timid and wary.

300
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,368
If there are too many people,
it will definitely run away.

301
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,137
Listen to me.

302
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:04,978
The marriages of
Skinny and Pimply are relying on it.

303
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:12,377
I'll wait for you here.

304
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:13,618
Okay.

305
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:17,657
What's wrong again?

306
00:22:20,177 --> 00:22:21,377
Be careful.

307
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:24,777
Don't worry.

308
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:27,177
I lived alone in the mountains
for many years.

309
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:28,497
When I was hungry,

310
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:30,858
I even ate the eggs laid by
the thousand-year-old serpent demon.

311
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,698
Fierce beasts are

312
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,257
not dangerous to me at all.

313
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,458
Honestly,

314
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:37,537
even the most terrifying beast

315
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,978
is not as scary as humans sometimes.

316
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:42,578
I'll wait for you.

317
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,377
It will take a lot of effort
to catch Feifei.

318
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,578
If you can't wait,
you can go home first.

319
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,818
No one in this world
will wait for someone else forever.

320
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:16,858
When tired, they naturally leave.

321
00:23:49,257 --> 00:23:51,458
Feifei likes to listen to
the singing of young girls,

322
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:53,938
and can't bear to see people being sad.

and you're still helping others
relieve worries.

341
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:42,938
Silly boy.

342
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:44,537
There you go.

343
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:46,818
I won't catch you for money.

344
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,417
Sir,

345
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:06,257
I really didn't mean to offend you.

346
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:07,698
As you know,

347
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:10,137
Feifei is really difficult to catch.

348
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:12,458
If I hadn't lured it out first,

349
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:14,257
even if you wanted to eat it,

350
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:15,377
you wouldn't be able to.

351
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:25,978
Sir, Sir.

352
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,058
I know

353
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:29,578
you boast a handsome look,

354
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:32,058
an extraordinary posture,
and amazing claw strength.

355
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,578
You're clearly the king of eagles

356
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:35,858
and the ruler of the sky.

357
00:27:38,218 --> 00:27:40,698
I really admire you.

358
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,497
But today,

359
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:45,377
I really can't let you eat this Feifei.

360
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:02,058
Chubby,

361
00:28:04,137 --> 00:28:05,858
I told you several times.

362
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,257
Humans are cunning.

363
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:11,657
Have you learned your lesson this time?

364
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:30,417
If you throw these
crappy things at me again,

365
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:31,497
and dirty my clothes,

366
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,618
I'll cut off your hands.

367
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:15,698
Leave now!

368
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,098
Run!

369
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:20,738
Run now!

370
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:29,497
Please spare my life, Your Lordship.

371
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:30,537
Your Lordship,

372
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:32,537
I'm just a physician

373
00:29:32,578 --> 00:29:33,618
from Qingshui Town.

374
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:35,417
I have two younger brothers,

375
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:36,698
waiting to get married.

376
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:38,618
I was blinded by money

377
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:40,578
and wanted to
find some herbs in the mountain,

378
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,417
and sell them for money.

379
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:42,177
Antidote.

380
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,657
I'll give you the antidote.

381
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:51,897
My mount has eaten

382
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:54,017
at least tens
of thousands of poisonous snakes.

383
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:58,858
Even Xiyan's court physicians can't do anything
to it with the medicines they made.

384
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:01,017
I really didn't expect

385
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:02,657
that a physician from Qingshui Town

386
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:03,777
could be so powerful.

387
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,257
I was just lucky.

388
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:06,978
Your Lordship.

389
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:09,218
I'm really a physician.

390
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:10,417
I live at Rejuvenation Hall

391
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:11,618
by the West River in Qingshui Town.

392
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:13,897
I specialize in
treating women's infertility.

393
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:16,098
If you have a wife or concubines
who are infertile,

394
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:16,537
I will...

395
00:30:35,897 --> 00:30:36,777
Your Lordship,

396
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:38,698
please spare Feifei.

397
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:40,458
Its fur is more than its meat.

398
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:41,338
It doesn't taste good

399
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:42,377
and isn't worth eating.

400
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:13,777
Guards.

401
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:19,458
- Take him back to the military camp.
- Yes.

402
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,488
(Xiang Liu's Camp)

403
00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:51,537
The ears of a good spy
are more powerful than his eyes.

404
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:53,978
I've lived at Rejuvenation Hall

405
00:31:54,218 --> 00:31:55,938
for over twenty years.

406
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:57,818
You will know if you check it out.

407
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:39,938
(Xiang Liu with Nine Lives.)

408
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:26,537
Your Lordship,

409
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:27,777
we have known his identity.

410
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:29,058
His name is Wen Xiaoliu,

411
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:31,338
a pharmacist at Rejuvenation Hall
in Qingshui Town.

412
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:42,177
Your Lordship,
everything I said is true.

413
00:33:43,058 --> 00:33:44,297
I have family members

414
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:45,657
hoping for my return.

415
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,698
I only trust my own judgment.

416
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:52,377
Who

417
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:56,058
are you exactly?

418
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:58,777
I am Wen Xiaoliu,

419
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:01,297
the physician of Rejuvenation Hall.

420
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:19,098
Is that so?

421
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:23,457
But I don't believe it.

422
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:29,658
Your Lordship,

423
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,818
I really am Wen Xiaoliu.

424
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:34,737
Perhaps, I am not just Wen Xiaoliu.

425
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:36,338
But I have never had malice

426
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:37,697
towards the Chenrong Army.

427
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:39,977
I don't belong to Xiyan.

428
00:34:40,697 --> 00:34:41,697
I don't belong to Chenrong,

429
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:43,138
nor belong to Haoling.

430
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:44,457
I am just a...

431
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:47,418
Just what?

432
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:52,977
(Who am I on earth?)

433
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:13,737
My face!

434
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:15,178
My face!

435
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:16,418
My face!

436
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:17,618
My face!

437
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:19,537
I forgot what I look like.

438
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,017
I can't return.

439
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:22,257
Who am I?

440
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:23,858
Who am I?

441
00:35:26,178 --> 00:35:28,297
I am just an abandoned person.

442
00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:32,457
I couldn't protect myself,

443
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:35,537
had no one to rely on,

444
00:35:37,457 --> 00:35:38,777
and had nowhere to go.

445
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:42,338
So, I had to wander about,

446
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:46,457
and came to Qingshui Town
over twenty years ago,

447
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:47,537
becoming Wen Xiaoliu.

448
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:51,658
If you allow me,

449
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:55,578
I would like to be

450
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:57,138
Wen Xiaoliu for the rest of my life.

451
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:23,937
If you want to live,

452
00:36:25,297 --> 00:36:26,457
then work for me.

453
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:28,697
Work for you?

454
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:30,658
Be my man

455
00:36:31,618 --> 00:36:32,537
and obey me.

456
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:43,898
I'll give you one night to consider.

457
00:36:44,658 --> 00:36:46,017
I want the answer tomorrow.

458
00:36:58,457 --> 00:37:00,737
Investigate the spies
in the remnants of the Chenrong Army.

459
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:02,338
Be cautious.

460
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:03,257
Yes.

461
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:52,378
You are too kind-hearted.

462
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:54,178
Sang is so spoiled
that he has no manners,

463
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:55,658
but the master serves him instead.

464
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:56,658
Princess,

465
00:37:57,418 --> 00:37:59,418
the thousand-year-old mulberries

466
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:01,858
are all left for you.

467
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:04,512
I certainly haven't been willing
to give them to anyone else.

468
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:08,977
Though he lacks manners,

469
00:38:09,098 --> 00:38:10,378
he is devoted to his master.

470
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,058
There are some redeeming features.

471
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:27,290
(Chenrong Army's Temporary Camp)

472
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:48,858
Shiqi must have gone back

473
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:50,058
when he didn't see me.

474
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:53,098
I don't know if Mu and the others

475
00:38:53,378 --> 00:38:54,497
would be worried.

476
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:53,898
Have you decided?

477
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,697
Still thinking about it.

478
00:39:58,457 --> 00:39:59,537
I'm a bit thirsty.

479
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:01,457
May I have some water first?

480
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:04,737
Guards.

481
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:08,457
Whip him.

482
00:40:09,257 --> 00:40:09,977
Twenty times.

483
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:21,737
I...

484
00:40:22,017 --> 00:40:22,898
I've made up my mind.

485
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,338
I've made up my mind.

486
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,098
I've made up my mind.

487
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:30,658
Your Lordship,

488
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:32,058
twenty lashes have been done.

489
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:35,232
Have you made up your mind?

490
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:36,257
Yes.

491
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:39,658
I agree to your terms.

492
00:40:41,618 --> 00:40:42,418
But...

493
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:45,297
But I have three conditions.

494
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:46,618
Whip him

495
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:48,058
twenty times.

496
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:57,098
Two conditions. Two...

497
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:00,378
One condition.

498
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:02,497
One.

499
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:04,737
One.

500
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:07,098
One condition.

501
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,297
Your Lordship,
twenty lashes have been done.

502
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:20,297
Any more conditions?

503
00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:26,697
Even if you beat me to death,

504
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:29,858
I still have one condition.

505
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:38,858
Tell me.

506
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:42,138
I will never leave Qingshui Town.

507
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:45,297
If you don't agree,

508
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,578
then just kill me.

509
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:54,017
Okay.

510
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,457
Help me make the medicines I want.

511
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:27,818
You can stay in Qingshui Town,

512
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:29,058
and be a physician.

513
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:30,858
But when I summon you,

514
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:32,898
you must obey.

515
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:35,058
Okay.

516
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:38,618
But it's not like you say what you want,

517
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:40,418
and I am able to make it.

518
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:41,777
If you can't make it,

519
00:42:42,737 --> 00:42:44,017
then use your body in exchange.

520
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:52,058
Your Lordship, you are indeed handsome.

521
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,937
I'm not unwilling to serve you,

522
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:56,658
but...

523
00:42:58,457 --> 00:42:59,457
Your Lordship!

524
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:02,338
If you can't make it once,

525
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:05,457
you'll take
a part of your body in exchange.

526
00:43:06,178 --> 00:43:06,858
For the first time,

527
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:09,257
let's start with your useless ears.

528
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:11,138
After two times,

529
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:13,618
let's go with the nose.

530
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,777
If the nose is cut off,

531
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:17,058
you look a bit ugly.

532
00:43:17,937 --> 00:43:18,697
Don't worry,

533
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:22,497
I won't chop off your hands, because
they are needed for formulating the medicines.

534
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:24,058
I understand.

535
00:43:24,537 --> 00:43:26,058
I understand.

536
00:43:29,058 --> 00:43:30,457
You're a slippery eel,

537
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:32,217
hard to grasp.

538
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:34,537
If I am not careful,

539
00:43:35,098 --> 00:43:36,737
I'll get my hands dirty.

540
00:43:37,418 --> 00:43:38,858
But you'd better find out

541
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:41,457
what kind of person I am.

542
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:44,257
I understand without inquiries.

543
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:46,737
Your Lordship! Your Lordship!

544
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,217
