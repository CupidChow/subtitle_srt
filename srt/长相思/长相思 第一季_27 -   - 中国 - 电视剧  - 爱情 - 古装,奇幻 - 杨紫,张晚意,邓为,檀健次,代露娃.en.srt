2
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:36,480
=Episode 27=

3
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:40,768
(Tushan)

4
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:57,427
Master, Miss Fangfeng is here.

5
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,226
You may leave.

6
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,147
I have a word with her in private.

7
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:04,147
Yes.

8
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:10,347
I'm checking accounts with grandmother.

9
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,987
Can we talk later?

10
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:14,386
Miss Fangfeng.

11
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:19,787
I'll never forget your kindness

12
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,307
towards the Tushan Family.

13
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:24,026
But marriage can't be forced.

14
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:26,427
We've been living
like brother and sister.

15
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:27,746
I can't be your husband,

16
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:28,867
but I can be your brother

17
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:29,666
and announce it.

18
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:35,867
All these years,

19
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,466
I've been staying at Qingqiu,

20
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:42,026
busying myself for the Tushan Family,

21
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:45,147
not to be your sister.

22
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,546
Marriage requires mutual affection.

23
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:50,787
I already have someone I love.

24
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:53,227
Please forgive me.

25
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:55,386
What did you say?

26
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,147
I already have someone I love.

27
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,864
How is that possible?

28
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:08,347
I know the world is harsher on women.

29
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,826
You might feel hurt.

30
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,227
I am being selfish and unfaithful.

31
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,787
I will confess all my faults
to the public

32
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,826
to minimize the harm to you.

33
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:18,906
You will cancel the engagement.

34
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:20,307
How do you minimize the harm?

35
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,947
Grandmother takes you
as her granddaughter.

36
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:23,826
As the lady of Tushan Family,

37
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:25,266
you'll have another good match.

38
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:28,466
My family will provide you
with a generous dowry.

39
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,546
The Chishui Family,
Xiling family, and Guifang Family

40
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,707
will all open their doors
to the Fangfeng Family.

41
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:35,587
I promise

42
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:38,466
Fangfeng Family will
under the protection of Tushan Family.

43
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:41,307
The Fangfeng Family won't suffer losses.

44
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:43,707
So, you've been running around

45
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:45,587
just to cancel the engagement?

46
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,906
I know fame and benefits

47
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:49,906
can't make up for your emotional damage.

48
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:51,746
But I'm in love with someone else.

49
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,987
I can only repay you

50
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:54,906
some day.

51
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:12,707
I didn't expect to eat roast meat

52
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,347
in the Central Plains.

53
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,867
The taste is as good as that
of Xiyan Town.

54
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:20,187
I'm glad you like it.

55
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,688
Excuse me, ten coins in total.

56
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:38,346
I pay the check later.

57
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,346
Did you leave your moneybag at home?

58
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,346
Come here. I'll pay.

59
00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:56,147
I said it was my treat.

60
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,867
It's okay. Didn't you...

61
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:03,867
Very funny.

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,587
You don't have any money

63
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:07,386
and refuse to let this lady pay.

64
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:08,546
You should know

65
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,106
money makes you emboldened.

66
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,987
Don't pretend to be generous.

67
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,027
You're in over your head.

68
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,346
Get me another plate of pickles.

69
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:20,786
Hurry up.

70
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:21,346
Got it.

71
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,066
Calm down.

72
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:39,467
Calm down.

73
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:41,867
Calm down.

74
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:53,747
What do you think I'm going to do?

75
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:57,386
As a charming man,

76
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,066
you surely won't

77
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,187
kill that waiter.

78
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,587
You have a broad mind

79
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,106
and high ambitions.

80
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:09,946
You will ignore these ordinary people.

81
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:11,027
Am I right?

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,266
I just wanted to find a pawnshop

83
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:20,987
to pawn my jade pendant.

84
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,027
Sorry.

85
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,266
I really didn't know.

86
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,266
I thought...

87
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:38,627
Go ahead.

88
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:40,467
That waiter will let you pay soon.

89
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,307
The bill shall be paid by a man,

90
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:50,987
not you.

91
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,666
Fine, I won't do it again.

92
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:08,027
Three months later,

93
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,427
I've picked an auspicious day

94
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:10,747
for your wedding.

95
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:13,666
Everything has been arranged.

96
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,266
Your wedding will be held

97
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,946
on that day.

98
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,427
Your wedding has been delayed
for so long.

99
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,066
We should arrange it.

100
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,147
Whoever you like,

101
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:29,066
you can marry her.

102
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,147
But,

103
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:36,346
it must be
after your marriage to Yiying.

104
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:38,946
Grandmother,

105
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,266
you never planned
to cancel the engagement.

106
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:44,826
You've been deceiving me.

107
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:45,786
Jing.

108
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:48,307
I allow you

109
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:50,307
to marry the girl you like.

110
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:53,627
But you have to marry Yiying first.

111
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:55,506
What's wrong with having one more girl

112
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,427
to take care of you?

113
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:58,707
Even if

114
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:01,987
you never like Yiying,

115
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:05,467
you can find a girl you like

116
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,027
and live with her.

117
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,666
In this big Tushan Mansion,

118
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:11,386
what's wrong

119
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,826
with Yiying living here?

120
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,707
It is absolutely impossible.

121
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:23,747
As long as I am alive,

122
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:28,346
I won't approve your breakup with Yiying
for marrying another woman.

123
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:33,706
In that case,

124
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:36,947
I'd rather stay unmarried for life.

125
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:38,867
Stop.

126
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:41,706
Where are you going?

127
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,947
Since you want to keep Fangfeng Yiying,

128
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,427
I have to leave Qingqiu.

129
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,507
What did you say?

130
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:59,072
The restoration of the palace
on Chenrong Mountain is a huge project.

131
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:01,827
We're responsible for many tasks.

132
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:05,507
I will live in Zhiyi for a long time.

133
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,706
The foundation has been finished.

134
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:21,947
Once the cap block arrives,

135
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:23,706
we can start repairing the wall.

136
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:25,346
When will it arrive?

137
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:28,307
Today, the workers
of the Tushan Family will deliver it.

138
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:37,867
Greetings.

139
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:41,067
Master Qingqiu does everything yourself.

140
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:43,026
You even came

141
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,427
for delivering materials.

142
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:46,947
I'm here to see Your Highness.

143
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:48,427
I take my leave.

144
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:56,906
Cang Xuan, I want to see Xiaoyao.

145
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,387
Can you take a message for me?

146
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:04,666
Aren't you already in Chenrong Mountain?

147
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,226
Can't you send a letter
to Xiaoyao yourself?

148
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:08,146
I did,

149
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,187
but Xiaoyao hasn't replied.

150
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:11,987
I can only ask for your help.

151
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:14,586
Why should I help you upset Xiaoyao?

152
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,346
Chenrong Xinyue argued
with Fangfeng Yiying.

153
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,947
Fenglong had to apologize

154
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:20,947
to Fangfeng Yiying because of you.

155
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,187
Since you're so protective
of Fangfeng Yiying,

156
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:26,106
why do you look for Xiaoyao?

157
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,106
I don't like Fangfeng Yiying.

158
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:32,146
Considering her long service
to my family,

159
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:34,067
I didn't want her to lose face.

160
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:35,067
In my mind,

161
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:38,026
my sister's feelings
are the most important.

162
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:44,226
It was my fault. It won't happen again.

163
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:46,867
I'm sorry, but I can't help.

164
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,427
You should break up with Fangfeng Yiying

165
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,146
before seeing Xiaoyao.

166
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,706
How do you test my archery?

167
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:39,666
You should aim earlier and higher

168
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,546
to hit the target.

169
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:04,187
Not bad.

170
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,387
You can use a better bow

171
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:08,106
to learn more sophisticated archery.

172
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:09,586
A better bow?

173
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,747
Do we need to buy a new bow?

174
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:19,387
Who's paying for this bow?

175
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,106
You pay for your own bow.

176
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:27,067
Do you expect me to pay?

177
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:29,747
No, I didn't mean that.

178
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:30,827
I didn't.

179
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,786
I need to teach you a lesson.

180
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:49,987
I really can't help laughing.

181
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,546
I didn't expect you

182
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,026
to get caught short.

183
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,427
Are you looking for trouble

184
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:01,627
or going with me to buy a bow?

185
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:04,067
I'm going to buy a bow.

186
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:11,546
Wait for me.

187
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,976
(Weapons Shop)

188
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,507
Miss, did you find a bow you like?

189
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:19,666
Do you have other styles of bows?

190
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,627
We do, but they are all quite expensive.

191
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:25,187
The Tushan Family

192
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,226
always provides value for money.

193
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,906
It's definitely worth it.

194
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,586
I want to choose a handy bow.

195
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:31,747
Price is not a problem.

196
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,507
Okay, please come in.

197
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:42,026
This way, please.

198
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:43,427
You must

199
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,947
try weapons to know if they're good.

200
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,067
Here.

201
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,747
This is our weapon trial field.

202
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:54,106
Usually, customers are not allowed in.

203
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:56,026
Miss, please this way.

204
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:04,307
These are all top-grade bows forged
by Jintian Family.

205
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:05,627
Please have a look.

206
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:17,187
Try this one.

207
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:33,248
Grandmother knows you're going
to attend Chief Liu's banquet tomorrow.

208
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:34,827
She asked me to wait for you here

209
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:38,546
to tell you
that he likes daggers the most.

210
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,307
Everyone in Dahuang knows it.

211
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,507
You don't have to remind me.

212
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,627
But,

213
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:49,248
I want to see you.

214
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:51,546
Grandmother is not in good health.

215
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,267
She hopes to have you by her side.

216
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:55,786
Now because of me,

217
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:57,706
you two can't see each other.

218
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,067
It's all my fault.

219
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:17,546
Don't cry. Buy the dagger first.

220
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:34,627
I can't use this bow.

221
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:37,666
Your force posture is incorrect.

222
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:55,546
My brother and Xiaoyao.

223
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,187
Each bow has its own characteristics.

224
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:13,507
If you use it,

225
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,106
you must feel it

226
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:17,947
and work with it.

227
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,880
Bei.

228
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,226
What a coincidence.

229
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:40,546
Are you teaching archery?

230
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:41,146
Yes.

231
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:48,507
Bei.

232
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,307
Are you here to buy weapons too?

233
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,747
Right.

234
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,256
You've been training Xiaoyao
for a while now, haven't you?

235
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:08,306
Yes, he has been teaching me
for a long time.

236
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,186
Bei praised me for my progress.

237
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:11,867
So he brought me here
to choose a new bow.

238
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:14,946
Can I take a look?

239
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:17,466
Of course.

240
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,907
It's indeed remarkable,

241
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,066
and worth the hefty price.

242
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:30,426
Bei, you have a good eye.

243
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,426
I heard of your superior archery.

244
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,667
I haven't had the chance to see it.

245
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,907
Can you show it today?

246
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:39,747
Sure.

247
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:18,106
Here you go.

248
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,867
Very impressive.

249
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:25,867
Your archery skills got better.

250
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,560
Master Qingqiu is lucky.

251
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,867
Your fiancee is highly skilled.

252
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:35,826
And she is also beautiful.

253
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,106
No wonder people in Dahuang say

254
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,387
you two are a perfect match.

255
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:46,880
Don't tease us.

256
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:53,066
Bei, you need to teach me well.

257
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,387
I want to be as powerful as Miss Yiying.

258
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:58,507
Your archery

259
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:00,747
might never be as good as hers.

260
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,226
Bei.

261
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,306
Your disciple hasn't given up.

262
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,747
How could you give up first?

263
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:07,907
You need to teach princess well.

264
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:19,826
Put it in the best gift box.

265
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:20,426
Okay.

266
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:26,706
Could you wrap it up?

267
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:27,872
Okay.

268
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,267
Jing.

269
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:32,416
Can you pay for my brother?

270
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:46,400
How can I let him pay?

271
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,066
If he pays,

272
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:52,000
this bow will be a gift from him.

273
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:53,226
Miss.

274
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:56,306
Any thoughts?

275
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:57,987
Bei.

276
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:11,186
I appreciate your kindness.

277
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:15,507
But I buy this bow for Xiaoyao.

278
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,346
So, I can't let you pay.

279
00:20:20,826 --> 00:20:21,507
I'm sorry.

280
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,867
I was inconsiderate.

281
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:24,128
I shouldn't say that.

282
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:29,387
Thank you, sir. Hope to see you again.

283
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:30,387
We'll be leaving.

284
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:32,544
See you, princess.

285
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,826
The gift for Chief Liu is ready.

286
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,747
- Then we...
- Miss Fangfeng.

287
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:45,547
Don't make others misunderstand.

288
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:49,547
I will discuss the annulment
with Chief Fangfeng.

289
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:54,667
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,787
I shouldn't have asked you to pay

291
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:59,306
without your consent.

292
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,706
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,066
Give me back the money.

294
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:22,867
I know you don't care about the money.

295
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,867
I shouldn't have used you
to make Tushan Jing angry.

296
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:29,226
Please forgive me.

297
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:30,586
I won't dare to do this again.

298
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:33,667
Thank you.

299
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:34,907
Thank you.

300
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:36,027
Thank you.

301
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:37,426
Thank you.

302
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:38,627
Thank you.

303
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,147
Do you think if you keep waiting here,

304
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:03,987
I will soften and go see him?

305
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:05,267
I'm not like him.

306
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:07,627
He is soft-hearted

307
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,106
and indecisive.

308
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:11,747
Well...

309
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,907
I am quite hard-hearted.

310
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:17,667
Xiaoyao.

311
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:28,480
Why are you bullying it?

312
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,627
I don't hate it.

313
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:31,616
Its owner is annoying.

314
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:45,507
It looks delicious.

315
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:48,667
It's poisonous.

316
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:49,946
What kind of hobby is this?

317
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:52,147
Are you cooking poison?

318
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:54,147
Your pharmacy is turning into a kitchen.

319
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,387
(I am willing to care about you,)

320
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:15,946
(but I don't want)

321
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:18,267
(to care about you
because of Fangfeng Yiying.)

322
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,920
(Zhiyi)

323
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:22,586
What is this?

324
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:24,147
Open it.

325
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,547
Eat slowly.

326
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,186
How's the taste?

327
00:25:43,872 --> 00:25:44,426
Not too bad.

328
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,667
You liar.

329
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:51,946
I'm the only person
who can make poison taste this good

330
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:52,907
in this world.

331
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,826
I'm the only person
who can appreciate your culinary skills.

332
00:25:58,368 --> 00:25:59,306
Isn't that just perfect?

333
00:25:59,712 --> 00:26:01,027
Finding a confidant is enough.

334
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,106
So, are you no longer angry?

335
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:09,267
Can you continue teaching me archery?

336
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,547
I have to leave for a while.

337
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:21,667
I'll teach you after that.

338
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:26,586

Tushan Jing is determined
to break up with me.

360
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:55,867
I really can't take it anymore.

361
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:02,747
Be patient.

362
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:07,586
You always ask me to wait.

363
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,586
If I wait any longer,
I'll become a laughingstock in Dahuang.

364
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:12,787
What do you want to do?

365
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:13,856
Kill him.

366
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:15,147
Are you crazy?

367
00:28:16,547 --> 00:28:17,946
If I could, I would have done it.

368
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:21,346
Tushan Jing has been

369
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:23,547
on guard against me.

370
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:26,667
Grandmother is also suspicious of me.

371
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,507
Rash action...

372
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:29,186
I don't care.

373
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:31,346
Anyway, I can't bear it anymore.

374
00:28:39,826 --> 00:28:41,147
Don't be impulsive.

375
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:45,586
Now is not the time to kill him.

376
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:52,547
Hou,

377
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,586
you kill Tushan Jing first,

378
00:28:56,787 --> 00:28:58,426
then get rid of Lan Mei.

379
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:02,147
Grandmother loves me.

380
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:05,907
She will let me marry you.

381
00:29:08,426 --> 00:29:09,507
You're really crazy.

382
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:13,547
After you calm yourself,

383
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:15,147
we'll meet again.

384
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:20,627
You drive me mad.

385
00:29:44,186 --> 00:29:44,547
Go.

386
00:30:21,507 --> 00:30:22,226
Be careful, Master.

387
00:30:48,987 --> 00:30:49,907
Why are you still here?

388
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:51,987
If you don't leave,

389
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:53,946
I'll order them to tie you up

390
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:55,267
and feed you to the beasts.

391
00:30:59,507 --> 00:30:59,987
Xiaoyao.

392
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:01,747
Xiaoyao.

393
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:04,826
You coward.

394
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:06,507
Jing was ambushed on the way back

395
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:07,507
from Chief Liu's feast.

396
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,226
How is Jing?

397
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:10,466
His injuries must be severe.

398
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:11,547
I don't know if he's alive.

399
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:12,706
I asked Fenglong...

400
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:13,706
Stop.

401
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:14,826
I'll find Jing.

402
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:16,147
You won't see him.

403
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:17,306
You should wait for Fenglong.

404
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:18,306
I won't go to Qingqiu.

405
00:31:18,426 --> 00:31:20,106
I want to go to place
in Chenrong Mountain.

406
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:22,987
Put on a coat. I'll go with you.

407
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:53,267
You fool.

408
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:55,987
I'm so worried about you.

409
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:57,586
You're here.

410
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:08,186
Why is there so much water vapor?

411
00:32:08,987 --> 00:32:10,306
How long have you been standing here?

412
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:12,507
Have you been waiting

413
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:13,787
from yesterday?

414
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,808
You never showed up,

415
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,586
so I kept waiting.

416
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,027
The Tushan Jing outside is your puppet?

417
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,987
I haven't left
since I got here yesterday.

418
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:26,747
I was supposed
to attend a banquet today,

419
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,867
but I haven't seen Xiaoyao yet,

420
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:31,507
so I let the puppet go.

421
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:33,267
I'm glad you're safe.

422
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:34,907
Go back now.

423
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,027
Your puppet is seriously injured.

424
00:32:37,186 --> 00:32:38,627
Qingqiu is in chaos.

425
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:50,346
Can I spend some time alone with Jing?

426
00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:54,507
I'll go back first

427
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,226
and pick you up later.

428
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:17,226
I didn't come to see you
not because I'm into someone else,

429
00:33:18,507 --> 00:33:20,186
and I want to break up with you.

430
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:23,426
I'm just unhappy.

431
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,826
I know you are struggling,

432
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,267
but I'm still unhappy.

433
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:31,392
I'm sorry.

434
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:34,226
Grandmother promised
to cancel engagement.

435
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:36,826
But she suddenly changed her mind.

436
00:33:38,747 --> 00:33:40,346
She said
I could marry the person I like,

437
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:46,907
but I must marry Fangfeng Yiying first.

438
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:49,987
You wish.

439
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:56,147
Xiaoyao, don't be mad.

440
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:58,346
Give me some more time.

441
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:00,547
I will definitely find a solution.

442
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:11,466
If you are just Tushan Jing,

443
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:13,706
I would have cut ties with you.

444
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,027
But,

445
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,587
you were Ye Shiqi when I first met you.

446
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:24,547
Since I promised you
to wait for 15 years,

447
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:27,906
if you don't get married,

448
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:30,426
I will wait for you.

449
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,906
I'm sorry.

450
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:53,226
Don't focus on

451
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:54,906
cancelling your engagement for now.

452
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:57,027
Keep yourself safe first.

453
00:34:57,827 --> 00:35:00,587
Someone dared
to assassinate you in Zhiyi.

454
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,307
The other party must try to kill you.

455
00:35:06,027 --> 00:35:08,027
I spent so much effort
to save you back then.

456
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:11,027
Don't get yourself killed.

457
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:12,507
Don't worry.

458
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:14,987
I will be careful.

459
00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:21,307
Remember

460
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,146
to be ruthless if you have to.

461
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,386
I see.

462
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:41,706
Suppress the news
that Jing is severely injured.

463
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:44,827
Don't let any news get out.

464
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:45,587
Yes.

465
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,146
From today,

466
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:52,507
should I call you Chief Tushan?

467
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:56,747
Didn't you notice that the one lying

468
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,186
on the bed is Tushan Jing's puppet?

469
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,386
What? His puppet?

470
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:05,024
(Tushan Mansion)

471
00:36:07,226 --> 00:36:08,626
Grandmother, I'm back.

472
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:11,264
I'm glad you're safe.

473
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:13,466
It's good.

474
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:15,067
I'm sorry to make you worry.

475
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:21,307
Punish the murderer without mercy.

476
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:24,507
Please rest assured.

477
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:27,027
The murderer will pay the price.

478
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:30,626
Master.

479
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:32,587
The 58 shops in Zhiyi

480
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:33,747
have all been sorted through,

481
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:34,787
and our people get in.

482
00:36:35,186 --> 00:36:36,547
Is there any movement from my brother?

483
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,027
Probably he feels guilty,

484
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:39,747
so he is very cooperative

485
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:40,736
and has to give up.

486
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:10,400
I'm sorry.

487
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:12,827
Because of my recklessness,

488
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:16,067
you were suppressed by Tushan Jing.

489
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:16,987
You don't have to.

490
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,827
We're not officially married,

491
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,666
but I've seen you as my wife.

492
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:27,626
We should share weal and woe.

493
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:37,067
You don't have to worry too much.

494
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:40,226
Although I suffered great losses,

495
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:43,386
with the support
of the Fifth and Seventh Kings,

496
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,186
Tushan Jing

497
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:47,466
couldn't threaten me.

498
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:48,787
That's good.

499
00:37:50,426 --> 00:37:52,866
I will listen to you in future.

500
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:03,587
In the name of finding assassins,

501
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,666
Jing cleaned up the Tushan Family,

502
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:08,067
getting rid of many men of Tushan Hou.

503
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,666
So, my uncles lost Hou's support,

504
00:38:12,027 --> 00:38:14,587
and their influence
in the Central Plains has been weakened.

505
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:18,666
In this case,
the assassination is a good thing.

506
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:21,747
Tushan Hou doesn't look like a fool.

507
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:24,146
Why did he take such a stupid move?

508
00:38:24,787 --> 00:38:26,186
It's totally not his style.

509
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,747
The open assassination is a bit reckless

510
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:31,507
but very effective.

511
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:33,027
Once done,

512
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,386
Tushan Hou can not only get rid of Jing,

513
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:37,507
but also root out all of Jing's forces

514
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:39,386
in the name of finding assassins,

515
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,267
like what Jing is doing now.

516
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:43,466
It makes sense.

517
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:45,747
I made an appointment.

518
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:46,906
I have to go.

519
00:38:47,386 --> 00:38:47,866
Hold on.

520
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:51,666
I have a favor to ask you.

521
00:38:53,507 --> 00:38:55,507
I wonder what favor

522
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:57,186
you will ask me.

523
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:00,547
I've asked Xiaoyao out several times,

524
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:01,626
but she refused me.

525
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,466
Could you put in a good word for me?

526
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:06,547
I want to meet her.

527
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:10,587
Okay.

528
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:12,946
I'll let her see you,

529
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:15,987
But I can't control her final decision.

530
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:17,067
I understand.

531
00:39:17,787 --> 00:39:19,706
I don't expect her
to fall for me at once.

532
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:21,146
We can be friends first.

533
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,706
Whether it will work out is up to me.

534
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:32,626
Fenglong asked you out, but you refused.

535
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,347
Do you want me to agree?

536
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:41,347
He asked me
to put in a good word for him.

537
00:39:42,027 --> 00:39:42,507
I agreed.

538
00:39:44,787 --> 00:39:46,426
You're not going
to make me marry him, are you?

539
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:48,307
No way.

540
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:53,946
Don't care about what I think.

541
00:39:55,347 --> 00:39:57,146
I'm curious why it is impossible?

542
00:39:58,547 --> 00:39:59,626
Tushan Jing is engaged,

543
00:40:00,027 --> 00:40:01,426
and Fangfeng Bei is a playboy.

544
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:03,827
Compared to them,

545
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:05,787
Fenglong has both talent

546
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:07,307
and family background,

547
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:10,347
and there are no women around him.

548
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:12,507
Why is it absolutely impossible?

549
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:19,587
If I tell you,

550
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:20,866
you promise not to hit me?

551
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:25,226
Anyway, it won't be anything good.

552
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:28,107
Okay, I promise I won't hit you.

553
00:40:30,107 --> 00:40:31,307
There's nothing wrong with Fenglong.

554
00:40:31,706 --> 00:40:34,067
But he's a lot like you.

555
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:36,067
He is calculating well.

556
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:37,666
He wants to see me

557
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,307
not because he cares about me,

558
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:42,946
but because he thinks I'm his best match

559
00:40:43,347 --> 00:40:44,787
among the eligible women.

560
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:47,027
I'm suitable
to be the lady of the Chishui Clan.

561
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:54,706
He's like me, so you can't accept him.

562
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:56,787
You promised not to hit me.

563
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:04,466
In Fenglong's position,

564
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:07,507
he can't just do what he likes,

565
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,386
so he has to consider everything.

566
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:14,386
Even though he has a comparison,

567
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:18,027
it doesn't mean there's no affection.

568
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:23,307
You really want to help him, don't you?

569
00:41:24,987 --> 00:41:26,906
Are you my brother or his?

570
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,347
Of course I'm yours.

571
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:32,186
I don't ask you to marry Fenglong.

572
00:41:33,906 --> 00:41:35,146
But since he asked me to help,

573
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:37,347
I couldn't refuse him.

574
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:40,507
For me, I hope

575
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:42,787
you can see him.

576
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:47,386
Do you now depend on his help?

577
00:41:58,146 --> 00:41:59,666
Xiaoyao, I need to tell you something.

578
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:02,347
What is it?

579
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:04,547
I've been secretly training troops

580
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:07,027
and have formed my own army.

581
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:10,787
If grandfather finds out about it,

582
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:12,507
it will cause the family extermination.

583
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:18,666
Now, only you
and I are left on Zhaoyun Peak.

584
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,347
What do I have to fear about that?

585
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:22,787
I am the Princess of Haoling.

586
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,706
Even if our grandfather finds it,

587
00:42:24,706 --> 00:42:26,626
he won't blame me.

588
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:28,146
But what about you?

589
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,507
I'm tired of being unable
to protect myself.

590
00:42:31,946 --> 00:42:33,226
I want to have my own army.

591
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:55,547
Xuan.

592
00:42:57,426 --> 00:42:58,307
I'll meet Fenglong.

593
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:09,386
I do need Fenglong,

594
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:12,866
but he can't do without me either.

595
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,347
Only I can give what he wants.

596
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,547
If you really don't like him,

597
00:43:22,107 --> 00:43:23,747
you don't have to push yourself for me.

598
00:43:26,226 --> 00:43:28,507
I sincerely think
Fenglong is a good man.

599
00:43:29,547 --> 00:43:30,666
You can see him.

600
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:35,347
You deserve a better man
than Tushan Jing.

601
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,347
We're talking about Fenglong.

602
00:43:38,107 --> 00:43:39,547
Why did you mention Tushan Jing?

603
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:45,827
Anyway, I promise you.

604
00:43:46,866 --> 00:43:48,946
I'll try to see Fenglong as a friend

605
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:50,186
and be true to him.
