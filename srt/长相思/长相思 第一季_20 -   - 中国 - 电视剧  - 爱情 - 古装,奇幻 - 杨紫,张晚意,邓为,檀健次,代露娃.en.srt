=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,448
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:42,787
Fangfeng Yiying saw the wounds
on your body,

4
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:45,346
so she was sick of you?

5
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:47,107
Yes.

6
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:52,067
Those are just some surface scars.

7
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:55,507
Just an image of you.
You might misunderstand her.

8
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:01,986
Who can ignore the image?

9
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:05,107
If I were not Master Qingqiu,

10
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:07,747
without the wealth of the Tushan family,

11
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:10,866
without these glamorous clothes,

12
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,306
who would look at me?

13
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:16,706
Xiaoyao,

14
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:19,786
not everyone can be like you,

15
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:23,107
embracing me without disgust

16
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:24,987
when I was ragged and stinky.

17
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:29,107
In fact, at the beginning,

18
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:31,987
I didn't intend to save you.

19
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:35,627
Besides, when I was down and out,

20
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:37,706
I wasn't much better than you.

21
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,347
How could I despise you?

22
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:42,387
Miss Fangfeng is different from me.

23
00:02:43,107 --> 00:02:45,187
She has been pampered
since she was a child.

24
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:46,706
She is pretty.

25
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:50,426
It's normal for her to be picky.

26
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:52,827
You're the best.

27
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:57,907
With this look?

28
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,627
Although I know you're lying,

29
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:04,747
I still love to hear it.

30
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:06,786
I didn't lie.

31
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:10,107
Have you heard the discussion
about you in Dahuang?

32
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:12,187
What did they discuss about me?

33
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:15,187
They discussed how good you are.

34
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:20,946
I know I'm not good enough for you.

35
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,627
In this world,

36
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:27,387
there are many healthy, smart,

37
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:29,907
and handsome men.

38
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,426
Jing, look up.

39
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,827
Tushan Jing, look at me.

40
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:49,306
How can you despise yourself

41
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,547
because of Fangfeng Yiying's
attitude toward you?

42
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:54,827
Even if others judge you
by your appearance

43
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,306
and wealth,

44
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:59,267
don't you know who you are?

45
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:00,706
I...

46
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:04,666
Last night,

47
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,146
a man forced me to kiss him.

48
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:11,987
But now,

49
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:15,987
I just want to kiss you.

50
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:41,106
No, Xiaoyao.

51
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:50,986
Why not kiss my lips?

52
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:53,586
It's not time yet.

53
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,106
I thought when men
were alone with women,

54
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:00,787
they couldn't wait to...

55
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,986
I'm not like that.

56
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,027
So...

57
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,146
When can we do it?

58
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:23,306
I...

59
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,106
I don't know.

60
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:34,627
(Because it's up to you,)

61
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:36,266
(not me.)

62
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:38,627
(I want to kiss you.)

63
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:42,507
(But I also want your love)

64
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:46,266
(rather than your pity.)

65
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:51,787
Xiaoyao.

66
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,106
Xiaoyao.

67
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:12,627
Xiaoyao.

68
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:14,386
I'm here.

69
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,187
Why are you in such a mess?

70
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:21,747
Did you see Tushan Jing?

71
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:24,706
I did.

72
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:26,426
When did you become so close

73
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,546
that you could be alone
with him all night?

74
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:30,067
You didn't know it's improper,

75
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,426
but how about Tushan Jing?

76
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:33,227
Look at me.

77
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,706
You think I had a good time all night?

78
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,386
If it weren't for your good sister,

79
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,027
I'd have gone back to home to sleep.

80
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,706
What has Nian done?

81
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,227
Your good sister made me soak

82
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,826
in the sea all night.

83
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,907
Don't keep calling her my good sister.

84
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:52,306
In terms of closeness,
she is your sister.

85
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:56,027
Since she's my sister,

86
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,467
it's reasonable for me
to discipline her, right?

87
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,106
Even so, you should get changed first.

88
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:05,787
It's the proof. I need this momentum.

89
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:12,986
How could she not come back last night?

90
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,106
Has she died?

91
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:23,067
Great Princess, you can't go in.

92
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:24,347
Great Princess.

93
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:29,706
Princess.

94
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:32,146
Leave us alone.

95
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,746
I'll see what she's really up to.

96
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:35,746
Yes.

97
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,946
You made me like this.

98
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:54,867
Happy now?

99
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,626
Sort of.

100
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,626
You nuts.

101
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:13,746
I swear I will beat you

102
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,027
to death today.

103
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,347
Did you poison me again?

104
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,386
I just temporarily
disabled your spirit power.

105
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:24,867
Weren't you going to beat me?

106
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:27,787
Come on. Do it.

107
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:28,946
Come on.

108
00:09:28,946 --> 00:09:29,586
You stop.

109
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:35,467
Hit me?

110
00:09:37,706 --> 00:09:38,347
Put it down!

111
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,227
How dare you!

112
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:48,706
Come on!

113
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:49,307
Come on.

114
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:50,907
I'll beat you to death!

115
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:53,867
I'll beat you to death!

116
00:09:58,586 --> 00:09:59,146
I'll kill you.

117
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:09,440
(Hanzhang Hall)

118
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:11,987
Princess.

119
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:15,826
Princess.

120
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:17,186
Princess.

121
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:19,227
Princess, are you alright?

122
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:21,186
Haoling Yi.

123
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:24,307
Other than using your identity
and spirit power to bully others,

124
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:25,107
what else can you do?

125
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,667
Do you think you're better than me?

126
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:29,826
If your mother weren't Princess General,

127
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,186
Xuan would care about you?

128
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:34,427
Without Xiyan Kingdom behind you,

129
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:36,586
do you think so many people
would attend your celebration?

130
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:38,506
Actually, you're even worse than me.

131
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,826
You are just resenting
your mother's lowly status.

132
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,066
I didn't.

133
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:48,946
My mother is the best mother
in the world.

134
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,547
I won't let you speak ill of her.

135
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,467
You liar.

136
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,586
I know what you just meant.

137
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:01,307
Can you deny it?

138
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:05,907
Do you dare to swear

139
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,347
that you've never thought that way?

140
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:21,586
You envy me having a mother
who was noble Princess General.

141
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,506
But I wish my mother
would be an ordinary person.

142
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:28,386
My mother was Princess General,

143
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:31,027
so she had to go to war

144
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:32,706
for the sake of the country.

145
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:35,667
She promised me she would come back,

146
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:38,826
but all I got was news of her death.

147
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,907
I didn't believe she left me
and never came back,

148
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,307
so I waited for her on Mount Jade

149
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:48,746
for 70 years.

150
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:50,706
To be honest,

151
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:53,706
if I could choose a mother,

152
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:55,667
I'd choose yours.

153
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:00,227
At least she can
watch her daughter grow up

154
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:01,307
and love her,

155
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:05,186
instead of letting her be bullied
and displaced.

156
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:13,266
How about exchanging mothers?

157
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:16,227
No! Absolutely not! My mother is mine!

158
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:23,626
There are two options for you now.

159
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,066
Option one.

160
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,626
We become enemies.

161
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,946
You keep picking on me,

162
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:30,746
even teaming up with outsiders
to deal with me.

163
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:31,867
As a result,

164
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,586
you'll make our father sad,

165
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:35,107
and ultimately lose Cang Xuan.

166
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:36,946
I don't believe it.

167
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:39,467
In our father's eyes,

168
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:42,307
he will feel sad
whether you or I are hurt.

169
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:45,746
In that case,
your mother will feel the same way.

170
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:48,576
Regarding Cang Xuan,

171
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:52,027
he and I rely on each other.

172
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:54,386
If you hurt me,

173
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,227
do you think he will forgive you?

174
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,746
Nonsense. I don't believe
Xuan would side with you.

175
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:00,746
I believe you already know deep down

176
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,506
who's more important in his heart.

177
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,227
Otherwise, why are you jealous of me?

178
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:13,427
Option two.

179
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:15,746
We live in peace.

180
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:17,586
We don't irritate each other.

181
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,746
In this case, our father will be happy.

182
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,547
Cang Xuan will protect and love you.

183
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:25,266
Your mother can continue
to live a peaceful life.

184
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:31,027
Isn't there a third option?

185
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,946
Actually, there is.

186
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:39,386
We get along well.

187
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:43,107
So, you will be loved
by our father, Cang Xuan,

188
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,506
and me.

189
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:47,867
You wish.

190
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:49,347
I know it's a wish.

191
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,467
So, I didn't even mention it.

192
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,467
Do you want to continue fighting?

193
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:14,107
You just kicked me and punched me.

194
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:16,266
I just slapped you, so we're square.

195
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,027
From now on, we live in peace.

196
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,107
Okay, we're square.

197
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,427
If Cang Xuan finds out about Xiang Liu,

198
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:32,467
he will never forgive you.

199
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:33,867
I won't tell him about this.

200
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:36,826
You should also keep your mouth shut.

201
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:55,386
(Hanzhang Hall)

202
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:56,146
Princess.

203
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,467
Once out of this room,

204
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:25,146
I will purposefully avoid you.

205
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,107
And I can't talk to you.

206
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:28,907
I really don't want to go out.

207
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:35,227
Didn't you have an appointment
with Xinyue?

208
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:37,227
We can find a chance

209
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:39,266
to hang out again.

210
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:13,746
What is this?

211
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:17,946
Just a handkerchief.

212
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,586
It must be prepared by a maid.

213
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,826
A maid gave you a handkerchief
for lovers?

214
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:27,586
Who is it?

215
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,107
Just a maid at home.

216
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:39,746
It's just an act.
Don't take it seriously.

217
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,467
Tushan Hou, how could you do this to me?

218
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:47,547
It's just an act.

219
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:55,547
Come on.

220
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:57,266
Don't touch me.

221
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:15,986
Miss,

222
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,787
junior master went out with his friends.

223
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,427
If you want,

224
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:24,427
I can take a message for you.

225
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,027
(I will leave early tomorrow morning.)

226
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,587
(I don't know when we'll meet again.)

227
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,146
No, thank you.

228
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,851
(Yingzhou)

229
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:51,947
How come you invited him too?

230
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,027
Jing asked me not

231
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:56,947
to neglect his elder brother.

232
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,128
Jing hasn't given up reconciling

233
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,506
with his brother.

234
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:06,626
You'll know it.

235
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,346
Miss, take a look.
You can buy anything you like.

236
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:21,266
How much is this makeup box?

237
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:22,907
I'll take this makeup box.

238
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:25,787
I came first.

239
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:27,506
And I asked the price first.

240
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,427
If I didn't say I didn't want it,

241
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:30,986
it shouldn't be sold to others.

242
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:34,626
I'll pay twice what she just offered.

243
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:37,266
Well...

244
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,707
This makeup box is good,
but the coral isn't.

245
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,547
If you like this kind of thing,

246
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,506
I will have the craftsmen make a set

247
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,106
for you with the Guixu Coral.

248
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,547
Wrap it up for me.

249
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:56,346
I'm not one of those women
who have never seen nice things.

250
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:58,067
I don't care for such trinkets.

251
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,787
I just thought it was novel
and wanted to reward my maids.

252
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:03,547
If you like it, just take it.

253
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:04,907
Good.

254
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:06,907
Xiaoyao.

255
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:08,827
Xiaoyao.

256
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:11,986
Why are you shopping?

257
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:18,067
I was really bored,

258
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:19,266
so I'm hanging around.

259
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,787
I should have invited you
to come with us.

260
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:25,067
You have quite a lot of female friends.

261
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:27,266
You can bump into one on the street.

262
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,587
You guys wanted
to meet my sister last night, right?

263
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:36,067
She is my sister.

264
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:42,427
I am Chishui Fenglong.
Greetings, Your Highness.

265
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:45,187
Chenrong Xinyue.
Greetings, Your Highness.

266
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:47,587
Fangfeng Yiying.
Greetings, Your Highness.

267
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,707
I am Tushan Hou.

268
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:51,587
I am Tushan Jing.

269
00:19:57,466 --> 00:19:58,947
All of you are Cang Xuan's friends.

270
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,027
No need of that.

271
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:04,947
I'm really sorry.

272
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:06,746
I'm leaving tomorrow,

273
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:08,746
so I saw a unique gift
and was eager to get it.

274
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,427
Please forgive me for being rude.

275
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:12,266
Please accept this makeup box,

276
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:14,386
as a memento of our meeting.

277
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:18,547
Thank you.

278
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,266
We have planned it with Cang Xuan,

279
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,667
going out to see the sea on a ship.

280
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:27,266
Why not you join us?

281
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:37,027
Okay.

282
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,466
Your Highness, please sit here.

283
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:16,106
Your Highness, there are no outsiders.

284
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,226
You may take off your veil.

285
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:21,587
All of you are Xuan's friends.
Please be casual.

286
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,226
Just call me Xiaoyao.

287
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:46,587
We just met,
but we have to part tomorrow.

288
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,067
Let's consider it a farewell party
for everyone.

289
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:50,947
Princess.

290
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,106
Xiaoyao.

291
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:53,266
This liquor is strong.

292
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:55,027
You should drink fruit wine instead.

293
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:56,746
It's okay.

294
00:21:57,027 --> 00:21:59,587
I used to drink strong alcohol,
and I'm a bit of a drinker.

295
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,146
No need to take care of me.

296
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,466
Great, I rarely meet girls
who can drink strong alcohol.

297
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:08,346
My brother has never been
considerate to me.

298
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:10,907
Today, he seems like a different person.

299
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,466
Shut up.

300
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:15,067
Jing, you're the closest to my brother.

301
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:16,027
Make a judgement.

302
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:18,386
Have you ever seen him
as thoughtful as he is today?

303
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:23,146
Never seen it.

304
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:24,907
Mrs. Tushan.

305
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:26,707
Help me shut his mouth up.

306
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:30,626
Don't call me that.

307
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,187
A cup of liquor is not enough.

308
00:22:47,187 --> 00:22:49,027
Jing, please.

309
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:54,307
Jing, you were not like this before.

310
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:56,027
Why are you so restrained today?

311
00:22:56,427 --> 00:22:58,266
Jing, if you act like this,

312
00:22:58,346 --> 00:22:59,947
Yiying may feel embarrassed.

313
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:06,986
This won't do.

314
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:12,827
Sorry, I punish myself
with three cups of liquor.

315
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,226
Good. Let's drink.

316
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,506
Let's catch fish.

317
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:36,947
Fenglong.

318
00:24:43,587 --> 00:24:44,506
What happened?

319
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:46,547
What's wrong?

320
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:48,707
Fenglong got drunk
and jumped in to catch fish.

321
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:52,707
I'll join Fenglong.

322
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:54,866
Hou.

323
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:03,027
My brother is from the Chishui Family.

324
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:04,787
He grew up in the water.

325
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:07,307
Hou is also good at swimming.
You don't need to worry.

326
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,827
I also want to jump down.
Do you all want to join?

327
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:14,626
What's going on today?
Is everyone drunk?

328
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:17,187
It doesn't often happen.

329
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:19,506
Xinyue, I'll wait for you in the sea.

330
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:26,787
Jing, do you want to play in the water?

331
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:29,667
I'll go sober myself up.
You guys go have fun.

332
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:34,907
How about you?

333
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:37,466
I can't swim.

334
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,626
I know. But I can teach you.

335
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:41,947
Well,

336
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:44,667
do you dare to give your life to me?

337
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:48,827
I really can't swim.

338
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:50,787
Even if there's no danger,

339
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:52,346
I'm afraid I would disturb your fun.

340
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:20,866
Xinyue dragged Cang Xuan into the sea.

341
00:26:24,986 --> 00:26:27,506
You didn't dare to approach me
when everyone was here.

342
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:31,106
Now you dare to when everyone has left?

343
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:34,346
You're Princess of Haoling
in front of them.

344
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:35,787
Now you're not.

345
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:48,907
What did you feel to be fed liquor?

346
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:50,106
I want to try it too.

347
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,307
I didn't drink the liquor she fed me.

348
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,787
Anyway, will you feed me or not?

349
00:26:58,307 --> 00:26:58,746
Yes.

350
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:17,427
Are you alright?

351
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:22,667
Perhaps I just drank too quickly.

352
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:24,106
I'm feeling a bit seasick.

353
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,307
I made this herbal sachet. Try it.

354
00:27:46,386 --> 00:27:48,226
You didn't forget what I taught you.

355
00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:52,827
I will never forget.

356
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:59,547
When we drank in the cabin,

357
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:01,307
did you feel upset?

358
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:04,067
Yes.

359
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:07,187
Seeing Fenglong taking care of you,

360
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:09,106
I feel very upset.

361
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,386
I feel good to see you like that.

362
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:19,907
If you feel good,

363
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,787
I'll be happy too.

364
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,827
I'm willing to care about you.

365
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:33,947
But I'm not willing to do it
because of Fangfeng Yiying.

366
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:36,626
No matter how good something is,

367
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:38,146
if it's not worth it,

368
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:39,907
I will give it up.

369
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,226
Yiying.

370
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:09,266
Yiying.

371
00:29:12,746 --> 00:29:13,626
I was wrong.

372
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:16,707
Please forgive me.

373
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:31,746
Yiying, do you

374
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:34,707
remember the Dragon Boat Festival
that year?

375
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,506
We first met

376
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:41,866
on the water.

377
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:43,346
How could I forget?

378
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:47,226
That was my first time in Haoling.

379
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:49,027
I grew up in the North.

380
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:50,667
I've never seen so much water before.

381
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:52,256
I was so excited.

382
00:29:53,346 --> 00:29:55,307
I fell into the river
when I focused on festivities.

383
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:59,106
At that time,
you didn't know how to swim at all.

384
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,547
When you fell into the water,

385
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:03,386
you forgot to use
your spirit power in panic.

386
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:10,346
Then you got more panicked.

387
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:14,307
You were entangled
by a plant with a little spirit power.

388
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:22,626
You saved me.

389
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:30,266
Since then,

390
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:32,986
you've been the only one I love.

391
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:40,226
I thought you had forgotten.

392
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:45,907
The one who gave me the handkerchief

393
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:49,106
was an informant by Tushan Jing's side.

394
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:50,907
She's just a tool

395
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:52,307
for me.

396
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:55,626
You were really just using her?

397
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:56,986
Of course.

398
00:30:58,146 --> 00:30:59,027
After all these years,

399
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:00,787
don't you know

400
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:01,827
I only have eyes

401
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,226
for you.

402
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:07,827
But I hate it
when you're close with other women.

403
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:08,787
I know.

404
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:11,266
On the ship,

405
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:14,106
when I saw you being close and gentle

406
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:15,547
to Tushan Jing,

407
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:17,386
I also felt sad.

408
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:19,027
Who wants to be close to him?

409
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:21,547
I was just trying to annoy you.

410
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:27,346
Yiying.

411
00:31:28,707 --> 00:31:30,027
Just endure it for a while longer.

412
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:31,947
Only in this way

413
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:34,146
can we be together forever.

414
00:31:35,146 --> 00:31:36,466
How long do I have to endure?

415
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:38,386
Soon.

416
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:54,067
I don't like Fangfeng Yiying.

417
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:56,067
And she's not into me either.

418
00:32:00,346 --> 00:32:01,547
But just now,

419
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:03,187
I saw it.

420
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:06,027
She absolutely has no feelings for me.

421
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:09,466
She did so

422
00:32:09,947 --> 00:32:10,866
because of my identity

423
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:14,027
and the benefits
of marrying into the Tushan Family.

424
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:15,746
Since she doesn't want you,

425
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:17,907
you can come back to me as Ye Shiqi.

426
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:27,947
Did I say something stupid?

427
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,027
You didn't.

428
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:34,707
I'm very happy to hear that.

429
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:36,547
But,

430
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:38,787
we're not in Qingshui Town.

431
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:41,346
And you're no longer Wen Xiaoliu.

432
00:32:45,707 --> 00:32:46,187
Yes.

433
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:48,707
I am now Princess of Haoling.

434
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:51,626
I can't decide many things alone.

435
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:55,386
I want to formally ask your father
to give you to me.

436
00:32:58,106 --> 00:32:58,466
Xiaoyao.

437
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,466
Give me a little more time,

438
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:04,787
so I can stand before you with dignity.

439
00:33:08,827 --> 00:33:12,146
I also want
to introduce you to my father.

440
00:33:17,427 --> 00:33:18,866
Please keep your heart to me.

441
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:27,226
I realize you're a cunning man.

442
00:33:28,587 --> 00:33:29,707
You sent me green plum wine.

443
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:31,746
Isn't it just a way

444
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:33,146
to remind me of our promise.

445
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:36,907
I know you.

446
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:40,827
You said you wouldn't dare
to dream of having me,

447
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:43,427
while you refuse to let me go.

448
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,067
I'm sorry.

449
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:51,427
I...

450
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:53,707
I have no choice.

451
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:55,947
I know you deserve better,

452
00:33:57,187 --> 00:33:58,466
but I can't give up.

453
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,746
I understand.

454
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:08,706
You don't.

455
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:11,906
I don't understand,

456
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:14,506
but I have to say something
to comfort you, right?

457
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,027
Sending you the green plum wine

458
00:34:21,547 --> 00:34:22,827
is not just my selfishness.

459
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:26,107
I hope when you receive the wine,

460
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,307
you'll know that I'm missing you.

461
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:46,706
Xiaoyao.

462
00:35:08,587 --> 00:35:09,347
Are you happy?

463
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,547
Yeah, you're a good swimming teacher.

464
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:16,867
Did you learn it?

465
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:18,666
I didn't.

466
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:20,787
Do you want me to teach you?

467
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:22,946
No, thanks.

468
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,107
Why not?

469
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:24,666
Doggy paddle.

470
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:34,147
Yiying, where have you been?

471
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:37,186
I went underwater to see the corals.
What about you?

472
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:44,226
I taught Cang Xuan how to swim.

473
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:53,666
Jing,

474
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:55,666
what have you been doing?

475
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:57,307
I...

476
00:35:59,587 --> 00:36:01,506
I've been admiring the scenery
on the deck.

477
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:08,706
The scenery must be quite special.

478
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:17,946
What is this?

479
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:20,067
I just killed a fish demon underwater.

480
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:21,906
This is its fish core.

481
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,506
Hou, could you give it to me?

482
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:29,027
Xinyue, I need this fish core.

483
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,347
I'll get you another one next time.

484
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,067
Alright, I got to go.

485
00:36:33,506 --> 00:36:37,307
I'm going to change and wash up.

486
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:41,547
Why are you laughing?

487
00:36:44,387 --> 00:36:45,696
What kind of gem is that?

488
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:48,027
With the head of the Tushan Family here,

489
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:49,506
I dare not discuss gems.

490
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:54,466
That's a fish core in a fish demon.

491
00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:56,466
It can be used
to make jewelry, accessories,

492
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:58,746
tools and as a medicinal ingredient.

493
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:01,627
High-quality fish core
can help with breathing.

494
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:03,906
It can make a person
stay longer underwater.

495
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:05,587
Based on the different colors,

496
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:07,307
it can be red,

497
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,107
purple, and yellow.

498
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:11,867
But most fish cores have mixed colors.

499
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:13,906
Hou got a fish core

500
00:37:13,906 --> 00:37:15,226
without a hint of impurity.

501
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:16,347
That's a rare one.

502
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:18,706
It can be considered the best fish core.

503
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:24,307
It's hard to get.

504
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:26,986
If you really want it,

505
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:28,387
I can ask my grandfather for it.

506
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,147
No, I was just asking out of curiosity.

507
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:40,067
We are leaving early tomorrow.

508
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,347
I don't know

509
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:44,147
when we will meet again
after this separation.

510
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:46,746
Where there's a will,

511
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:49,107
there's a way.

512
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:55,906
Yes.

513
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:59,587
Where there's a will, there's a way.

514
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,906
Fenglong and the others
are leaving early tomorrow.

515
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:21,147
I won't see them off.

516
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,347
Please say goodbye to them for me.

517
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:27,746
Are you tired?

518
00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:33,347
Did you have fun with Tushan Jing?

519
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:37,706
I only chatted with him for a while.

520
00:38:42,627 --> 00:38:43,506
Well,

521
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,746
Miss Chenrong

522
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:48,547
was quite interested in you.

523
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:50,107
She looked serious.

524
00:38:51,906 --> 00:38:54,906
If I were an ordinary member
of the Dragon Squad,

525
00:38:55,426 --> 00:38:57,147
Chenrong Xinyue

526
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:00,107
would be playing with me.

527
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:02,426
She looks serious

528
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,746
because I am Xiyan Cang Xuan.

529
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,587
How do you know
she's not sincere to you?

530
00:39:09,787 --> 00:39:12,466
I can tell after experiencing so much.

531
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:14,906
But I'm not in a position to judge her.

532
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:18,266
I don't refuse her

533
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:20,226
just because

534
00:39:20,787 --> 00:39:22,272
she is Chenrong Xinyue.

535
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:24,547
Do you feel bad?

536
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:27,827
If I can't offend enemies

537
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,666
nor get close to someone I like,

538
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:34,307
how will it not be distressing?

539
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:39,307
But this is the price I need to pay

540
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:42,027
to return to Xiyan Mountain.

541
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:46,426
It must be a bloody path
returning to Xiyan Mountain.

542
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:48,827
Are you ready?

543
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,226
I must stand on Zhaoyun Peak

544
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:54,426
on my auntie's anniversary death
next year.

545
00:39:58,466 --> 00:39:59,587
It's been so many years.

546
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:02,666
I haven't been back
to pay respects to my mother.

547
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:08,547
I haven't been back
for a long time either.

548
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:11,426
I don't know what the graves

549
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:14,387
of my parents, auntie,

550
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:18,226
grandmother, and uncles

551
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:20,827
look like now.

552
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:22,387
Cang Xuan.

553
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,307
Let's

554
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:29,666
go home together.

555
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:37,506
Alright,

556
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:40,506
let's go home together.

557
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:54,464
(Xiyan, Shangyuan Palace)

558
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,027
I've been away for a century.

559
00:40:58,307 --> 00:40:59,506
My mother's death day is coming.

560
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:01,226
The mountains are high,

561
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:02,787
and the wind is fierce,

562
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:04,067
but people live in peace.

563
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:05,547
I have been through a hard journey.

564
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:07,107
I'm willing to cross mountains

565
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:08,867
to return to Xiyan

566
00:41:09,226 --> 00:41:10,666
to pay homage to my mother

567
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:12,347
as her daughter.

568
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:14,186
Your Majesty.

569
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:15,827
You're getting old.

570
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,506
I should fulfill filial duty

571
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:19,307
and take care of you for my mother.

572
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:21,186
Words can't express how I feel.

573
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,506
I beg Your Majesty to grant my wish.

574
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:26,946
Haoling Jiuyao.

575
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:42,706
So,

576
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,266
what do you think?

577
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:48,666
Your majesty,

578
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:53,587
Great Princess of Haoling
is the daughter of Princess General.

579
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:57,186
It's reasonable for her
to attend this anniversary death.

580
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:02,147
Princess General died
in battle for the people of Xiyan.

581
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:04,867
She is the national heroine.

582
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:09,746
In my opinion,
we shall treat Great Princess of Haoling

583
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:12,627
with national courtesy.

584
00:42:12,928 --> 00:42:15,872
(Xiyan Yuyang)

585
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:20,027
Your Majesty,

586
00:42:20,986 --> 00:42:23,067
Great Princess of Haoling comes
to pay homage to her mother.

587
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:24,226
It's a family matter.

588
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:26,027
If we treat her
with national courtesy...

589
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:32,266
If so,

590
00:42:35,027 --> 00:42:36,107
how would it be?

591
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,927
(Xiyan Deyan)

592
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:43,547
Father,

593
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:46,946
Xiling Heng sacrificed herself
for the Kingdom.

594
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:50,627
Great Princess of Haoling will return
to pay homage to her mother.

595
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:53,946
It's not inappropriate
to treat her with national courtesy.

596
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:56,547
In my view,

597
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:00,946
we should make it as grand as possible

598
00:43:01,827 --> 00:43:02,906
without breaking the rules.

599
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,827
Do it this way.

600
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:08,347
Yes.

601
00:43:09,344 --> 00:43:12,288
(Xiyan City)

602
00:43:13,147 --> 00:43:15,827
Great Princess of Haoling
really made a big fuss.

603
00:43:16,266 --> 00:43:17,248
She made my father and uncle

604
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,186
(Xiyan Shiran) (Xiyan Yueliang)
receive her in person.

605
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,787
For the sake of grandfather,

606
00:43:23,307 --> 00:43:24,226
we give her this honor.

607
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:25,787
After grandfather abdicates,

608
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,147
she cannot come back at will.

609
00:43:28,426 --> 00:43:28,986
Shut up.

610
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:33,147
How dare you say something like that.

611
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:35,266
Go down and wait.

612
00:43:37,627 --> 00:43:38,307
Pardon me.

613
00:43:40,147 --> 00:43:42,426
They're getting more reckless.

614
00:43:43,547 --> 00:43:44,946
They need to be disciplined.

615
00:43:45,266 --> 00:43:47,107
They will look at the big picture.

616
00:43:47,387 --> 00:43:49,466
They just made jokes.

617
00:43:50,147 --> 00:43:51,307
Don't make a big deal out of it.

618
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,706
Xiaoyao comes back
to pay homage to her mother.

619
00:43:54,147 --> 00:43:55,307
It's not a big deal.

620
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,992
No need to be too wary.

621
00:43:57,627 --> 00:43:59,706
Xiaoyao can't cause any waves,

622
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:01,946
but Cang Xuan also returns with her.

623
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:03,946
Isn't that better?

624
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:07,426
Come on.

625
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:09,867
Let's go down

626
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:12,506
and welcome Great Princess of Haoling.

627
00:44:21,347 --> 00:44:23,946
Great Princess, you must be tired
from your journey.

628
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:28,147
Xiaoyao.

629
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:30,547
Xiaoyao.

630
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:31,906
Long time no see.

631
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,906
Fifth King, Seventh King.

632
00:44:37,387 --> 00:44:38,787
Kid, you're back.

633
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:40,827
It's a long journey.

634
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:44,666
Originally, we should receive the envoy
at Shangyuan Palace.

635
00:44:45,107 --> 00:44:47,347
But my father is old
and has mobility issues.

636
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:49,986
He's tired of seeing people these years.

637
00:44:50,466 --> 00:44:50,946
So,

638
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:53,067
he ordered your seventh uncle

639
00:44:53,787 --> 00:44:55,147
to host a banquet to entertain them.

640
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:57,827
Father won't see them.

641
00:44:58,426 --> 00:45:00,506
He will only see you at Zhaoyun Hall.

642
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:01,906
Then I'll trouble Fifth King

643
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:03,706
to take me to see my grandfather.

644
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:07,387
Princess, please.

645
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:14,387
Cang Xuan doesn't come with us?

646
00:45:16,186 --> 00:45:17,587
Father didn't summon him.

647
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:19,867
We've got a place for him.

648
00:45:20,186 --> 00:45:21,107
Don't worry, princess.

649
00:45:21,466 --> 00:45:23,466
No worries. We will accompany him.
