=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,895
=Episode 35=

3
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:39,564
Are you never going to see anyone?

4
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:40,765
- You're someone.
- You're someone.

5
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,205
Xinyue, they have things to discuss.

6
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:56,845
Let's hang out somewhere else.

7
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:58,205
- Alright.
- Let's go.

8
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:11,964
Chief Lirong, this way.

9
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,328
(Lirong Chang)

10
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:26,884
I am Chief

11
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:27,804
Lirong Chang.

12
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:29,084
May Your Highness be well.

13
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,604
I've heard so much about you.

14
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,804
I finally have a chance to meet you

15
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:36,684
thanks to Jing.

16
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:41,444
Your Highness, our Lirong Family

17
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,845
has always been
suppressed by other clans.

18
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:44,684
We are running

19
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:46,164
the lowly business to make ends meet.

20
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:47,804
It's a disgrace to our ancestors.

21
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:50,804
Your Highness, please guide us

22
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:52,244
back to our glory.

23
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:54,724
I truly admire you for planning

24
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:55,724
for your clan.

25
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:57,724
I will do my best

26
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,244
to make your wish come true.

27
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:04,005
Thank you.

28
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,524
We are willing to offer you

29
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:08,084
our fiercest warriors

30
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:10,045
and 500,000 jade and silk every year

31
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:11,604
to assist Your Highness.

32
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:15,524
Please get up.

33
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:20,324
I will never

34
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:21,164
forget

35
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:22,365
your help.

36
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:25,244
We're brothers from now on.

37
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:35,205
I haven't seen my father

38
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:36,405
since I came back.

39
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:38,244
He's been waiting.

40
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,125
I've told Xuan that

41
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:41,244
I'm going back

42
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:42,565
to see my father in Haoling.

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,565
I can't go with you.

44
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,684
A letter came from Qingqiu.

45
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,045
Grandmother is not so well.

46
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:57,444
I haven't figured out

47
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:59,005
what to do about your grandmother.

48
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:01,444
But there are many medical books

49
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:02,964
and remedies in the palace

50
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:03,804
of Haoling.

51
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:05,405
I'll check

52
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,084
if anything can be helpful.

53
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:14,244
Xiaoyao.

54
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:15,604
Thank you.

55
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:18,805
I may not be able to help.

56
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:19,965
It's too early for that.

57
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:22,404
It's the intention that matters.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,284
(Tushan Mansion)

59
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:32,205
What did you say?

60
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,245
Tushan Jing likes

61
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,045
the Great Princess of Haoling.

62
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:38,404
No way.

63
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:41,164
Why would the Great Princess like him?

64
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:43,444
He hooked up with the Great Princess.

65
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,245
No wonder he won't marry you.

66
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:46,525
What do you mean?

67
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:49,045
Nothing.

68
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:51,205
I'm just saying.

69
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:18,805
Father.

70
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:20,844
I'm back.

71
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:34,965
It's so good to see you.

72
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:38,045
You've lost some weight.

73
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:55,124
You are back.

74
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:57,444
Not missing any limbs, huh?

75
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,164
Your 10,000-year Water Chalcedony

76
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,805
would have healed me

77
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:03,844
anyway.

78
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,884
That's just the leftover food

79
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:08,965
of my spirit beasts.

80
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:11,245
I see.

81
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:13,844
Anyway, you're breeding them.

82
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,685
So, thank you.

83
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:21,805
You!

84
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:22,724
A princess

85
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:24,365
almost got killed by the bullies.

86
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:25,205
So useless.

87
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,564
If it's up to me, you should

88
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:28,685
stay on Wushen Mountain.

89
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:30,485
Father will make sure

90
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,604
that nobody bullies you.

91
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,164
Nian is right.

92
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:36,245
Stay at Wushen Mountain for a while.

93
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:39,645
Alright.

94
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:41,085
I'll do as you say.

95
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:56,805
Your Highness.

96
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,404
Found any clues?

97
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,604
I found a Chi Chen Village in Baili

98
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:03,164
where Chi Chen supposedly

99
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:04,404
lived with his wife.

100
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:05,485
Chi Chen had a wife?

101
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,284
Yes.

102
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:08,805
The locals are highly alert.

103
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,404
They stopped talking

104
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:11,324
almost instantly.

105
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,645
I sneaked inside and saw

106
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:15,805
the portrait of Chi Chen.

107
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:17,965
He had lived there for sure.

108
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:20,045
But there was no portrait of his wife.

109
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,085
I only know that
she went by Xiling Witch.

110
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:29,724
Xiling Witch?

111
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:32,724
Alright.

112
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:34,765
You may leave.

113
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:36,564
I take my leave.

114
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:43,124
(Xiling Witch?)

115
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:46,124
(Did Auntie and Chi Chen truly...)

116
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:56,525
Sang, go to Xiyan Town in secret.

117
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:58,525
Go to Xiyan Town in secret?

118
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,085
I have a letter for General Yinglong.

119
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:02,324
No one shall read it,

120
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:03,564
not even you.

121
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:04,444
Rest assured.

122
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:06,765
I'll kill whoever reads it,

123
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:08,004
including me.

124
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:20,404
You.

125
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:23,645
- Your Lordship.
- Give it to Supervisor Liu.

126
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:24,324
Okay.

127
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,784
(Daming Hall)

128
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:49,125
Cang Xuan.

129
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:26,844
What's up?

130
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:31,125
Xinyue.

131
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:33,204
Are you alright?

132
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:37,644
Yes.

133
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:39,284
I'm just so happy

134
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:40,045
for you.

135
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:43,365
You have developed strength.

136
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,245
Once the Daming Hall is built,

137
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,325
you'll have fame.

138
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:47,805
Cang Xuan.

139
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:49,325
You're finally making it

140
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:50,724
after so many years.

141
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,724
All thanks to you and Fenglong.

142
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:56,604
I proceed and retreat

143
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:59,045
alongside you.

144
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,325
I'll keep you company

145
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:02,925
no matter what you do

146
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,565
until you get everything you want.

147
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,045
Miss.

148
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:16,125
It's too tiring to copy

149
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,445
all these in person.

150
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:19,885
Why don't you get some help?

151
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,805
These are the records of how

152
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,644
the former kings
ruled the Central Plains.

153
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:25,284
How can I let others copy them?

154
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:30,365
Cang Xuan has great ambition.

155
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:32,685
Of course, I have to help.

156
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:35,604
Once I offer him this as a gift,

157
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:38,325
it will be much easier
for him to gain control

158
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:39,365
and rule over

159
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:40,604
the Central Plains.

160
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,164
Your gift for His Highness
not only showed

161
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:44,485
your love and loyalty,

162
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,964
but also your consideration.

163
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:47,404
I bet His Highness

164
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:48,764
will be so happy to get it.

165
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:51,164
A gift has to be pleasing
to the recipient.

166
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:53,964
Cang Xuan

167
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:56,045
deserves such an effort.

168
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:58,685
And

169
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,365
there are things

170
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:03,925
no one can offer him except me.

171
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:11,964
What is it, Miss Fangfeng?

172
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:13,245
Jing.

173
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:15,325
Are you really

174
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,404
canceling the engagement?

175
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,284
Miss Fangfeng.

176
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:24,524
I have

177
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:25,844
made myself clear.

178
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:27,604
Please contain yourself.

179
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,885
I've served the Tushan Family for years,

180
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,805
but you never appreciated it.

181
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:36,885
Since you're so determined,

182
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,644
I won't displease you.

183
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:41,644
I'll quit

184
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:43,084
for you two.

185
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:54,524
Thank you.

186
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:55,565
Miss Fangfeng.

187
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,445
I'll pay you back.

188
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:00,885
Grandmother.

189
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,125
Miss Fangfeng agreed
to cancel the engagement.

190
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,604
She agreed?

191
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:10,925
No way.

192
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:13,524
She knew that
I'm in love with someone else.

193
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:14,445
So she decided

194
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:16,524
to find her true love.

195
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:19,045
Grand Madam, bad news.

196
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:22,365
Miss Fangfeng committed suicide.

197
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:28,764
Thankfully, I found her in time.

198
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:30,125
Otherwise...

199
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:33,245
How's Yiying?

200
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:35,685
The physicians came and said

201
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:36,925
that she would be fine.

202
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,445
But the poison damaged her

203
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:41,524
and she needs to rest and recover.

204
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,445
You've either

205
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:49,724
been gone or in a coma

206
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,764
for the past decades.

207
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:55,245
Yiying stayed by my side on your behalf.

208
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,164
She fed me medicine and did house chores

209
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:03,084
industriously without complaining.

210
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,964
What has she done to you?

211
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:09,485
Why do you want her dead?

212
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:10,925
Grandmother, I...

213
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:11,925
Grandmother.

214
00:13:13,245 --> 00:13:15,524
Miss!

215
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:22,445
Grandmother.

216
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:24,524
Don't blame it on Jing.

217
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,325
It's all my fault.

218
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:27,844
I don't deserve him.

219
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:29,685
I'm the one to blame.

220
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:30,885
Sweetheart.

221
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,964
The Tushan Family
didn't treat you right.

222
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:38,204
I failed to educate my grandson.

223
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:39,245
Grandmother.

224
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:41,524
The physicians say
you can't get emotional.

225
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,125
Please don't cry.

226
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:44,644
It's all my fault.

227
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,644
Since you realized your problem,

228
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:48,485
stay and take care of Yiying.

229
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:49,764
Help her recover.

230
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:54,565
What's wrong?

231
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:56,964
Do you want me

232
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,724
to redeem your sin for you

233
00:13:58,724 --> 00:13:59,964
and take care of Yiying?

234
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:01,204
Grandmother, go back.

235
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:03,524
I will stay here.

236
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:10,284
Rest well.

237
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:12,204
Get Jing to serve you.

238
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,045
Don't go easy on him.

239
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:23,805
Miss.

240
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:25,125
Xuanzhou.

241
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:27,565
Stay here and take care of her.

242
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:30,325
Miss Fangfeng.

243
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:31,764
I'll be outside.

244
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,005
Call me if you need me.

245
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:02,245
Grandmother, why didn't you go to bed?

246
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:04,485
You barely recovered.

247
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:06,204
And Yiying is sick.

248
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,404
How can I fall asleep?

249
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:10,925
I might as well work on something.

250
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:12,805
So I made some soup.

251
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,125
Have some.

252
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,685
Leave the rest for Yiying.

253
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:04,325
Father.

254
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:06,644
Why are you staying up so late?

255
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,404
I want to ask you the same question.

256
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:12,045
You've been locking yourself

257
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:13,885
in your room to read medicinal books

258
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:14,524
these days.

259
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:17,164
Nian came to make a complaint.

260
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,404
Jing's grandmother is ill.

261
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:20,404
I'm looking for

262
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:21,764
a way to treat her.

263
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:23,724
But you can't focus

264
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:25,724
solely on someone else's senior.

265
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,164
My apologies.

266
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:36,992
(Daming Hall, Zijin Palace)

267
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:38,604
Look.

268
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,005
Prince Cang Xuan is quite impressive.

269
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,524
It's dull and complicated
to build the hall.

270
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:46,524
Not everyone

271
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:48,485
can remain so devoted

272
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:50,084
for 40 years.

273
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:57,245
Strange.

274
00:16:58,005 --> 00:16:59,565
It's such an important event.

275
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,125
Where is Jing?

276
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,725
The propitious time has arrived.

277
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:14,925
Let the ceremony begin.

278
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,045
Blessed by

279
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:24,164
the almighty heaven,

280
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:26,484
the Daming Hall is completed.

281
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:27,805
I, Xiyan Cang Xuan,

282
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:31,764
lead the clans of the Central Plains
to pray for peace and safety.

283
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:43,644
What happened?

284
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:50,644
What should we do?

285
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,325
How did it collapse?

286
00:17:59,445 --> 00:17:59,884
Father.

287
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,244
It seems that

288
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:03,004
Cang Xuan hasn't improved much.

289
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:04,524
You made him build a hall

290
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:05,725
but he made it collapse.

291
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:08,445
No wonder those clans
are impeaching him.

292
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:09,925
Father.

293
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:12,404
Although this incident may not be

294
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,965
Cang Xuan's fault.

295
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:15,164
But we should

296
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:17,364
look into it to appease

297
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,364
those clans.

298
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:19,524
Otherwise,

299
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:22,445
they won't recognize our authority.

300
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:33,164
What do you suggest?

301
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:36,284
Since the clans suspect
Cang Xuan of embezzlement,

302
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:37,644
I suggest

303
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:41,404
we send a commissar to look into it

304
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:43,284
and reveal the truth.

305
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:45,045
We may

306
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:47,484
clear Cang Xuan's name if he's wronged.

307
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:49,644
Proceed.

308
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:52,725
Father, you're truly wise.

309
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:55,644
The Fan and Zheng families kept

310
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:56,484
spreading rumors,

311
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:58,884
which convinced the clans

312
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,045
that Cang Xuan embezzled money.

313
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:03,124
Chenrong Yi wanted to reconcile them,

314
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,404
but seeing everyone enraged,

315
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,284
he agreed to report
to the King of Xiyan.

316
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:10,644
Chenrong Yi always prioritizes
the peace and harmony

317
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:11,925
of the Central Plains.

318
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,764
Cang Xuan became the target.

319
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:15,884
He wouldn't displease the clans

320
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:17,764
to protect Cang Xuan.

321
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,205
The King of Xiyan has accepted

322
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:19,965
Deyan's advice

323
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,805
and sent a commissar

324
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:23,325
to look into this incident.

325
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:25,045
The King of Xiyan wants to show

326
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,045
that he won't favor Cang Xuan.

327
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:28,605
So this time,

328
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:30,484
Cang Xuan has to count on himself.

329
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:31,884
If Cang Xuan

330
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:34,284
fails to steer through this,

331
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:36,364
his well-established power
in Central Plains

332
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:37,725
will be ruined.

333
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:41,085
If Cang Xuan gets
kicked out of the Central Plains,

334
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:42,925
he has to return to Xiyan Town.

335
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,484
But his two uncles

336
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,325
won't give him another chance.

337
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:49,764
The path to the throne

338
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:51,364
is paved by blood and bodies.

339
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:53,244
Cang Xuan chose this path.

340
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:54,965
So he must have been

341
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:56,484
well-prepared.

342
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:57,484
Master,

343
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:00,764
are you really letting him be?

344
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:01,685
I've taught him

345
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:05,404
everything I could teach him.

346
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:16,404
Princess.

347
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:17,884
Jintian Valley's forging master is here.

348
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:33,484
You're the one
who wants the bow and arrows?

349
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:35,884
You have little spirit power

350
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,284
and expect to kill people?

351
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:39,484
Chief was right.

352
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,085
It's truly challenging.

353
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,164
When I first saw you,

354
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,085
I also doubted

355
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:47,925
that you were

356
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,725
the forging master my father invited.

357
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:52,364
I'm Jintian Xingchen,

358
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:53,685
the most talented forging master

359
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,605
in the Jintian Family.

360
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,725
If the clan chief hadn't told me

361
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:58,565
how challenging it was,

362
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,244
I wouldn't do it even for

363
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:01,205
His Majesty.

364
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:02,565
I'm counting on you.

365
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:09,284
How come

366
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,565
your hands are even rougher

367
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:12,325
than mine?

368
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:14,565
I practice archery to kill people.

369
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:17,004
How do I succeed without hard work?

370
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,205
I thought

371
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:22,205
you wanted a weapon for fun.

372
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,644
It looks like I was wrong.

373
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,884
Do you have any requirements

374
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,085
on the shape, color,

375
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,524
or auxiliary functions?

376
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:31,965
There's only one.

377
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:33,685
It should be deadly.

378
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:35,845
You're quite an expert.

379
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:37,124
Weapons are meant

380
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:38,164
for killing people.

381
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:39,965
Those who ask for fancy stuff

382
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,565
are amateurs.

383
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:42,764
I do have a weapon for you.

384
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,205
What is it?

385
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:45,725
You're so lucky.

386
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:46,605
It's unbelievable.

387
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:47,644
You don't know

388
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,404
what rare materials I used for it.

389
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,404
There are merfolk's bones,
siren's organs, tortoise blood,

390
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,524
undersea bamboo, star sand,
and epic moonstone.

391
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:56,685
Those are all rare treasures.

392
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:57,884
Even His Majesty

393
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,205
can't easily gather those.

394
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:01,085
I wonder how that person

395
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:03,284
gathered all those materials.

396
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:05,605
It's such a legendary weapon.

397
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:07,004
Why is it unwanted?

398
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:24,244
Are you here for the weapon?

399
00:22:25,164 --> 00:22:25,805
Just a second.

400
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:33,565
Here you go.

401
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:44,284
How about it?

402
00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:45,805
Do you like it?

403
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:47,884
This is my best piece of work.

404
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:51,565
I don't want it anymore.

405
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:52,565
What?

406
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:54,205
You don't want it?

407
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,164
I can't use it anyway.

408
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,045
It serves no purpose.

409
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:00,244
You already wasted my materials.

410
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,164
You can't force me to buy it.

411
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,725
No matter why he didn't want it,

412
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:09,484
it wasn't because I did a bad job.

413
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:16,484
Look.

414
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,484
This is the bow.

415
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:36,325
What a nice bow.

416
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:37,244
Of course.

417
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:39,644
This is the best
piece of work in my life.

418
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:41,404
But...

419
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:42,364
But what?

420
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:43,764
The bow

421
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:45,965
needs to be tamed.

422
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:48,725
It has a special requirement.

423
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:50,605
How special?

424
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:53,004
It needs the blood

425
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,404
of the nine-headed demon.

426
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:58,565
The only known nine-headed demon

427
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:00,164
throughout Dahuang

428
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:01,805
is that guy called

429
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:03,445
Xiang Liu with Nine Lives.

430
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:05,884
I heard he's really eccentric

431
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,484
and difficult.

432
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:14,764
No wonder nobody wants this bow.

433
00:24:15,524 --> 00:24:17,325
Well, the rare materials won't work

434
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:18,484
without the blood

435
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:19,325
of that demon.

436
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:21,045
But you're the Princess of Haoling.

437
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:22,284
Your father is the king.

438
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:23,364
You'll find a way.

439
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:25,364
This is truly a legendary bow.

440
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:25,845
I promise

441
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:27,445
you won't regret getting it.

442
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:31,685
This bow

443
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:33,565
is mine.

444
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:35,565
Your Highness.

445
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:37,845
I found the cause of the collapse.

446
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:39,764
The bucket arch broke.

447
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:41,805
They are crisscrossed and layered

448
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:42,884
upon each other

449
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,484
to share the burden of the beam

450
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,884
on the columns

451
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:47,124
and support the eaves.

452
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:49,284
If the bucket arch breaks,

453
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,644
the roof collapses first

454
00:24:53,364 --> 00:24:55,085
and pulls the walls and columns.

455
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:58,364
That's similar to what happened.

456
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:00,805
But our bucket arch
was made from Kunwood,

457
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:01,925
which was solid.

458
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:03,884
How did it break?

459
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:05,284
I found white ants

460
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:07,644
under the broken bucket arch.

461
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:09,565
I thought they were common ants.

462
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:11,445
But the experts said that

463
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:12,644
those ants were bred

464
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,404
by chalcedony from Mount Jade

465
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:15,605
and could eat Kunwood.

466
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:17,164
Someone must have

467
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:18,364
placed them there

468
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,565
to eat the wood.

469
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,284
I have found the suspect

470
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:22,445
and ordered an arrest.

471
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:24,484
Your Highness.

472
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:27,284
Your Lordship. I went to arrest
the carpenter Peng Shan.

473
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,124
But he had committed suicide at home.

474
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:35,484
We lost our key witness.

475
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:36,845
I wasn't fast enough.

476
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:37,565
Your Highness.

477
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,445
The commissar has arrived at Zhiyi.

478
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:41,164
Who is it?

479
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:42,445
Yueliang.

480
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,085
It's him.

481
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:50,205
I came to the Central Plains

482
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:51,725
because a palace collapsed.

483
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,445
I didn't expect that

484
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:57,404
I'd be kicked out for the same reason.

485
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:05,605
The plan was to give these

486
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:07,565
copies of the historical records

487
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,445
to Prince Cang Xuan as a gift,

488
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:12,605
but the Daming Hall suddenly collapsed.

489
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:14,884
You didn't even have the chance

490
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:16,845
to give him these files you copied

491
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:18,404
and the letter you wrote.

492
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:20,805
(To Cang Xuan)

493
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:21,565
Miss.

494
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:23,325
Should I send them

495
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:24,565
to Prince Cang Xuan?

496
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:25,845
Miss.

497
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:43,925
Remember.

498
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:46,805
There were no gifts.

499
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:48,244
Yes.

500
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:03,325
Pack the medicinal material

501
00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:04,445
and the spirit herb.

502
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:06,524
Take them to Chenrong Mountain

503
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,484
with us.

504
00:27:07,845 --> 00:27:09,925
Why didn't you pack any jewelry,

505
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:11,644
but took all the rare medicinal material

506
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:12,364
from the palace?

507
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:15,045
You don't get it.

508
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:17,284
I need them to make medicine.

509
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:18,685
Since I need a favor,

510
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:20,764
I must offer some gifts.

511
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:23,805
Xuan is in deep trouble.

512
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:24,965
What's wrong?

513
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:26,445
The Daming Hall collapsed.

514
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,524
The King of Xiyan sent Xuan's archenemy

515
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:29,884
Yueliang to look into this.

516
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,164
Yueliang

517
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:32,805
will take a deadly strike now.

518
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:34,925
Shan Hu, Miao Pu.

519
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:36,244
Pack up.

520
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,205
We're going back.

521
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:38,124
Yes.

522
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,845
I'm coming with you.

523
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:41,524
May I?

524
00:27:47,524 --> 00:27:48,965
I heard my father is choosing

525
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,124
a husband for you.

526
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:51,764
Don't you like any

527
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:53,124
of those young men?

528
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:53,965
They...

529
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:57,124
They're no match for Xuan.

530
00:27:59,565 --> 00:27:59,965
Come.

531
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:05,685
Sit down.

532
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:12,364
I see you as my sister.

533
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:15,085
So I don't want you

534
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:16,524
to fall for Cang Xuan.

535
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:20,484
To be honest with you,

536
00:28:21,244 --> 00:28:22,524
back in Xiyan Town,

537
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:24,164
although he was faking it,

538
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:26,325
it was a fact that he was popular

539
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:27,124
among women.

540
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,445
Moreover, he has

541
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:31,004
Chenrong Xinyue with him now.

542
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:34,004
I know.

543
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:35,284
Cang Xuan

544
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:37,284
never cares about romance.

545
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,404
If another woman falls in love with him

546
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:42,205
and can offer him

547
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:43,925
some assistance,

548
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:45,244
he won't mind it.

549
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:47,085
I'm afraid

550
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:48,805
he'll accept her.

551
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:50,644
If marrying a woman

552
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:52,764
can help him avoid conflicts

553
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,124
and save dozens or hundreds

554
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,284
of guards,

555
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:58,404
or even prevent a war,

556
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,524
what do you think he would do?

557
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:08,524
In fact, I don't like it, either.

558
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:11,404
But I wandered the world
for hundreds of years.

559
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,605
I was once an ordinary person.

560
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:16,484
I know

561
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:19,524
how precious it is to live in peace

562
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:22,404
and how fragile a common person is.

563
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:23,004
So

564
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:25,685
I fully support him.

565
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:26,925
Nian,

566
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:29,124
let Father find you

567
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:30,685
a good husband in Haoling.

568
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:33,685
Stop thinking about Cang Xuan.

569
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:44,445
I've been trying to forget him

570
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:45,484
for 40 years,

571
00:29:45,565 --> 00:29:46,725
but I can't.

572
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:50,325
I've been thinking about it so much.

573
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:52,364
And I've made up my mind.

574
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,124
Even if he marries other women,

575
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:57,605
as long as he's sweet to me,

576
00:29:58,364 --> 00:29:59,445
I won't mind it.

577
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:02,244
Can't you just toughen up?

578
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:03,764
You're a princess.

579
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:05,445
You don't need any man.

580
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,085
How come you can't live

581
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:08,364
without him?

582
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:12,325
You just...

583
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:15,565
You just feel heartbroken and that's it.

584
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:19,004
But

585
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:20,965
I'm not as good as you.

586
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:22,764
I can't live on

587
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:24,565
with a broken heart.

588
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:26,085
All I know

589
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:28,404
is that without Xuan,

590
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:30,685
there is no fun

591
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:31,845
in whatever I do.

592
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:32,805
I'd rather die.

593
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:36,445
Are you saying that you can't forget him

594
00:30:37,164 --> 00:30:39,205
with all the years you have as a deity?

595
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:45,045
Sister.

596
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,965
Apart from Father and Mother,

597
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:50,565
only you can help me.

598
00:30:56,484 --> 00:30:57,045
Sister.

599
00:30:59,364 --> 00:31:00,644
Help me, please.

600
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:12,725
Your Highness.

601
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,244
General Yinglong told me

602
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:16,284
to bring it to you.

603
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:27,484
Your Highness, what did he say?

604
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,124
Your Highness.

605
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:48,205
Are you fine?

606
00:31:49,004 --> 00:31:50,124
For Xiaoyao,

607
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:53,244
I must stay in the Central Plains.

608
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:56,565
I have to.

609
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:22,205
Jing.

610
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:25,965
Jing.

611
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:28,925
Wake up.

612
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:29,965
Jing.

613
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,965
Jing, are you fine now?

614
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:58,284
Where's Xiaoyao?

615
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:00,445
She went to visit her father

616
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:02,045
and hasn't returned.

617
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:04,284
Jing.

618
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:06,004
What exactly happened?

619
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:08,445
We've been looking for you.

620
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:09,404
But you were

621
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:11,484
hiding in Lirong Chang's casino

622
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:12,565
and getting drunk.

623
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:20,725
Why are you looking for me?

624
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:23,045
Go get changed.

625
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:24,925
Sorry.

626
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:26,445
I took extreme measures

627
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:28,004
to wake you up.

628
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:58,764
Brother,

629
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,685
I didn't expect that

630
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:01,965
we would

631
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:03,925
meet again under such a circumstance.

632
00:34:04,404 --> 00:34:06,565
Please bear with me.

633
00:34:08,284 --> 00:34:10,204
Your Highness,
we found the account books.

634
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:11,605
Nothing left?

635
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:12,924
Rest assured.

636
00:34:13,165 --> 00:34:14,484
I searched everywhere in person.

637
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:15,645
There is nothing left.

638
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:16,845
Brother.

639
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,845
Don't blame me if I'm being careful.

640
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:21,325
First, this is an edict
issued by the king,

641
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:23,045
and I must be impartial.

642
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:23,924
Second,

643
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:28,484
I really want to clear your name.

644
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:29,484
Thank you.

645
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:31,885
Don't worry.

646
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:35,085
I will look into it thoroughly

647
00:34:35,484 --> 00:34:36,365
and slowly

648
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:38,524
until I'm happy with the result.

649
00:34:47,764 --> 00:34:48,244
Your Highness.

650
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:50,845
Are those account books fine?

651
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:53,964
Will they find out

652
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:55,405
about our secret army?

653
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,444
Tushan Jing cooked the book.

654
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,325
Yueliang won't find anything.

655
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:03,565
And the materials for the Daming Hall

656
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:05,204
are authentic

657
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:06,325
and of top quality.

658
00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:07,365
It's impeccable.

659
00:35:09,244 --> 00:35:11,045
But nothing can be a secret forever.

660
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:12,645
It's been decades.

661
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,484
Someone from those clans

662
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,724
may have noticed something.

663
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,565
If Grandfather decides to look into it,

664
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:21,444
our secret army

665
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:24,045
will be exposed one day.

666
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:37,165
Your Highness.

667
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:40,325
Princess is back.

668
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,658
♪All things are dim,

Xuan.

677
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:33,885
I misunderstood you

678
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:34,885
and took off.

679
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:36,605
Are you mad at me?

680
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:38,524
If I'm so easily

681
00:36:38,524 --> 00:36:39,204
mad at you,

682
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,845

Why don't you stay on Wushen Mountain?

What if you catch a cold

688
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,365
on the way here?

689
00:36:58,724 --> 00:37:01,684
We won't catch a cold
on the Wushen Mountain,

690
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:03,924
but we'll be worried sick.

691
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:05,085
Don't worry.

692
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:06,524
It's under investigation.

693
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:08,045
Did Grandfather send someone

694
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:09,244
to take over your job

695
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:10,764
and build the Daming Hall?

696
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:12,724
I don't know.

697
00:37:13,724 --> 00:37:15,004
We're still waiting.

698
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:23,165
Shan Hu.

699
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:24,845
Send it to my father.

700
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:25,405
Yes.

701
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:31,885
(Xuan.)

702
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:34,284
(I will help you stay)

703
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,325
(in the Central Plains at all costs.)

704
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:38,645
Are you worried about His Highness?

705
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,405
You're afraid the clans here

706
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:41,845
will be severe on him

707
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:42,565
for this incident.

708
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:45,805
I am worried,

709
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:47,845
but I'm not afraid.

710
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:52,284
I've been in an existential crisis.

711
00:37:53,845 --> 00:37:54,805
Cang Xuan and I

712
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:57,605
have seen the blood.

713
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:12,684
Everything is ready

714
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:13,764
to be sent

715
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:15,444
to the Central Plains anytime.

716
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:16,484
No rush.

717
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:18,365
Your Majesty.

718
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,605
Yueliang is searching

719
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:21,444
Chenrong Mountain.

720
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:23,405
Things are against Cang Xuan.

721
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,325
This is the path he chose.

722
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:26,885
He must walk it on his own.

723
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:28,524
No one can do it for him.

724
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:32,724
You must understand

725
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:34,565
that we're not trying to save him

726
00:38:35,004 --> 00:38:36,365
but to boost his momentum.

727
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:38,444
To save him, we need to act fast.

728
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:41,964
But to boost his momentum,
we wait for the right moment.

729
00:38:42,204 --> 00:38:43,365
What if

730
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:46,405
there is no momentum to boost

731
00:38:47,204 --> 00:38:48,165
if we don't

732
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:49,805
save him now?

733
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:51,484
It's very likely.

734
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:52,645
But

735
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:54,724
this is the deadly dangerous

736
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:56,365
path to the throne.

737
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:18,684
What's wrong?

738
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:21,805
I gathered all the spirit herbs

739
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:23,724
and spiritual medicine
from the Haoling Palace

740
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,004
and made some fine poisons

741
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:27,924
for you.

742
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:36,885
Cut to the chase.

743
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:50,165
I got this bow

744
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:52,125
from the Jintian Family.

745
00:39:52,805 --> 00:39:53,684
What do you think?

746
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:57,484
Not bad.

747
00:39:58,284 --> 00:39:59,605
But I haven't tamed it,

748
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,684
so it's only unleashing
20 percent of its potential.

749
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:03,764
I need three drops of blood from you

750
00:40:04,405 --> 00:40:05,845
to claim the weapon.

751
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:07,045
May I?

752
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:09,365
Why would I help you

753
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:11,565
for no reason at all?

754
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:19,365
I taught you archery so that

755
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:20,405
you won't ask for favors.

756
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:21,805
If you want something,

757
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:24,165
get it yourself.

758
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:06,524
I made it.

759
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,244
Thank you.

760
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:14,845
Just with words?

761
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:16,524
You took my blood.

762
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:19,325
Shouldn't you pay back

763
00:41:20,365 --> 00:41:21,565
with your blood?

764
00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:25,284
Master, here you are.

765
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:29,845
Keep it for now. Don't renege on that.

766
00:41:30,045 --> 00:41:31,125

I'm planning to apply poison to them.
