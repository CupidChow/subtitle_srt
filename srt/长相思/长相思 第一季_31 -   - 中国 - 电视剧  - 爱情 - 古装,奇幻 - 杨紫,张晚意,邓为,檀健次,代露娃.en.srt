00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:47,137
Your Highness.

4
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:50,817
I tried three tortures on him.

5
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:52,978
He couldn't take it and wanted to die.

6
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:56,378
But he still hasn't
named his accomplices.

7
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:06,058
I killed your little sister.

8
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:11,417
Take my life as you wish.

9
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:12,938
You did it alone?

10
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,178
You really speak highly of yourself.

11
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:17,857
They must have agreed
to let him take all the blame

12
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:19,697
before the action.

13
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:23,497
His clan has been wiped out.

14
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:26,337
Even if the two kings are furious,

15
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:30,258
they can only kill him.

16
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:35,137
I have no family whatsoever.

17
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,738
If you want my life, take it.

18
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:43,217
You have no family whatsoever?

19
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:48,137
I bet countless people died
trying to save you

20
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:50,178
from Chi Chen's blade.

21
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:55,857
Do you really have the nerves
to terminate the Mu family here?

22
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,378
What do you mean?

23
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:00,417
Xiaoxiao.

24
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:06,057
When he was living
with his relatives, the Shen family,

25
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,098
his maid Liu'er was kicked out

26
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,538
of the mansion due to adultery

27
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:12,697
and soon gave birth to a boy.

28
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:14,898
You've been careful enough

29
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:18,258
to avoid contact with them,

30
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:21,137
but I still discovered something.

31
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:23,898
The son of this maid

32
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,697
must be yours.

33
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,658
You can remain silent and die.

34
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:34,337
I will send your son

35
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:38,178
to reunite with the entire Mu family.

36
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,497
You're a devil!

37
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,658
You're a lunatic!

38
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,217
You killed my little sister.

39
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:54,898
I swear I'll claim your life!

40
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:58,458
But if you tell me one thing,

41
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,857
I will leave your son out of it.

42
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:06,258
I killed your little sister.

43
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:09,018
Other than that,

44
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,617
I know nothing.

45
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,298
I know you won't betray your partners.

46
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:16,457
I just want to know

47
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:18,658
why you wanted to kill Xiaoyao.

48
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:21,497
Just tell me that

49
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,217
and I'll spare your son.

50
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:29,418
You have some time to think it through.

51
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:32,818
Don't try to commit suicide.

52
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:36,858
Think about your son.

53
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:55,777
Xiaoyao.

54
00:04:57,538 --> 00:04:58,418
Xiaoyao.

55
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:07,177
Your Highness.

56
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:09,578
What's wrong?

57
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:11,818
Mu Fei wants to see you.

58
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:14,337
But he wants Mr. Fenglong there, too.

59
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:15,457
I see.

60
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:23,858
I can tell you

61
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,057
why I killed your sister.

62
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:28,258
But you have to promise

63
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:31,017
that you'll never hurt my son.

64
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,658
As long as you tell the truth,

65
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:34,057
I won't hurt him.

66
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,337
I don't trust anyone from Xiyan.

67
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:42,418
I want to hear you say that

68
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:46,658
no one shall ever hurt my son.

69
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,938
As long as you tell Cang Xuan the truth,

70
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:51,858
I promise no one shall hurt your son

71
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,177
for what you've done.

72
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:57,138
You must be resenting me

73
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,897
for causing so much trouble
for the clans in the Central Plains.

74
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:04,777
But I had to kill her.

75
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,737
Because she's not
the Great Princess of Haoling at all.

76
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,297
She is the daughter of Chi Chen.

77
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,378
- No way.
- No way.

78
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,858
I've seen that demon's eyes in person.

79
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:23,217
I can't be wrong.

80
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:32,177
After I saw the fake princess,

81
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,737
I was filled with hatred and rage.

82
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:37,538
But I still investigated her carefully.

83
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:40,418
I even consulted
Fifth King and Seventh King.

84
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:43,497
The demon Chi Chen annihilated my clan.

85
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:47,457
I will never forget how he looks.

86
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:49,378
It just occurred to me

87
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:51,337
that the Great Princess of Haoling

88
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,177
reminded me a bit of Chi Chen.

89
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,938
And I've heard rumors
between Princess General

90
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:57,938
and that demon.

91
00:06:58,658 --> 00:06:59,297
Therefore,

92
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,378
I came to seek your confirmation.

93
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:03,457
What rumors?

94
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:06,497
Your Highnesses,
you lived through that period.

95
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:10,457
Have you ever heard of the affair
between Princess General and Chi Chen?

96
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:14,698
To be honest,
there were indeed rumors saying that

97
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:16,497
Xiling Heng and Chi Chen...

98
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,617
However,

99
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,378
it was before she married
the King of Haoling.

100
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,938
So Princess General
and Chi Chen indeed...

101
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:25,858
There's no such thing.

102
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:30,138
Brother, Father has forbidden
anyone to discuss this.

103
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,177
Don't you remember?

104
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,337
Fine, I won't discuss it.

105
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:39,297
Those are just random rumors.

106
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:41,138
Don't take them seriously.

107
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,978
Xiling Heng divorced
the King of Haoling for other reasons.

108
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:48,138
It had nothing to do with Chi Chen.

109
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:55,818
Although they were
extremely reluctant to talk about it,

110
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:59,497
I was sure I was right.

111
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:03,497
She was the daughter of Chi Chen.

112
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,418
Nonsense.

113
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:07,818
Before Auntie left for war,
she had told me

114
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:09,378
to ask the King of Haoling

115
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:11,457
for help if anything went wrong.

116
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,897
If she had betrayed him,

117
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,378
why was he nice enough

118
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:19,578
to educate me and protect me in Haoling?

119
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:20,578
Yeah.

120
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:21,978
Mu Fei.

121
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:23,777
Think about it.

122
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:25,897
King of Haoling is so shrewd.

123
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,457
You can find the truth.

124
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,378
But he can't?

125
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,818
If he had doubts about Xiaoyao,

126
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:34,617
why would he hold
such a grand worship ceremony

127
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,938
to show people in Dahuang
how much he loved Xiaoyao?

128
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:40,898
Did I really kill the wrong person?

129
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:49,057
No.

130
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:50,657
No way.

131
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:54,138
I've seen those eyes.

132
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,338
I can't be wrong.

133
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:57,938
There's no way I'm wrong.

134
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:00,737
It's too late
even if you realize your mistake.

135
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:03,737
You hurt Xiaoyao.

136
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,417
You will pay with your life.

137
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,018
I sacrificed one life to save you.

138
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,977
If you dare to die,

139
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:32,297
I will chop you up
and feed you to the fish.

140
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,417
(The nine-tailed fox also said)

141
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:50,497
(that my mom had been
having an affair with Chi Chen.)

142
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:54,938
They had kept it a secret
from everyone, including my father.

143
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,177
If he had found out about it,

144
00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:02,057
(he would have gotten rid of me.)

145
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,417
Still mad about what Mu Fei said?

146
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:17,097
Nobody would believe in such nonsense.

147
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:20,258
I hope what he said
can remain between us

148
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,778
not only because

149
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:24,338
it affects the reputation
of the King of Haoling and my auntie,

150
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:26,378
but also because my dear uncles

151
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:30,138
wanted to use the clans
in the Central Plains to kill Xiaoyao.

152
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:31,857
I understand.

153
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:33,938
Xiaoyao is prestigious.

154
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,258
If it's not handled properly,

155
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,417
the King of Xiyan may blame it
on the Central Plains

156
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,737
and put it into turbulence again.

157
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,938
For the peace of the Central Plains,

158
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,938
I will be careful and remain silent.

159
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:51,497
Since we know
why Mu Fei wanted Xiaoyao dead,

160
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:54,338
it's easy to find his accomplices.

161
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:58,177
Chi Chen wiped out many clans,

162
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:01,177
but not many of them have members left.

163
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,218
First, they need to know Mu Fei well

164
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:05,818
to trust each other
in this assassination.

165
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:07,737
Second, they should practice

166
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,138
Water Spirit and Wood Spirit.

167
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:14,138
And I feel that one of them is a woman.

168
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:17,778
Only a woman can manage
to separate Xinyue and Xiaoyao

169
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:20,297
and stop the secret guards
I sent around Xiaoyao

170
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:23,497
without attracting attention.

171
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:26,537
You've got a point.

172
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:29,297
With all this information,

173
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:32,297
I bet you already know who did it.

174
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:34,018
Come to Chenrong Mansion tonight.

175
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,537
Xinyue and I will
have an answer for you.

176
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:37,898
Alright.

177
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:30,977
Xinyue took me to the plum blossom wood,

178
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:32,898
and I was assassinated.

179
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:35,617
Where am I?

180
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,898
Am I already dead?

181
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,497
So I can't leave my body?

182
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:07,177
Does Cang Xuan know how I am?

183
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,857
He must be worried sick.

184
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:22,737
Brother, it's a good opportunity.

185
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,338
I know it's an opportunity.

186
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:27,857
But Cang Xuan

187
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:29,537
will have to make a decision.

188
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,138
Found the culprit?

189
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:40,898
After investigation,

190
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:43,218
we confirmed that
there were four culprits.

191
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:44,458
Apart from Mu Fei,

192
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:47,458
there are orphans of
the Shen, Zhan, and Jin families,

193
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:49,818
namely Shen Zhong,
Zhan Xueling, and Jin Yuejian.

194
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:53,578
Thank you.

195
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:56,578
Cang Xuan, one more thing.

196
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:57,578
What is it?

197
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:02,417
The Fan and the Zheng families
came to see me

198
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:04,698
and pleaded
for Zhan Xueling and Jin Yuejian.

199
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:07,617
Zhan Xueling is Mr. Fan's fiance.

200
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:10,018
They grew up together
as childhood sweethearts

201
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,778
and would get married in three months.

202
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:15,977
Jin Yuejian was engaged to the daughter
of the Zheng family at a young age.

203
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:17,617
They've always been close.

204
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,338
The Fan and Zheng families said

205
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:27,898
that as long as you went easy
on Zhan Xueling and Jin Yuejian,

206
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,657
their families would pay back
by showing support. I...

207
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:37,218
I...

208
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,578
suggest you think twice.

209
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:48,898
That's also my opinion.

210
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:51,097
You need talents at this moment.

211
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:53,578
If you kill Zhan Xueling
and Jin Yuejian,

212
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:56,417
the two clans of the six
will turn against you.

213
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:57,938
It's not worth it.

214
00:15:58,497 --> 00:15:59,977
That's right.

215
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:03,537
Cang Xuan, to achieve great success,

216
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,698
you must know what to do

217
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,097
and what not to do.

218
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:10,297
The harm to Xiaoyao

219
00:16:10,898 --> 00:16:12,378
can't be undone even if you kill them.

220
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,578
You can only vent your anger,
which is pointless.

221
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:17,177
But if you spare them,

222
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:20,737
they will be your supporters
and help you achieve great things.

223
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,617
Good point.

224
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,938
Let me tell you
a story from my childhood.

225
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:45,417
I was quite young.

226
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:49,338
My parents left to fight in the war,

227
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:51,218
the one against your grandpa,

228
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:53,537
Chenrong Yanzhuan.

229
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:55,458
One day,

230
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:59,458
my mother and auntie suddenly came back

231
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,338
with the news that
my father died in the war.

232
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:11,858
I saw my granny,
my auntie, and my mother

233
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,537
hugging each other and crying.

234
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:19,897
Granny was the founding queen of Xiyan

235
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,137
who used to fight alongside Grandpa.

236
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:25,777
My mother was the wise leader

237
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,098
of the Ruoshui Clan.

238
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,938
My auntie was the Princess General
who became known throughout Dahuang

239
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,777
and died defending the kingdom.

240
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,618
The three of them were
the toughest women I'd known.

241
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:42,978
But at that moment,

242
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:46,417
they cried their hearts out

243
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:49,098
like they lost all hope in life

244
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,537
and didn't know what lay ahead.

245
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,297
It was heartbreaking.

246
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:03,698
At that moment,

247
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:07,578
I swore to myself that

248
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,297
I would be strong,

249
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:15,777
much stronger than the King of Xiyan.

250
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:19,777
I have to protect them.

251
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:26,338
I will never let my grandma,
my auntie, and my mom

252
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:31,017
weep helplessly
out of the deepest grief.

253
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:35,578
But...

254
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:48,498
But...

255
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,738
They didn't see me grow up.

256
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:01,377
I want to protect my family.

257
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,578
That's why I'm eager to grow up

258
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:06,338
and gain power.

259
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:10,738
That's why I want to
achieve greater things than my grandpa.

260
00:19:13,498 --> 00:19:15,177
If I choose to let go

261
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,177
of those who hurt Xiaoyao to gain power,

262
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,177
I'd be betraying my younger self
in the Zhaoyun Hall.

263
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,098
As you said,

264
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:30,777
there are things we can do
and things we can't do.

265
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:33,098
But no matter what,

266
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:34,377
we shouldn't

267
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,377
betray ourselves.

268
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:42,338
When you try to talk me out of it,

269
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,978
has it crossed your mind that
if I give up on Xiaoyao for some reason,

270
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:49,818
maybe one day

271
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:53,297
I can give up on you

272
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:55,978
for something else?

273
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:00,978
I'm not a good man

274
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,458
or a good lover for a woman.

275
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:06,938
But no matter what happens,

276
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:10,858
I won't give up on my family,

277
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:12,698
friends, and subordinates.

278
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,057
You, Xiaoxiao, or Jin Xuan.

279
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:18,137
Whoever dares to hurt you

280
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,137
will never be spared.

281
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:31,897
Most of the time,

282
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:35,257
I can weigh the pros and cons

283
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:37,858
and make the right choices.

284
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:40,578
But in rare cases,

285
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,297
I'm willing to follow

286
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:44,578
an arduous path.

287
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,897
It's not ideal to offend the Fan

288
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,177
and Zheng families.

289
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:50,897
But so what?

290
00:20:52,057 --> 00:20:53,738
I'll fight through thick and thin

291
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:56,537
in the worst case.

292
00:20:57,377 --> 00:20:57,978
Alright.

293
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:00,458
I'll fight alongside you.

294
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:01,578
I believe

295
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,098
that sooner or later,

296
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:07,098
those two families will realize

297
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:10,537
that it's better to take my side.

298
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:15,698
You two are lunatics.

299
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:41,818
Miss.

300
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:44,098
Are you happy or sad?

301
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:47,098
I should have been sad

302
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:49,938
when he mentioned another woman.

303
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:52,338
But I can't help being happy

304
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,297
about what he said.

305
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,177
He said

306
00:21:58,618 --> 00:21:59,858
that he'd protect me

307
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:03,618
and wouldn't let anyone hurt me.

308
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,377
Why haven't I met him sooner?

309
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,218
When I was held hostage in Xiyan Town,

310
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:16,057
I was terrified every day

311
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,897
and had to bear with it
when I got bullied.

312
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:24,578
If he had been by my side back then,

313
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:30,218
maybe I wouldn't have suffered so much.

314
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,818
Do you like my little sister
because of her status

315
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:38,498
or her personality?

316
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:49,017
Do you like Xiaoyao
because of her status

317
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:52,338
or her personality?

318
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,777
We've decided to make the culprits pay.

319
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:10,257
But it's tricky to decide

320
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:11,537
on a method.

321
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,738
What's on your mind?

322
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:17,698
If I let Grandpa handle
the Mu, Shen, Zhan, and Jin families,

323
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,818
someone may connect it to Chi Chen,

324
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:23,777
which is bad for Xiaoyao.

325
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:25,458
It's not just bad for her.

326
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:28,537
Chi Chen is hated in the Central Plains.

327
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:30,818
If people hear about it,

328
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,057
it may cause serious trouble.

329
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:34,698
Don't worry.

330
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:37,818
Not even my father and Xinyue
saw Mu Fei's testimony.

331
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:40,897
I will keep their motive a top secret.

332
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:46,618
Tell your father
to leave Mu Fei to Grandpa.

333
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,777
I will handle the Shen, Zhan,

334
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:51,618
and Jin families.

335
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:52,858
Alright.

336
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,338
But what's your plan?

337
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:59,338
I'll make it quick for Zhan Xueling

338
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:02,657
because she's a woman.

339
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:03,938
But the others...

340
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,297
I will make them suffer

341
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:10,657
hundreds and thousands of times

342
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,938
the pain Xiaoyao has suffered.

343
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:16,978
What about your uncles?

344
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:19,177
I can't do anything to them yet.

345
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:22,818
But I swear I will

346
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:26,698
get even with them one day.

347
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:38,537
Xueling.

348
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,177
I'm married into the Zheng family.

349
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:53,777
They won't let you off
if you dare to touch me.

350
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:16,698
Xiaoyao.

351
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:19,938
I've avenged you.

352
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:22,897
I didn't let go of any culprit.

353
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,297
And I know

354
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:30,338
it may render all our efforts in vain.

355
00:25:30,858 --> 00:25:31,938
If you're awake,

356
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:34,137
you would stop me.

357
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:36,137
But I don't want to

358
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:39,137
weigh the pros and cons of this.

359
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:42,618
If we have to start afresh,

360
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:44,897
I'll have to make you

361
00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:47,738
continue suffering with me.

362
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:02,897
Princess's hand is cold.

363
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:05,458
Get her a thick quilt.

364
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:07,098
Your Highness.

365
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:09,017
This is just a puppet.

366
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:12,297
Yes, Your Highness. I'll be right back.

367
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:36,537
I wonder how Cang Xuan is.

368
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:39,017
I bet he's looking for me.

369
00:26:40,578 --> 00:26:43,777
Tushan Jing must have heard
about the assassination.

370
00:26:54,938 --> 00:26:55,738

371
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,377

00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:08,618
Where have you been?

376
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:09,738
How can you

377
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:10,777
leave me here alone?

378
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,657
It's so irresponsible

379
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:14,098
to leave the patient alone.

380
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:15,098

Why do you look so pale?

386

Is it the blood from your heart?

387
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:38,938

Princess General's daughter
was tortured and assassinated.

I can't believe some clan heads would

431
00:29:57,938 --> 00:29:59,858
plead for the culprits.

432
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:02,657
Father.

433

Mu Fei

434
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:07,297
is the last member of the Mu family.

435
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:09,458
The Ying and Chu families

436
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:11,218
feel sorry for him.

437
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:13,057
That's why they plead for him.

438
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,458
We can chop off his legs or nose.

439
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:18,738
But please, let the Mu family
carry on their bloodline.

440
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:23,818
Isn't Xiaoyao the only child of Heng?

441
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,657
Why don't you feel sorry for her?

442
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:31,498
I'm not pleading for Mu Fei.

443
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,057
I'm simply conveying
the message of those clans.

444
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:39,978
When did you become so close
to those clans in the Central Plains?

445
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:46,297
I'm not. I dare not.

446
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:56,297
Assassinating Princess General's child
is a heinous crime never to be forgiven.

447
00:30:56,858 --> 00:30:59,738
Mu Fei dared to hurt the royal blood.

448
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:02,498
I sentence him
to death by a thousand cuts.

449
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:04,777
Discard his body in the wild
without a burial.

450
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:08,338
The heads of the Chu and Ying families
couldn't discern

451
00:31:09,218 --> 00:31:10,537
right from wrong

452
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:13,338
and pleaded for the culprit.

453
00:31:14,057 --> 00:31:15,698
Tell the two families

454
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:20,618
to select new leaders
who have better ethics and morals.

455
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:23,498
Understood.

456
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:35,938
Send some...

457
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:36,818
No.

458
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:38,897
Go bring Xiaoyao back in person.

459
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,338
I can't leave her there anymore.

460
00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:45,098
Master, I'm afraid we shouldn't
move her at the moment.

461
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:49,218
The physicians in Haoling
couldn't figure out how to heal her.

462
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:52,458
But Cang Xuan seemed
to have found someone

463
00:31:52,498 --> 00:31:53,978
who could save Great Princess.

464
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:05,017
Let her stay and get treated for now.

465
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:07,137
But

466
00:32:07,698 --> 00:32:09,858
no matter what happens,

467
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:13,338
make Cang Xuan inform me right away.

468
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:16,657
Also, send as many
spiritual medicines as possible.

469
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:18,777
If they need anything else,

470
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,818
inform me at once.

471
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:24,057
Rest assured, Master.
I'll keep an eye on it.

472
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,657
Assassinated? How come?

473
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:36,098
I bet she's been picking up fights.

474
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,858
You think everyone's
nice like me? You deserve it.

475
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:43,858
- The King of Xiyan gave the verdict?
- Yes.

476
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:46,137
Mu Fei has been sentenced to death

477
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,938
by a thousand cuts and no burial.

478
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,618
Two clans

479
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,698
pleaded for him

480
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:53,698
and both got denounced.

481
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:56,618
They were even told
to select better clan leaders.

482
00:32:57,297 --> 00:32:59,738
Which clans pleaded for the culprit?

483
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:04,017
The Chu and Ying families.

484
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:07,377
The Fan and Zheng families
didn't hand in a report.

485
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:09,218
But as far as I know,

486
00:33:09,818 --> 00:33:12,377
they were secretly supporting
the other two families.

487
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:13,978
Your Majesty.

488
00:33:14,897 --> 00:33:18,177
These clans are
in the territory of Xiyan.

489
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:21,458
It's inappropriate for us
to directly intervene.

490
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:25,498
We shouldn't intervene.

491
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:28,297
But we should let them
bully our Great Princess at will?

492
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,498
You're so useless!

493
00:33:30,057 --> 00:33:30,858
Father.

494
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:32,618
You can't let them off easy.

495
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:35,098
We must show them the consequences.

496
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:41,377
I said we shouldn't directly intervene.
But we can do it indirectly.

497
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,698
Ru Shou, pass on my word.

498
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:49,657
Kick all the members of the Chu, Ying,

499
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:53,738
Fan, and Zheng families out of Haoling.

500
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:54,938
Also,

501
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:58,017
Qin Mang, visit the Central Plains

502
00:33:58,017 --> 00:33:59,377
to see your senior Cang Xuan

503
00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:01,938
and inform all the clans there

504
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:07,897
that no one from these four clans
shall set foot in Haoling.

505
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:10,577
Yes, Your Majesty.

506
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:30,698
I swear I didn't do anything.

507
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:35,857
He can't see me. Why am I scared?

508
00:34:39,738 --> 00:34:41,018
Are you better, Xiang Liu?

509
00:34:43,857 --> 00:34:44,577
Nine-headed demon.

510
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:46,577
Why did you become so weak?

511
00:34:46,978 --> 00:34:49,258
You're like a fair lady who's been sick

512
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,817
and faint all the time.

513
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:56,018
Did you lose primal spirit power
because of me?

514
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:01,097
Xiang Liu.

515
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:03,698
Talk to me.

516
00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:06,458
Why are you so silent?

517
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,538
Come on. Talk to me.

518
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,018
Talk to me.

519
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,337
Tell me what's going on out there.

520
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,177
How's my brother Cang Xuan?

521
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,218
I bet he's worried.

522
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:21,938
And my father

523
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:24,698
must have heard about the assassination.

524
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:26,698
Did you tell them anything?

525
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:30,657
And Tushan Jing.

526
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:32,137
Is he fine?

527
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:42,978
What are those?

528
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:45,298
Cang Xuan sent you
some spiritual medicines.

529
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:46,938
But they don't help you much.

530
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:50,058
You can just play with them.

531
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:51,498
Cang Xuan knows I'm here.

532
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:53,738
That's great.

533
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,218
But I thought you two fight
whenever you meet.

534
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:00,337
Why would he let me stay here?

535
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:06,137
Xiang Liu, why are you silent again?

536
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:07,938
Say something.

537
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:09,897
Fine.

538
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:11,778
Why are you staying

539
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:13,177
if you won't talk?

540
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,258
Just leave.

541
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:15,377
Just go.

542
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,498
Xiang Liu, I was kidding.

543
00:36:31,218 --> 00:36:31,978
Xiang Liu.

544
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:34,137
Xiang Liu, I was kidding.

545
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:35,298
I'm sorry.

546
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:38,018
I'm sorry. Please.

547
00:36:40,018 --> 00:36:40,857
Please come back.

548
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:43,498
I'm even lonelier without you.

549
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:45,137
Who's going to talk to me?

550
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:52,218
Your Highness.

551
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,617
Do you think the Poinciana Wood will
resemble the one on the Zhaoyun Peak?

552
00:36:58,978 --> 00:36:59,857
Eventually.

553
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:02,458
That's great.

554
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:05,577
Princess will be so happy
once she's back.

555
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:07,978
She has always loved Poinciana trees.

556
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:10,657
Once they're fully grown,

557
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:14,897
I'll make her a swing
just like the one on the Zhaoyun Peak.

558
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:16,258
Even better.

559
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:19,657
You'll push the swing for her

560
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:21,377
just like when you were kids.

561
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,897
- Your Highness.
- Did you see him?

562
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:32,817
Xiang Liu is hard to track.

563
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,097
I didn't see him.

564
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:36,298
I simply left
the spiritual medicines there.

565
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:38,778
He left you a message.

566
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:45,056
(No longer in critical condition.
But she hasn't woken up.)

567
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,458
Your Highness,
is it news about Princess?

568
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:51,498
How is she? Has she woken up?

569
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:53,617
She hasn't woken up yet,

570
00:37:54,377 --> 00:37:56,778
but she's no longer
in critical condition.

571
00:37:58,337 --> 00:37:59,177
That's good.

572
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:00,298
Great.

573
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:01,577
How's Tushan Jing doing?

574
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:04,018
Master Qiuqing
is getting worse and worse.

575
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:06,978
Grand Madam of Tushan
asked the King of Haoling

576
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:09,337
for permission to send
Master Qingqiu to Guixu.

577
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,538
However, he got weaker and weaker

578
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:14,298
once he left Zhiyi.

579
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:16,498
Things didn't look right, so they

580
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:18,112
sent him back to Chenrong Mansion.

581
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,377
Send someone to keep an eye on him.

582
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,698
He fell sick because of Xiaoyao.

583
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,778
She wouldn't want to see him sick.

584
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:26,258
Understood.

585
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:20,137
You have such an amazing puppet.

586
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:22,817
I lost.

587
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:24,978
A visit from an old acquaintance.

588
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:27,458
Chenrong Mountain is well-guarded.

589
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:29,417
How did you enter?

590
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:31,617
Evil deeds bring self-destruction.

591
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:34,137
I'm not the only one who wants you dead.

592
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,897
Try to stay alive first.

593
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:42,258
Let him go.

594
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:44,377
Your Highness, don't.

595
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:46,018
Let him go.

596
00:39:55,337 --> 00:39:56,097
You can go now.

597
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:01,458
If you don't kill me today,

598
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:03,938
I'll kill you some other day.

599
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:05,897
Then you should be careful

600
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,058
not to be caught again.

601
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:33,298
Take the front door.

602
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:08,577
What for?

603
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:14,417
This well-forged dagger

604
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:16,377
is made to take out hearts.

605
00:41:18,298 --> 00:41:19,498
It's named Heart Appreciator.

606
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:22,857
This is Bone Smashing Hammer.

607
00:41:29,058 --> 00:41:30,577
This is Burned Goose Palm

608
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:32,577
named after a dish.

609
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:34,218
But it burns human feet.

610
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:36,778
Your evil hypocrite

611
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:38,577
racked your brain

612
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,897
to come up with
these horrendous tortures.

613
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,857
It's a pity that I'm incapable

614
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:45,258
of killing you
for the benefit of the people.

615
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:46,938
Say no more.

616
00:41:47,577 --> 00:41:49,778
Kill me as you wish.

617
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,738
You also think of someone
who invented these tools

618
00:41:53,738 --> 00:41:56,258
as a devil that deserves to be killed.

619
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:58,577
Anyone would pleasantly

620
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:00,177
kill a maniac beast.

621
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,897
The Lord of Zhiyi 200 years ago

622
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:05,377
designed them in person.

623
00:42:05,778 --> 00:42:07,097
The sinister method

624
00:42:07,298 --> 00:42:10,258
killed tens of thousands
of innocent people in prison

625
00:42:10,337 --> 00:42:11,377
with false accusations.

626
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:14,058
The current Lord of Zhiyi gave the order

627
00:42:15,218 --> 00:42:18,137
to stop using most of these tools.

628
00:42:18,897 --> 00:42:22,097
So don't worry about being tortured.

629
00:42:23,698 --> 00:42:25,657
The previous Lord of Zhiyi?

630
00:42:29,738 --> 00:42:31,617
His mother was from the Xiyan clan.

631
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:36,657
His father was from Haoling Xihe Squad.

632
00:42:39,817 --> 00:42:41,218
His name was Xuan Ting.

633
00:42:43,538 --> 00:42:45,738
Utter nonsense! No way!

634
00:42:46,577 --> 00:42:47,337
Untie him.

635
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:51,097
Give it to him.

636
00:43:03,018 --> 00:43:06,177
These are Xuan Ting's case files
on the people he tortured.

637
00:43:07,137 --> 00:43:10,498
He listed the specific types
of tortures he used

638
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:12,738
and the victims' reactions.

639
00:43:18,258 --> 00:43:19,657
It was a coincidence that

640
00:43:20,938 --> 00:43:22,817
Grandpa assigned this case
to me back then.

641
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:27,337
I never regretted
killing your big brother.

642
00:43:27,778 --> 00:43:28,817
Because he was

643
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:30,698
a high official

644
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:33,498
who adopted tortures on innocent people

645
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,577
and killed tens of thousands of them.

646
00:43:37,258 --> 00:43:38,458
He deserved it.

647
00:43:40,938 --> 00:43:42,577
If you think I've made a mistake,

648
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:44,897
go on with the assassinations.
