00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,128
=Episode 2=


3
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:48,565
Brother, what's wrong with you?


4
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:50,084
My eyes played tricks on me.


5
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:51,444
I thought I saw someone I knew,


6
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:52,764
but it turned out to be a mistake.


7
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:54,645
A familiar person. Do I know them?


8
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:55,565
No, you don't.


9
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:58,645
I heard that in this town,
there's a talking stone.

10
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:00,288
Would you like to go see it?


11
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:01,004
Sure.


12
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:01,845
Let's go.


13
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,605
Xiaoliu, come again!


14
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,205
I'm leaving.


15
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,205
I'm leaving.


16
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:07,165
Whoever can't have a baby


17
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,924
can come to
the Rejuvenation Hall for me.

18
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:14,564
Are you alright?


19
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:15,364
Sorry.


20
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:16,924
Don't you watch where you're going?


21
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:17,765
Sorry.


22
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,165
Really sorry.


23
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:21,564
Did it hurt you?


24
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:22,325
No.


25
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:24,204
These rustics


26
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,045
are dirty and smelly.


27
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:35,284
I just bathed in the river yesterday.


28
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:36,844
Do I smell bad?


29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,728
Please take your time.


30
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:48,245
Brother,


31
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:50,325
how can we eat the snacks
from such a place?

32
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,284
Sang, eat.


33
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:54,765
We're here to see the stone.


34
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,685
This stone is quite interesting.


35
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:01,536
Not only can it talk,
it can also perform magic tricks.

36
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:02,685
As it says,


37
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:07,245
the little princess has been waiting
on the Mount Jade,

38
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,325
but she hasn't been picked up


39
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,325
by her brother.


40
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,765
So she secretly
slipped down the mountain

41
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:16,924
to look for her father, King of Haoling.


42
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:21,084
Unexpectedly, she vanished
without a trace,

43
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,204
and her fate was unknown.


44
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:27,364
The King of Haoling
is the princess's father.

45
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:28,804
The King of Xiyan


46
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,125
is the princess's maternal grandfather.


47
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,125
Neither emperor can find her?


48
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:34,364
Life is unpredictable,


49
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,685
and things are hard to foresee.


50
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,045
Even the divine emperors


51
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:41,004
cannot control the will of heaven.


52
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:44,084
Is it the sister's story?


53
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:45,004
Yes.


54
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:46,724
Alright.


55
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:49,525
We'll stop here for today.


56
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:51,444
If you want to know what happens next,


57
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,485
please come early tomorrow.


58
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:55,485
Mr. Stone,


59
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:57,444
you've never left this town.


60
00:03:57,844 --> 00:03:58,885
How do you know so much?


61
00:03:59,165 --> 00:03:59,564
Yeah.


62
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:00,605
How do you know?


63
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:04,204
I have a photographic memory from birth.


64
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,685
As the Qingshui stone spirit,


65
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:09,804
there's very little
in this world that I don't know.

66
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:11,685
Master.


67
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,284
Sang.


68
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,045
You're back, Xiaoliu.


69
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
(Rejuvenation Hall)


70
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:35,124
Mu.


71
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:39,765
Slacking off again.


72
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:01,325
Xiaoliu,


73
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,244
I've got some stuff to do at home.


74
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:07,284
I need to leave now.


75
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:08,004
You...


76
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:08,964
You guys go ahead.


77
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:10,765
You've got some stuff to do?


78
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:12,325
You go ahead with your work.


79
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,964
Come and play often in the future.


80
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:18,244
Take care.


81
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:28,885
Xiaoliu,


82
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:32,485
the income today is higher than usual.


83
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,004
The rabbit elf at the breakfast stall


84
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:35,564
gave birth to a litter of bunnies.


85
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:36,444
I earned a little more.


86
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,325
It seems that heaven knows


87
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:41,284
Pimply is going to get married


88
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:42,885
and is helping out.


89
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,045
Xiaoliu,


90
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:52,205
I heard


91
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,284
that the shop on the east side
of the street has been rented out.

92
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:59,605
It's a newcomer to the town.


93
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:00,605
I don't know


94
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,165
what kind of business
they're planning to do.

95
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:03,844
Well.


96
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,284
If he's planning to open a clinic,


97
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,645
won't he steal our business?


98
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:10,124
Live for today and spend your money.


99
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,684
Don't worry about tomorrow.


100
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:12,485
Do your work.


101
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:19,284
Let's do it.


102
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,724
It's your favorite,
Yingzhou Jade Plum Blossom.

103
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:24,165
His Highness
specially planted it for you.

104
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:29,165
It's just a pity that it's not the cold winter,
so we can't see the plum blossoms.

105
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:36,005
His Highness treats you
so well, Your Highness.

106
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:37,724
His Highness's favorite person


107
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,404
is his younger sister.


108
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:40,844
Brother.


109
00:08:41,324 --> 00:08:42,605
Look. So many plum blossoms.


110
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:45,324
Brother, are they beautiful?


111
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:44,445
You've worked hard all day.


112
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,204
Your Highness,
why haven't you rested yet?

113
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:56,125
Are you thinking of the princess again?


114
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:00,805
When I think of Xiaoyao,


115
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:04,045
I can't sleep.


116
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,204
It's been 300 years.


117
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,324
I've traveled through Dahuang


118
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:10,005
and searched everywhere
in Haoling and Xiyan,

119
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:13,284
but I have no news of her.


120
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:15,805
Xiaoyao must think


121
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,045
that her brother is useless, right?


122
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,605
Your Highness, you're wrong.


123
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,165
These years,


124
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:25,964
while you've been searching for
the princess across Dahuang, you also have to

125
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:28,245
avoid the assassinations
of the Fifth King and Seventh King.

126
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,324
It's been very hard.


127
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:30,925
If the princess knew,


128
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:32,485
she would only feel sorry for you.


129
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:36,324
As long as I can find Xiaoyao,


130
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:38,485
it's no big deal to me.


131
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,844
This town has
a unique geographical location

132
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:43,925
and is a mixed bag.


133
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,844
Maybe there will be news this time.


134
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:51,404
You're right, Your Highness.


135
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:03,445
The Qingshui Stone Spirit
claims to have a photographic memory

136
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:04,485
and know everything.


137
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,165
You go and inquire.


138
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:08,045
See if he really knows


139
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:09,524
everything about this town.


140
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:11,605
I wanted to inquire during the day,


141
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:13,245
but I was stopped by Your Highness.


142
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:15,445
Ostensibly,


143
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:19,245
we came to this town to investigate
the matter of the remnants of the Chenrong Army.

144
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:21,724
We need to keep our search


145
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,284
for Xiaoyao as discreet as possible.


146
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:27,565
I don't want my uncles to notice.


147
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:30,764
I see.


148
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:32,964
Your Highness, you thought it through.


149
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:04,644
(The little prince had to leave Xiyan)


150
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:06,685
(due to the exclusion of his uncles)


151
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,165
(and be a hostage in Haoling Kingdom.)


152
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:12,485
(He regarded)


153
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:15,884
(that alluring and thriving
foreign land as his home,)

154
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,204
(spending his days accompanying
the second princess)

155
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:21,084
(on nature walks,)


156
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:24,724
(unconcerned with worldly affairs.)


157
00:13:10,445 --> 00:13:11,605
What are you going to do?


158
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,844
It's your turn to wash the dishes today.


159
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,565
But after washing this time,


160
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:21,184
I'll have to wash again
for the next meal.

161
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:23,005
The dishes will get dirty
sooner or later.

162
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:24,005
Then why should I wash them?


163
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,605
Then I think you should stop eating.


164
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:29,644
After all, you'll get
hungry sooner or later.

165
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,045
After eating this meal,


166
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,365
you'll be hungry for the next meal.


167
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:33,565
Since you said it,


168
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:35,605
why do you have to eat every meal?


169
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:37,685
I'll eat from my own bowl.


170
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:38,884
I don't mind if it's dirty.


171
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:39,764
Whoever minds can wash it.


172
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,644
Always talking nonsense.


173
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:43,925
Mu.


174
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,565
You're a bad influence


175
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:46,724
on Skinny and Pimply.


176
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:47,724
I'll do it.


177
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:48,844
I'll wash them, okay?


178
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:50,204
Hurry.


179
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,964
Wash.


180
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,644
I'll wash all of them.


181
00:13:58,685 --> 00:13:59,365
I'm leaving.


182
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,165
That's more like it.


183
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:03,284
Wash it clean.


184
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:04,764
Got it.


185
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:27,644
Wash.


186
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,125
It looks really fat.


187
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,485
It must taste good
whether it's braised or stewed.

188
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,084
When did I become so accurate?


189
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:50,844
Mind my own business and worry less,


190
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:54,404
and I'll live a long and carefree life.


191
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,644
Good morning, Xiaoliu.


192
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:06,245
Good morning.


193
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:06,964
Morning.


194
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:08,404
Come again.


195
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:10,524
Good morning.


196
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:11,360
Good morning, Xiaoliu.


197
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:12,925
Morning, Xiaoliu.


198
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:13,445
Ready to open?


199
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,485
Going to visit your patient, Xiaoliu?


200
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:16,284
Yeah.


201
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:17,445
Alright.


202
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,284
Rabbit elf,


203
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,248
aren't you supposed to be
in postpartum confinement?

204
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:28,125
Have you ever seen a beast that just lies down
and doesn't move after giving birth?

205
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,245
Don't they have to
run around looking for food?

206
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:38,005
I heard some noise yesterday.


207
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,404
Seems like someone moved in.


208
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,764
But I don't know what they do.


209
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,204
I hope it's not a snack bar.


210
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:44,365
They might steal my business.


211
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:45,764
What are the chances of that?


212
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:47,404
Maybe it's a friendly neighbor.


213
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:48,324
I'm leaving.


214
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:49,245
Take care.


215
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,324
-Morning, ma'am.
-Morning.

216
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:05,565
I'd like a bun, a sesame seed cake,
and a bowl of sweet soy milk.

217
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,685
It'll be ready in a moment.


218
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:12,004
Here you are.


219
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:14,604
This plate of pickles is my treat.


220
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:16,165
I heard you signed a long-term lease.


221
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,845
We're going to be neighbors.


222
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:18,845
Please don't be a stranger.


223
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:19,725
Thank you.


224
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:21,725
My name is Xuan.


225
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:22,805
I've just arrived.


226
00:17:22,884 --> 00:17:23,884
Please take care of me.


227
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:26,205
Xuan.


228
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,244
That's great.


229
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,604
What do you do for a living?


230
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:31,524
I don't know much,


231
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:33,124
but I learned how to brew
alcohol from my master.

232
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:34,205
I'm planning to open a winery.


233
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,364
Once the first batch of wine is brewed,


234
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:37,284
I'll start the business.


235
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,124
That's great.


236
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:40,205
That is


237
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,764
just what this street is lacking.


238
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:42,965
I'll come back right up.


239
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:55,284
Where did this beggar come from?


240
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:28,244
Beggar.


241
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,725
You need to eat.


242
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:34,560
If you don't eat, where will you
get the energy to beg?

243
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:40,644
Skinny, Pimply,


244
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,644
there's a customer here
to buy medicinal herbs.

245
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,445
The rabbit elf inquired.


246
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:36,524
The shop on the east side of the street


247
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:37,524
will be a bar.


248
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:38,925
Its business doesn't conflict with ours.


249
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:40,845
That's good.


250
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:43,325
Xiaoliu.


251
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:48,725
Xiaoliu,


252
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:50,965
I just saw a beggar


253
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,805
by the West River.


254
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:54,644
I don't know where he came from.


255
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:56,364
He looked quite pitiful.


256
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,244
This is Qingshui Town.


257
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,124
We don't lack pitiful people.


258
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,124
If you get into trouble,
you won't even know how you die.

259
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:04,124
But I think...


260
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:05,604
You think what?


261
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:06,805
You bad kid.


262
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:08,484
Are you just growing meat
and not brains?

263
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:10,845
If you want to live long, mind your own business.


264
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:12,725
We won't interfere.


265
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:13,965
Absolutely not.


266
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:15,925
Go and see


267
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:17,045
if Skinny has finished cooking.


268
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:18,805
Once the meal's ready, we'll eat.


269
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,165
Go.


270
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,764
I'll take a walk
by the river to digest my food.

271
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:12,284
I stepped on your sesame seed cake.


272
00:22:13,085 --> 00:22:14,404
What kind of compensation do you want?


273
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:50,004
Xiaoliu.


274
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:50,805
Xiaoliu.


275
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:51,764
This...


276
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:52,124
This...


277
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:52,925
What's wrong?


278
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:53,644
Such a fuss.


279
00:23:03,364 --> 00:23:08,284
Whip wounds, burn wounds,
knife wounds, and stab wounds.

280
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,845
There are both new and older ones,


281
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,484
and all seem unusual.


282
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:16,524
It's the result of enduring


283
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:17,764
long-term torture.


284
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:20,045
Xiaoliu,


285
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:21,284
his feet.


286
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:31,325
The soles have been pierced
with long nails,

287
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:33,484
and his nails have been pulled out.


288
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:39,008
This leg has been broken before,
and it grew back on its own.

289
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,845
But it healed crooked
without medical treatment.

290
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,364
If he wants to walk in the future,


291
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,244
it has to be broken again and reset.


292
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:45,805
Breaking his leg?


293
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,004
Go get me a hammer.


294
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:47,845
Get the biggest one.


295
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:53,205
What are you standing there for?
Go get it.

296
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:53,884
Let's go.


297
00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:58,085
Xiaoliu,


298
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:03,325
this person is a deity.


299
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:05,925
And not a low-level deity like us.


300
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:07,805
I've noticed it.


301
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:15,364
And you still want to save him?


302
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,045
Killing a man requires
no more than cutting off his head.

303
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,725
Behind such torment


304
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:24,565
must be an extraordinary reason.


305
00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:26,805
If you save someone you shouldn't,


306
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:28,685
you're asking for death.


307
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:39,925
I'll go boil some more hot water.


308
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:44,124
Xiaoliu.


309
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:44,644
Xiaoliu.


310
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:45,965
Here's the hammer.


311
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:52,725
See?


312
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:54,205
Strike it.


313
00:24:57,284 --> 00:24:58,045
I dare not.


314
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:04,725
Give it to me.


315
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:06,725
You're bigger than a bear,


316
00:25:06,884 --> 00:25:08,484
but why are you as timid as a mouse?


317
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:09,565
Hold him.


318
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:24,524
Don't be afraid.


319
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:26,325
This is the Rejuvenation Hall,


320
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,965
a medical clinic.


321
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,644
The injury on your leg
must be treated quickly.

322
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:32,364
I am a physician.


323
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:35,404
I'm going to break
your misaligned bone now.

324
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:36,764
It will be struck three times in total.


325
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:38,965
If you really can't bear it,


326
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:40,325
just scream.


327
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,565
Bro, don't worry.


328
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:43,965
Xiaoliu will definitely cure your leg.


329
00:25:57,604 --> 00:25:58,205
One,


330
00:25:59,004 --> 00:25:59,565
two,


331
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:00,884
three.


332
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:10,884
Done.


333
00:26:12,165 --> 00:26:12,725
Xiaoliu,


334
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:13,845
he fainted.


335
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:17,284
He's quite tough. He didn't make a sound
even though it was so painful.

336
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:18,805
This little bit of pain,


337
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:20,884
compared to the torture
he's suffered before,

338
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:22,165
is nothing.


339
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:22,884
Come.


340
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:24,325
Give me a hand.


341
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,045
Xiaoliu,


342
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:55,284
the medicine is ready.


343
00:26:57,244 --> 00:26:57,725
Get up.


344
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:58,685
Take the medicine.


345
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:02,644
Give it to me.


346
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,128
Open your mouth.


347
00:27:35,925 --> 00:27:38,325
He has been tortured for many years.


348
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:41,284
His internal organs
are severely damaged.

349
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:43,805
We don't have
any divine pills or elixirs.

350
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:45,565
I'm afraid he won't live long.


351
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:50,244
Let's do our best
and leave the rest to fate.

352
00:27:57,565 --> 00:27:58,725
I have already made contact


353
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:00,484
with the mole in the remnants
of the Chenrong Army.

354
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:03,685
The remnants of the army are vigilant.


355
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:05,524
It's not easy for the mole to hide.


356
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,925
Don't act rashly.


357
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:08,165
I understand.


358
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,805
The Fifth King and Seventh King
have built up influence for many years,

359
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:13,472
yet they have no way to deal with
the remnants of the Chenrong Army.

360
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,360
Thanks to your meticulous planning,
My Lord,

361
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,484
we are able to infiltrate the enemy
so smoothly this time.

362
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:19,524
The remnants of the Chenrong Army


363
00:28:19,524 --> 00:28:21,045
have always been
a concern of my grandpa.

364
00:28:22,124 --> 00:28:23,685
It's time to remove it.


365
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:25,085
If this mission is successful,


366
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:26,205
it will be a great achievement.


367
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:28,965
Maybe it can help you
return to the Xiyan Mountain.

368
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,004
Master.


369
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:34,004
Master.


370
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:34,965
Master.


371
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:37,404
Master.


372
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:39,524
I've found out.


373
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:40,604
The Qingshui Stone Spirit


374
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,445
is just a small monster


375
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:43,364
with little spirit power,


376
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:45,124
but it has stood in this town


377
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,325
for tens of thousands of years.


378
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:47,685
He knows about all the things


379
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:48,764
that happened in this place.


380
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:51,884
Good.


381
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:53,884
Tonight we will


382
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:55,325
go visit the stone spirit.


383
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:10,884
Mr. Stone, I'm sorry
to disturb you late at night.

384
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:12,085
I have a favor to ask.


385
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,604
What is it?


386
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,165
Can't you tell me during the day?


387
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:25,205
Must you disturb my sweet dreams?


388
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,925
This is millennia-aged jade marrow
from Mount Jade.

389
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:30,004
I've heard it's beneficial
for the cultivation of demons.

390
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:31,604
Please accept it, Mr. Stone.


391
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:38,805
What can I do for you, sir?


392
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:40,884
I have an old friend
who came to this town,

393
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,484
but I don't know where she is.


394
00:29:42,644 --> 00:29:44,484
I heard that you know everything,


395
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,604
so I want to ask you
for help to find her.

396
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:51,124
A piece of cake.


397
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:55,325
But what does the person
you're looking for look like?

398
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:58,845
I haven't seen her for many years.
I'm not very clear about her appearance.

399
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:02,965
But she has a peach blossom-shaped birthmark
in the middle of her forehead.

400
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:03,884
Easy.


401
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:05,364
Easy.


402
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,124
Still not her?


403
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,284
How come it's still not her?


404
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:39,004
T-This is not my fault.


405
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:40,445
I've followed your request


406
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:41,484
to look for this person.


407
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:43,484
I really can't find her.


408
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:45,004
You're right.


409
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:47,045
Thank you.


410
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:01,045
Is there anything else, sir?


411
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,725
It suddenly occurred to me
that my old friend

412
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:03,884
might have changed her appearance.


413
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:05,764
I wonder if you can see


414
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:07,205
the true face through illusions


415
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:08,244
when looking for people.


416
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:11,445
I don't have enough spirit power for that.


417
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:13,364
I can transfer my spirit power to you.


418
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:18,085
You must be a deity, right?


419
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,925
The spirit power of a deity


420
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:22,884
is all benefits and no harm to me.


421
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,205
Of course, I am willing.


422
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:26,845
Master,


423
00:31:27,205 --> 00:31:28,284
it's inadvisable.


424
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:33,445
Sang.


425
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:44,965
Master, don't force yourself too much.


426
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:48,045
If you use too much spirit power at once,
your body won't be able to bear it.

427
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:49,085
The more spirit power,


428
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:51,165
the more likely we are to find her.


429
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:01,445
Master.


430
00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:04,004
That's enough.


431
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:10,364
Why did it stop on them?


432
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,525
I know this physician very well.


433
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,965
His name is Wen Xiaoliu.


434
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:16,324
He has lived in the town
for several decades.

435
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:18,564
He also took in


436
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:20,364
a Xiyan deserter
who didn't want to fight

437
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:23,124
and picked up two human orphans


438
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:24,604
and raised them.


439
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:25,804
It's definitely not him.


440
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:30,445
But this injured man
looks very unfamiliar.

441
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:32,448
It seems I've never seen him before.


442
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,005
I'm looking for a woman,


443
00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:35,685
not a man.


444
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:37,685
Although they are both deities,


445
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:39,205
they haven't changed their appearance.


446
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,564
I've searched all over the town.


447
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:43,005
The person you're looking for


448
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:44,925
is definitely not in this place.


449
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:22,765
(After enduring such torture,)


450
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:25,376
(I thought this man's character
would change drastically,)

451
00:35:25,685 --> 00:35:28,884
(but he still retains
a sense of kindness.)

452
00:35:29,445 --> 00:35:30,564
(That's rare.)


453
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,564
Why is he so hot?


454
00:35:58,485 --> 00:35:59,245
Mu,


455
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:00,485
hand me a bowl of medicine.


456
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:01,445
Hurry up.


457
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:03,165
Coming.


458
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:07,084
What's wrong?


459
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:09,404
The beggar is severely
injured and has fainted.

460
00:36:09,404 --> 00:36:10,912
I need to feed him some more medicine.


461
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:21,044
How can the injuries of a deity


462
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:24,285
be healed with earthly medicines?


463
00:36:27,205 --> 00:36:28,285
He looks like


464
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,445
he's about to breathe his last.


465
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:32,205
I'll let Skinny and Pimply


466
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:33,404
prepare a coffin.


467
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:35,884
He has suffered so much.


468
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,485
It might be a relief to depart early.


469
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:12,324
Don't worry.


470
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:13,644
I'm a superb physician.


471
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:15,245
You'll be better soon.


472
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:21,285
Brother.


473
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:28,404
Brother,


474
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:31,604
Brother.


475
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:37,844
Where did he go so early in the morning?


476
00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:42,205
Brother,


477
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,324
where did you go this early in the day?


478
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,760
Why didn't you even tell me in advance?


479
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:47,005
I went to buy you breakfast.


480
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:49,568
The small steamed buns
from the breakfast stall next door.

481
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:50,644
Very tasty.


482
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:53,364
I don't want to eat
this unsanitary food.

483
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:55,285
Brother, give it to Sang.


484
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:57,312
What do you want to eat then?


485
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:58,445
I will make it for you.


486
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:00,445
As long as it's made by you,
I'm willing to eat.

487
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:01,925
Alright.


488
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:03,765
You go play for a while.


489
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:05,124
I'll be done soon.


490
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:24,404
No wonder other people say


491
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:26,368
you have no dignity


492
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,884
and only know to curry favor
with the princess of Haoling.

493
00:38:29,044 --> 00:38:31,844
You had a hard night,
and your spirit power is all drained,

494
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,404
yet you still don't go to rest


495
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:35,485
and are making breakfast here.


496
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:37,604
You really don't care about
your own body at all.

497
00:38:43,644 --> 00:38:45,324
Xiaoyao was also picky as a child.


498
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:47,364
She couldn't get used
to the food in Xiyan.

499
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:50,005
She disliked the strong smell of mutton


500
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:51,744
and thought the cakes
were too hard to eat.

501
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:54,084
She didn't like mutton soup


502
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:55,364
or flatbread.


503
00:38:57,445 --> 00:38:59,245
But I couldn't cook back then,


504
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:01,525
so I couldn't make food for her.


505
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,084
I don't know


506
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:08,005
what Xiaoyao likes


507
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:09,525
to eat now.


508
00:39:40,564 --> 00:39:42,725
Xiaoliu, you are really awesome.


509
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:44,285
Even dead people can be saved by you.


510
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:45,564
Xiaoliu,


511
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,324
I always thought you were just


512
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:48,324
a mediocre doctor.


513
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:49,884
I didn't expect you to be so capable.


514
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:54,245
I'm even more capable.


515
00:39:58,445 --> 00:40:01,245
Later, make some
duck soup for the beggar.

516
00:40:02,324 --> 00:40:03,404
Just add some salt.


517
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,245
Don't add any other condiments.


518
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:06,685
His throat is injured too.


519
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:08,884
Make the duck meat soft enough.


520
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:16,685
What does that mean?


521
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,044
I don't know.


522
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:20,725
What's got into him?


523
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:22,404
When has he ever
volunteered to wash dishes?

524
00:40:51,124 --> 00:40:51,685
You're awake?


525
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,765
In life, there is no hurdle
that can't be overcome.

526
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:59,765
After you recover,
you can start all over again.

527
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:03,765
I'm going out to earn money.


528
00:41:04,124 --> 00:41:05,044
Take good care of yourself.


529
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:11,328
What are you looking at?


530
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:15,844
Xiaoliu,


531
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:17,604
you take care of him too attentively,


532
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,848
just like taking care of a baby.


533
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:20,576
Other people would think
you were his mother.

534
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:21,965
Are you asking for a beating?


535
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:23,765
Watch him carefully.


536
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,485
Beggar, Xiaoliu spent
the entire night saving you.

537
00:41:30,644 --> 00:41:32,245
You have to live to repay his efforts.


538
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:34,685
Otherwise, it would be
a waste of his hard work.

539
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,644
Come. I'll help you undo it.


540
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:24,285
What?


541
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:26,084
Not happy with me helping you undo it?


542
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:27,084
Okay.


543
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:28,124
You can undo it yourself later.


544
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,044
Starting today,


545
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:35,725
you can take a real bath.


546
00:42:39,872 --> 00:42:41,324
I've been taking care
of you for so long,

547
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,925
cleaning your body,
applying medicine and washing your hair.

548
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:45,600
There's nothing I haven't seen.


549
00:42:46,124 --> 00:42:48,445
Besides, we're both men.


550
00:42:48,564 --> 00:42:49,485
What are you hiding?


551
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:50,804
I'm not going to hold you responsible.


552
00:43:33,604 --> 00:43:36,084
I... I have something else to do.


553
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,324
You wash yourself.


554
00:43:37,644 --> 00:43:38,445
Do it yourself.


555
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:43,644
(He's a woman.)


556
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:52,804
I think


557
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:54,245
the beggar


558
00:43:54,485 --> 00:43:55,564
is either a fool or a mute.


559
00:43:56,044 --> 00:43:56,884
It's been so long,


560
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:58,044
but he hasn't said a word.


561
00:43:58,044 --> 00:43:59,205
He doesn't even cry out in pain.


562
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:00,485
Nonsense.


563
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,044
With such a severe injury,


564
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:03,245
he can still hang on.


565
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:05,005
His determination is extraordinary.


566
00:44:05,084 --> 00:44:06,044
He's definitely not a fool.


567
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:08,324
When his leg heals,


568
00:44:08,324 --> 00:44:08,965
let him leave.


569
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:11,485
This place is not where he should stay.
