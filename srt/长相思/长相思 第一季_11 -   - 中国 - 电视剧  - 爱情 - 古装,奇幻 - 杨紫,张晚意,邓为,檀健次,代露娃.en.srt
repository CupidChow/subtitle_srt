00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:36,576
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:49,298
There are various poisons in this world,

4
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,219
but everything in nature
has its complements and constraints.

5
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:53,888
The same goes for
the poisoning technique.

6
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:56,658
Just remember the tips I told you.

7
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,859
Be cautious.

8
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:00,539
Use your eyes,
nose, hands, and tongue,

9
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,618
and your observation and sense of smell,

10
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,219
You can always find clues,

11
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,378
and nip them in the bud.

12
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:06,618
Okay.

13
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,619
These methods of detecting
and avoiding poison are secret,

14
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,819
but you didn't hold back but taught me.

15
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,578
I don't even know
how to express my gratitude.

16
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:15,776
Your safety is what matters.

17
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,459
We're all friends here.

18
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,339
We could save the courtesy.

19
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,778
I know many people,

20
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,298
but I don't have many friends.

21
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,699
Cheers. To friendship.

22
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,179
Cheers.

23
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:42,778
How are you in Qingshui Town?

24
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,539
I had been wandering around,
and just ended up here.

25
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,378
Qingshui Town
doesn't belong to any kingdom,

26
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:51,539
far from strife.

27
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:53,138
And people here

28
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:56,259
only care about a hand-to-mouth life,

29
00:02:56,658 --> 00:02:57,578
not a prosperous one.

30
00:02:58,138 --> 00:02:59,539
I like this kind of life,

31
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:00,858
so I stayed.

32
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,619
You are quite familiar with
Xiang Liu with Nine Lives, right?

33
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:09,858
Such questions

34
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,539
are not suitable while drinking.

35
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,658
Then drink a few more before answering.

36
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:23,179
Xiang Liu.

37
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:24,819
I fear him,

38
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:26,298
but I don't hate him.

39
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,059
He's not my enemy,

40
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:29,699
but definitely not a friend either.

41
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,179
Xiang Liu is too cunning and suspicious.

42
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,259
Otherwise, I really want to

43
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,378
sit down and have a drink with him.

44
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:44,979
What about you?

45
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:47,899
You and Nian

46
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,699
are just cousins?

47
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,658
This question is quite suitable

48
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:56,979
for discussing over drinks.

49
00:03:58,899 --> 00:03:59,619
Tell me.

50
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:43,979
This is my little sister
Xiaoyao's treasure.

51
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,859
She gave it to me when we parted.

52
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:57,938
She said I could play it temporarily.

53
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:02,498
But

54
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,178
three hundred years have passed.

55
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:13,058
Xiaoyao is the daughter
of my aunt and my master.

56
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,139
She was lost when she was little.

57
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,178
They all said she died,

58
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:27,338
but I always
hold onto a glimmer of hope

59
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:30,618
that she's still alive,

60
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:36,218
and I have been waiting
for her return for her fox tail.

61
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,099
Nian is also my master's daughter.

62
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,739
I pamper her,

63
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,739
just like pampering Xiaoyao.

64
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:34,898
Drink, Xuan.

65
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:39,019
Drink.

66
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,058
Let's sit.

67
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:25,178
Xiaoliu, your pastries.

68
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:32,859
I left in such a hurry
that I forgot my money.

69
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,539
Never mind, Xiaoliu, no need to pay.

70
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:35,539
Consider it my treat.

71
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:36,699
That's not appropriate.

72
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,658
Really no need to pay.

73
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,658
Take it, or else
I won't dare to come next time.

74
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:48,699
Thank you, Xiaoliu.

75
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:49,419
Go ahead.

76
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,699
Why do I always
run into you wherever I go?

77
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,579
Since you bought it, you eat it.

78
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:06,979
Xiaoliu. Shiqi.

79
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:09,058
Xuan.

80
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:10,019
Come on in.

81
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:10,979
Alright.

82
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,259
Xuan.

83
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:23,539
Shall we play?

84
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:24,979
Sure.

85
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,579
You just taught me the other day.
I can't wait to play.

86
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,859
Let's play a round.

87
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,419
I mean him, not you.

88
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,818
You look down on me, huh?

89
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:36,499
I do look down on you a bit.

90
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,099
You take a slow move

91
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:40,179
and like to take back your moves.

92
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,379
Aren't I asking for trouble
to play chess with you?

93
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,778
You could indulge me
for a few rounds, right?

94
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:46,218
How about

95
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,778
playing a round with me?

96
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:50,739
I heard that you excel at
music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

97
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,419
but never got to play with you.

98
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,338
Do I play with him?

99
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:00,939
It's up to you.

100
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,859
None of my business.

101
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:05,218
If you say yes, I'll play.

102
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,658
If you say no, I won't.

103
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,099
I know you two are close,
but playing chess...

104
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,059
Who is close to him?

105
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:25,299
It's none of your business.

106
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,859
Any way, he listens to you.

107
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:35,818
Xiaoliu,

108
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,619
let Shiqi play a round with me.

109
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,059
I have heard his reputation
for a long time,

110
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,379
but never had the chance
to learn from him.

111
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,138
Alright, but I want to play too.

112
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:55,818
Fine.

113
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,179
You move, and he gives advice.

114
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,138
Who's giving advice is still uncertain.

115
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:03,419
Let's play.

116
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:53,539
I heard the wine here is good.

117
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:54,499
Have a few drinks.

118
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:56,939
I've been to this place.

119
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:58,419
Why didn't you call me?

120
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:00,578
The wine is sold out today.

121
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:01,578
Come back tomorrow.

122
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,720
(Sold out)

123
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:04,578
Come back another day.

124
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:05,059
Let's go.

125
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,179
Tomorrow. Tomorrow night.

126
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:09,258
I've been waiting for it.

127
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:16,179
It's your turn.

128
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,739
I think it's better to move here.

129
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:22,099
Alright, then move there.

130
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:26,018
I allow you to take it back.

131
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:28,818
I'll not. I've made up my mind.

132
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,739
You let him move randomly like this?

133
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:31,578
Is it okay?

134
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:35,979
It's okay.

135
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:39,218
Think it over.

136
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:41,898
You really are interesting.

137
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,258
When I want to take back my move,
you don't allow it.

138
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,658
When I don't want to,
you insist on me taking it back.

139
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:52,258
You've messed it up.

140
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:53,258
Fine.

141
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,619
Let's see how many moves you can make.

142
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,859
How about this?

143
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:14,099
You really can
make a silk purse of a sow's ear.

144
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:26,698
No.

145
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:29,379
I want to move here. I like here.

146
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,338
That would be great.

147
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,179
Okay.

148
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:35,218
I suggest you take back your move.

149
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:36,658
No. Absolutely no.

150
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:10,099
Where should I move?

151
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:21,739
Master Qingqiu,
you truly do live up to your reputation.

152
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,379
You managed to save
Xiaoliu's helpless games

153
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,258
over and over again.

154
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:42,979
I lost.

155
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:45,939
Winner treats.

156
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:48,778
I heard that Mr. Stone
will tell a new story today.

157
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:50,099
Let's go enjoy tea and listen to it.

158
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:50,698
Great.

159
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:51,658
Wait!

160
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:53,898
I, the winner, haven't agreed yet.

161
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:55,898
Losers treat. Thank you.

162
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:56,539
All right.

163
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,578
Then let's go. Go.

164
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:31,458
Xuan,

165
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,138
why aren't you happy
even though you won?

166
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:36,898
It is more frustrating than losing.

167
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:39,299
Your lousy chess skills
make me want to die.

168
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:42,059
It's really hard for Shiqi
to save you again and again.

169
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:43,979
If it wasn't for your meddling,

170
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,778
Shiqi could have taken it seriously,
and I might not be able to win.

171
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,179
Did you lose because of my moves?

172
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,179
No. Your moves were good.

173
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,218
It was my fault.

174
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:54,419
Did you hear that?

175
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,619
Make way.

176
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:01,419
Move.

177
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:10,258
Get out of the way.

178
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:19,939
Let's go.

179
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:21,778
Who is in the carriage?

180
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:24,658
It's probably some powerful noble
from a prestigious family.

181
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:27,458
Even the desperadoes in Qingshui Town
don't dare to mess with them.

182
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:30,099
Who is it? So powerful?

183
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,619
Why is there a bow and arrow embroidered
on the curtain of the carriage?

184
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:37,458
That's the family crest
of the Fangfeng Family.

185
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,539
Their archery skills are handed down.

186
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,458
It is said that their ancestors
could shoot down stars.

187
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:44,859
But they have strict family rules.

188
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:46,138
Not every disciple

189
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,018
is allowed to use
the family crest on their equipment,

190
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:50,299
and there seems to be
a strict rule about the size.

191
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,179
That pair of bow and arrow may means

192
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:55,419
that the person in the carriage
boasts superior archery skills.

193
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,258
Fangfeng Family?

194
00:15:57,818 --> 00:15:59,379
Why does it sound so familiar?

195
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,379
Is the person in the carriage

196
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:13,859
the soon-to-be second lady
of the Tushan Family?

197
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:18,658
The carriage has the bow and arrow crest
of the Fangfeng Family,

198
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,419
and also the nine-tailed fox crest
of the Tushan Family.

199
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,859
So, it must be Miss Fangfeng.

200
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,218
Since your fiancée is here,

201
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,778
we won't disturb your reunion.

202
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:43,578
Farewell.

203
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:44,778
Let's go.

204
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:04,338
This Miss Fangfeng

205
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,099
can be regarded as
the most infatuated person in the world.

206
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:10,538
Ten years ago,

207
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,698
Lady of Tushan planned to hold a wedding

208
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:19,019
for the junior master and Miss Fangfeng.

209
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:21,938
They had already distributed
the wedding invitations,

210
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:23,659
but on the eve of the wedding,

211
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:28,178
the junior master of Tushan
suddenly fell seriously ill,

212
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:31,379
so the wedding had to be canceled.

213
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:34,899
The lovers failed to get married.

214
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:38,458
The patriarch of Fangfeng Family
didn't want his daughter to be a widow,

215
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,058
and wanted to cancel the marriage.

216
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:44,298
Miss Fangfeng actually
ran to Qingqiu Hill in her wedding dress

217
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:48,298
and knelt before
the former Lady of Tushan.

218
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,338
She said,

219
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:51,218
"I was born in the Tushan Mansion,"

220
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:52,899
"and will be buried in the Tushan Tomb."

221
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:56,739
"I am willing to serve Lady of Tushan
in place of the junior master."

222
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:59,499
The former Lady of Tushan was moved,

223
00:17:59,499 --> 00:18:01,099
and kept Miss Fangfeng

224
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:02,859
in her own house,

225
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:05,099
and let her assist in internal affairs.

226
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,619
Although because
the junior master was seriously ill,

227
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,499
the former Lady of Tushan
could not really make Miss Fangfeng

228
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,458
her granddaughter-in-law,

229
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,139
she treated her like

230
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:18,739
a beloved granddaughter.

231
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:26,259
Now the junior master has recovered

232
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:28,218
and traveled to Qingshui Town,

233
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,139
and Miss Fangfeng also came along.

234
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,938
The marriage of the two
may be around the corner.

235
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:36,859
There will be another pair of lovers

236
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:40,099
in Dahuang.

237
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:45,379
No wonder Miss Fangfeng
is so adept at archery.

238
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:48,659
She is determined and tenacious
when it comes to the things

239
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:49,779
she aims at.

240
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:50,979
Ture.

241
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:57,499
Why did you take him in?

242
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,379
Didn't you investigate?

243
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:01,338
I did.

244
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,218
I only found out
he was seriously injured,

245
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:05,538
and picked up by you.

246
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,298
As for what kind of serious injuries,
I couldn't find out.

247
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,019
Why are you so concerned about him?

248
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:16,938
The Tushan Family's business
covers the entire Dahuang.

249
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:20,019
He affects the future position
of the Tushan Family,

250
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:23,104
and determines whether
the Family and I are friends or foes.

251
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:25,178
Then you should get close to him.

252
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,619
What are you chatting with me for?

253
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,698
He listens to you.

254
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,899
Comparing chess to major family matters?

255
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,818
He listens to me
because he owes me a life.

256
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:38,619
So he listens when he wants to.

257
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:41,019
True.

258
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,499
You should leave Qingshui Town now.

259
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:48,698
Xiang Liu could appear at any time.

260
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:51,698
It's nothing
if you think Xiang Liu is formidable,

261
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,458
but you shouldn't regard me as too weak.

262
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:00,058
Right, you're powerful.

263
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:01,019
In a one-on-one fight,

264
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,019
I can't rival him.

265
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:04,938
To be precise, I am far behind.

266
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:05,739
But

267
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,739
what I rely on is here.

268
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:13,259
Isn't that just bullying with power,

269
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:14,619
and winning by outnumbering?

270
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,578
I'll make it
only when I have power to rely on,

271
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:17,659
and loyal followers to trust.

272
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,379
Do you think the power
doesn't need to be operated,

273
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:21,859
and followers
don't need to be cultivated?

274
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:27,619
It must have been hard for you.

275
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:31,538
I mean,

276
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:33,938
these years of enhancing power

277
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,218
and cultivating followers

278
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,418
must have been hard.

279
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,538
Not really.

280
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:50,298
You have never seen Miss Fangfeng,

281
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,779
but Miss Fangfeng's affections for you

282
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:54,698
are well known in the entire Dahuang.

283
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:58,659
As Miss Fangfeng is beautiful
and has a good character,

284
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,979
you will surely like her
when you see her, Master.

285
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,178
Master.

286
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:40,058
Miss Fangfeng.

287
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:50,538
A decade ago,
you disappeared out of the blue.

288
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:51,979
We didn't know if you were alive.

289
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:55,418
Grand Madam had been looking for you,

290
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:57,818
and I was distraught as well.

291
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,338
Thank you for your concern.

292
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,139
Fortunately, you came back
safe and sound.

293
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,859
Grand Madam has looked better
since she knew about it.

294
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,418
Now, she is eagerly waiting
for your return to Qingqiu Hill

295
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:11,458
for reunion.

296
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:26,499
Master,

297
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:29,859
what has happened these years?

298
00:22:30,578 --> 00:22:32,418
Why were you unaccounted for
for ten years?

299
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:34,418
Grand Madam said,

300
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:35,739
she wrote to ask you several times,

301
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:38,139
but you did not answer directly.

302
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:40,659
I don't remember.

303
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:51,739
Miss Fangfeng, you may not know

304
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:53,379
when Master recovered his memory,

305
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:54,659
he was at Rejuvenation Hall.

306
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:55,979
He really doesn't remember

307
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,259
what exactly happened

308
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,938
during the previous years.

309
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:08,178
It is said that
you were seriously injured.

310
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:09,659
What kind of injuries?

311
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:12,979
Maybe, we can know some clues from it.

312
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,099
I don't remember.

313
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:21,259
Water under the bridge.

314
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:22,859
Let bygones be bygones.

315
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,019
That's right.

316
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,899
The past doesn't matter.

317
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:33,259
What matters is
to live well in the future.

318
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:40,099
Miss Fangfeng, you are right.

319
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:43,458
Master, Miss Fangfeng likes archery.

320
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:46,298
You can design weapons
for Miss Fangfeng in the future.

321
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,218
Miss Fangfeng likes sightseeing,

322
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:51,499
and you are good at painting landscapes.

323
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,499
What's more, Miss Fangfeng
is good at playing chess as well.

324
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:55,218
Jing Ye,

325
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:58,019
as Miss Fangfeng
has been traveling all the way,

326
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,139
she must be tired.

327
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:01,499
You should take her back to rest.

328
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,218
Master, you are thoughtful.

329
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:10,899
Miss Fangfeng,

330
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,379
please follow me to your bedroom
and have a rest.

331
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:21,739
I'll take my leave.

332
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:35,578
Master,

333
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,418
just call me Yiying in the future.

334
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:41,019
We are a family.
No need to be so distant.

335
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,818
Grand Madam is senior and frail now.

336
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,859
She likes to see us younger generation

337
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:47,739
being close and friendly.

338
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,099
Miss Fangfeng, please follow me.

339
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:15,619
(All forgotten.)

340
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,899
(Does he really forget,)

341
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:20,979
(or is he holding back
and waiting for other plans?)

342
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:29,338
You clumsy. Be careful.

343
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:30,979
Yes.

344
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:39,379
Miss, this is the best bow in Dahuang.

345
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:42,859
Master made efforts
to find phoenix bones and tendons,

346
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:45,218
and had the best craftsman
from the Jintian Family

347
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:46,379
specially make it for you.

348
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:48,938
Even if you cut it with a sword,
it won't leave a scratch.

349
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:12,659
(I agreed with what you said last time.)

350
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,019
(I will cooperate with you then.)

(Mr. Lirong)

358
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,619
It's been a long time.

359
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:21,499
What brings you here today?

360
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:26,859
I want to ask you something.

361
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:32,379
What's it? Say it.

362
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:38,400
How much do you
know about poisonous bugs?

363
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,818
Why are you suddenly asking about them?

364
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:46,418
Recently, I met a poisonous bug.

365
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:48,578
It's very strange.

366
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:52,099
It can make the receiver suffer
the same pain as the one who places it.

367
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:54,578
Conversely,

368
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:56,938
if the receiver is injured,

369
00:27:58,139 --> 00:27:59,818
it has no effect
on the one who places it.

370
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,859
But the one who places it
can neither control the bug at will,

371
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,058
nor recall it.

372
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,739
Is the one who places the bug a girl?

373
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:11,338
Why are you asking this?

374
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:14,619
If it really is a girl,

375
00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:17,099
it's likely

376
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,979
a pair of couple poisonous bugs

377
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:20,619
planted for her lover.

378
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:26,099
Couple poisonous bugs?

379
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:30,259
Rumor has it that
couple poisonous bugs are hard to raise.

380
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:34,338
If the male and the female
enjoy equal power,

381
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:38,298
the one who places them
won't be able to control the bugs.

382
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:15,739
Wen Xiaoliu, who are you making
that long face for?

383
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,178
Apart from yourself, who would pity you?

384
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,298
In this world, whoever leaves,

385
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:22,779
life can go on as usual.

386
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:30,659
W-When did you come over?

387
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,259
When you were thinking about someone.

388
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,979
I was just thinking

389
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:38,538
when you would
come to get medicine from me?

390
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:42,739
It seems I came at the right time.

391
00:29:59,178 --> 00:30:01,058
You should go and rest earlier.
I'll clean them up.

392
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,578
It's okay. It'll be done soon.

393
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:24,058
Protect Lord!

394
00:30:44,032 --> 00:30:44,899
Protect Nian.

395
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:46,538
Whatever happens,
don't let her leave the room.

396
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:47,139
Yes.

397
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:22,659
You're not going to
throw me down from here, are you?

398
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:25,779
No.

399
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:31,859
That's good.

400
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,659
What about I use you as a cushion?

401
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:43,698
No! No!

402
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:15,058
My Lord, watch out!

403
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,298
My Lord!

404
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:29,619
Mission completed.

405
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:32,258
You will share half the credit
and a great reward.

406
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:22,619
If you want to kill me,

407
00:36:22,899 --> 00:36:23,818
do it quickly.

408
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:27,778
You only have one head.

409
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:29,659
You can only die once.

410
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,578
If you only die once,

411
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:34,338
this is too easy for you.

412
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:42,099
Does it hurt?

413
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:44,939
Xuan will hurt.

414
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:54,818
You really have nine brains,

415
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,578
but not a single heart.

416
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,258
Still worrying about the other.

417
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:01,298
It means you are fine.

418
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:04,058
The poisonous bugs are not bad,

419
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,216
but they can only make Xuan feel pain.

420
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:16,778
If you kill me
and Xuan will die accordingly,

421
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:19,058
you would kill me
without hesitation, right?

422
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:23,899
Too bad,

423
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,144
I won't.

424
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,219
Is Xuan all right?

425
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:50,099
Don't worry.

426
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:51,859
I'm fine.

427
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:55,778
Princess, don't worry.

428
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,099
Fortunately, Jun Yi pushed Lord away.

429
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:01,058
As long as the bleeding is stopped,
there shouldn't be any major problems.

430
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:11,298
Strange.

431
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:13,338
I applied hemostatic medicine.

432
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:14,899
Why can't it stop bleeding?

433
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,538
B-But why

434
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:32,899
is he still bleeding?

435
00:38:33,498 --> 00:38:34,939
Hasn't he already been treated?

436
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:41,058
Xuan.

437
00:38:49,978 --> 00:38:52,018
My Lord, hold on.

438
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:05,578
Since you care about Xuan so much,

439
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:08,219
why don't you remove the bugs?

440
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:14,099
Do you think I don't want?

441
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:15,778
I can't.

442
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,578
I have been trying to
recall the bugs from his body,

443
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,379
but I failed.

444
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,419
You are a demon.

445
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:43,498
Demons and bugs must be friends.

446
00:39:44,578 --> 00:39:45,899
So you must have some understanding

447
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:47,298
of the poisonous bugs, right?

448
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:08,939
If you don't want to die,

449
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:11,818
don't recall the bugs by force.

450
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:14,498
The only method

451
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:17,498
is to lure the bugs
to someone else's body

452
00:40:18,058 --> 00:40:19,058
to scourge someone else.

453
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:24,139
The only one I want to scourge is you.

454
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:38,578
The only one you want to scourge is me?

455
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:49,298
I will kill Xuan
before he leaves Qingshui Town,

456
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:52,338
so you don't have to
worry about how to solve it.

457
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,379
Can you restore Chenrong by killing him?

458
00:40:59,058 --> 00:40:59,578
No.

459
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:02,496
Has Xuan ever been to the battlefield
and killed the soldiers of Chenrong?

460
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:03,379
No.

461
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,376
Do you have
a personal grudge against Xuan?

462
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:07,699
No either.

463
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:10,459
Then why do you want to kill him
since neither of the above is true?

464
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,419
Just because he is
the grandson of the King of Xiyang?

465
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:16,832
It's a matter of position.

466
00:41:19,498 --> 00:41:21,459
Now that I know
the grandson of the King of Xiyang

467
00:41:21,498 --> 00:41:22,899
is around me,

468
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:25,179
if I don't kill him,

469
00:41:26,538 --> 00:41:28,128
it seems that
I will have a terrible conscience.

470
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:31,818
Do you still have a conscience?

471
00:41:35,978 --> 00:41:38,139
I do have a bit for Chenrong.

472
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:42,459
Ridiculous.

473
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:48,538
Yes, it is.

474
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,578
So much so that I feel pitiful myself.

475
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,219
If I didn't have this bit of conscience,

476
00:41:57,899 --> 00:41:58,538
maybe,

477
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:01,778
I would really go
and talk to the King of Xiyang,

478
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,179
and help him destroy Haoling.

479
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:13,179
I wonder what kind of person
Hong Jiang really is

480
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:16,778
that he could make you, a demon,
grow a conscience.

481
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:20,258
He's a fool.

482
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,058
A pitiful fool.

483
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:28,538
Leading a group of fools

484
00:42:30,058 --> 00:42:31,419
to do pitiful things.

485
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:35,738
I think the biggest fool is you.

486
00:42:35,738 --> 00:42:36,939
You are the fool.

487
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:38,459
You are the most pathetic.

488
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:39,899
They are not fools.

489
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,219
They do these things willingly.

490
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:45,699
They firmly believe
they can console their ancestors,

491
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:47,219
and be accountable to their descendants.

492
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:50,498
When they die, they are resolute and passionate,
full of righteous indignation.

493
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:52,859
Unlike you,

494
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:55,018
who despise it while doing it.

495
00:42:58,978 --> 00:43:00,298
I have nine heads, you know.

496
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:03,219
So I'm always
a bit complex and contradictory.

497
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:08,298
Didn't you always say

498
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:09,538
that you hate it when others

499
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:11,419
call you a nine-headed monster?

500
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:13,619
The nine heads are your taboo.

501
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,859
Whoever mentions it, you will kill them.

502
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:16,778
But you are still alive.

503
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:19,179
For now.

504
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:30,379
What I hate

505
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:33,139
is not them talking about me
being a nine-headed monster,

506
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:36,338
but their underlying contempt.

507
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:41,139
I allow you to mention it

508
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:42,379
because...

509
00:43:49,856 --> 00:43:51,738
Because you make fun in your mouth,

510
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:53,498
but in your heart,

511
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:57,659
you never thought
that a nine-headed demon is weird.

512
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:08,099
I used to be weirder than you.

513
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:18,498
So you hid in the deep mountains,

514
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:20,219
and dared not see anyone.
