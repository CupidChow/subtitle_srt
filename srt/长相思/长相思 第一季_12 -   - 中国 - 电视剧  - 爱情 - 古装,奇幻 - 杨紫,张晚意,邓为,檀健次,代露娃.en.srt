00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,760
=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:36,448
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:41,242
So you hide here.

4
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:26,322
Are we having a heart-to-heart talk
under the moon,

5
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:28,201
trying to get along?

6
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,962
Before you irritate me again,

7
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:38,082
I suppose we are.

8
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,201
What a pity.

9
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:46,082
Harmonious moments are always short.

10
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:49,921
Beautiful things never last long.

11
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,201
Who once said

12
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:58,001
no matter how beautiful the view is,

13
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,121
it will become dull

14
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,602
if we watch it for too long?

15
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,121
The person who said that must be sleepy.

16
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:07,522
I'm going to sleep.

17
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:06,442
Didn't you say it was not serious?

18
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,281
Why is he still bleeding?

19
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,481
They did something to the wooden arrow.

20
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,201
I've done my best,

21
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,402
but I couldn't find the cause.

22
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:16,562
Isn't Wen Xiaoliu good at poison?

23
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:17,802
Why not ask him for help?

24
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:19,802
Yes.

25
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,522
I'll go find him right now.

26
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,282
Nian.

27
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:27,921
My Lord.

28
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,921
It's a common wooden arrow,

29
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:31,842
but the archer's skills are good.

30
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:34,242
The strength and technique are unusual.

31
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,041
I guess

32
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:38,761
only Fangfeng Yiying can do it

33
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,441
in Qingshui Town.

34
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,722
Even if it's not her,

35
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,842
it's probably related
to the Fangfeng Family.

36
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,522
I'll ask them for hemostatic drugs.

37
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:50,761
No matter what,

38
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,361
they wouldn't dare to act against you.

39
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:59,122
The Fangfeng Family

40
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:01,722
is not a concern.

41
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:05,641
But behind them is the Tushan Family.

42
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:10,161
Even my grandfather and master
had to be wary of the Four Great Clans.

43
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,082
Without evidence,

44
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,402
don't act rashly.

45
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:16,761
So what are we going to do now?

46
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:18,361
If the bleeding doesn't stop,

47
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:19,682
you're likely to die.

48
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:24,002
We can't ask Fangfeng Yiying for drugs,

49
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:27,122
but we can
ask Tushan Jing to secretly get it.

50
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:29,082
Secretly?

51
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:30,722
Jun Yi.

52
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:33,481
When Wen Xiaoliu is here,

53
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:38,242
it's good if he agrees
to help me get the antidote.

54
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:39,881
But if he doesn't,

55
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,481
stab him with the wooden arrow

56
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,161
to make him bleed.

57
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:48,802
Tushan Jing

58
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,881
won't watch him die.

59
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:55,321
So he will ask Fangfeng Yiying
for the antidote.

60
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,321
At that time,

61
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,562
send someone

62
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:02,161
to snatch the antidote.

63
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,161
Yes.

64
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,761
Xiaoliu, someone is looking for you.

65
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:17,402
Go away.

66
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,064
Xiaoliu.

67
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,601
I told you to get out.

68
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,441
Come with me.

69
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,641
I'll give you a lot of money.

70
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,641
What are you doing here?

71
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:28,722
You think I want to be here?

72
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,481
I'm here to ask you to save Xuan.

73
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,321
What happened to him?

74
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,161
He...

75
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:36,402
H-He got injured.

76
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:37,562
The physician tried many methods

77
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:38,682
but couldn't stop the bleeding.

78
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,722
(So, Xiang Liu was trying
to kill Xuan last night.)

79
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:54,842
So, are you coming or not?

80
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:03,921
Xuan.

81
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:06,161
Any better?

82
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:08,481
Nian, don't be sad.

83
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,041
I'm fine.

84
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:13,242
Don't cry.

85
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:15,441
Don't cry.

86
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,201
Stop crying.

87
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:25,082
Hey, move.

88
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:26,641
Why?

89
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,601
I need to check the wound.

90
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:30,041
Why else would you get me here?

91
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:33,402
Right.

92
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,082
Be gentle.

93
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:56,041
Strange.

94
00:07:56,682 --> 00:07:58,881
It didn't hit any vital parts,
and there's no poison.

95
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,242
Why are you still bleeding?

96
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:03,201
Can you do it or not?

97
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:05,082
You claim to be highly skilled
in poisons.

98
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:06,722
But I think you use your poison
to bully people.

99
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,522
Nian.

100
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:10,082
You haven't slept all night.

101
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:12,802
Go and get some rest.

102
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:15,601
Now.

103
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:20,321
Miss.

104
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:21,802
Master cares about you the most.

105
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:23,562
If you keep crying here,

106
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,722
he won't focus on the treatment.

107
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:26,722
Let's go.

108
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:39,681
Where's the arrow?

109
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,704
Here it is.

110
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:43,922
Thank you.

111
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:45,761
I've examined it.

112
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:48,321
It's indeed a very common arrow.

113
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:54,042
The moment this arrow
pierced your chest,

114
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:55,162
what did you feel?

115
00:08:58,241 --> 00:08:59,922
At that moment,

116
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,082
my body ached,

117
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:05,681
and my chest hurt like being stifled.

118
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,121
I couldn't breathe,

119
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:09,681
and move.

120
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,201
And I felt cold.

121
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,962
I felt a chill creep over me.

122
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:22,801
I know it. It's Ice Crystal.

123
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:26,922
Destroy them along with the box.

124
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:30,681
M-Miss.

125
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,241
They are Ice Crystals.

126
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:35,282
It's a rare and valuable treasure.

127
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:37,001
Do you think I care about such things?

128
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,441
Yes.

129
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,082
I was sorry.

130
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:42,681
The Tushan Family is rich and powerful,

131
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:45,922
possessing various treasures in Dahuang.

132
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:48,082
The Master deeply loves you.

133
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,962
Even if you want
to throw them away like a stone,

134
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:51,241
he won't blame you.

135
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:52,962
What if someone asks you

136
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:54,602
what I was doing last night?

137
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,602
After a long journey
to meet the junior master,

138
00:09:58,602 --> 00:09:59,402
you felt tired.

139
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:01,962
So, after dinner, you went to bed early.

140
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:04,121
I was guarding outside,

141
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,962
and you slept the whole night.

142
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:07,441
You drank some water at midnight.

143
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:10,201
Good.

144
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,121
The iceberg in the Far North

145
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,761
can generate Ice Crystals,

146
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,282
as clear as gemstones,

147
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,842
but harder than stone.

148
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:23,922
And they emit extremely cold air.

149
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:25,522
Hold on.

150
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,922
You mean someone used a special method

151
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:34,402
to coat a common wooden arrow

152
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:35,842
with a layer of Ice Crystal?

153
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,042
The Ice Crystal melted
when touching blood,

154
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:41,001
so nothing weird could be noticed?

155
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:42,881
Pretty much.

156
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,001
There must be some special medicine

157
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,801
in the Ice Crystal.

158
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:02,042
So after the Ice Crystal melted,

159
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,042
this stuff spreads around your wound,

160
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,522
making your wound can't heal

161
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:07,522
and the blood can't stop.

162
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,402
What kind of medicine?

163
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,561
What's the antidote?

164
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:12,162
I don't know.

165
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,842
After so much talking,

166
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,881
you tell me you don't know?

167
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:18,602
Sang.

168
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:21,321
He was just worried about me.

169
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:23,761
That's why he was rude.

170
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:25,482
Please forgive him.

171
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,121
Although I don't know

172
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,522
what is making the wound can't heal,

173
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:34,201
and I don't know what the antidote is,

174
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,241
I do know

175
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,082
all darkness

176
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,042
will disappear under the sun.

177
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:41,761
The Tanggu water
contains the power of the sun,

178
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,881
pure and clean,
and nothing can grow in it.

179
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:45,042
Everything

180
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:47,681
can be cleaned with it.

181
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:50,962
But Tanggu is thousands of miles away.

182
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:53,241
I'm afraid I would have bled out

183
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:55,042
before I can get there.

184
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:57,922
I have a method.

185
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:00,522
Place the Ice Crystal in your wound,

186
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,362
using the extreme cold of it

187
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,042
to coagulate your blood.

188
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,001
It can slow the flow.

189
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,201
However, the Ice Crystal

190
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:08,881
is generated
from the ice of thousands of years.

191
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,321
So, you will feel frozen.

192
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:12,162
It doesn't matter.

193
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:15,362
But where can we find the Ice Crystal?

194
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:18,001
I have a way.

195
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,962
Xuan, wait for me. I will be back soon.

196
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:20,681
Xiaoliu.

197
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:25,962
Put your hand down.

198
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:30,282
Are you going
to ask Tushan Jing for help?

199
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:32,001
Yes.

200
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:34,482
I know you're close to him,

201
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:37,001
but that's just a personal relationship.

202
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,282
Compared with family interests,

203
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:39,561
personal relationships are nothing.

204
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,362
I don't think you can get it.

205
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,201
Don't worry.

206
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:47,722
I'm going to steal, not to take.

207
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:50,282
I once saw ice crystal wind chimes

208
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:51,761
under their eaves.

209
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,248
The refined Ice Crystals

210
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:54,402
are better for your wounds.

211
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,681
Actually, this is all my business.

212
00:12:57,681 --> 00:12:59,282
It has nothing to do with you.

213
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:02,001
You don't have to go to such trouble.

214
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:04,962
Without the poisonous bug in your body,

215
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,801
you might not have been hit
by the arrow.

216
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,482
This happened because of me.

217
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,121
So it does have something to do with me.

218
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:11,722
I'll be right back.

219
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:57,761
Jing told me you saved his life.

220
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,561
Thank you for that.

221
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,602
Please, Miss Fangfeng.

222
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:05,201
May I ask

223
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:06,241
where Master Qingqiu is now?

224
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:07,962
Someone is getting him.

225
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:10,121
I was doing something in the hall,

226
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:11,321
so I was told ahead of him.

227
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,001
I was afraid of keeping you waiting,

228
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:14,121
so I got here immediately.

229
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,602
You don't have to, Miss Fangfeng.

230
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,441
Master Qingqiu and I are friends.

231
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:19,922
I can go find him directly.

232
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:26,722
(Miss Fangfeng seems kind and weak,)

233
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,201
(as if the wind could blow her down.)

234
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:31,162
(Could she)

235
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,482
(do such a vicious thing?)

236
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,321
(Why would she try to kill Cang Xuan?)

237
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:38,001
(Does Shiqi know?)

238
00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:01,641
I've never seen so many flowers.

239
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:02,561
It's my first time.

240
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:04,121
I don't know their varieties.

241
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:06,842
W-What is that? What is it?

242
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:08,522
It's cymbidium.

243
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:11,162
And this one?

244
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:13,241
This is azalea.

245
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,761
It's beautiful.

246
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,082
This room looks good.

247
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:29,162
He will be here soon.

248
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,201
Alright.

249
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:41,801
Jing, he is looking for you.

250
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:44,121
Since he's your friend,

251
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:45,042
so I brought him here.

252
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,842
I have something to talk with Xiaoliu.

253
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:51,602
Please leave us alone.

254
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:55,121
Alright.

255
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,282
I'll go prepare the food.

256
00:15:57,962 --> 00:15:58,962
It's all your favorite.

257
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:06,082
Thank you.

258
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:19,522
You're looking for?

259
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,042
I'll tell you the truth.

260
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,962
I want to ask you for something.

261
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:23,641
Okay.

262
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:26,681
You can give me anything?

263
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,001
You can take whatever I have.

264
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:33,282
If I don't have what you want,
I'll help you find it.

265
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,402
I want two ice crystal wind chimes.

266
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:39,362
Jing Ye.

267
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:47,680
Get two ice crystal wind chimes.

268
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:49,881
Yes.

269
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,760
(I know you're close to him,)

270
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,352
(but that's just
a personal relationship.)

271
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,042
(Compared with family interests,
personal relationships are nothing.)

272
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,681
I want you...

273
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:10,882
I want...

274
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:15,242
Well,

275
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,281
under any circumstances,

276
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,041
you must not harm Xuan.

277
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:27,441
Alright.

278
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:31,441
You agreed?

279
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,842
I've promised I'll do what you say.

280
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,722
Whatever you want me to do,

281
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:37,321
I'll do my best.

282
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:40,521
(It seems Shiqi is completely unaware)

283
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,762
(of Fangfeng Yiying's attempt
to assassinate Cang Xuan.)

284
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:47,882
Jing Ye.

285
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,161
Miss Yiying.

286
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,122
Is Physician Liu still here?

287
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:58,041
He is.

288
00:17:58,624 --> 00:17:59,602
He once saved Master.

289
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:01,122
Master treated him very well.

290
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:04,681
Jing values friendship.

291
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,521
He must be grateful to Physician Liu.

292
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,482
What is Physician Liu here for?

293
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:10,722
He looked anxious to see Jing.

294
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:13,122
He is just a physician.

295
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:14,801
What could happen to him?

296
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:19,602
Perhaps, during his last visit,

297
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:21,281
he liked the wind chimes
hanging under the eaves.

298
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:23,321
So, he's here
to ask for the wind chimes.

299
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,962
Give him the wind chimes now.

300
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,002
Yes.

301
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,401
Physician Liu.

302
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:39,041
I've put two wind chimes in the box.

303
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,521
The Ice Crystal pieces
have been tempered,

304
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,201
and the coldness has greatly weakened.

305
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:45,082
In case you might have other uses,

306
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:46,801
I also put in two Ice Crystals.

307
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,602
If you don't have enough spirit power,

308
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,281
never use your hands to pick them up,

309
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,921
or it will freeze your fingers.

310
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:54,762
I know. Thank you, Miss Jing Ye.

311
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,321
Don't be angry, beauty.

312
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:02,401
I'm leaving now.

313
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:05,760
Master, he touched me.

314
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:07,201
Alright.

315
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:07,882
I...

316
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:08,882
Show me a shortcut.

317
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,602
- Let's go from the back door. Let's go.
- No.

318
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:11,762
Come on.

319
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,561
His command is my command.

320
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:14,362
Do as he says.

321
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,321
Go.

322
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:17,842
How to take a shortcut?

323
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:21,482
Come on. Beauty.

324
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,441
You have a temper. Lead the way.

325
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:26,722
Go.

326
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:40,561
Hold on.

327
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,041
It works. The blood stopped.

328
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,882
Xuan, we'll set off.

329
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:15,921
Let's get back to Tanggu.

330
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:18,762
Okay.

331
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:21,161
You guys pack up now.

332
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:38,602
Xiaoliu.

333
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,441
I'm afraid I won't come back

334
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,921
after leaving Qingshui Town.

335
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:52,521
There are too many people
trying to kill you here.

336
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,161
You shouldn't come back.

337
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:00,722
You promised me

338
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,521
to help me remove the poisonous bug

339
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:06,521
before l leave Qingshui Town.

340
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,441
Why don't you come with me?

341
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,401
With your intelligence and talent,

342
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:14,561
you can make a name for yourself.

343
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,681
But I want to stay.

344
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,681
I like being a physician.

345
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:26,362
I promised you,

346
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:27,962
but your wound hasn't healed yet.

347
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:29,242
I dare not act rashly.

348
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,401
When your wound is healed,

349
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,801
I'll write you the method
of removing the poisonous bug.

350
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:34,762
You have many talented men
under your command.

351
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,762
I'm sure they can help you.

352
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:40,602
Everyone has their own ambitions.

353
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:43,762
I won't force you then.

354
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:48,002
Take care.

355
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:53,362
Farewell.

356
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:56,041
Take care.

May you get everything

you wish for.

368
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:54,962
My Lord, the poisonous bug
has not been removed.

369
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,401
You just let Wen Xiaoliu go like this?

370
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,362
He said he would help me remove it
after my injury heals.

371
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:04,362
No matter what his real intention is,

372
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:07,561
after all, he saved me twice.

373
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:09,561
What if Wen Xiaoliu

374
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,242
acts against you again?

375
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,321
No matter how big the favor is,

376
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,962
I'll repay and owe nothing to him.

377
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:57,962
I heard Xuan got better.

378
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:00,962
Did you save him?

379
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:06,722
I'm a physician.

380
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,561
Xuan came to me.

381
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:12,321
I-I am a nobody.

382
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,002
I don't dare to offend anyone.

383
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:15,521
He was in danger twice.

384
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,281
You saved him twice.

385
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:20,842
Are you a nobody?

386
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:24,242
How about a drink?

387
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:37,801
Anything is bothering you?

388
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:42,921
I was thinking
about how to remove the poisonous bug

389
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,161
from Xuan.

390
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:47,321
I've told you.

391
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:49,722
Find another person,

392
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:51,801
and lure the poisonous bug into him.

393
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:54,602
But who would take it?

394
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:57,201
Maybe

395
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:58,801
one of Xuan's subordinates would.

396
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,762
Not anyone can do it.

397
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:03,921
Why?

398
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,161
You raised the poisonous bug.

399
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,561
You don't know why?

400
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:17,921
I don't know.

401
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:21,561
Where did you get the poisonous bug?

402
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:24,362
Many years ago,

403
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:27,242
I met a dying old woman.

404
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,642
She was dirty and smelly,

405
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:31,642
so I gave her a bath.

406
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,041
I cleaned her up nicely

407
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:36,161
and sent her to meet her lover.

408
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:39,362
She gave me a walnut as a reward,

409
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,401
and inside it was a pair
of poisonous bugs.

410
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:44,122
But I haven't used them for many years.

411
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,002
Finally, you planned to use it on me.

412
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:50,602
I made a mistake.

413
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,201
Now it's used on Xuan.

414
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,201
How did you know how to raise them?

415
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:01,842
The old woman told me.

416
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:06,321
Nonsense.

417
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:09,122
If she told you that,

418
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:11,642
how come she didn't tell you
what they were called?

419
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,482
Anyway, I know.

420
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:14,801
It's none of your business.

421
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:22,321
Your poisonous bugs are indeed rare.

422
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:24,842
I have told you before.

423
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:27,002
The only way
to remove the poisonous bug

424
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:28,576
from Xuan is

425
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,401
to lure it into another person.

426
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,842
So,

427
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,362
what kind of person

428
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:50,242
would meet this condition?

429
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:54,762
Couple poisonous bugs?

430
00:26:56,362 --> 00:27:00,681
They're extremely difficult to raise.

431
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,242
One is male,
and the other is female, equal in power.

432
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:08,321
The raiser cannot
control the poisonous bug.

433
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:12,762
Mostly, women raise it for their lovers,

434
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:15,441
hoping for eternal

435
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:16,842
and loyal love.

436
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:18,161
Once planted,

437
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:21,321
the couple will live and die together.

438
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:24,921
So, it's also called love poisonous bug.

439
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:26,882
Will it work if there's no love

440
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:29,762
between the couple?

441
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:31,962
No, it won't.

442
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,201
However,

443
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:41,642
the magic is mysteriously unpredictable.

444
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:43,681
Perhaps it's possible.

445
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:46,002
Yet, even so,

446
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:48,281
it will lead to endless troubles.

447
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:50,602
The couple couldn't live together.

448
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:53,242
They might be killed

449
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:55,321
by the poisonous bugs.

450
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:57,681
How to remove it?

451
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:00,842
The planting of it relies on affection,

452
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:03,482
and so does the removal of it.

453
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,161
If it hasn't been planted for long,

454
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,041
and it's not yet stable,

455
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:11,441
it could possibly be transferred
to another person.

456
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:12,896
But this person

457
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,842
must have love in his heart.

458
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:19,161
The love poisonous bug

459
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:22,681
demands not only your life
but also your heart.

460
00:28:23,362 --> 00:28:25,002
You have nine lives,

461
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:28,242
but you only have one heart.

462
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,401
Once you give your heart,

463
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:32,762
you can never take it back.

464
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:34,762
Tell me.

465
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:35,882
What kind of person

466
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,321
meets the conditions?

467
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:40,642
I have no idea.

468
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,642
Are you eligible?

469
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:50,041
You're a nine-headed demon.

470
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:52,161
You should be able to

471
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:54,041
lure the poisonous bug out, right?

472
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,041
You said it.

473
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,281
You're a nine-headed demon.

474
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:01,321
Any pain on me

475
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,041
would be nothing to you.

476
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:05,242
Can you do me a favor

477
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:07,482
and lure the poisonous bug into you?

478
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:08,882
Please.

479
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:10,161
Please.

480
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:11,962
Please.

481
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,441
I can help you,

482
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:21,362
but you have to promise

483
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:24,801
you'll help me
with one thing in the future.

484
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:27,362
As soon as I say it,

485
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:29,842
you can't refuse.

486
00:29:32,362 --> 00:29:33,482
You can't take Xuan's life.

487
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:35,681
Alright.

488
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:38,082
You can't harm Tushan Jing.

489
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:41,921
Alright.

490
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,122
You're not going to ask me

491
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:47,201
to kill the King of Xiyan
or King of Haoling, right?

492
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,882
I must be out of my nine minds

493
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,242
to think you could

494
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,441
kill both of them.

495
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:54,681
So, your answer is?

496
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:58,642
No.

497
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:01,362
Deal.

498
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:07,762
I swear.

499
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,161
As long as Xiang Liu helps me
lure the poisonous bug

500
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:11,321
from Xuan into himself,

501
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,161
I will do one thing for him.

502
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:17,521
If you break this oath...

503
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:20,722
I will be dead.

504
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,602
Never mind.

505
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:26,962
A mean man like you won't be satisfied.

506
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:29,882
You tell me how to swear.

507
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:31,242
If you break the oath,

508
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:33,722
all your pleasures

509
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:35,801
will turn into pain,

510
00:30:37,321 --> 00:30:38,362
and all your happiness

511
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:40,921
will turn into sorrow.

512
00:30:54,882 --> 00:30:55,842
Well played.

513
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,281
Alright, I swear.

514
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:02,082
If I break this oath,

515
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:04,041
all my pleasures

516
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:05,801
will turn into pain,

517
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:07,642
and all my happiness

518
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:09,321
will turn into sorrow.

519
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:18,082
Don't worry. I'll keep my promise.

520
00:31:20,882 --> 00:31:22,201
What do I have to worry about?

521
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,842
If you can't do it, you will suffer,

522
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:26,842
not me.

523
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:29,482
Well,

524
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,082
here's one more thing.

525
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:35,762
If I lure the poisonous bug out,

526
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:39,482
you can't be too far from Xuan.

527
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:41,882
Otherwise,
I won't be able to control it.

528
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:44,882
Right now, you're a bit too far away.

529
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:47,122
So, we need to go
to the Wushen Mountain in Haoling.

530
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,082
Of course, I know.

531
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:50,441
Given your current situation,

532
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:52,002
it might be difficult for you.

533
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:55,281
Wushen Mountain?

534
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,882
You just promised me.

535
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,002
Please.

536
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:58,882
Please.

537
00:31:59,082 --> 00:31:59,921
Please.

538
00:32:10,482 --> 00:32:11,242
Here.

539
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:15,648
Okay.

540
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:21,082
Take the medicine as prescribed.

541
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:23,762
Two doses a day, seven days in a row.
You will be fine.

542
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,521
Thank you, doctor.

543
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:27,362
You're welcome.

544
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:34,561
Shiqi.

545
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:36,882
What brought you here?

546
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:41,242
Mr. Yu asked me to bring some wine
and snacks to Xiaoliu.

547
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:43,281
Where's Xiaoliu?

548
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:44,401
He has left.

549
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:45,521
What?

550
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:47,122
He left?

551
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:48,401
Where did he go?

552
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:49,882
How could you let him leave?

553
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,921
No, he will be back.

554
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:54,722
He went out for something.

555
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:55,681
He'll be back soon.

556
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:56,521
You can wait here.

557
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:21,002
The Wushen Mountain
is where King of Haoling resides.

558
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:22,441
It's heavily guarded.

559
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:25,041
If we fly in,

560
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,201
we will be discovered.

561
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:27,882
What should we do?

562
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:31,362
We'll go by sea.

563
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:33,681
By sea?

564
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,842
I guess we could avoid the guards.

565
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:54,080
(Haoling, Sea Area of Wushen Mountain)

566
00:34:07,242 --> 00:34:09,281
We've reached the sea area
of Wushen Mountain.

567
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:12,721
You can try to lure the bug out.

568
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,184
You apply to the other half.

569
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:48,961
Relax.

570
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,442
If possible,

571
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:52,842
please be happy in silence,

572
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,321
and welcome the poisonous bug.

573
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:56,202
Close your eyes.

574
00:34:58,761 --> 00:34:59,321
Oh, I'll.

575
00:35:02,082 --> 00:35:04,041
(The love poisonous bug)

576
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:07,402
(demands not only your life
but also your heart.)

577
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:10,122
(You have nine lives,)

578
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:13,202
(but you only have one heart.)

579
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:15,402
(Once you give your heart,)

580
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:17,761
(you can never take it back.)

581
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,880
(Haoling, Wushen Mountain, Huayin Hall)

582
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:40,961
But you will grow up.

583
00:35:41,362 --> 00:35:43,442
You'll make a living and start a family.

584
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:47,202
Then you have to leave Zhaoyun Peak

585
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:49,001
and me.

586
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:53,721
We won't ever be parted

587
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,882
as long as I'm your little sister.

588
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:58,682
Alright, you're my little sister.

589
00:35:58,682 --> 00:36:00,281
And I'm your big brother forever.

590
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:02,561
(No matter what,
we'll be together forever.)

591
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
(Deal. Together forever.)

592
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,976
(We will never be parted.)

593
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:07,961
(Deal.)

594
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:12,281
What's wrong with you?

595
00:36:13,642 --> 00:36:14,922
Could it be the poisonous bug?

596
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:17,922
Wen Xiaoliu doesn't keep his word.

597
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:19,481
He hasn't brought the antidote yet.

598
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:20,721
I'll go find him.

599
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:24,602
It has been removed.

600
00:36:26,402 --> 00:36:27,162
Really?

601
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:42,801
Congratulations.

602
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:47,202
Your Highness.

603
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:49,281
What's the matter?

604
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:52,882
Nothing.

605
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:56,842
Just a dream.

606
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:34,801
It entered your body so quickly.

607
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:42,922
How dare you manipulate it.

608
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:45,241
The best bug manipulators

609
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:47,961
can take lives
from thousands of miles away.

610
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:51,402
Did you think the poisonous bugs

611
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:53,001
will slowly climb
over mountains like you?

612
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:57,561
Where is my walnut?

613
00:37:59,082 --> 00:37:59,882
Where is it?

614
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,080
Did you steal it?

615
00:38:08,602 --> 00:38:10,241
It's weird.

616
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:12,761
I have a bad feeling.

617
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:15,682
I think this poisonous bug
isn't as simple as I thought.

618
00:38:16,481 --> 00:38:17,682
Why?

619
00:38:18,842 --> 00:38:19,362
I don't know.

620
00:38:19,682 --> 00:38:21,521
I don't feel anything unusual
in my body.

621
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:22,721
How about you?

622
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,442
Do you feel uncomfortable?

623
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:29,001
I think

624
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:31,241
we should run.
