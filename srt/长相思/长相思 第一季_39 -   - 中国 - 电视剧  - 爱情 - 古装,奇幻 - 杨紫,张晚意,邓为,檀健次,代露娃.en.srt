2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,527
=Episode 39=

3
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:40,724
Alright, put me down.

4
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:41,645
I can do it.

5
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:43,645
Come on.

6
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:44,724
Put me down.

7
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:50,005
Alright.

8
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:51,325
You better leave.

9
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:54,045
You...

10
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:57,285
You saw Jing today.

11
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:58,764
Well,

12
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:01,764
do you really

13
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:03,645
get over him?

14
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:07,084
Yes.

15
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:13,965
I wish

16
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:15,125
I could do it.

17
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,284
I wish I could forget everything.

18
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:23,644
Today,

19
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:25,952
I did it on purpose.

20
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:29,804
I chatted and laughed
as usual in front of him.

21
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,284
When he looked sad,

22
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:35,364
I was actually very happy.

23
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:39,004
If he was like me today,

24
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:41,885
chatting and laughing,
as if nothing happened,

25
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,885
I guess I would feel very upset.

26
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:51,605
I always say things that I don't mean.

27
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:55,564
I said we should be strangers,

28
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:57,284
but in my heart,

29
00:02:57,325 --> 00:02:58,125
I do not want him

30
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,125
to forget me so quickly.

31
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:03,045
I can pretend not to care,

32
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:06,045
but I won't allow him not to care.

33
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:09,485
If he really

34
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,965
forgets about me soon,

35
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:14,644
I guess I would hate him.

36
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:21,084
Xuan.

37
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,004
What's wrong with me?

38
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,245
You're fine.

39
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:27,564
You've really fallen for him.

40
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:32,564
I regret it now.

41
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:35,125
If I hadn't intended

42
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,045
to have Tushan Jing's support,

43
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:40,125
none of this would have happened today.

44
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:45,605
Have you forgotten?

45
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,205
I was the one who saved him.

46
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:49,364
I already knew him.

47
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:51,564
But you didn't have real feelings
for him then.

48
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:53,765
I gave him the opportunity

49
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,644
to approach you step by step

50
00:03:58,084 --> 00:03:58,924
and walk into your heart.

51
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:01,205
Alright.

52
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,245
You may leave.

53
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,205
It's something between me and Jing.

54
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:10,485
Besides,

55
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,205
I've never regretted liking him.

56
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:14,924
Why should you blame yourself?

57
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:17,724
Don't worry about me.

58
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:19,765
Time will heal everything.

59
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,004
I just need a little more time

60
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:23,724
to forget the past.

61
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:25,404
Xiaoyao.

62
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,564
Alright.

63
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:27,765
You have to remember

64
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,724
that many people depend on you now.

65
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:33,885
You must always stay clear-headed.

66
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:35,485
Understand?

67
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:38,844
Okay.

68
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:40,444
Have an early rest.

69
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:42,925
Don't worry.

70
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:43,964
I've never been too harsh

71
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,205
on myself.

72
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:46,605
Go.

73
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:47,964
I'm leaving.

74
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,844
On hearing that Your Majesty is unwell,

75
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:47,964
the clans from the Central Plains

76
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:49,844
have offered spiritual medicine.

77
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:53,205
Wish you a speedy recovery,
Your Majesty.

78
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,085
I'm too old

79
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:56,885
to be healed.

80
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:02,325
I'm already on borrowed time.

81
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,085
Father has the blessings of Xiyan.

82
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:14,284
No need to worry too much.

83
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,205
You must have a long

84
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,444
and healthy life.

85
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:19,564
Fifth King is right.

86
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:29,124
Even so,

87
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:33,124
it's time to hand over the state affairs

88
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:35,525
to the younger generation.

89
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:47,444
I made a trip to the east

90
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:51,404
to honor the heavens
on the Chenrong Mountain.

91
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:56,564
The ceremony should be grand and solemn.

92
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:58,605
Deyan.

93
00:06:58,765 --> 00:06:59,404
Yes.

94
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,004
You will be in charge.

95
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:02,724
Yes.

96
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:05,444
You must prepare carefully.

97
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:08,404
This ceremony, for you,

98
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:17,645
is of great significance.

99
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,645
I will announce an important matter

100
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:27,045
after the ceremony.

101
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:31,645
I will definitely not let you down.

102
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:35,525
That's good.

103
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:40,925
Uncle.

104
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:42,444
Sorry for the late welcome.

105
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,085
Please forgive me.

106
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:45,684
Father asked me
to prepare for the ceremony.

107
00:07:47,164 --> 00:07:49,525
You and your people not only can't help,

108
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:50,684
but are a hindrance.

109
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,844
For the sake of the ceremony,

110
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:55,124
you should move out of Zijin Peak today.

111
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:00,444
Yes.

112
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,684
Back off.

113
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:27,365
Princess.

114
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:29,525
A message form Miss Xinyue.

115
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:31,765
She invites you to the Chenrong Mansion.

116
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:34,965
Xinyue?

117
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:38,004
Since the trip of my grandfather,

118
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:39,725
she has been living a secluded life,

119
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,325
even avoiding Cang Xuan.

120
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:44,765
Why would she want to see me?

121
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:56,885
Sit.

122
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,645
Where is Xinyue?

123
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:12,885
Actually, I'm the one looking for you.

124
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,205
You're looking for me?

125
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:15,484
What's the matter?

126
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:21,484
Just say it.

127
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,804
No need to beat around the bush.

128
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:31,684
Xiaoyao,

129
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:32,885
let's get married.

130
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,712
I've always wanted to marry you,

131
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:36,924
and you should know it.

132
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:39,604
I thought

133
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:41,804
you had long regarded me as a friend.

134
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:43,765
I feel relaxed with you,

135
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,684
so I think marrying you is a good idea.

136
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:49,244
Don't you mind what happened

137
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,205
between Chief Tushan and me?

138
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:52,804
Why?

139
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:54,604
Good things are desired by all.

140
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,484
I just hate that he won you over first.

141
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,684
Unfortunately, you two are not destined.

142
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:02,004
I don't like to beat around the bush.

143
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,845
I told Jing before I came to ask you.

144
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:09,444
What did he say?

145
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,405
It's clear that Jing is upset.

146
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:13,965
But as long as I am sincere to you,

147
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,725
he is willing to bless us.

148
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:31,845
Why do you want to marry me?

149
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,604
You're pretty,

150
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:34,645
with a good temper.

151
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:36,004
And you can drink with me.

152
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:38,004
Any girl

153
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,044
in entertainment places

154
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:39,924
can do that.

155
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:40,325
You...

156
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,525
You surprised me.

157
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:44,965
I didn't expect to hear that.

158
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:47,564
Tell me

159
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:49,845
the real reason you want to marry me.

160
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:52,325
I heard that you have moved here.

161
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:53,804
Without people leading the way,

162
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:54,965
I couldn't find here.

163
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:56,285
Thanks for coming.

164
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:57,965
You seem calm.

165
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,885
His Majesty will announce Deyan

166
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,325
as the Crown Prince at the ceremony

167
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:02,564
That news has spread everywhere.

168
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,684
Clans of the Central Plains are
in a flurry.

169
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:06,684
Except for my family,
the other five major clans

170
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:07,845
have already sided

171
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:09,285
with the Fifth King.

172
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:11,484
It's unfavorable for you.

173
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:12,845
Since my parents died,

174
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:14,525
I have never been in good times.

175
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:16,405
No matter what happens,

176
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,044
find a way to deal with it.

177
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,044
Cang Xuan

178
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:22,484
has reached a critical point
of life and death.

179
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:24,604
Yes.

180
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:27,205
The Chishui Family is top
of Four Great Clans.

181
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:30,124
It can influence the position
and decision of other clans.

182
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:32,684
Yes.

183
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,085
I want to help Cang Xuan.

184
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,044
But I must become the clan leader

185
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:37,645
to mobilize the Chishui Family.

186
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,684
Grandfather and other elders want me

187
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,165
to experience more.

188
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:42,885
But I can't wait any longer.

189
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:44,645
I want to be
the clan leader immediately.

190
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:46,765
Marrying you is the fastest way.

191
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:49,645
You want to marry me

192
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,604
because I'm Princess of Haoling, right?

193
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:52,684
It's not entirely like that.

194
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:53,564
I really

195
00:11:53,564 --> 00:11:54,725
like your straightforwardness.

196
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:56,325
In that case,

197
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:57,444
I won't be coy either.

198
00:11:58,645 --> 00:11:59,804
Did Cang Xuan tell you

199
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,325
about the conditions for marrying me?

200
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,885
He said if I want to marry you,

201
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:04,645
I should have no other women.

202
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:06,405
Xiaoyao,

203
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:07,965
you should know

204
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:09,244
what kind of person I am.

205
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:10,165
I swear.

206
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,364
As long as you marry me,

207
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:15,205
I'll only have you
as my woman in this life.

208
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:18,685
♪Waiting for the dawn light and breaking
the icy river at the darkest moment♪

209
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:22,560
♪I suppressed down
the remaining turmoil of this life♪

210
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,085
You didn't reject me outright,

211
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,525
which means I have a chance.

212
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:31,063
♪I mended the bumpy road with a mortal's heart♪

213
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:34,444
Others propose marriage
with romantic feelings.

214
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:36,484
But we two

215
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:37,564
are like doing a business.

216
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,124
That's why we're a good match.

217
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:41,845
To be honest,

218
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:44,004
I've always resisted getting married.

219
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,004
But if I marry you,

220
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,325
I feel that no matter what happens,

221
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:49,765
we can sit down

222
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:51,484
and discuss it calmly.

223
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:53,845
I think it's not bad to have a wife.

224
00:12:57,765 --> 00:12:59,004
It's too sudden.

225
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:00,845
After all, it's about my marriage.

226
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,725
Let me think about it.

227
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:07,885
Okay.

228
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:09,205
I'll wait for your news.

229
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:13,325
Rest assured.

230
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,272
Everything is going well.

231
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:15,776
- Then we...
- Your Highness.

232
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:17,725
For the ceremony,

233
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:18,645
His Majesty

234
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:19,684
has mobilized 100,000 troops

235
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,525
to cordon off 100 miles
around Chenrong Mountain.

236
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:22,405
Deyan's people

237
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:23,765
have already controlled Zijin Peak.

238
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,325
His Majesty turns a deaf ear to it.

239
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:27,444
We have 20,000 elite soldiers.

240
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:29,684
They can either attack to win

241
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:32,405
or ensure your safe withdrawal.

242
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:34,725
Okay.

243
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:37,765
My people and I will be on our guard

244
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,325
and die for Your Highness.

245
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:46,285
Long time no see.

246
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,684
Is Cang Xuan doing well lately?

247
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:49,525
Given the current situation,

248
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:51,325
I can't say he's very well.

249
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,484
But he looks the same

250
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,765
as usual.

251
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,085
Occasionally after dinner,

252
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:58,405
he would take Shuhui

253
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,004
for a walk along the mountain stream.

254
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,124
If you want to help Cang Xuan,

255
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:12,244
you better marry my brother.

256
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,364
I know.

257
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,044
You're mocking me in your heart.

258
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:23,444
If I really want to help Cang Xuan,

259
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:25,684
why don't I marry him?

260
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:33,004
I grew up in Xiyan Town.

261
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:35,285
I seem to have a noble status,

262
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:37,804
but in the eyes of those Xiyan nobles,

263
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:40,725
I am the descendant of the defeated,

264
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,525
just a hostage used

265
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,885
to restrain my father and grandfather.

266
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,165
Do you know what it's like
to be a hostage?

267
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,325
I don't know,

268
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,804
but Cang Xuan has been a hostage

269
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:56,044
in Haoling for 200 years.

270
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,044
I think he should understand.

271
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,325
At one time,

272
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,725
I prayed every night before I slept.

273
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,124
I prayed that my father would not rebel,

274
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:11,405
because I didn't want

275
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:13,165
to be tortured to death by King of Xiyan

276
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:14,244
and hung atop the city wall.

277
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:16,645
I didn't want

278
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:18,124
to be chopped off limbs.

279
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:25,285
I know

280
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:26,725
you think I'm too calculating.

281
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:29,604
Even my brother thinks

282
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,564
I'm excessively scheming.

283
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,364
But I can't be

284
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,004
as carefree as Nian.

285
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:37,645
When I was in Xiyan Town

286
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:39,085
I made a vow

287
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:41,444
that I would never

288
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:44,285
live that kind of life again.

289
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,244
I must stand at the highest point.

290
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:51,684
Xinyue,

291
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:54,645
you don't need to explain it to me.

292
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:56,244
This is between you

293
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,364
and Cang Xuan.

294
00:15:57,965 --> 00:15:59,085
And Cang Xuan

295
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:02,044
never blamed you.

296
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,124
Really?

297
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:18,645
I am a descendant
of the Chenrong royal family.

298
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:21,124
If Cang Xuan wants to marry me,

299
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:22,765
he must have the ability

300
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,205
to give me the grandest wedding.

301
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,965
This isn't just because I want it.

302
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:29,885
It's what the Xiyan must give

303
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,564
to the Chenrong Family.

304
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:33,044
Xiaoyao,

305
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:33,965
do you understand?

306
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,645
I am not just me.

307
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,405
I represent

308
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:39,725
a defeated royal family

309
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:42,444
and all the clans in the Central Plains.

310
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,364
You and Nian can marry anyone you like

311
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:47,965
because behind you

312
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:49,244
is the prosperous Haoling Kingdom.

313
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,325
People will only praise your freedom.

314
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:53,484
But I can't.

315
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,965
My simplicity and casualness

316
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:58,124
will only let people think

317
00:16:58,124 --> 00:17:00,085
of our failure and shame.

318
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,084
Maybe at first I didn't understand,

319
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:07,925
but now I do.

320
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,244
I think Cang Xuan

321
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:11,805
will understand better than I do.

322
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:15,324
Originally, I just wanted
to persuade you to marry my brother,

323
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:16,964
but somehow,

324
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:18,484
I started to talk about me.

325
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:20,124
I think it's quite nice.

326
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:22,565
We haven't chatted like this
for a long time.

327
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:24,724
Xiaoyao,

328
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:26,324
everyone knows

329
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,124
that you and Cang Xuan are close,

330
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:30,445
so your future husband

331
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:31,925
will definitely support Cang Xuan.

332
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,165
And my brother's status is delicate.

333
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:35,925
Although he is from the Chishui Family,

334
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:37,645
he also has the bloodline
of the Chenrong Family.

335
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,964
If you marry him,

336
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,004
Cang Xuan will get the support

337
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:43,084
of the Chishui and Chenrong clans
at the same time.

338
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:44,604
I understand.

339
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:47,004
I will consider carefully.

340
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,724
Time is pressing.

341
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:07,724
What did Xinyue tell you?

342
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,765
Why are you here alone?

343
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:11,925
She explained to me

344
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,124
why she can't marry you for now

345
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:15,124
and hoped I could tell you

346
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,004
not to blame her.

347
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:17,964
She said...

348
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,204
I fully understand what she said.

349
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:23,364
Do you?

350
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:25,525
Or you never had expectations for her?

351
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,724
If there are no expectations,

352
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:31,844
no matter what she does,

353
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:32,885
you won't be disappointed

354
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,084
or blame her.

355
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:35,445
I told you.

356
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:37,925
Don't have yourself hopes,

357
00:18:38,124 --> 00:18:39,645
and you will never be disappointed.

358
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:42,724
Xinyue doesn't know

359
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:44,244
she has missed the only chance

360
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:45,324
to gain your trust

361
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,525
and expectation.

362
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:49,045
It's her only chance.

363
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,724
But perhaps even if she knows,

364
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,285
maybe she simply doesn't care.

365
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:58,405
At this critical juncture,

366
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,844
Xinyue couldn't only invite you over

367
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:00,724
to talk about this.

368
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:02,405
What else did she say?

369
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:04,204
I met Fenglong.

370
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:06,645
He proposed to me.

371
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:15,204
Cang Xuan,

372
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:17,844
what do you think

373
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,324
about me marrying Fenglong?

374
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:24,925
Do you want to marry him?

375
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:32,324
I do.

376
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:37,285
Is he good enough for you?

377
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:43,765
He swore to me
that he would be good to me

378
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:45,565
and only have one wife

379
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:47,405

Didn't you always wish

386
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,124
that I would give him a chance?

387
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:13,484
Even so,

388
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:16,445

from a good family,

00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:26,165
and talented.

He is devoted to me.

do you allow Xiaoyao

417
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,604
to marry Chishui Fenglong?

418
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:24,324
Never mind.

419
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:27,364
I'll agree to Xiaoyao's request.

there's always a way
to turn things around.

00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,165
Didn't you promise me

424
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:01,925
to be with me for a lifetime,

425
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:03,525
always by my side.

Xiaoliu.

427
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:08,405
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:12,405
I'm not qualified
to be Ye Shiqi anymore.

429
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:18,724
I can't be with you for a lifetime.

430
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:33,165
Xiaoliu.

431
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:37,805
Shouldn't you be at

432
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:40,004
the succession ceremony
of the Chief Chishui?

433
00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:41,885
How do you have time

434
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:42,885
to do calculations?

435
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:44,925
You were saying numbers.

436
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:49,084
Xiaoyao and Fenglong are engaged.

437
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,165
The news should be spread

438
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,484
throughout the Dahuang soon.

439
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:54,805
How can it be Fenglong?

440
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:57,280
In terms of
family background and talent,

441
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:59,565
Fenglong is impeccable.

442
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,525
If Xiaoyao doesn't choose him,

443
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:04,844
should she choose me,

444
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,484
an unfaithful scoundrel,

445
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:08,165
or you...

446
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:13,925
What?

447
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,084
You really are a scoundrel.

448
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:23,925
If Xiaoyao cared
about family background,

449
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:26,364
there would

450
00:24:27,484 --> 00:24:29,124
be no Ye Shiqi in this world.

451
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,184
(Chenrong Mansion)

452
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:43,084
When Deyan
and Cang Xuan argued on the court.

453
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:46,604
Deyan said he would

454
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:47,648
rely on the old clans of Xiyan

455
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:49,765
but divide our Central Plains clans.

456
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:52,045
But Cang Xuan said
he would treat our clans

457
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:53,844
and the old clans of Xiyan equally.

458
00:24:54,604 --> 00:24:56,604
What I just said is all true.

459
00:24:57,565 --> 00:24:58,964
Chief Tushan can testify.

460
00:24:59,244 --> 00:24:59,844
Indeed,

461
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:01,925
I was there at the time

462
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:03,324
and heard it.

463
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:05,805
The Four Great Clans
have never been involved in disputes,

464
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,244
but now the crisis
we are facing is comparable

465
00:25:09,244 --> 00:25:11,885
to the one
that Xiyan soldiers opened our gates.

466
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:13,885
If Deyan ascends the throne,

467
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:15,844
based on his strategic governance,

468
00:25:17,204 --> 00:25:18,604
I'm afraid the clans of Central Plains

469
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:20,244
will live in suspicion

470
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:21,405
and never be in peace.

471
00:25:22,844 --> 00:25:23,885
Between Cang Xuan and Deyan,

472
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:25,765
which side should we support?

473
00:25:26,364 --> 00:25:27,685
Isn't it obvious?

474
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:28,925
Fenglong,

475
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:32,645
you're being alarmist.

476
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,445
The Fifth King is very generous

477
00:25:36,204 --> 00:25:38,244
and values the clans of Central Plains.

478
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:39,885
(Chief of Fan Clan)
He is...

479
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:44,045
Fan Bin, what are you doing?

480
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:46,805
Deyan pretends to value us

481
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,565
because he's been trying

482
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:49,805
to suppress Cang Xuan.

483
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:51,964
What he said before His Majesty

484
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:53,405
are his heartfelt words.

485
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:55,964
Father, don't make a mistake.

486
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:57,405
If Cang Xuan succeeds,

487
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,885
our family still has a future.

488
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:00,124
Once Deyan succeeds,

489
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:02,084
our family won't be accepted by Xiyan

490
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:03,445
nor by the Central Plains clans,

491
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:05,045
stranded in Dahuang.

492
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:06,805
Fan Bin has a long-term vision,

493
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,165
better than your narrow-minded brother

494
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:10,045
filled with hatred.

495
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:12,565
I've gained the support
of the elders in the clan.

496
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,364
I'm taking over the position
of the clan leader.

497
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:20,285
Guards.

498
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:48,045
The Chishui Family is willing

499
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:49,120
to support Prince Cang Xuan

500
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,364
for the Central Plains,

501
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:52,324
and for my own bright future.

502
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:56,844
The Tushan Family
will support Prince Cang Xuan.

503
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,604
I will stand with Chief Chishui,

504
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:05,685
supporting Prince Cang Xuan.

505
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:08,645
We will support Prince Cang Xuan.

506
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,165
Greetings, Your Majesty.

507
00:27:13,604 --> 00:27:14,324
Everyone,

508
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,405
why have you

509
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:18,765
come together?

510
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:21,244
I've heard that Your Majesty is going
to announce the Crown Prince.

511
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:23,244
I have something to say.

512
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:25,484
Go ahead.

513
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,885
Prince Cang Xuan is of noble bloodline,

514
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:29,244
virtuous and diligent.

515
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,765
Since he came to the Central Plains,

516
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:32,964
he has been conscientious

517
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:34,604
and loved by the people.

518
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:36,604
Not only the old ministers of Xiyan

519
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,604
but also clans of the Central Plains

520
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:39,805
deeply believe

521
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:43,604
that he is the best candidate
for the Crown Prince.

522
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:45,925
That's people's expectation.

523
00:27:46,045 --> 00:27:48,645
Please think carefully, Your Majesty.

524
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:51,324
Please think carefully, Your Majesty.

525
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,405
Please rise.

526
00:27:58,124 --> 00:28:01,045
Cang Xuan is indeed good.

527
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:03,004
But over the years,

528
00:28:03,124 --> 00:28:04,204
Deyan has helped me

529
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:07,084
with state affairs.

530
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:10,484
He is more mature

531
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:12,324
and thoughtful than Cang Xuan.

532
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:17,885
The selection of the Crown Prince

533
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:20,045
must be taken seriously.

534
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:21,964
Don't worry too much.

535
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:23,324
I

536
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:25,805
will make my own decision.

537
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:28,885
These Central Plains clans

538
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:33,004
are really despicable.

539
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:35,724
They openly joined forces

540
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:38,445
to nominate Cang Xuan
as the Crown Prince.

541
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:42,405
Uncle, don't be angry.

542
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:46,324
Grandfather has decided
to let you succeed.

543
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:48,445
They can't stir up any waves.

544
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:53,244
Cang Xuan has always been a big worry.

545
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:55,445
Should we get rid of him first?

546
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:01,204
Be patient.

547
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,724
After I ascend to the position
of the Crown Prince tomorrow,

548
00:29:05,645 --> 00:29:06,885
it's not too late to deal with him.

549
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:20,544
Your Highness,

550
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:22,604
although Deyan controls the Zijin Peak,

551
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:24,244
we have secret tunnels

552
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:25,165
and ambushes.

553
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:26,525
We can catch them off guard.

554
00:29:26,844 --> 00:29:27,885
You proclaim yourself a king.

555
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:32,084
If we don't take action now,

556
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,045
once Deyan becomes the Crown Prince,

557
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:35,885
we will be at his disposal.

558
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,324
Deyan will definitely kill you.

559
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,405
This is our only chance.

560
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:44,165
Your Highness.

561
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:47,805
I've made up my mind.

562
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:49,405
We don't take action now.

563
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:51,165
You guys may leave.

564
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:55,445
Yes.

565
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:15,244
What are you really thinking?

566
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:21,565
We've been fighting side by side

567
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:23,045
in life-and-death moments.

568
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:25,324
We should toast

569
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:26,244
to each other

570
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:28,885
for never leaving each other.

571
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:32,364
I wish we could turn a crisis

572
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:33,604
into a success as usual.

573
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,405
But our grandfather

574
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:36,364
made it so clear.

575
00:30:36,964 --> 00:30:37,405
Xuan.

576
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:39,445
Why are you hesitating?

577
00:30:40,324 --> 00:30:41,405
Anyway,

578
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:43,685
aren't you ready

579
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:44,525
to accompany me?

580
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,324
Well,

581
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:58,604
you're getting better at coaxing people.

582
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:09,324
Xuan.

583
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:11,484
You...

584
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:27,124
Xiaoyao.

585
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:28,685
I don't want you

586
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:29,925
to accompany me this time.

587
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,004
If we part today,

588
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:41,324
we might be separated forever.

589
00:31:44,124 --> 00:31:45,565
If I die,

590
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:47,844
this flower will be like me,

591
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:50,364
accompanying you forever.

592
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:59,194
♪You come and go without noticing♪

593
00:31:59,244 --> 00:32:01,084
The Ruoshui Clan
will follow your commands

594
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:04,244
and protect you.

595
00:32:09,408 --> 00:32:12,604
♪You come and go without noticing♪

596
00:32:12,604 --> 00:32:13,084
Miao Pu.

597
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:15,744
Your Highness.

598
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:19,925
Send princess away
through the secret passage.

599
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:21,244
Yes.

600
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:39,264
♪You come and go without noticing♪

601
00:32:58,525 --> 00:33:00,805
The ceremony begins.

602
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,844
First bow to the heaven.

603
00:33:13,364 --> 00:33:15,765
Second bow to the earth.

604
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:25,204
Third bow to the mountains of Chenrong.

605
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:34,525
Finished.

606
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,324
You have heard the news

607
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:44,685
before you came.

608
00:33:45,285 --> 00:33:47,844
After today's ceremony,

609
00:33:48,844 --> 00:33:51,405
I will announce an important thing,

610
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:54,084
the appointment of the Crown Prince.

611
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:08,284
You got the wrong news.

612
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:10,804
Today,

613
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:13,925
I won't announce the Crown Prince.

614
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,284
Instead, I will announce

615
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:20,925
who becomes the king of Xiyan Kingdom.

616
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:31,044
In this lifetime,

617
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:34,005
I used to engage in warfare,

618
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:38,245
bringing peace and happiness to people,

619
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:40,564
and bringing separation

620
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:42,245
and pain to people.

621
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:47,604
I want all the people of Xiyan

622
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,925
to live in peace and contentment.

623
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:55,564
I want all the races of Dahuang

624
00:34:56,205 --> 00:35:00,564
to freely choose their own life.

625
00:35:01,324 --> 00:35:02,445
I want the Central Plains clans

626
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:06,725
to admire me
like the clans of the northwest

627
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:10,284
and the southwest.

628
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:12,044
I want the son

629
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:14,524
of the lowly

630
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:18,885
to have a chance to become a great hero.

631
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:23,324
But,

632
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:26,485
I am getting old,

633
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:34,005
and Xiyan Kingdom
is moving towards prosperity.

634
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:37,324
It needs a new king.

635
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:41,165
This king

636
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:42,764
should have a great ambition,

637
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:44,925
a keen mind,

638
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:46,885
a broad heart,

639
00:35:47,165 --> 00:35:49,005
and vigorous energy.

640
00:35:51,124 --> 00:35:52,764
Only such a king

641
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:56,804
can lead Xiyan Kingdom

642
00:35:57,445 --> 00:36:00,205
to create a new history

643
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:02,245
and glory.

644
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:04,965
I have already cultivated the best king

645
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:07,205
for Xiyan.

646
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:09,925
So,

647
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,324
I choose to abdicate,

648
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:17,844
and let the new king

649
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:21,124
fulfill my unfulfilled wishes.

650
00:36:31,284 --> 00:36:32,005
Deyan.

651
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:33,965
Father.

652
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:36,885
You did a good job.

653
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:38,445
Thank you, Father.

654
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,685
You arranged

655
00:36:40,844 --> 00:36:42,965
a good ceremony.

656
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:45,725
The new king ascends,

657
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:47,645
demonstrating his power.

658
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:56,445
Cang Xuan,

659
00:36:58,645 --> 00:36:59,485
come here.

660
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:35,645
From today,

661
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:40,725
Xiyan Cang Xuan is the king
of Xiyan Kingdom.

662
00:38:43,245 --> 00:38:47,405
Perhaps you think I'm not being serious.

663
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:49,284
After all, this ceremony

664
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:51,485
is not grand enough.

665
00:38:52,485 --> 00:38:53,685
It doesn't look like the coronation

666
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:56,284
of a king at all.

667
00:38:57,764 --> 00:39:00,284
But remember,

668
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,764
people won't remember a king

669
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:07,764
because of a grand ceremony.

670
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:11,005
People will only

671
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:12,364
remember a king

672
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,324
because of what he did.

673
00:40:34,284 --> 00:40:34,844
Grandfather.

674
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:38,124
Greetings, Your Majesty.

675
00:40:46,165 --> 00:40:48,284
Greetings, Your Majesty.

676
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:53,124
Greetings, Your Majesty.

677
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:57,298
(Daming Hall)

678
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,885
Everyone, please rise.

679
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:10,764
Thank you, Your Majesty.

680
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:16,324
Let's go.

681
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:17,885
I will support you.

682
00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:21,165
Just now,

683
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:24,445
I didn't see you during the ceremony.

684
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:26,084
I thought

685
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,604
Cang Xuan had sent you away

686
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:29,604
for your safety.

687
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:31,804
He thought the same as you again.

688
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:33,165
But,

689
00:41:33,564 --> 00:41:34,564
he is the grandson

690
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:35,885
of King of Xiyan and Lady Xiezu.

691
00:41:36,124 --> 00:41:36,725
I'm half of it.

692
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:38,528
I pretended to fall into his trap

693
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:39,604
to let him

694
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:40,965
do his own thing.

695
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:42,364
Don't worry about me.

696
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:48,005
Why are you dressed like this?

697
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:50,005
I will kill Deyan

698
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:52,885
as soon as you announce him

699
00:41:53,725 --> 00:41:55,084
as the Crown Prince.

700
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,685
You're actually my granddaughter.

701
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:03,645
Grandfather,

702
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:05,284
you really played a trick

703
00:42:05,284 --> 00:42:06,405
on everyone today.

704
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:16,165
Sometimes being an emperor is boring,

705
00:42:16,844 --> 00:42:20,405
I have to have some fun for myself.

706
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:22,844
But grandfather,

707
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:24,284
since you already decided

708
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:25,764
to pass the throne to Cang Xuan,

709
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:27,524
why didn't you tell him?

710
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:29,044
What if he...

711
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:30,485
Aren't you afraid

712
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:32,124
that he will...

713
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:33,645
You mean,

714
00:42:34,604 --> 00:42:35,445
Cang Xuan

715
00:42:36,044 --> 00:42:39,205
hid the elite troops
in Chenrong Mountain?

716
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:42,885
So,

717
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:45,485
you knew it.

718
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,604
If he launched a coup
to seize the throne,

719
00:42:51,044 --> 00:42:52,965
it would mean he is much like me.

720
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,645
He will be a good and decisive king.

721
00:42:58,524 --> 00:42:59,445
But he didn't.

722
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:06,165
He's kinder than me.

723
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:09,364
I hope

724
00:43:09,844 --> 00:43:12,405
he can bring more peace

725
00:43:13,284 --> 00:43:14,084
to the world.

726
00:43:17,005 --> 00:43:17,685
Grandfather,

727
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:18,925
where are you planning

728
00:43:19,124 --> 00:43:20,445
to live in the future?

729
00:43:20,925 --> 00:43:22,245
Are you going back to Xiyan Mountain?

730
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:24,685
Cang Xuan just ascended the throne.

731
00:43:25,524 --> 00:43:27,364
The clans in the north

732
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:29,524
and the west
are not yet wholly convinced.

733
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:32,364
If I return to Xiyan Mountain,

734
00:43:32,804 --> 00:43:36,165
it will make people think
that there are two kings in one country.

735
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:38,885
I will stay in Chenrong Mountain

736
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:40,284
until Cang Xuan

737
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:43,124
has won over all the clans.

738
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:47,405
After that, I will consider
whether to return to Xiyan Mountain.

739
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:51,844
We stay in Chenrong Mountain

740
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:53,804
and watch

741
00:43:56,005 --> 00:43:59,485
