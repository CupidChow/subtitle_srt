=Episode 8=

3
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:55,514
Xiaoliu.

4
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:58,514
Shiqi is by the river.
He said he's waiting for someone.

5
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,474
But he won't tell me who.

6
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:01,594
Is he waiting for you?

7
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:04,355
It has nothing to do with me.

8
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,234
How would I know about it?

9
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,115
Shiqi, look.

10
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:42,395
One, two, three,

11
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:47,714
four, five, six,

12
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:52,035
seven, eight, nine,

13
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:53,835
ten.

14
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:04,154
2226.

15
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:08,275
2228.

16
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,835
2229.

17
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:16,675
22...

18
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:25,664
Stop pretending to sleep.

19
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:28,194
I'm asleep. I can't hear anything.

20
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:41,794
Your Lordship, why aren't you
staying in your mountain

21
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:44,354
but coming to my small courtyard?

22
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:45,754
Is the man by your side

23
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:48,595
from the Tushan Family?

24
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:50,675
The man by my side?

25
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:53,034
Which one are you talking about?

26
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:56,995
Skinny, Pimply or Mu?

27
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,034
I wanted to treat you better,

28
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:03,715
but you can always

29
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:05,875
make me want to bite off your neck.

30
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:13,395
You're becoming less
concerned about your image.

31
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,675
I know you're a demon.

32
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,675
But knowing this

33
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,034
and seeing you

34
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:23,194
show your fangs
are two different things.

35
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:24,914
I think you know it.

36
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:27,595
Whether they are mortals or deities,

37
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,794
they only care about appearances,

38
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,914
with no regard for the character.

39
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:35,715
Even when eating, the food
has to look and smell good,

40
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:37,754
and when choosing a wife,
they pick the prettiest one.

41
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:39,875
Unlike you demons.

42
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:43,395
As long as it's fat, big
and fresh, it's enough.

43
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:46,275
Is that man

44
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:50,115
Tushan Jing or not?

45
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:56,480
If I say he's not, you won't believe it.

46
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:06,115
Very good.

47
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:12,995
Can you stop laughing now?

48
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:14,675
Your laughter really creeps me out.

49
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:16,875
I'm not familiar with him.

50
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,354
If you want to find him,

51
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:19,354
you go find him yourself.

52
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:20,835
I'm even less familiar with him.

53
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:23,794
I'm more familiar with you.

54
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:28,074
Demons are really bad at telling jokes.

55
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,168
Many people in the military camp
have been infected with miasma,

56
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:33,754
in urgent need of herbs.

57
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,115
Ask Tushan Jing
to get some herbs for us.

58
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:38,955
On what grounds?

59
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:40,314
Just because I could eat you.

60
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,194
I'd rather you eat me

61
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:43,595
than go find him.

62
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:46,914
Do you want to know what kind of person
the senior master of the Tushan Family is?

63
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:49,715
Ten years ago,

64
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:52,914
he made Tushan Jing
suddenly disappear before the wedding.

65
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,634
If I ask the senior master

66
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:57,995
to get herbs for me

67
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,354
and I kill for him,

68
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,155
what are the chances

69
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,555
that the Master Qingqiu can survive?

70
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:12,474
No wonder you have ranked first
on the bounty list in Xiyan.

71
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:16,256
Even I'm thinking about
taking your head for money now.

72
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:24,914
I have nine heads.

73
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:27,595
Remember to sharpen your knife.

74
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:33,835
What can he get for helping you?

75
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:35,794
When I'm not busy,

76
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,634
I occasionally work as a killer

77
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:41,715
and have gained
a reputation in Dahuang.

78
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,754
If the senior master
of Tushan asks me to kill him,

79
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:46,675
I will refuse.

80
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:50,595
But if he considers killing
the senior master of Tushan,

81
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:54,794
I will accept it.

82
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:57,794
He's just returned home.

83
00:07:58,314 --> 00:08:00,794
He may not be able to freely mobilize

84
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:02,234
people and money in the family.

85
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,634
You underestimate him.

86
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,595
Just some herbs.

87
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:10,395
It's nothing to him.

88
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:12,074
The Tushan Family
does all kinds of business.

89
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:13,995
The things sold to Chenrong

90
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:15,995
by him back then

91
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:19,514
were much more dangerous than this.

92
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:22,595
Then why don't you just
buy it from the Tushan Family?

93
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,514
I have no money.

94
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,874
Come on.

95
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:34,795
You're a demon.

96
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:38,035
Is it worth it for Chenrong?

97
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:43,994
If you can care for some idiots
out of boredom,

98
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:47,795
can't I do something boring as well?

99
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:52,874
True.

100
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:55,514
Life is long and boring.

101
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:58,074
We have to find something
to occupy our time.

102
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:00,314
Let's go to Yu Mansion to see him.

103
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:03,715
He's by the river.

104
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,074
How have you been these days?

105
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:33,184
I'm fine.

106
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:37,715
How are Lan Xiang and Jing Ye doing?

107
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:47,155
I need a favor.

108
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:48,704
Okay.

109
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,355
I need a batch of herbs.

110
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:54,874
It's all written here, very clear.

111
00:09:59,072 --> 00:09:59,514
Okay.

112
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,795
Once the herbs are delivered
to Qingshui Town, notify me.

113
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:04,955
Xiang Liu will pick it up.

114
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:08,035
Okay.

115
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:10,235
And

116
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,514
I don't have money to pay you.

117
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:13,795
You know that, right?

118
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,795
You don't need to pay it.

119
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,795
That is it, thanks.

120
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:31,795
Don't thank me anymore.

121
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:47,035
I'm going back to sleep then. Bye.

122
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,194
Before I get the herbs,

123
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:54,114
you stick with me.

124
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,994
Fine. I have just made a new poison.

125
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,235
I want to test it out.

126
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,816
(Chenrong Army Base Camp)

127
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,155
Have you thought it through?

128
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,235
I'm afraid of the pain
and have no principles.

129
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:29,395
And I'm a fence-sitter.

130
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:33,314
If people from Xiyan capture me in the future,
I'll directly disclose your location.

131
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:34,314
Open your eyes.

132
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:34,994
I won't.

133
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,874
I won't give you a reason
to kill me in the future.

134
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,074
Okay, we've arrived at the camp.

135
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,155
As long as you don't wander around,

136
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:58,514
it's impossible
to know the location here.

137
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:10,434
Mr. Xiang.

138
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,434
Your life as a strategist for the army

139
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,874
is unexpectedly so difficult.

140
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,275
I don't know what you are after.

141
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:45,155
I mean

142
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:47,955
it's not easy for a powerful figure

143
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:50,194
like you to stay in this kind of place.

144
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:50,915
Medicine.

145
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:52,955
Medicine.

146
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:58,235
Newly-made Hundred Poison Pill.
Please accept it.

147
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,114
(I feed you with my blood every day.)

148
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,275
(You two better do me proud.)

149
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:15,514
Go.

150
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:20,640
Hurry up, coward.

151
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:21,874
Go.

152
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:24,155
Go.

153
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:26,795
Go or not? I...

154
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:36,235
What are you doing?

155
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:38,674
I'm checking out
if you've been poisoned.

156
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:43,155
If you want to poison me, do it openly.

157
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:17,754
Go to sleep.

158
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:06,035
Attack!

159
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:10,994
Defend!

160
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:13,634
Kill!

161
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:17,955
Attack!

162
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:22,595
Defend!

163
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:27,194
Kill!

164
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,035
Attack!

165
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:40,715
Defend!

166
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:43,595
Kill!

167
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:46,874
Attack!

168
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,074
Defend!

169
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:54,595
(They say that demons
are naturally slacking off)

170
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:55,915
(and undisciplined.)

171
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,475
(But I never thought
this arrogant nine-headed demon)

172
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:01,395
(would even stay in the deep mountain,)

173
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:03,674
(and do things he despises every day.)

174
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,515
Defend!

175
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,040
Kill!

176
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:46,403
Defend!

177
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:08,355
The tea is so strange.

178
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:31,314
Your Lordship,

179
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,595
other people train soldiers

180
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:35,274
to protect a territory

181
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:36,635
and the people.

182
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,074
You guys have neither territory

183
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:40,595
nor people to protect.

184
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:43,235
Is it meaningful to train
from morning to night?

185
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,835
Is it meaningful to eat
and sleep every day?

186
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:50,355
Well.

187
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,475
There isn't even
a decent cup of tea here.

188
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:58,314
Your life is really tough.

189
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,314
After drinking the tea,

190
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:16,875
I casually threw
an insecticide pellet into the tea jar.

191
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:20,074
It's said to be some kind
of wild beast's feces.

192
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:28,434
I don't care.

193
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,034
Many good medicinal herbs
are animals' feces.

194
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:32,715
Hare dung is rabbit excrement.

195
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:34,794
White clove is sparrow excrement.

196
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:36,635
Trogopterus dung
is flying squirrel excrement.

197
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:38,875
All are nutritious feces.

198
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:09,314
Mr. Xiang, two more soldiers have died.

I apologize
for what I said to you last time.

211
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:12,394
The Chenrong Army is indeed admirable.

212
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,194
If we can get those herbs soon,

213
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:19,875
at least they can live a little longer.

214
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:26,115
They are soldiers.

215
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:29,194
Even if they have to die,

216
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:32,635
they should die in battle.

217
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:46,554
I hope they can get herbs soon.

218
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,490
(Yu Mansion, Qingshui Town)

219
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:04,554
Jing Ye, go change it
to ordinary wildflowers.

220
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:06,115
Wildflowers?

221
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:09,515
Yes, Master.

222
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:24,274
Master, the medicinal herbs
listed on the list

223
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:25,835
have all been bought out.

224
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,595
There are no herbs
in all the pharmacies.

225
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:30,515
If we gather from other places,

226
00:24:30,794 --> 00:24:31,914
it will take at least seven days.

227
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:37,554
I am incompetent.

228
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:38,875
Please punish me, Master.

229
00:24:45,154 --> 00:24:47,355
Get up. I'll think of another way.

230
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:49,475
Thank you.

231
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,394
In these years of war,

232
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,394
the large clans all have stored
medicinal herbs in case of emergency.

233
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,875
Go to visit the large clans around
in my name and tell them

234
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:08,274
Tushan Family is willing to exchange
the Guixu Crystal for the herbs on the list.

235
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:11,914
The Guixu Crystal
is quite precious to deities.

236
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:15,875
Is it worth exchanging it for herbs?

237
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:20,274
No matter how precious,
it's just an item.

238
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:22,794
Yes.

239
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:31,355
If it can make her happy,

240
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:34,355
why not?

241
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:48,614
My Lord, the Tushan family
has recently gathered a batch

242
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,816
of herbs for treating miasma
and transported it to Qingshui Town.

243
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:54,674
I suspect that Tushan Family
and Xiang Liu have secretly reached a deal.

244
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:59,194
Send people to watch the family's movements
and try to find out where the herbs are hidden.

245
00:26:00,154 --> 00:26:04,475
Then we will shoot fish in the barrel.

246
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:05,355
Yes.

247
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:17,715
The medicine.

248
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:29,034
Help me hold him down.

249
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:34,434
Master, more and more people
are getting sick.

250
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,475
We're running out of herbs.

251
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:37,955
What should we do?

252
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:42,154
Mr. Xiang said that the herbs
will be delivered in two more days.

253
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:43,955
Let's hold on a bit longer.

254
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:47,394
Shall I decoct
these herb residues one more time?

255
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:54,914
Better than nothing.

256
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:27,875
Come over and help.

257
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:32,355
Keep up.

258
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:45,914
Keep up.

259
00:27:58,515 --> 00:27:59,755
The blood seems not enough.

260
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:04,635
I'm not a spy.

261
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:16,832
You're courting death?

262
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,314
The herbs haven't arrived,

263
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:20,794
and the soldiers can't wait,
so I had to resort to this.

264
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,115
I have always thought
that my special constitution

265
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:29,835
brings nothing but trouble.

266
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,434
But now I realize
my blood can save people.

267
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:34,955
I think it's not all bad.

268
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:37,635
I don't know
how many people my blood can save,

269
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:39,434
but if I can at least save one,
it's worth it.

270
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:42,274
Don't do stupid things.

271
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,154
So many people.

272
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:46,274
Even if you bleed yourself dry,
it won't help.

273
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:55,314
Tushan Jing got the herbs.

274
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,074
That's great.

275
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,074
I mean there's hope for the soldiers.

276
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,715
The herbs have arrived. Where are they?

277
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:15,424
The herbs are all ready, in the cellar

278
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:18,554
of the fourth house on the left
of Dongliu Street in the town.

279
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:20,914
You can send someone to get them.

280
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,424
You care a lot about him.

281
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:43,835
I'm doing my friend a favor.

282
00:29:47,595 --> 00:29:49,355
Was it a hassle to get those herbs?

283
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:51,194
Not at all.

284
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:56,034
When are you leaving Qingshui Town?

285
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:57,194
I'm not leaving.

286
00:29:58,314 --> 00:30:00,074
Your fiancée will come for you?

287
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,034
Thank you for helping
Xiang Liu this time.

288
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:06,394
I'll go now.

289
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:56,064
(Zhuang family of Dongliu Street)

290
00:31:29,995 --> 00:31:30,875
You're hurt again.

291
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:45,595
You're really lucky

292
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,314
to have me, a panacea blood pack.

293
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:57,755
You didn't get the herbs?

294
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:12,128
No.

295
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:16,288
Someone from the Tushan family
leaked the location of the herbs.

296
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:17,914
I was ambushed.

297
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:19,355
It was definitely not Tushan Jing.

298
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:20,635
I know it wasn't him.

299
00:32:21,554 --> 00:32:22,355
Who was it?

300
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,674
You should ask Tushan Jing.

301
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:29,034
Do you know who robbed the herbs?

302
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,515
I don't know.

303
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:31,955
How come you don't know anything?

304
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:38,074
All I know is that it's the same group
of people who hurt me last time.

305
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:41,088
I suspect there are
traitors in the mountain.

306
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:43,595
It's a pity that I only killed one,

307
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:45,674
and others escaped.

308
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:47,034
It's my uselessness.

309
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:48,928
Although Xiang Liu
was injured this time,

310
00:32:49,154 --> 00:32:51,355
the helpers I brought
were all killed by him.

311
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,755
Only I managed to escape.

312
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:55,515
I'm worried
that it has exposed our tracks.

313
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:57,154
If Xiang Liu investigates,

314
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,674
it will threaten your safety.

315
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:01,314
Xiang Liu is indeed a dangerous man.

316
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:03,475
Since he can't be used by me,

317
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:07,515
I have to strike first.

318
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:09,984
Take advantage of his severe injury

319
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,674
and immediately dispatch
people to find him.

320
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,715
We must fully remove
the threat to avoid trouble later.

321
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:17,835
Can't believe it.
How can it be such a coincidence?

322
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:21,274
You know who it was?

323
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:22,674
Let me calm down first.

324
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:27,995
This concerns the lives
of thousands of soldiers.

325
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:30,434
This is no game to pass the time.

326
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:36,794
It's... it's Xuan from the winery.

327
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:43,355
We can't just rob him.

328
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,995
The man has many people under him,

329
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:47,274
and I suspect he's colluding
with someone from the Tushan family.

330
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:50,274
Once this gets out, I'm afraid the one
from the Tushan family will help him.

331
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:55,635
I have a way to get back the herbs.
without shedding blood.

332
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:57,554
Tell me.

333
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:08,275
I can only give you four people.

334
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:10,995
You're not giving me
all your people, are you?

335
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:12,834
I'll keep two.

336
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:14,955
You're injured.
Xuan is not easy to deal with.

337
00:34:15,515 --> 00:34:18,114
Until I get back, everyone
listens to Wen Xiaoliu's orders.

338
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:19,035
Yes.

339
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:28,795
Nine-headed demon.

340
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:32,154
Don't get killed.

341
00:34:54,035 --> 00:34:55,235
I'm incompetent.

342
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:56,955
Xiang Liu got away.

343
00:34:57,914 --> 00:34:58,834
What about the herbs?

344
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,434
According to your command,

345
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,715
they have been transferred in advance,

346
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,194
leaving Xiang Liu empty-handed.

347
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:07,114
Xiang Liu won't let it go.

348
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:10,275
Xiang Liu is coming.

349
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:12,434
Since he dares to come,

350
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:14,394
I'll go and confront him.

351
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:34,394
I'm coming.

352
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:38,475
It's so late. What do you want?

353
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,914
I just saw your master fighting

354
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:45,035
the white-haired, white-robed demon.

355
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:46,848
Your master was defeated.

356
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,275
He was injured.

357
00:35:48,394 --> 00:35:49,354
Master is injured?

358
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:50,995
Where is he?

359
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:53,834
Over there. Hurry up.

360
00:35:57,795 --> 00:35:59,594
This fool is so easy to deceive.

361
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:06,394
Xuan.

362
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:08,515
Xuan.

363
00:36:09,194 --> 00:36:10,394
Xuan.

364
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,035
Xuan.

365
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:14,315
Xuan.

366
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:16,354
Xuan.

367
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,394
Xuan.

368
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:21,475
What are you doing up so late at night?

369
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:25,674
I'm here to see Xuan.
It's none of your business. Get lost!

370
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:25,995
You...

371
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:28,354
What are you making noise about
in the middle of the night?

372
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:29,874
If you don't leave,
I won't be polite to you.

373
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:30,874
You won't be polite to me?

374
00:36:31,114 --> 00:36:32,434
I won't be polite to you either!

375
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:34,235
If it weren't for Xuan,

376
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:36,194
I would have slapped you
many times already.

377
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:38,874
You ugly hag.

378
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:43,075
Haitang, kill him! If you kill him
and Xuan blames you, I'll take responsibility.

379
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:43,555
Yes.

380
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,275
Why don't you do it yourself?

381
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:47,475
Don't let your maid do it.

382
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:50,075
You ugly hag.

383
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,795
- Come on.
- Stop there!

384
00:36:51,914 --> 00:36:52,674
You ugly.

385
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:53,874
I'll do it myself.

386
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:55,394
Come on.

387
00:36:55,594 --> 00:36:57,874
You ugly hag.

388
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:58,874
Come on. There you go.

389
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:00,874
I'm telling you.
If I catch you, you'll be dead.

390
00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:02,275
Miss.

391
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,354
Miss.

392
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:19,075
I give you two choices.

393
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:20,634
Work for me,

394
00:37:21,315 --> 00:37:22,394
and I will treat you well.

395
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,275
If you continue to hide
in the mountains,

396
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,594
colluding with rebels to cause trouble,

397
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:28,634
I will kill you.

398
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,594
I'll give you two choices too.

399
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:32,634
Either you kill me,

400
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:37,434
or I kill you.

401
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:30,154
Ruomu Puppet.

402
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,872
I've got other things to do.

403
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,888
Let's call it a day.

404
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,475
Come on, hag.

405
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:08,955
You stop!

406
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,035
Come on.

407
00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:20,114
Haitang.

408
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:24,035
Miss, are you scared now?

409
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:26,795
Aren't you chasing me? Come on.

410
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:29,674
Scared of you? You're not worthy.

411
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:51,555
What do you want to do?

412
00:39:59,114 --> 00:40:02,075
Put me down. Did you hear me?

413
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:03,235
I'm telling you.

414
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:04,834
If you don't put me down,

415
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:06,354
I'll chop off your hands.

416
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:08,995
Did you hear me? Put me down.

417
00:40:10,114 --> 00:40:11,194
I'm talking to you.

418
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:19,434
How dare you drop me?

419
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,120
It was you who asked me to put you down.

420
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:22,194
Why did you hold me?

421
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,634
You're tied up.
If I don't hold you, should I drag you?

422
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:24,914
I...

423
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:27,194
What?

424
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:29,914
You're too heavy. I'm tired.

425
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:32,795
What do you eat every day?

426
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:35,154
Noble lady,

427
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:38,035
you must have never been tied up
like this before, right?

428
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:39,354
How does it feel?

429
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:40,394
Let me tell you.

430
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,674
You're simply looking for death.

431
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,035
Miss, recognize the situation.

432
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,394
Now you're tied up by me.

433
00:40:48,955 --> 00:40:50,834
My cousin will find me soon.

434
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:52,515
He'll be super angry,

435
00:40:52,674 --> 00:40:54,634
and you'll die super miserably.

436
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,555
Do you have
so much confidence in your cousin?

437
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:57,194
Of course.

438
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:57,874
My father...

439
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,515
My father never praises anyone,

440
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:01,594
except my cousin.

441
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:03,394
Do your parents love you very much?

442
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:05,674
Nonsense. Of course my parents love me.

443
00:41:05,914 --> 00:41:07,555
Then the people around you love you too.

444
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:09,995
Nonsense. How dare they not love me?

445
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:14,874
You're quite annoying.

446
00:41:15,715 --> 00:41:17,114
But if possible,

447
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:19,075
I believe probably all girls

448
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:20,755
would like to be like you.

449
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:23,715
Having never experienced
setbacks or seen darkness

450
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:26,464
and being shamelessly
naive and arrogantly imperious

451
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:28,634
as a result of your parents'
and cousin's spoiling.

452
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:32,075
Want to be like me? In their dream.

453
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:34,834
You have such a bad temper.

454
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:36,114
I'm really curious

455
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:38,715
what your parents
are like to spoil you like this.

456
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:42,354
My father is the most handsome
and capable man in the world.

457
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:43,674
What about your cousin?

458
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,914
And so is my cousin, of course.

459
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:46,634
Both are the best. Who's better?

460
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:50,235
Stupid. My father represents the past.
My cousin represents the future.

461
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:54,354
I grew up without a father.
I don't know what that feels like.

462
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,434
Can you tell me about it?

463
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,475
What do you do
when you're with your father?

464
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:05,035
Tell me.

465
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:39,194
Do you want to see
the face under the mask?

466
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:41,315
Definitely not worse than your cousin's.

467
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,315
Who cares?

468
00:43:03,235 --> 00:43:05,594
Your Highness,
the princess had been abducted.

469
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,456
The kidnapper wants herbs
in exchange for her.

470
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,450
(Herbs in exchange for her)

471
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:10,592
It was all my fault.

472
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,376
I was deceived by Wen Xiaoliu.
I did not protect the princess well.

473
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:15,715
Rise, both of you. It's not your fault.

474
00:43:15,914 --> 00:43:19,194
I underestimated them
and made them grasp an opportunity.

475
00:43:24,555 --> 00:43:28,194
(This time, I will not allow myself
to lose another sister.)

476
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:32,555
