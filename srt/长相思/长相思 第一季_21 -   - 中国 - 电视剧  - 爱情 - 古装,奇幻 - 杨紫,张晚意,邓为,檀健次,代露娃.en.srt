00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,760
=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,363
Alright, you may leave now.

4
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:59,282
I need to take a nap.

5
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:02,963
Your Majesty,

6
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:06,162
the Great Princess of Haoling
has arrived in Xiyan Town.

7
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:09,843
After changing to a carriage,
she should arrive soon.

8
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:14,483
It'll take her a long time to get here.

9
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:17,442
It's enough for me to take a nap.

10
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,162
Yes.

11
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:23,362
Back when we were at Zhaoyun Peak,

12
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:25,123
it was always Cang Xuan
who accompanied me.

13
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:27,602
If he can't accompany me there,

14
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:29,082
I don't want to go anymore.

15
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,123
I don't want to stop him here,

16
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:33,283
but Father didn't summon him.

17
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:36,043
I can't go against his will

18
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:37,843
and do it without his permission.

19
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:40,722
If Grandfather blames us,
I will bear the responsibility.

20
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,802
Fifth King and Seventh King,
don't worry.

21
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,763
Can't I really have Cang Xuan's company?

22
00:02:58,082 --> 00:02:59,483
Please forgive me.

23
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,923
Since I'm not welcome in Xiyan,

24
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,362
set off immediately
and return to Haoling.

25
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,882
Princess, you can't be messing around.

26
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:12,082
Am I messing around?

27
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:13,843
How would a crazy person

28
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,882
travel thousands of miles
to mess around here?

29
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:18,882
My mother died in battle
for the people of Xiyan.

30
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:21,843
I traveled a long way
to pay tribute to my mother.

31
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:24,722
I sincerely came
to pay respects to my grandfather.

32
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,203
I just want

33
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:28,323
the brother who I've known
since childhood to accompany me,

34
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:29,504
and that makes me a troublemaker?

35
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:32,763
Your soldiers drew
their weapons against me

36
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:33,963
and stopped me entering the town.

37
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,002
I want to ask the people of the world

38
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:39,082
who's messing around,
me or rude men from Xiyan?

39
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,323
As a princess,

40
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:42,203
how could you yell out

41
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:43,362
in public?

42
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:45,722
I just raised my voice a bit,

43
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:46,963
and you couldn't tolerate it.

44
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:50,203
Then is it more intolerable

45
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:52,123
that you guys draw weapons against me?

46
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:08,483
Princess, you misunderstood.

47
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:11,602
No one dares to stop you
from entering the city.

48
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:13,802
Please.

49
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:43,883
Brother.

50
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,920
(Zhaoyun Hall)

51
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:00,522
I remember this plaque

52
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:03,283
was written by my grandmother.

53
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,080
(Zhaoyun Hall)

54
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:08,802
(Father, Mother,)

55
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:11,123
(Grandma and Auntie,)

56
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,202
(Xiaoyao and I are back.)

57
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:16,362
(Sorry for the wait.)

58
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:56,202
- Mother.
- Mother, Auntie.

59
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:59,603
Look, I picked
these Poinciana flowers today.

60
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:00,603
Have a smell.

61
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,163
They smell so good.

62
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:04,922
Granny,

63
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:07,283
the Poinciana flower
I picked is so sweet.

64
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:08,242
Xiaoyao.

65
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:41,322
Your grandson is back.

66
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,762
Your granddaughter is back.

67
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,403
Come on over.

68
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:10,642
You don't look like your mother,

69
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:14,242
but your face and mouth

70
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:17,163
really resemble those
of your grandmother.

71
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:21,482
Exactly like hers when I met her.

72
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:25,202
I hadn't seen my grandmother
when she was young,

73
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:27,322
but in my memory,

74
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:30,123
she was always old and withered.

75
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:32,322
Not like other women

76
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:35,202
who always use spirit power
to maintain their youthful beauty.

77
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:39,723
Your grandmother
was once as young as you.

78
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:43,403
Her beauty and talent
were known throughout Dahuang.

79
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:45,443
Countless men

80
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,522
wanted to marry her.

81
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:57,922
You want to say
she married the wrong man.

82
00:07:58,563 --> 00:07:59,683
You're really smart.

83
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:04,042
Is that a compliment or a dig?

84
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:29,522
I thought you were so enthralled
by the romance of Haoling

85
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:32,603
that you forgot how to come back.

86
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:38,923
I have kept you waiting so long.

87
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:43,882
What is your purpose of coming back?

88
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:47,442
Think about it before you speak.

89
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:49,483
I want to hear the truth.

90
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,403
I want the Xiyan Mountain.

91
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:01,723
And there's another reason

92
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:04,202
you might not believe.

93
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:07,603
I missed you.

94
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,963
Your two royal uncles and a few brothers

95
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,562
all want the Xiyan Mountain.

96
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:28,882
If you want it, find your own way.

97
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:30,963
I won't help you.

98
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:35,043
Just like the road back to Zhaoyun Peak.

99
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,603
Only when you came to me
would I see you.

100
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:41,363
Yes.

101
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:48,043
Don't blame me for being heartless.

102
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:52,283
If you don't earn it on your own,

103
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:54,762
even if it's given to you,

104
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:57,403
you won't be able to keep it.

105
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:01,762
I understand.

106
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:05,568
(Cui Hall)

107
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:10,803
Brother,

108
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:12,363
Cang Xuan

109
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:15,442
got to Zhaoyun Peak just
because of Xiaoyao's tantrum.

110
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,603
It made it too easy for him.

111
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:22,243
He would become more unrestrained.

112
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:24,768
So what?

113
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:27,904
His little tricks

114
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:29,728
are not worth mentioning.

115
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:31,243
Father is getting old after all.

116
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,363
Surely, he will feel some pity
for his grandchildren.

117
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:36,202
Cang Xuan is getting close to Father.

118
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:38,403
We should worry
about the worst-case scenario.

119
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:44,762
Leave.

120
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:56,483
What you said makes sense.

121
00:10:57,762 --> 00:10:58,762
It's time to put an end

122
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:01,603
to this once and for all.

123
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:02,963
The sooner, the better.

124
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:16,882
This is where we lived
when we were kids.

125
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:24,803
Mother.

126
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:27,283
Come and see the swing
your aunt and I made for you.

127
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:27,882
Try it.

128
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:29,403
Come on, Xiaoyao, get on.

129
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:30,562
Be careful.

130
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:31,403
I'll push you.

131
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:32,882
Is it fun?

132
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:33,682
Yes.

133
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:34,843
Do you like it?

134
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:35,680
Yes.

135
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,403
The swing is gone.

136
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:11,283
At least this is
still the same as before.

137
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:14,483
At least we are both here.

138
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:45,603
Junior Master.

139
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:03,723
Brother.

140
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:05,002
Tushan Jing.

141
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:16,522
Didn't we always greet
each other like this before?

142
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:21,283
Why did you dodge?

143
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:27,363
You said you forgot
everything from the past.

144
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,363
I don't believe it at all.

145
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:36,322
I said it

146
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,442
just to compensate
for what my mother owed you.

147
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:40,202
Compensation?

148
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:44,882
What can you compensate with?

149
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:47,403
Without you,

150
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:49,843
I would be the best.

151
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:52,043
But with you,

152
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,522
I am dispensable.

153
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,682
The biggest compensation you can give me

154
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:02,963
is to completely

155
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,762
and forever disappear.

156
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:32,243
Princess.

157
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:39,283
I don't know
what Prince Cang Xuan was thinking.

158
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:41,723
He was up all night yesterday,

159
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:43,522
spending hours making a swing.

160
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,322
It's exactly the same
as the one from our childhood.

161
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,562
Do you want to swing?

162
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:58,923
The person who pushed the swing is gone.

163
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:01,442
You didn't waste

164
00:16:01,882 --> 00:16:03,762
the chess skills I taught you.

165
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:07,843
I don't dare to slack off for a day.

166
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:20,522
I've been ignoring you these years.

167
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,642
Have you ever hated me?

168
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:37,363
Suffering is not a pleasant experience,

169
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,363
but when I overcome it,

170
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:42,682
all of it will turn
into my own strength.

171
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:53,963
For this game of chess,

172
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:57,122
you played well.

173
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,442
Thank you for your praise.

174
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:14,442
Grandfather,

175
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:17,523
after sitting for a long time,
you should move around.

176
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,523
I'll accompany you for a walk.

177
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:23,402
That's a good idea.

178
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:15,243
His Majesty and Prince Cang Xuan
have gone out for a walk.

179
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:16,843
They should be back soon.

180
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:18,963
You might as well go in
and sit for a while.

181
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:23,682
Can I go in?

182
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:25,243
His Majesty has informed us

183
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,003
the Zhaoyun Hall is your home.

184
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:29,402
You can move around here freely.

185
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:19,562
(I had never seen my grandmother)

186
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:22,523
(wear such dazzling jewelry.)

187
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:38,363
If you like it, take it.

188
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:45,402
Women wear these things for men.

189
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:47,442
If I wear it,

190
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,322
even if a man looks at me,

191
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:52,562
how do I know if he's looking at me

192
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,562
or these sparkling gems?

193
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,282
If I misunderstand him

194
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:00,723
and fall for him,

195
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:02,682
wouldn't it be a huge loss?

196
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,963
I never thought that my grandmother

197
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,922
would be willing to dress up like this.

198
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,562
It seems that my grandmother
really loved you.

199
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:17,922
How can you talk
about your elders like that?

200
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:20,082
I speak straightforwardly.

201
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,643
If you don't want
to hear it, just ignore it.

202
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:26,363
After all, your ability to play dumb

203
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:28,082
is top-notch.

204
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:33,442
So you're this kind of person,

205
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,363
being cold and indifferent,

206
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:39,763
and completely different
from your mother and grandmother.

207
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,643
What's so good about being like them?

208
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,042
They ended up suffering
while men reap the benefits.

209
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:47,003
I've suffered enough in my life.

210
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:50,322
I won't go looking for trouble from men.

211
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:54,883
You're in the royal family.

212
00:21:56,442 --> 00:21:57,843
Thinking this way

213
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,442
is a good thing.

214
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:07,483
I'm tired.

215
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:10,282
You may leave.

216
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,202
- I'll leave.
- I'll leave.

217
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:32,442
Isn't it just like the swing
from our childhood?

218
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:37,562
Did you really come back
for our grandfather?

219
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:39,603
Yes.

220
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:42,802
I thought you would resent him.

221
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,322
He is not only our grandfather

222
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:48,003
but also a king.

223
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:50,643
He has hurt many people,

224
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:52,243
including you and me.

225
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,243
But he didn't fail his people.

226
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:55,843
The older I get,

227
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,042
the more I understand his choices.

228
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:00,483
While he was hurting us,

229
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:04,843
he was hurting himself too.

230
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:10,243
Okay, I can't argue with you.

231
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:12,442
I'll never provoke him again

232
00:23:12,763 --> 00:23:13,963
in the future.

233
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:15,123
There's no need for that.

234
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,322
Say what you think.

235
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,723
I think he likes your frankness.

236
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:23,680
Our grandfather is not an ordinary man.

237
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:25,682
He can take your resentment.

238
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:28,736
Xuan,

239
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,808
to become the master
of the Xiyan Mountain

240
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
do you have to be like our grandfather?

241
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,082
Being strong and cold.

242
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:44,003
I'm not qualified to answer it yet.

243
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,082
Because I'm not yet,

244
00:23:49,282 --> 00:23:50,202
or I should say,

245
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:54,483
I don't even know
if I can keep the Zhaoyun Hall.

246
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:57,082
Can I help you with something?

247
00:23:58,162 --> 00:24:00,042
You know I've been using you, right?

248
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:04,672
You mean Tushan Jing?

249
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,963
Tushan Jing is not a fool.

250
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,442
The current situation
is clearly in favor of my uncles.

251
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:14,368
Helping me has no benefits
for the Tushan Family.

252
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:17,682
It was because of you
that he helped me again and again.

253
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,523
So are Fenglong and Xinyue.

254
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:23,082
Because of your concern for me,

255
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:24,843
they considered you

256
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:26,723
when they scrutinized me.

257
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:31,202
But I feel like I've done nothing.

258
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:33,003
You've done enough.

259
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:34,976
I was able to return here

260
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:38,883
because you restored your identity
as Princess of Haoling for me.

261
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:41,523
Your seeing me
as the most important one

262
00:24:42,282 --> 00:24:43,963
is the greatest help to me.

263
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:49,442
There's still too little
I can do for you.

264
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:53,483
Xiaoyao.

265
00:24:57,603 --> 00:25:00,123
I know you don't care
about getting your hands dirty,

266
00:25:01,763 --> 00:25:02,643
but I do.

267
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:06,363
You just need to stand by my side,

268
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:08,523
and that's enough.

269
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:18,723
Yiying,

270
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:21,363
you're getting better
at managing things.

271
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,003
The accounts are well sorted out.

272
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:25,843
It's all thanks to you.

273
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:40,562
Grandmother.

274
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:41,682
Sit.

275
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:06,562
Thanks, Miss Fangfeng.

276
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:09,243
I need to have
a private chat with grandmother.

277
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:14,162
Grandmother, I'll take my leave.

278
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,603
(Grand Madam of Tushan)

279
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,963
Yiying handles things gracefully
and knows when to advance and retreat.

280
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,963
If you have her
manage the family affairs,

281
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,603
I can really rest easy.

282
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:47,763
Get up.

283
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,883
What do you have to say on your knees?

284
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,480
Please cancel my engagement
with Miss Fangfeng.

285
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:54,643
What do you mean?

286
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:55,763
Grandma,

287
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:58,922
Miss Fangfeng and I had never met

288
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:00,123
and didn't know each other

289
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:02,723
when my mother arranged
our engagement from her sickbed.

290
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,603
I know these years,
she has been serving you

291
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:08,243
and has worked hard
to manage the household.

292
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:10,442
But I have no feelings for her,

293
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:11,843
and she has no interest in me.

294
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:12,843
Shut up.

295
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:15,963
It's true that you have
no affection for her,

296
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:18,243
but she has for you.

297
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:20,442
After you disappeared back then,

298
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:24,082
Yiying came to Qingqiu
in a wedding dress.

299
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:27,802
She swore she'd be
part of our family for life.

300
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,442
All these years,
she's had no legitimate status,

301
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:33,802
but she's been managing
our household for over a decade.

302
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:37,760
If you cancel the engagement,
what about her reputation?

303
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:40,243
What about
the Fangfeng Family's reputation?

304
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:43,162
If we break our promise,

305
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:45,202
what about our family's reputation?

306
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:47,402
Are you going
to let our family bear the stigma

307
00:28:47,402 --> 00:28:50,042
and be ridiculed
by all the people in Dahuang

308
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,843
because of you?

309
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:56,224
Grandmother.

310
00:28:57,408 --> 00:28:58,912
I know I'm selfish.

311
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:01,202
I'll give up the position
as family leader

312
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:02,363
and bear the reproach

313
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:03,963
just to cancel the engagement.

314
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,003
You, you...

315
00:29:09,802 --> 00:29:11,282
Grandmother!

316
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:13,883
Grand Madam.

317
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:15,322
Grandmother!

318
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:16,322
Get a physician!

319
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:17,523
Hurry up!

320
00:29:18,162 --> 00:29:18,802
Grandmother!

321
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:41,162
What is this?

322
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:43,162
I just killed a fish demon in the water.

323
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:45,042
This is its fish core.

324
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,603
Hou, could you give it to me?

325
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:52,003
Xinyue, I need this fish core.

326
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:54,723
I'll get you another one next time.

327
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:56,442
Alright, I got to go.

328
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:58,322
I'm going to get changed

329
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:00,523
and rinse off.

330
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:11,322
With Tushan Hou being around,

331
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:14,643
what do we need Tushan Jing for?

332
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,963
Miss, something terrible has happened!

333
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:20,243
What's all the shouting about?

334
00:30:20,322 --> 00:30:21,603
This is Qingqiu.

335
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:25,162
Miss, the junior master
formally proposed

336
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:27,483
to cancel the engagement with you.

337
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:29,402
What?

338
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:32,162
Grand Madam did not agree

339
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,603
and fainted from anger.

340
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:37,843
Tushan Jing, how dare he...

341
00:30:40,603 --> 00:30:41,483
Miss,

342
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:44,763
I know you don't like the junior master,

343
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:46,363
but these days

344
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:49,442
you've been too cold to him.

345
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,082
So he can find me repugnant,
but I can't find him the same?

346
00:30:52,562 --> 00:30:54,843
Miss, that's Tushan Jing,

347
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,682
the future leader of the Tushan Family.

348
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,243
If you really get
your engagement canceled,

349
00:30:59,603 --> 00:31:01,082
I'm afraid
I'll be beaten to death first

350
00:31:01,763 --> 00:31:05,243
by Lord and Madam.

351
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:44,802
Someone!

352
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:50,322
Master.

353
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,603
Did you touch the wine inside?

354
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:54,963
No, I didn't.

355
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:56,562
Lan Xiang, what about you?

356
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:58,123
Master,

357
00:31:58,202 --> 00:32:01,042
all these things
are usually handled by Jing Ye.

358
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:03,162
I didn't even touch it.

359
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:07,123
Master, is there
something wrong with the wine?

360
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:12,843
No, it's nothing.

361
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:14,802
I just wanted to tell you

362
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:17,123
not to send the green plum wine
to Prince Cang Xuan now.

363
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,202
The bottles with peach blossom paintings
were specially designed by you.

364
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:22,643
There are nine in a set

365
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:24,682
and 12 sets in total
based on the four seasons.

366
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:26,843
We've only sent four sets so far.

367
00:32:27,202 --> 00:32:28,723
How can we stop sending them

368
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:30,963
when there are still eight sets left?

369
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,123
Things change with the seasons,
and people change too.

370
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:37,442
You can leave now.

371
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:40,723
Yes.

372
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:06,922
You seem to love
this green plum wine so much.

373
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,523
There are only a few bottles left.

374
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:10,322
I'll go tell His Highness later

375
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,123
and get some more over.

376
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:17,802
This wine was given
by a friend of His Highness

377
00:33:18,003 --> 00:33:19,562
and he hasn't sent any more recently.

378
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:21,963
I'm afraid His Highness
doesn't have much either.

379
00:33:24,523 --> 00:33:26,042
(Sending you the green plum wine)

380
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:28,162
(is not just out of selfishness.)

381
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,523
(If you receive my wine,)

382
00:33:32,922 --> 00:33:34,523
(you'll know that I'm missing you.)

383
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:42,003
You like this green plum wine so much.

384
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:46,082
You even keep staring
at the empty bottle.

385
00:33:47,322 --> 00:33:48,843
I just took a few sips of wine.

386
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,402
Even you are nagging about it.

387
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,802
I'll make you
some mulberry wine another day.

388
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,082
I can make sure
it'll be more to your liking.

389
00:33:55,682 --> 00:33:56,523
Okay.

390
00:33:57,963 --> 00:33:59,243
I need to go to Xiyan Town.

391
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:00,202
I'll take you with me,

392
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:01,643
so you won't be idle.

393
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:03,682
Sure.

394
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:07,744
(Cabaret in Xiyan Town)

395
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,402
I didn't expect you to take me
to such a place for relaxation.

396
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:34,003
Quite unique indeed.

397
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:37,122
Because I have a unique sister.

398
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:40,402
I thought you saw me as your brother.

399
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:41,402
That's fine too.

400
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:44,723
As a man, you are
just a bit shorter than me.

401
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:52,402
Sir, would you like to listen
to music or watch a dance?

402
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:54,682
Do you want it to be lively or quiet?

403
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:58,723
Please go upstairs, sir.

404
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:25,523
This way, please.

405
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:29,442
I'll wait for you here.

406
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,003
Okay.

407
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,043
Just enjoy the music and dance.
I'll be back soon.

408
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,083
If you with the brilliant white colt

409
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:38,963
would brightly come to me.

410
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:41,483
(Jin Xuan)
You should be a duke or a marquis.

411
00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:44,083
Enjoying yourself without end.

412
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:46,483
Be on your guard against idly wandering.

413
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:49,483
Deal vigorously
with your thoughts of retirement.

414
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:52,963
It's been a long time.
I hope you're well.

415
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:58,723
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

416
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:02,323
Jin Xuan, please get up.

417
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:09,523
What crime have you committed?

418
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:12,763
Due to a lack of manpower
in Bluebird Agency, we didn't report

419
00:37:13,122 --> 00:37:16,122
the two assassination attempts on you
by the Fangfeng Family in time.

420
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:17,402
That's my fault.

421
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:19,362
Please punish me, Your Highness.

422
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,362
A thousand years ago, my elder uncle
established the Bluebird Agency.

423
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,323
He had spies all over Dahuang.

424
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:29,723
After he and Auntie sacrificed
themselves, I wandered in foreign lands.

425
00:37:30,842 --> 00:37:33,602
You've managed to keep
the agency up until now,

426
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:35,162
which is a miracle.

427
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:37,003
Thanks to your information,

428
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:39,402
I managed to dodge
my uncle's many attempts

429
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,483
on my life.

430
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:45,803
Jin Xuan, this is not your fault.

431
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,763
Please stand up and talk.

432
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:55,642
Thank you for your forgiveness.

433
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:02,283
This is the latest information
I've collected.

434
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:03,803
Please review it, Your Highness.

435
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:11,362
There's something

436
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,083
that I don't know if I should say.

437
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:15,442
Feel free to say it.

438
00:38:16,323 --> 00:38:19,922
Rumor has it
that the King of Xiyan is ill.

439
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:24,723
The power of the Fifth and Seventh Kings
has grown stronger in recent years.

440
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:28,523
Many masters in Dahuang have
either openly or secretly joined them.

441
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:31,043
Although you have guards protecting you,

442
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:33,682
you are no match for them.

443
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:34,963
Your Highness,

444
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:37,283
please do not leave Zhaoyun Peak.

445
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:23,642
Tonight, you'll have
this beauty serve you.

446
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:17,122
You have a good figure.

447
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:21,402
Show your face,
and I may let you serve me tonight.

448
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:31,442
How can you be so rude to a beauty?

449
00:40:32,442 --> 00:40:35,402
This is a place for seeking pleasure,
not a hunting ground.

450
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:39,283
Only with each other's consent
can both enjoy themselves.

451
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:40,882
Besides,

452
00:40:42,144 --> 00:40:43,424
this young lady,

453
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:45,003
like us,

454
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,283
is a guest here.

455
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:49,842
When it comes to cherishing beauty,

456
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:52,442
no one in Dahuang can compare with you.

457
00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:09,922
Where are you going?

458
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:11,483
I...

459
00:41:14,882 --> 00:41:15,682
What are you looking at?

460
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:18,922
It's time to go back.

461
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:31,424
Master, a message from Xiyan.

462
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:44,402
(Xiyan is fraught with peril.)

463
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:46,723
(Xiaoyao may encounter danger.)

464
00:41:47,362 --> 00:41:49,602
Prepare a carriage.
I'm going to Xiyan Town.

465
00:41:49,963 --> 00:41:50,723
Yes, Master.

466
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:52,483
Wait.

467
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:57,723
Not Xiyan Town,

468
00:41:58,563 --> 00:41:59,083
but Zhiyi.

469
00:41:59,563 --> 00:41:59,963
Yes.

470
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,500
(Tushan Mansion)

471
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:07,842
Master, hold on please.

472
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:14,362
I heard you're going to Zhiyi.

473
00:42:14,362 --> 00:42:15,882
I've prepared some snacks for you

474
00:42:17,362 --> 00:42:18,362
to eat on the road.

475
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:19,922
No, thanks.

476
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:29,882
Miss burnt her hand

477
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:31,202
when making them for you.

478
00:42:32,243 --> 00:42:33,162
You're a blabbermouth.

479
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:35,963
Ill-mannered girl.

480
00:42:39,162 --> 00:42:42,402
I was too clumsy.
It's nothing, just a minor injury.

481
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:52,362
I'll postpone the wedding date.

482
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,323
Treat Yiying as a sister

483
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:56,682
for now.

484
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:58,963
When the time is right,

485
00:42:59,803 --> 00:43:01,362
we will negotiate the cancellation

486
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:05,003
of the engagement with her family
in a civil manner.

487
00:43:05,632 --> 00:43:09,283
This way, Yiying won't lose face

488
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:10,523
and become a laughingstock.

489
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:13,362
Thank you.

490
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:20,642
We have a special burn medicine.

491
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:23,483
You can ask the physician for a bottle.

492
00:43:38,523 --> 00:43:40,523
Have you ever seen
Xiang Liu's real face?

493
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:43,842
No, he always wears
a mask when I see him.

494
00:43:47,362 --> 00:43:49,362
He's been wanted in Xiyan
for hundreds of years.

495
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:52,362
He's the only one
on the list without a portrait.

496
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:53,803
Has no one seen his face

497
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:56,122
in all these years?

498
00:43:56,922 --> 00:43:58,723
Many people have seen his face,

499
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:00,842
but he's a nine-headed demon.

500
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:04,122
It is said that he has nine faces
and 81 incarnations.

501
00:44:05,122 --> 00:44:06,803
Those who have seen him
contradict each other.

502
00:44:07,922 --> 00:44:09,283
Once, a portrait of him was drawn,

503
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:11,602
and it looked exactly
like my sixth uncle.

504
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:15,763
(Was the Xiang Liu I saw
just an illusion too?)

505
00:44:16,763 --> 00:44:17,602
But it's strange.

506
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:21,043
Since his illusion
can even confuse rare weapons.

507
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:22,642
Why does he need to wear a mask?

508
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:25,283
After all, he can
change his face at will.

509
00:44:25,682 --> 00:44:27,043
Maybe he's like me,

510
00:44:27,712 --> 00:44:29,216
just wanting to be his true self,

511
00:44:29,952 --> 00:44:31,283
not interested in illusions.

512
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:33,323
Why did you suddenly mention him?

513
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:35,283
I just suddenly thought of it.

514
00:44:38,464 --> 00:44:40,563
You're not Wen Xiaoliu
from Qingshui Town anymore.

515
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:43,362
I know.
