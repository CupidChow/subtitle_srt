00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,704
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,915
What do you want to show me?

4
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:43,395
Wait a moment.

5
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:51,075
Here she comes.

6
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:55,035
Mr. Xuan is handsome,
capable, and speaks kindly.

7
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:58,035
It is a blessing for the girl
who marries him.

8
00:01:58,874 --> 00:01:59,595
What?

9
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:00,754
Are you smitten?

10
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,395
Why are we watching women?

11
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:04,754
To meet your needs?

12
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:06,995
No rush.

13
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:07,794
In my opinion,

14
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,554
it's better to live
an honest and simple life.

15
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,075
What if I am smitten?

16
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:14,995
Look, here they come.

17
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:26,075
What...

18
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:44,275
Your choice.

19
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,954
As a member of a prestigious family,

20
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:02,114
even if you don't have a concubine,

21
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:04,954
you must have a few stunning maids, right?

22
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:08,875
Comparing the one inside

23
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,355
with your maid,

24
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:11,554
who is prettier?

25
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,674
What kind of woman do you like?

26
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:22,554
Is it the innocent type
like a little white rabbit,

27
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:25,674
or the passionate type
like the one inside?

28
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,995
Why are you blushing?

29
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:34,235
Do you also want to get married?

30
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,155
Skinny!

31
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,355
You've learned to visit brothels, right?

32
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:55,194
Where did you get the money?

33
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:00,235
Xiaoliu, why are you here?

34
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:05,754
My name is Sang Tian'er.

35
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:08,640
I'm in love with Skinny,
and I didn't take his money.

36
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:10,875
Doesn't that mean you're losing out?

37
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:13,674
I'm willing to.

38
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,675
Are you willing to
spend your whole life with him?

39
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:24,075
I am.

40
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:24,955
Get out of the way!

41
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:26,994
I'm asking her.

42
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,314
I'm willing.

43
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:49,555
Go back.

44
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:51,395
We'll decide your wedding date.

45
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:54,955
Listen, Xiaoliu may look fierce,
but he keeps his word.

46
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:56,128
You've really grown up. Go home.

47
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,355
Xiaoliu, it hurts.

48
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:58,235
Xiaoliu, be gentle.

49
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:00,034
Gentle. Xiaoliu.

50
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,235
Go in. Still running away?

51
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:17,754
I really want to marry Tian'er.

52
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:19,835
- Get down.
- I think about it all day long.

53
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:20,795
I'll beat you.

54
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:23,994
Come here.

55
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:24,874
Enough.

56
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:28,032
If you want to hit him,
do it out of my sight.

57
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,194
He's not a kid anymore.

58
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,115
At least leave him some dignity.

59
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:36,594
I have to kill you today.

60
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:37,714
Come here.

61
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:38,474
Come here.

62
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,355
Come here.

63
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,515
Stop it.

64
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:48,635
I'm talking to you.

65
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:53,235
Look at you.

66
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:54,515
If you want to get married,

67
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,274
find a good girl, won't you?

68
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:58,994
I'm loving Tian'er,

69
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,034
and Tian'er genuinely
wants to marry me as well.

70
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,314
I'm going to marry her.

71
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,274
You, you, you...
Are you asking for a beating?

72
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:06,115
I'll beat you to death.

73
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:12,194
When living your life with a woman,

74
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,314
the most important thing
is still your own comfort.

75
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,955
We, as elders,
shouldn't interfere too much.

76
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:25,314
You've made up your mind?

77
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:31,115
Hopeless.

78
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:33,555
Mu,

79
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:35,555
if that's the case,

80
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:38,395
let's find a way to redeem her.

81
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:39,754
Once we redeem her,

82
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:41,075
we'll do what we have to do.

83
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:43,795
For those Pimply enjoyed,
Skinny should have them as well.

84
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:50,955
Thank you, Mu.

85
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:51,915
Thank you, Xiaoliu.

86
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:32,515
Where's Tian'er?

87
00:07:32,594 --> 00:07:33,835
Why didn't she come back with you?

88
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:41,075
The bawd's asking for too much.

89
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,434
Even if we sell Rejuvenation Hall,

90
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:44,795
we still can't pay for it.

91
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,994
You should choose another woman.

92
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:50,395
No.

93
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:51,754
I don't want anyone but Tian'er.

94
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:15,154
Sang Tian'er is not young,

95
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:16,675
and she's not the top woman.

96
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:19,034
Normally,

97
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:21,835
the bawd wouldn't hold her back
and not allow us to redeem her.

98
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:25,274
Someone's playing dirty.

99
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,115
Could it be Xiang Liu?

100
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,154
Because last time I drew his face.

101
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:41,954
If that's the case,

102
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,315
I need to find Xiang Liu.

103
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:47,274
I can't let my actions
ruin Skinny's marriage.

104
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:51,875
Don't go.

105
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:52,875
I'll go.

106
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,355
Don't bother.

107
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:55,875
Don't provoke him.

108
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,355
Anyway, whoever goes to find him,

109
00:08:58,594 --> 00:08:59,555
let's table it tomorrow.

110
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:00,514
I'm tired.

111
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:01,154
I'm going to sleep.

112
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:03,675
Skinny hasn't come back yet.

113
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:05,555
Remember to find him.

114
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:08,714
I'm out of money.

115
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:10,714
It's on me.

116
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,115
Bro, so nice of you.

117
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,355
Has Xiaoliu been busy lately?

118
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,594
I wanted to invite him
to taste the new wine,

119
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:32,034
but I haven't seen him.

120
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:37,274
The wine is too strong.

121
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,675
Xiaoliu doesn't like it.

122
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:40,256
Then what kind of wine does he like?

123
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:41,714
Xiaoliu likes

124
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:43,274
mulberry wine the most.

125
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,795
Why does he like mulberry wine?

126
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:47,435
Because of his elder brother.

127
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,154
Because mulberry wine

128
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,394
reminds him

129
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:55,995
of his brother.

130
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,834
Who's his brother?

131
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:00,954
His brother is...

132
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:02,714
Is...

133
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:04,235
Is...

134
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:09,115
Skinny.

135
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:10,714
Skinny.

136
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:20,074
Who exactly is Wen Xiaoliu's brother?

137
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,154
His brother...

138
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,394
His brother is Mu.

139
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:41,675
Shiqi.

140
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:43,315
I came to pick him up.

141
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,714
You're just in time.

142
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:46,235
I was about to send him home.

143
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:53,154
It's fine.

144
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,315
It's my treat.

145
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,474
Don't give him
such strong wine next time.

146
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,514
Next time, I'll treat you.

147
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,274
He actually dares to come to me.

148
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:58,755
Is he planning to repay me?

149
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:10,514
Acted tough, huh?

150
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:11,594
Acted tough.

151
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:12,960
Let's see what you got.

152
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:13,755
Acted tough, huh?

153
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:16,154
Acted tough. Let's see what you got.

154
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,115
Your Lordship, are you here?

155
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,235
Thankfully,
it's not that nine-headed demon.

156
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,474
I still haven't figured out
how to beg for mercy.

157
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:40,074
Your Lordship,

158
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,714
as you're a magnanimous lord,

159
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,115
don't be angry with

160
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,714
someone insignificant like me.

161
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:46,394
If you get sick from anger,

162
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:47,594
you might not care,

163
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,115
but it would break my heart.

164
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:51,915
That nine-headed demon

165
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,435
boasts brains but no heart.

166
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:54,995
Pleading like this will be in vain.

167
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,115
I'm telling you,

168
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,034
don't think I scare you.

169
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:03,634
Believe it or not, in the future,

170
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:06,115
I won't use my blood
to heal your wounds.

171
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:08,755
You have so many enemies,
and you are bad-tempered.

172
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,714
Without me,
you're doomed sooner or later.

173
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:15,795
It may be too much.

174
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:18,208
Will he really kill me
if I act like this?

175
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:19,555
Forget it.

176
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:21,875
I'll just lie down and let him eat me.

177
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,755
I'll give you three choices.

178
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,315
First, whip me forty times.

179
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:01,995
Second, kick me out of here.

180
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:04,915
Third, listen to my serious matter.

181
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:06,235
A serious matter for real.

182
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:08,154
Have you bathed yet?

183
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:13,154
I've washed well,
just waiting for you.

184
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:46,995
It's okay.
I don't need your help.

185
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:47,474
I...

186
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,675
Look, I'm walking straight, right?

187
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:53,315
What happened?

188
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:54,514
Why did you drink so much?

189
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:55,634
Come on, have a drink, cheers.

190
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,875
Who's drinking with you?

191
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:58,514
Leave him to me. I'll do it.

192
00:15:58,755 --> 00:15:59,915
I'm home.

193
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,634
How much did you drink?

194
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:02,514
Such a grown-up.

195
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:03,195
I am not drunk.

196
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:05,154
But you still made us worry.

197
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:06,115
I didn't drink much.

198
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,034
Take your time.

199
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:11,954
Be careful.

200
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:01,394
Why are you sucking so much?

201
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:03,714
I only know you have nine heads,

202
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:05,595
but I don't know you have nine stomachs.

203
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,715
Can't you save some for next time?

204
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:22,464
Tell me

205
00:17:24,114 --> 00:17:25,394
when I should

206
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:28,595
bite this off?

207
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:33,675
How about tonight?

208
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:35,835
Tonight isn't a good time.

209
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:38,315
Such a beautiful night.

210
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:40,675
How elegant it is to talk under the moon.

211
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,475
You'd better kill me until

212
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:46,195
I really want to kill you.

213
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:48,754
Don't you want to kill me now?

214
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:50,634
I don't.

215
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:54,435
You clearly know that
I don't and won't kill you.

216
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:56,114
I don't know.

217
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:58,315
Don't you hate me?

218
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,994
You don't know but you
dared to meet me with injuries?

219
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:02,675
You think I'm a little bunny?

220
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:05,114
Or your nine heads
got bumped during a fight?

221
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:10,874
I don't hate you.

222
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:12,195
I really don't hate you.

223
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:16,675
Even though you whipped me forty times,

224
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:18,315
and always exploit me,

225
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,034
I don't really care.

226
00:18:21,715 --> 00:18:24,675
Because I'm lonely.

227
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:31,195
I had a strange disease before,

228
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,195
so I hid in the deep mountain.

229
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:34,634
I couldn't meet anyone for decades.

230
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:37,114
Then I met a snake demon.

231
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:39,354
I knew the snake demon wanted to eat me,

232
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:40,994
but even knowing the danger,

233
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:42,595
I still provoked it all the time.

234
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:45,435
Because only it

235
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:46,754
could understand what I was saying.

236
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,224
It's said that Heaven favors deity,

237
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,368
but I think it's the mortal it favors.

238
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:56,274
The mortal is no different from deity.

239
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:59,154
The only difference is their short life.

240
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:02,555
But look at that moon.

241
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:04,514
A thousand years ago,

242
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:05,435
it looked just like that.

243
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:07,994
Even the most beautiful scenery

244
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,675
becomes boring over time.

245
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,034
That snake later...

246
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:55,835
Died.

247
00:19:58,154 --> 00:19:59,274
You killed it?

248
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:02,208
It's the nine-tailed fox demon.

249
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,874
The fox demon wanted to catch me.

250
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:07,715
But the snake demon thought only it could eat me,

251
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:11,795
so it blocked the evil fox and died.

252
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:14,994
Interesting.

253
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:17,034
What about the fox?

254
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:18,475
I killed it.

255
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:21,195
You are that capable?

256
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:24,595
He should have killed me
as soon as he caught me.

257
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,675
But he locked me in a cage,

258
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,915
and forced me to eat disgusting things

259
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,034
because he wanted to fatten me up
before eating me.

260
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:32,994
But he forgot

261
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:36,195
fattening up the prey too much

262
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:39,675
will backfire.

263
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,274
What's wrong with you?

264
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:55,195
Nothing.

265
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,795
But you looked...

266
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:00,795
You mean

267
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:03,154
I'm just like that snake.

268
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,955
We're both the games for you
to alleviate loneliness.

269
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:08,915
Who knows?

270
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:10,315
Perhaps, to you,

271
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:12,195
I am the snake that amuses you.

272
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:18,154
Didn't you come to me for business?

273
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:23,715
Is the brothel on Nanhuai Street yours?

274
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,475
Why do you ask this?

275
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:28,994
Skinny wants to marry a girl from there.

276
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,234
You want me to let her go?

277
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:39,394
Is that brothel yours?

278
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:41,394
Name.

279
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:44,795
It seems not yours.

280
00:22:44,874 --> 00:22:45,835
I thought so.

281
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:48,034
You wouldn't be difficult like that.

282
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:50,634
Alright, I don't need your help.

283
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:51,874
I'll ask someone else.

284
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,154
Is this the business you mentioned?

285
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:56,754
Yeah.

286
00:22:57,354 --> 00:22:59,354
Skinny's marriage matters.

287
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:31,435
You,

288
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:35,034
at most, are that snake egg
eaten by others.

289
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:27,744
Bad Xiang Liu,

290
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:29,568
next time I see you,

291
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:31,354
I will definitely kill you.

292
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:42,034
Bad Xiang Liu.

293
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:43,915
Bad Xiang Liu.

294
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:45,195
Xiaoliu!

295
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:48,595
Shiqi.

296
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:49,715
Shiqi.

297
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:52,994
Where did you hurt?

298
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:53,795
Is it severe?

299
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:54,675
It's okay.

300
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:55,595
I'm thick-skinned.

301
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:56,435
It's okay.

302
00:25:04,274 --> 00:25:04,955
It hurts.

303
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:17,274
Shiqi, my leg hurts.

304
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:36,874
Shiqi,

305
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:39,075
I can't walk again.

306
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,104
Shiqi.

307
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:06,784
Shiqi.

308
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:10,354
It hurts.

309
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:12,352
Where does it hurt?

310
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:15,114
If you talk to me, I won't hurt.

311
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:26,114
Don't leave me behind
deliberately in the future.

312
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:28,234
I worry a lot

313
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:29,795
when I can't find you.

314
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:32,955
I got it.

315
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:54,394
It's okay, it's okay.

316
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:02,915
Your bandaging skills are so good

317
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,315
that you can be a mentor.

318
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:09,195
Go to sleep.

319
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:24,514
Skinny's marriage

320
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:26,595
was not stopped by Xiang Liu

321
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:28,154
but by another one.

322
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:30,994
It's Xuan from the Winery.

323
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:36,754
You are really smart.

324
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:30,595
Xiaoliu,

325
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:32,114
you came to buy wine so early.

326
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,154
I have a favor to ask.

327
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:34,994
Let's talk inside.

328
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:36,555
Alright.

329
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:38,274
Thank you.

330
00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:44,435
Thank you.

331
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:45,874
Xiaoliu, please go ahead.

332
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:49,835
Skinny wants to marry Sang Tian'er.

333
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:52,915
I hope you could bend the rules.

334
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:56,354
I know

335
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:58,795
I'm asking for too much
based on our relationship.

336
00:28:59,195 --> 00:28:59,994
But

337
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:01,874
it is Skinny's lifelong matter,

338
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:04,795
I could only ask for
your help brazenly.

339
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:06,915
Why do you think

340
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,154
I can help you on this matter?

341
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,514
I don't know the
real identities of yours and Nian's.

342
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:13,835
I don't want to know either.

343
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:15,595
But as you are not ordinary,

344
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:16,874
I believe,

345
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:20,315
as long as you kindly step back,

346
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:22,354
you could definitely help me.

347
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:23,835
Speaking of real identity,

348
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:26,394
I'm interested in you.

349
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:28,955
Me.

350
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:32,915
I've lived in Qingshui Town
for almost thirty years.

351
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,634
I have no connection

352
00:29:34,754 --> 00:29:36,195
with any power.

353
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:39,634
I just want to live a tranquil life,

354
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:42,634
watching Skinny and Pimply
get married and have children,

355
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,715
and helping Mu enjoy his old age.

356
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:46,915
The only thing I ask for

357
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:49,754
is nothing more than what the ordinary want,
a peaceful and healthy family.

358
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:50,715
So,

359
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:53,354
I hope you could help me.

360
00:29:56,835 --> 00:29:58,555
A peaceful and healthy family.

361
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:02,754
What you ask for

362
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:06,154
is more than
what ordinary people ask for.

363
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,394
If possible,

364
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:14,435
I also hope to live a tranquil life
with my family.

365
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:17,994
Yes, yes.

366
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:19,874
You are right.

367
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:23,354
I will never come again
and disrupt your life with Nian.

368
00:30:23,675 --> 00:30:25,315
I guarantee to let you live in peace.

369
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:26,754
You can rest assured about this.

370
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:35,114
When it's time to attend the wedding,
remember to invite me.

371
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:38,754
Alright, alright.

372
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,675
Thank you.

373
00:30:46,955 --> 00:30:47,675
Shiqi.

374
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:53,034
I'm fine.

375
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:55,595
It's just that I was too happy
and didn't stand steady.

376
00:30:57,195 --> 00:30:57,795
Help me up.

377
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,715
Mr. Xuan, we will leave you.

378
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:02,354
Thank you.

379
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:03,715
Thank you.

380
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:04,394
Goodbye.

381
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:08,435
Shiqi, didn't I tell you
not to follow me?

382
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:11,715
I was just exchanging
a few words with Mr. Xuan.

383
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:12,754
I'm worried about you.

384
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:14,114
What's there to worry about?

385
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:14,955
Let's go home.

386
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:17,195
Jun Yi.

387
00:31:21,274 --> 00:31:21,795
My Lord.

388
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,354
Ye Shiqi is not simple.

389
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:24,835
Check his background.

390
00:31:25,354 --> 00:31:25,915
Yes.

391
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:37,874
Young Master, have a taste.

392
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:39,744
The mulberries we bought today
are especially delicious.

393
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:41,595
The wine made with them
will definitely be delicious.

394
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:56,128
We haven't eaten
iced mulberries for years.

395
00:31:56,274 --> 00:31:58,080
Young Master, let's make some.

396
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:07,315
I didn't say anything.

397
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:08,555
Wine-making.

398
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:09,874
Wine-making.

399
00:32:11,754 --> 00:32:12,394
Sang,

400
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:15,435
what do you think
if I wasn't the prince of Xiyan,

401
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:17,154
who would I be?

402
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,874
If you are not a prince of Xiyang,
Your Highness,

403
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:23,675
then your father and your mother

404
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:26,234
must not be the prince
and princess of Xiyang, right?

405
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:31,200
My father and mother didn't
want to be a prince and a princess either.

406
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,394
They just wanted to be an ordinary couple,

407
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:34,955
leading an ordinary life.

408
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,075
And then watch me
get married and have children,

409
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:41,955
enjoying a peaceful family.

410
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:46,634
My parents' wishes could not be realized.

411
00:32:47,754 --> 00:32:49,195
Then, let Wen Xiaoliu realize it.

412
00:32:52,075 --> 00:32:53,280
Good people get good returns.

413
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:55,114
Your Highness,
you will definitely find Princess.

414
00:33:00,315 --> 00:33:02,048
If I truly can find Xiaoyao,

415
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:04,514
living an ordinary life with her

416
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:07,904
in Qingshui Town

417
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:09,354
would be nice as well.

418
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:11,915
Then, I also want to join you.

419
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:14,994
I will make lots of mulberries for you

420
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,955
so that you can make and sell wine,

421
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:18,034
and enjoy iced mulberries.

422
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:20,154
Great.

423
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:28,874
Come on in.

424
00:33:30,154 --> 00:33:30,994
We're back.

425
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:33,795
Skinny!

426
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:37,634
I'm on my way.

427
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:42,475
Tian'er.

428
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:46,394
It's okay.

429
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:48,608
I'll go to Sister-in-law's place
to borrow some clothes for you.

430
00:33:52,994 --> 00:33:55,274
I'm going to buy some good wine
and food for the celebration.

431
00:33:57,354 --> 00:33:59,555
Shiqi,
come and help me with the groceries.

432
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:18,275
Believe it or not,

433
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,634
I can make your life worse than death.

434
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:29,755
I believe.

435
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:33,995
Why did you lure Skinny?

436
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:37,794
I don't believe

437
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:39,114
you could like him.

438
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,074
Three months ago,

439
00:34:43,554 --> 00:34:44,915
a man found me

440
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:49,594
and offered me a large sum of money
to lure Skinny and probe you.

441
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:52,354
Last night, that man came again

442
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:53,995
and gave me a sum of money.

443
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:57,195
He said, our deal was over.

444
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:58,915
Do you know that man?

445
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:01,594
No.

446
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,675
You should know

447
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:06,915
both the deities and the demons
can change their appearances.

448
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,154
But I'm just an ordinary mortal.

449
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,200
Skinny has always been saying
he wants to marry me,

450
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:20,794
but I never took it seriously.

451
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:23,035
With a background like mine,

452
00:35:23,314 --> 00:35:24,955
how can I believe what men say?

453
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:27,275
But I didn't expect

454
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:28,634
he actually

455
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:30,074
asked you to redeem me.

456
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:34,304
Actually,

457
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:36,195
until now, I don't believe

458
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,354
Skinny will be nice to me forever.

459
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:42,275
But I want to try.

460
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:53,204
If Skinny is willing to
stay with me wholeheartedly,

461
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:55,195
I am willing to be
wholehearted in return.

462
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:57,275
If I become unfaithful,

463
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,554
I won't end well in this life.

464
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:03,955
Tian'er!

465
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:05,475
Tian'er!

466
00:36:06,394 --> 00:36:07,154
Tian'er,

467
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:08,154
Sister-in-law said...

468
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:11,515
Xiaoliu, what...

469
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:14,035
Why?

470
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:16,074
Are you unhappy

471
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:17,235
when I ask your wife

472
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,594
to kowtow to me?

473
00:36:19,354 --> 00:36:19,995
No.

474
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:21,275
How dare I?

475
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,154
It is an interesting gamble.

476
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:56,554
What gamble?

477
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:01,314
Sang Tian'er doesn't
believe Skinny will sincerely

478
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:02,475
spend a lifetime with her.

479
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:05,154
Now what she shows to Skinny
is all pretense,

480
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:07,264
but Skinny doesn't know about it.

481
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:10,874
If Sang Tian'er is nice to him,
he will be nicer to Sang Tian'er.

482
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:13,114
Sang Tian'er sees that Skinny
treats better to her,

483
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:15,794
then the pretense
will be mixed with sincerity.

484
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:17,915
In the end, as time goes by,

485
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:19,755
the false will become true.

486
00:37:21,354 --> 00:37:23,314
But this process involves risks.

487
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:26,394
Sang Tian'er is gambling with her heart.

488
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:29,114
If Skinny reneges,

489
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,394
one of these two will die certainly.

490
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:48,594
My life is long.

491
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:51,195
I can wait for the ending.

492
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:57,755
Sang Tian'er

493
00:37:58,675 --> 00:37:59,675
is very brave.

494
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,915
People scorn
trading pretense for sincerity.

495
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:08,224
It's not worth it
for those who show sincerity.

496
00:38:08,874 --> 00:38:10,240
You, on the other hand, appreciate it.

497
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,915
Even if it's pretense,

498
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,235
she has bet her future,

499
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,272
giving that person a chance to trade
sincerity for sincerity.

500
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:25,594
How would you think so?

501
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:27,915
Interesting.

502
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:34,880
Why would Xuan buy over Sang Tian'er?

503
00:38:37,074 --> 00:38:39,554
It could be because last time,
I went to his house to steal a chicken,

504
00:38:40,394 --> 00:38:41,794
and he thought I had ulterior motives.

505
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:42,915
So he bought over Sang Tian'er

506
00:38:42,995 --> 00:38:44,435
to see who was backing me.

507
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:48,704
Fortunately, I didn't ask
Xiang Liu for help.

508
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:49,955
Otherwise,

509
00:38:50,154 --> 00:38:51,275
there would be big trouble later.

510
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:57,154
Don't meet Xiang Liu anymore,

511
00:38:57,915 --> 00:38:59,114
in case of bringing trouble.

512
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:01,195
Understood.

513
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:03,154
Let's go back.

514
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:17,794
I almost have more injury.

515
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:18,594
Thank you.

516
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:24,475
Give me the crutch.

517
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,072
The ground is slippery.

518
00:40:07,874 --> 00:40:08,554
Alright, alright.

519
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:09,594
Put me down.

520
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:15,114
Thank you.

521
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:17,792
I'm going in if there's nothing else.

522
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,995
For a shadowless traitor,

523
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,394
we have to strengthen our defenses,

524
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:52,874
patrolling around

525
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:54,114
in the middle of the night.

526
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:55,834
Those who are not of our race

527
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:57,035
must have different minds.

528
00:40:57,515 --> 00:40:59,074
I think the most likely to betray us

529
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:00,154
is that nine-headed demon.

530
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:01,275
Yes.

531
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,288
General trusts that
lowly nine-headed creature so much.

532
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:06,794
It really is unsettling.

533
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:09,515
Let's go.

534
00:41:09,794 --> 00:41:10,314
Have a look.

535
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,594
Today is the day when Tian'er and I...

536
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:26,475
Well...

537
00:41:26,475 --> 00:41:27,955
Today is our wedding day.

538
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:30,195
We are very grateful
for your participation.

539
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:32,114
We toast to you all.

540
00:41:32,394 --> 00:41:33,394
- Let's do it.
- Bravo.

541
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:34,720
Cheers, cheers.

542
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,776
Congratulations, congratulations.

543
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:36,475
Thank you, everyone.

544
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:39,955
Pimply,

545
00:41:40,074 --> 00:41:40,874
let's have a drink.

546
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:43,915
Today is your big day.

547
00:41:44,354 --> 00:41:45,995
I will definitely
accompany you to the end.

548
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:49,915
Sister-in-law, I also toast you.

549
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:56,515
Chuntao is pregnant. She can't drink.

550
00:41:56,634 --> 00:41:57,794
I will drink with you.

551
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:58,915
Okay.

552
00:41:59,074 --> 00:41:59,794
I toast to you.

553
00:42:08,554 --> 00:42:09,475
Silly.

554
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:18,675
Brother,

555
00:42:19,594 --> 00:42:21,995
Haitang said you came
here for the wedding. So, it's true.

556
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,515
Little sister is here.
Come here. Come here.

557
00:42:24,554 --> 00:42:25,195
Sit here.

558
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:26,235
Sit here.

559
00:42:50,515 --> 00:42:51,394
I'm done.

560
00:42:51,794 --> 00:42:52,675
We'll go home now.

561
00:42:53,475 --> 00:42:54,195
No hurry.

562
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:55,995
I've never seen such a wedding.

563
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:57,154
Let them continue.

564
00:43:02,715 --> 00:43:03,874
We should welcome our guests.

565
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:06,794
We should toast to this lady.

566
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:08,634
No, thanks.

567
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,915
Your glasses are not clean.

568
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:18,816
I'll toast to you.

569
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:20,554
Let's go. Cheers.

570
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:22,755
Congratulations.

571
00:43:22,794 --> 00:43:23,354
Thank you.

572
00:43:40,114 --> 00:43:42,834
I heard that at a wedding,
the grandeur of the banquet

573
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:44,594
represents the bride is valued.

574
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:46,675
As your food is so poor,

575
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:48,035
don't you like the bride?

576
00:43:54,275 --> 00:43:55,915
You two have to go, right?

577
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:57,275
Then I will leave you.

578
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:57,874
Yes.

579
00:43:57,874 --> 00:43:58,874
This way, please.

580
00:43:59,114 --> 00:43:59,475
Come on.

581
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:00,928
- This way, please.
- We'll leave now.

582
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:02,715
Excuse me.

583
00:44:02,955 --> 00:44:03,712
We'll take our leave.

584
00:44:03,834 --> 00:44:04,394
Farewell.

585
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,154
You shall keep your handkerchief.

586
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:10,475
As we know, it's very valuable.

587
00:44:13,074 --> 00:44:13,995
Take your time.
