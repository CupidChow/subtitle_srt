3
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:40,992
(Wushen Mountain, Haoling)

4
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:05,216
(King of Haoling)

5
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:24,123
Master.

6
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:25,682
Sit.

7
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:35,962
How's your injury?

8
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:38,442
After applying Tanggu water,
it's already healed.

9
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:40,802
I heard your experience in Qingshui Town

10
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,123
was quite interesting.

11
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:44,802
I followed in your footsteps,

12
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:47,082
traveling around the world in my youth,

13
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:48,962
learning about things across Dahuang,

14
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:50,403
feeling the folk joys and sorrows,

15
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:52,363
and meeting various characters,

16
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,682
including friends and foes.
It was indeed quite interesting.

17
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,162
If you have time,
I'd like to share all about it with you.

18
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:01,003
The physician who suggested you
to use Tanggu water to treat wounds

19
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:02,563
and Ice Crystals to stop the bleeding

20
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:04,000
saved your life.

21
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:05,643
Let's start with him.

22
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,522
Easy.

23
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,763
The last dish. All dishes are ready.

24
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:15,363
Xiaoliu, why so many good foods today?

25
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,043
Yeah, it's not a holiday.

26
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,483
I missed you guys.

27
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,563
I wanted you to come back
and enjoy delicacies. Alright?

28
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:24,563
Xiaoliu implied we rarely came back.

29
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:29,123
You two, come back and visit Mu
more often in the future.

30
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:31,602
Contact Skinny and Sang Tian'er more.

31
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:34,882
Although we're not related by blood,
we're all family.

32
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:39,203
Xiaoliu, don't worry. We will
come back more frequently for sure.

33
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,722
Come on. Let's drink.

34
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:41,882
Cheers.

35
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:42,843
Cheers, cheers.

36
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:46,882
Dig in.

37
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:48,882
Xiaoliu.

38
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,363
You didn't drink just now. I saw it.

39
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:55,363
Come on. Drink with me.

40
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:02,882
- Enjoy.
- Come to Grandpa.

41
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:05,882
What do you want to eat?

42
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,722
Here, drink.

43
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:17,763
Whether it's Xiang Liu
or the Fangfeng Family,

44
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:20,763
I am clear about
their motives and objectives.

45
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,083
But Wen Xiaoliu

46
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:25,002
is like a friend and a foe.

47
00:04:27,363 --> 00:04:28,923
He helped Xiang Liu put the bug in me,

48
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,442
but also saved me twice.

49
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:33,882
I really can't figure out

50
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:35,402
what exactly he wants.

51
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:39,322
He's adept at poisoning

52
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:41,683
and can manipulate poisonous bugs.

53
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:43,803
Yes.

54
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,243
Go to Qingshui Town

55
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,402
and bring him to me.

56
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,282
I want to see him.

57
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:53,122
Master, who is he on earth?

58
00:04:53,763 --> 00:04:54,322
He...

59
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:58,643
He might be the kid of my acquaintance.

60
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:06,683
Master, rest assured.
I will bring him to Wushen Mountain.

61
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:13,483
Senior,

62
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:16,282
why is Master interested in

63
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,562
a physician from Qingshui Town?

64
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:23,162
The physician is of unknown origin.

65
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,842
He's a young man of the deity.

66
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:27,643
Living among the commoners,

67
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:30,402
yet he treats Tanggu water
and ice crystals as common things.

68
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,763
He's good at using poison
and controlling bugs.

69
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:34,203
He's not ordinary.

70
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:36,643
Junior,

71
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:38,722
do you know about

72
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:41,243
the Five Princes Rebellion?

73
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,483
I heard something.

74
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:46,803
The five rebellious princes
were all executed.

75
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:48,203
But there are rumors

76
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:51,602
that the son of Prince Zhongrong
was lost in Dahuang and unaccounted for.

77
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:55,763
Zhongrong had a concubine
who was good at using poison.

78
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:59,392
Could this young physician be

79
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:01,483
the son of the guilty Prince?

80
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,122
That makes sense.

81
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:07,203
He saved me

82
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:08,683
and approached me

83
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:11,483
because he wanted to
take advantage of his favors

84
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:13,402
and use me.

85
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:16,122
Exactly.

86
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:17,683
I'll set off

87
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,243
and bring Wen Xiaoliu back now.

88
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,402
It's hot. This is for you to cool down.

89
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:16,562
No need.

90
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:28,683
You're leaving?

91
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:32,763
What's our relationship?

92
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:34,803
It's none of your business, I suppose.

93
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,264
Master Qingqiu,
this is Qingshui Town, not Qingqiu Hill.

94
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:40,963
Why haven't you left yet?

95
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:42,923
As long as you're here, I won't leave.

96
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:46,203
Aren't you listening to me?

97
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:48,402
Then leave. Go far away.

98
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,602
Don't come back to disturb my life.

99
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:53,442
You are Tushan Jing, not Ye Shiqi.

100
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,363
We have no relationship.

101
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:57,043
Can you understand?

102
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:09,083
Please leave.

103
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:16,882
I wish I was just Ye Shiqi.

104
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:19,683
I know you hate Tushan Jing.

105
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:22,243
I tried to restrain myself
from coming to see you,

106
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,122
but I can't.

107
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:26,282
I dare not leave.

108
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:30,043
You gave Pimply a home,

109
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:31,963
found Sang Tian'er for Skinny,

110
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:33,803
and arranged retirement for Mu.

111
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:37,082
You've prepared to abandon all this
and continue wandering.

112
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:38,602
I'm afraid...

113
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:42,282
I'm afraid if I turn around,

114
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,803
I can't find you anymore
when I look back.

115
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:05,402
Wherever you go,

116
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:08,202
I'm ready to go with you.

117
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:17,842
How many times do I have to tell you?

118
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:19,803
I want you to leave.

119
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,883
Don't come back and bother me.

120
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:25,563
I'm resting now.
I don't want to deal with you.

121
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,803
Why can't you understand...

122
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,483
Xuan.

123
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:41,443
Why are you here?

124
00:10:41,883 --> 00:10:42,762
What brings you here?

125
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,602
Long time no see. Hope you've been well.

126
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,082
I've helped you
remove the poisonous bug.

127
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:51,722
You could feel it, right?

128
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:53,683
Or should I

129
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:55,202
find something to stab myself?

130
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:56,563
You can feel it.

131
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:58,363
Don't bother. I know.

132
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:00,602
I came for another reason.

133
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,043
What other reason?

134
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,224
My master wants to see you.

135
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,056
Your master?

136
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:19,202
Who is your master?

137
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,243
Why does your master want to see me?

138
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:26,602
But then again,

139
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,202
just because
your master wants to see me,

140
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,722
and I must see him?

141
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:35,883
I'll cut to the chase.

142
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:37,722
I am Xiyan Cang Xuan,

143
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,243
the eldest grandson of Xiyan.

144
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,162
My master is the King of Haoling.

145
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,803
Nice to meet you, Your Highness.

146
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:48,563
But I'm just from Qingshui Town.

147
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,563
I'm neither a citizen of Xiyan,

148
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,363
nor am I from Haoling.

149
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:54,043
When I was at Wushen Mountain,

150
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,923
I told my master something about you.

151
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,082
I don't know why

152
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,243
he suddenly became interested in you
and wanted to meet you.

153
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:03,762
He specifically sent me to invite you.

154
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:04,803
I won't go.

155
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:10,483
He's the emperor.

156
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:13,402
You probably can't refuse it.

157
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:18,522
Wen Xiaoliu.

158
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:20,762
Don't refuse.

159
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,043
I don't want to be rough with you.

160
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,243
Okay, I'll go to Haoling with you.

161
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:32,923
But I need half a day...

162
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:33,683
That is too long.

163
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:38,842
After all, I saved your life twice.

164
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,923
Is this how the Prince of Xiyan

165
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:43,043
treats your savior?

166
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:45,363
The first time you saved me

167
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:48,123
was to help Xiang Liu
set up a trap to kill me.

168
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:50,923
I didn't pursue it,
which means I already let you off.

169
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:52,443
If you hadn't put a bug in me,

170
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:54,282
I wouldn't have needed
your second rescue at all.

171
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:56,483
Nian is the Princess of Haoling,

172
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:58,363
but you have offended her
again and again.

173
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,043
You should know she desires to kill you.

174
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:02,762
It is me who protects you in the dark.

175
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:05,162
This time to Haoling,

176
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:08,842
you're falling into Nian's hands,
and are at her disposal.

177
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:14,202
Don't you want me to protect you again?

178
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,162
It's really hard to tell

179
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:19,202
who owes a favor between us.

180
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,762
If I don't go to Haoling,

181
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:25,803
I don't need you to protect me.

182
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,602
I'll give you four hours to pack up

183
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,123
and tell your friends and family.

184
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:44,443
We'll leave before sunset.

185
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,043
If you play tricks again...

186
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:00,043
(Only in this way)

187
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:02,483
(can you survive.)

188
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:11,008
(Jintian Valley)

189
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,952
(Jintian Xingchen)

190
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:57,162
I need you to forge weapons.

191
00:14:58,722 --> 00:14:59,842
I'm Jintian Xingchen.

192
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:02,483
As the Jintian Family
owes a favor to Guifang Family,

193
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:04,202
the chief asked me to take on the task.

194
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:08,282
But for me,
I only forge weapons based on my mood.

195
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:10,762
If the weapons you want
don't pique my interest,

196
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:12,443
I will refuse it outright.

197
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,642
What a finicky bow and arrows.

198
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,722
It might take decades of hard work.

199
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:30,483
However,

200
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:33,043
every material needed is hard to find.

201
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:35,402
Finding materials is even harder
than forging the bow.

202
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:36,803
I will provide all materials.

203
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:41,003
Good. If you say so, I'll take the job.

204
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:04,883
(Only Xiang Liu doesn't care about
Xiyan and Haoling.)

205
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,483
(And only in Chenrong Army's territory,)

206
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:08,962
(can I avoid my brother.)

207
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,762
This won't work. It's too light.

208
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:35,563
Xiang Liu definitely won't feel it.

209
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:59,522
My Lord, everything is arranged.

210
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:01,003
The exit routes have all been blocked.

211
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:11,162
(It seems I can't rely on Xiang Liu.)

212
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:35,002
Xuan,

213
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:38,762
I've been in Qingshui Town
for almost thirty years now.

214
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,323
I want to say goodbye to my neighbors.

215
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:42,683
Can I?

216
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:48,242
Okay.

217
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:51,402
Thank you, Xuan.

218
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:16,963
Xiaoliu.

219
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:27,762
I'll leave Rejuvenation Hall to you.

220
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:29,522
If Mu is sad,

221
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,402
tell him,

222
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,122
"Destiny brings people
together and apart."

223
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:36,762
"Having journeyed together
is already a blessing."

224
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:57,642
Take good care of Mu in the future.

225
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:00,603
You are smart.

226
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:03,923
Bear with Chuntao's little temperament.

227
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:05,963
Life is unpredictable.

228
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:07,522
If something happens,

229
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:11,522
Chuntao and Pimply
can only rely on you and Skinny.

230
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,402
And you and Skinny can only rely on

231
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,642
Chuntao and Pimply in return.

232
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:20,963
Come on. Get up.

233
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,603
Xiaoliu, rest assured.

234
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,122
I will definitely listen to you.

235
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:30,522
Xiaoliu,

236
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,083
where are you going?

237
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:39,043
As the world is large,
I can go anywhere.

238
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,762
Xiaoliu, I saved the best ribs for you.

239
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:06,803
Alright.

240
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:08,242
Xiaoliu, well...

241
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:12,723
Hello, Xiaoliu.

242
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:25,522
Xiaoliu.

243
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:27,443
Xiaoliu.

244
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,002
Xiaoliu.

245
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:43,963
I'll save some fresh buns for you.

246
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:44,832
Come and get them later.

247
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:45,803
Okay.

248
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:52,323
Thank you.

249
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:52,963
Not bad, right?

250
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:58,162
Back then...

251
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:03,402
And then...

252
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:04,963
- It's gone.
- Bravo!

253
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:22,603
(Would you)

254
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,664
(offend the King of Haoling
and the King of Xiyan for me?)

255
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:32,128
(Yu Mansion)

256
00:21:36,402 --> 00:21:37,122
What happened?

257
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:41,963
You know if there's nothing,

258
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:43,683
I definitely wouldn't come to you.

259
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:47,443
The Prince, Xiyan Cang Xuan

260
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:49,762
is waiting in the backyard
of Rejuvenation Hall.

261
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,882
He said King of Haoling wants to see me.

262
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:55,043
I'll accompany you to Haoling.

263
00:21:55,362 --> 00:21:56,882
King of Haoling
is a wise and benevolent king.

264
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,043
He won't be tough with you.

265
00:21:58,043 --> 00:22:00,043
What does it have to do with me?

266
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:01,762
I don't want to see him.

267
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:03,882
You want to escape?

268
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:06,043
Yes, I want to escape.

269
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:07,882
It's troublesome?

270
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:11,563
Yes, it is.

271
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,882
If it wasn't,
I wouldn't have come to you.

272
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:17,762
The seemingly serious matters
are actually simple.

273
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:19,882
It's nothing but all about business.

274
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:21,203
It's all about "benefit".

275
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,803
Even if they are kings,
I can talk to them,

276
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:24,642
negotiating.

277
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,083
There's nothing to talk about.

278
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:29,362
Tushan Family must have secret passages
going in and out of Qingshui Town.

279
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:31,122
Help me escape.

280
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:32,083
Okay.

281
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:42,923
Running away means
defying the King of Haoling.

282
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:45,203
The emperor must not be offended.

283
00:22:45,683 --> 00:22:47,402
Cang Xuan will definitely
pursue us all the way.

284
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:49,482
If we insist on resisting,

285
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:51,762
Cang Xuan will definitely kill us.

286
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:56,323
Even if we escape by luck later,

287
00:22:56,762 --> 00:23:00,323
you will offend both King of Haoling
and King of Xiyan at the same time.

288
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:03,402
Jing Ye, get ready.

289
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:05,162
Master, you don't have to take risks.

290
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:07,882
I will escort Physician Liu away
with two of my trusted men.

291
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:09,843
I swear on my life

292
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:12,122
I will do all my best
to ensure Physician Liu's safety.

293
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:14,642
Get ready for me and Xiaoliu.

294
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:19,762
Yes.

295
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:31,522
My Lord,

296
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:34,122
Wen Xiaoliu went to find Tushan Jing.

297
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:36,723
My Lord,

298
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:39,083
since you know Wen Xiaoliu is cunning,

299
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:40,762
why did you give him four more hours?

300
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:46,803
In any case, he did save me.

301
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:48,762
Consider these four hours

302
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:51,522
as a repayment of his two favors.

303
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:05,603
Miss Yiying.

304
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:07,923
What is this?

305
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:12,803
Master wants some clothes.
I'm delivering them to him.

306
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:15,362
Okay, just go.

307
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:16,640
Yes.

308
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,402
Even if Physician Liu has saved you,

309
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:42,563
the Tushan Family
can repay him in other ways.

310
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:45,002
Why must you risk yourself, Master?

311
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,642
Return to Qingqiu three days later.

312
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,882
If we manage to escape,
I will go to Qingqiu Hill to find you.

313
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,002
If not, you and Lan Xiang
should find someone to marry.

314
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:05,723
Let's go.

315
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,482
My Lord, Wen Xiaoliu
is no longer in Yu Mansion.

316
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:29,882
But rest assured.

317
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:32,563
Qingshui Town has set up
a huge dragnet that he can't escape.

318
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:34,923
What about the Chenrong Army?

319
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:36,963
We've set up more forces

320
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,528
to guard all the mountain roads,

321
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:39,616
so he can't enter the mountain.

322
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:45,282
Wen Xiaoliu can even bewitch

323
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,762
Master Qingqiu
to confront the King of Haoling,

324
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:51,043
I really underestimated him.

325
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:02,162
We're out of Qingshui Town.

326
00:26:02,482 --> 00:26:03,603
Let's leave for Haoling now.

327
00:26:04,203 --> 00:26:04,843
Let's go.

328
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:55,323
How could this happen?

329
00:26:58,803 --> 00:27:00,843
I didn't expect the junior master
to leave without a word.

330
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,522
How can I explain to Grand Madam?

331
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:08,203
Does Miss Fangfeng have any clues about
the whereabouts of the junior master?

332
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,362
His Highness is acting on
King of Haoling's orders.

333
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:14,642
For the sake of the Tushan Family,
please tell us, Miss.

334
00:27:15,923 --> 00:27:18,083
Master wants some clothes.

335
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,162
I'm delivering them to him.

336
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:21,923
I happened to see

337
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:23,203
the junior master's luggage.

338
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:27,043
The clothes inside are very light.

339
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:29,563
It's not like he is going to Xiyan.

340
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:31,762
More like going to Haoling.

341
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:34,083
Thank you, Miss Fangfeng.
I will take my leave.

342
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:35,963
Please take your time.

343
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:55,443
Aren't you tired
after traveling for so long?

344
00:27:57,563 --> 00:27:59,762
Even if Cang Xuan racks his brains,
he can't figure out

345
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:01,362
that I'm already in Haoling.

346
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:03,803
I thought you were the most honest.

347
00:28:04,122 --> 00:28:05,963
I didn't expect you to be
the most cunning.

348
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,043
You offended Haoling and Xiyan for me.

349
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:11,963
You will regret it in the future.

350
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:13,282
No regrets.

351
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,963
As long as I can stay with you.

352
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:19,002
If you can't return to Qingqiu Hill,

353
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:23,762
there will be no
Master Qingqiu in this world.

354
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:29,762
Master Qingqiu

355
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,083
is just a joke originally.

356
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,402
(Shan Shui House)
(Welcoming guest. Warming friends.)

357
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:05,843
This tea house

358
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:10,323
is famous all over the world

359
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,683
for Master Qingqiu's inscription.

360
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:14,642
Miss,

361
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:17,803
I see you've been waiting here
for several months.

362
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,762
(Shan Shui House)
Master Qingqiu won't come.

363
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:24,762
If he doesn't come in ten days,
I'll wait for ten days.

364
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:27,882
If he doesn't come in ten years,
I'll wait ten for years.

365
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:28,723
Miss,

366
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:31,083
you're too infatuated.

367
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,723
The scholars traveled thousands of miles

368
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:34,443
just to play a game of chess with him.

369
00:29:35,203 --> 00:29:36,683
Royal members
are willing to pay a fortune

370
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:38,282
just to get a painting from him.

371
00:29:38,624 --> 00:29:39,723
I'm nothing compared to them.

372
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:43,203
I just want to see him once more,
and listen to him play a song.

373
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,882
I will have no regrets in this life.

374
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:53,122
Go ahead. Go greet your acquaintance.

375
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,282
Get lost, beggar!

376
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:34,762
Don't dirty our lady's clothes.

377
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,482
What Master Qingqiu?

378
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:41,482
Did you see that?

379
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:43,522
This is you.

380
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,242
After taking off your noble clothes

381
00:30:47,122 --> 00:30:48,443
and losing your noble status,

382
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:51,843
you are nothing at all.

383
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,723
There is no more
Master Qingqiu in this world.

384
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:08,963
You are brothers,

385
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:11,242
but why did he treat you like that?

386
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,803
Was it just for the inheritance?

387
00:31:15,963 --> 00:31:16,402
No.

388
00:31:16,482 --> 00:31:17,362
Then why?

389
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,963
My older brother and I grew up together.

390
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:23,683
We were very close.

391
00:31:25,203 --> 00:31:26,362
Unlike me,

392
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:29,362
he was energetic and his spirit power
was stronger than mine.

393
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:32,522
For any move, as long as
he learns it, he can master it at once.

394
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:40,563
Your swordsmanship
is getting more and more refined.

395
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:42,362
Your piano skill is better,
little brother.

396
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:44,122
I feel ashamed.

397
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:55,362
Brother, are you alright?

398
00:31:55,843 --> 00:32:00,162
Jing, Jing, are you hurt?

399
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:02,642
You scared me off.

400
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,043
The physician is not here?

401
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:06,522
Mother, I'm fine.
Please check on my brother.

402
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,803
My brother's head is injured.

403
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,002
How can you be fine?

404
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,683
Do you feel any pain anywhere?

405
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:13,162
Did you hurt your hand?

406
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:16,522
You must be more careful, understand?

407
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,522
Come here. Let me hug you.

408
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,002
Good boy.

409
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,122
You are biological brothers,

410
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:30,362
but your mother
doesn't like your older brother.

411
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:34,122
My mother has always been cold
to my brother.

412
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:39,162
He always worked hard,
and is desperately diligent,

413
00:32:39,882 --> 00:32:41,803
trying to gain my mother's approval.

414
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:45,002
But my mother used every method
to belittle and deny him.

415
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:53,603
Mother,

416
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,882
please drink a little.

417
00:32:58,683 --> 00:32:59,482
Get lost.

418
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:01,482
Get out of my sight.

419
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,402
You make me sick.

420
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:09,282
Mother.

421
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:12,563
Why are you so biased?

422
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:15,923
Whatever I do, I'm not as good as
my brother? Why?

423
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:17,843
You're not as good as your brother.

424
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:22,002
You have dirty thoughts
and a lowly nature.

425
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:25,642
You're not even
as good as your brother's toe.

426
00:33:27,162 --> 00:33:27,723
Get lost.

427
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:30,482
I don't want to see you anymore.

428
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:32,362
Go away.

429
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:47,296
After my mother passed away,
my brother was very distressed.

430
00:33:48,762 --> 00:33:50,762
Not only because he lost his mother,

431
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:53,122
but also because
he would never be able to

432
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:56,002
gain her approval in his lifetime.

433
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,762
My grandmother couldn't bear to see
my brother destroy himself,

434
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,242
so she revealed the truth.

435
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:14,363
Hou, you can't go on like this.

436
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:15,883
I've been keeping the secret

437
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:18,682
for so many years.

438
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,482
For your sake, I have to tell you.

439
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:24,722
Actually, you and Jing

440
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,043
are not born of the same mother.

441
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:46,403
Grandmother.

442
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:07,512
(Memorial Tablet of My Mother Shen Yue)

443
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:46,722
Since then,

444
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,962
my brother stopped drinking,

445
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:51,803
and started to pull himself together.

446
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:54,323
I thought everything was behind us,

447
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,202
but one day,

448
00:35:58,403 --> 00:35:59,682
my brother suddenly came to me,

449
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:01,962
saying that he had an emergency.

450
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:05,482
I didn't suspect him,

451
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:07,522
and left with him.

452
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:10,843
When I woke up,

453
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,163
I found myself in a closed dungeon.

454
00:36:17,282 --> 00:36:18,202
My spirit power was sealed,

455
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:23,403
and my limbs were bound by
chains made of dragon bones.

456
00:36:37,002 --> 00:36:40,522
Shiqi, don't be afraid.
It's all over now.

457
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:45,603
I'm here. No one will bully
or torment you anymore.

458
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:54,242
I know.

459
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:29,323
What's wrong?

460
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,762
Haoling's army has surrounded the inn.

461
00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:39,403
There are two deities
with extremely high spirit power.

462
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:44,282
I can't defeat even one of them.

463
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:58,363
If we really manage to escape so easily,

464
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:01,083
I'd be disappointed in Cang Xuan.

465
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:03,522
So,

466
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:05,762
he does have some skills.

467
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:09,083
I let you down.

468
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:10,403
Nonsense. Not at all.

469
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,442
Cang Xuan is pursuing me
with the power of two kingdoms,

470
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,123
while you're helping me
with just your own strength.

471
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:19,722
It's already a miracle
that we've managed to escape this far.

472
00:38:22,522 --> 00:38:23,883
How much do you
not want to see the King?

473
00:38:27,002 --> 00:38:28,123
I'd rather die than see him.

474
00:38:30,563 --> 00:38:31,722
Although I can't beat them down,

475
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:33,403
I can hold them off.

476
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:35,563
My mount is to the northeast.

477
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,442
Run towards the northeast later.

478
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:45,522
Hold up this jade fox,

479
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,002
and it will come to you.

480
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:49,403
Will you be in danger?

481
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:54,563
I am Tushan Jing.

482
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:56,883
Even if the King of Haoling is here,

483
00:38:57,282 --> 00:38:58,762
he would not dare to kill me.

484
00:38:59,563 --> 00:39:01,563
Other generals
would not dare to act rashly.

485
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:08,043
Alright then.

486
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:10,843
Since you're so powerful,
I will leave you behind

487
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:12,482
and run away by myself.

488
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,043
Let me see your true face.

489
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:33,522
Have you thought it through?

490
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:35,163
Once I step out this door,

491
00:39:35,762 --> 00:39:37,083
I will be a different person.

492
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:39,563
Wen Xiaoliu will
no longer be Wen Xiaoliu.

493
00:39:40,163 --> 00:39:42,002
Ye Shiqi will
never be able to find him again.

494
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:45,563
Even so,

495
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:49,083
are you willing to
risk offending the King of Haoling

496
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:51,603
and let me escape alone?

497
00:39:58,442 --> 00:40:00,002
I kind of understand Tushan Hou now.

498
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:04,482
You're so good
that I almost want to resent you.

499
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:09,803
Wen Xiaoliu, come out.

500
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:13,002
Stop running or I'll break your legs.

501
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,522
Go now.

502
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:24,083
Leave.

503
00:40:30,922 --> 00:40:31,522
Hurry up.

504
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:48,323
Wen Xiaoliu, come out obediently

505
00:40:49,002 --> 00:40:50,803
and I'll let you suffer a bit less.

506
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:25,363
Tushan Family's illusion barrier.

507
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:26,722
Break the formation.

508
00:41:27,043 --> 00:41:27,643
Yes!

509
00:42:00,323 --> 00:42:01,282
Wen Xiaoliu escaped.

510
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:04,922
Where's Wen Xiaoliu?

511
00:42:09,682 --> 00:42:11,163
Junior Master of Tushan,

512
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,962
aren't you afraid of
implicating the whole Tushan Family?

513
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,123
I am Ye Shiqi.

514
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,643
Ye Shiqi?

515
00:42:22,922 --> 00:42:24,323
If you are Ye Shiqi,

516
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:26,123
then it becomes much easier.

517
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:42,922
Wen Xiaoliu,

518
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,762
the person with you was Ye Shiqi.

519
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:47,762
Killing Ye Shiqi

520
00:42:47,762 --> 00:42:49,363
is not hard for me.

521
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:54,962
Cang Xuan, you're indeed formidable.

522
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,843
No wonder Grandfather likes you.
