3
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:09,513
You

4
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:11,554
are...?

5
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:19,593
Fangfeng Bei.

6
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:21,593
I would rather

7
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:23,634
you came specifically
to visit my boudoir.

8
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:31,073
You have so many fair-weather friends.

9
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:32,754
Why would you come to me?

10
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:34,834
As you said,

11
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:36,953
they are fair-weather friends.

12
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:57,713
You do trust me.

13
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,354
Who exactly is after you?

14
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:03,274
Fifth King and Seventh King.

15
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:06,713
Hasn't your family already

16
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:08,394
pledged allegiance to them?

17
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,873
What exactly did you do

18
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:13,953
to have them
hunting you down everywhere?

19
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:22,274
Go up.

20
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:28,073
My brother can't
keep things under control now.

21
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,994
My status might not help.

22
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:32,673
If they really start a thorough search,

23
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:34,274
I can't do anything.

24
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:40,673
Too bad you're not a real libertine.

25
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:44,554
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have this much trouble.

26
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:08,153
This is His Highness's bedchamber.

27
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:09,593
You dare to barge in?

28
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,354
We are ordered to capture an assassin.

29
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:13,713
We have to search everyone's room.

30
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:16,833
How dare you!

31
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:36,873
You're too presumptuous.

32
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:39,313
Why are you even
going through cabinets and boxes?

33
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:41,354
Not just them.

34
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:44,194
Even His Highness's bed
must be searched.

35
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,634
Who knows if there's an assassin?

36
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:09,553
So beautiful.

37
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:11,474
So beautiful.

38
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:28,034
In my opinion,

39
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,593
we should also search
His Highness's clothes.

40
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:33,393
There might be traces left
by the assassin.

41
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:34,553
You've gone too far.

42
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:36,313
Buzz off!

43
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:40,593
Search for the assassin,

44
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,593
but don't disturb His Highness's rest.

45
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:44,713
Yes.

46
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:48,514
Alright,

47
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:50,993
there's no assassin hiding here.

48
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:52,794
Search elsewhere.

49
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:54,514
Let's go.

50
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:24,640
Princess.

51
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:27,553
Princess.

52
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,194
I'm Xiaoxiao. Something happened.

53
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:32,433
What? What's going on outside?

54
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,954
Princes Yue Liang and Shiran
brought soldiers to catch an assassin.

55
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:38,553
What did my brother say?

56
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,152
His Highness is still asleep
and has given no orders.

57
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:45,234
Princess,

58
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:46,713
please get dressed quickly.

59
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:47,833
I hear they've finished

60
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,234
searching His Highness's room.

61
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,354
I'm afraid they'll barge in here
and offend you.

62
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:17,514
Princess.

63
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,593
No need for this.

64
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:20,914
Those soldiers are too rude.

65
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,194
Should you stay clear of them?

66
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,553
We will guard here.

67
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:26,273
It's okay.

68
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:28,593
I'd like to see

69
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:31,153
the soldiers who dare
to search a princess's bedroom.

70
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:44,873
We're carrying out our duties.

71
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,113
If you do not surrender,

72
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,794
don't blame us for using lethal force.

73
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,034
You lackeys.

74
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:51,833
Haitang, beat them to death.

75
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:52,393
Yes.

76
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,674
Go ask Shiran
if he doesn't want to live anymore.

77
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:05,674
Yes.

78
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:13,553
Prince Shiran,

79
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:15,954
the princess asks
if you're seeking death.

80
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,113
No, I sure don't.

81
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:28,273
Why would you ask that?

82
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:31,713
What's exactly in your mind?

83
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,513
You have no sense at all.

84
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,034
That maid outside.

85
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,513
Don't you see she's not someone

86
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:39,593
anyone can afford to employ?

87
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:41,914
I don't mean to belittle you,

88
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:43,753
but among your companions,

89
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,073
you won't find a woman

90
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:47,914
with such looks

91
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:49,874
and superior spirit power.

92
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:52,193
I thought she was your maid.

93
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,354
She is my sister's maid.

94
00:08:58,273 --> 00:08:58,753
Stop!

95
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:03,314
Continue.

96
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,593
The Second Princess
of Haoling came to Xiyan Town,

97
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:14,713
yet you hid this from us.

98
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:17,114
Do you think I can do it?

99
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:20,153
It's Grandfather
who doesn't want you to know.

100
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:23,073
He is afraid that you will
have some crooked thoughts

101
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:24,393
and disturb my sister's peace.

102
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:26,393
You can go ask Grandfather if it's true.

103
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,434
Could you please help appease her?

104
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:32,994
I didn't mean to offend her.

105
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:35,034
I was completely unaware.

106
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:40,393
You're quite bold.

107
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:42,273
What?

108
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:45,314
Are you also thinking
of conducting a thorough search

109
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:47,354
of my room?

110
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:49,273
Not at all.

111
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:00,593
Get out.

112
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,393
All of you, stay outside.
Don't disturb the princess.

113
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:16,874
I shall take my leave.

114
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:36,234
All of you, leave.

115
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:45,513
Please forgive me.

116
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:47,393
Because there was an assassin around,

117
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:48,554
we feared for your safety

118
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:50,114
and specially dispatched soldiers.

119
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:26,193
You didn't smother, did you?

120
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,994
The medicine should have
taken effect by now.

121
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:34,034
Let me check.

122
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,114
Who are you exactly?

123
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:53,234
Such a good healing medicine

124
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:56,314
has no effect on you at all.

125
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,314
Who do you want me to be?

126
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,234
Whoever you are.

127
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:28,513
I need to heal.

128
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,434
Not here.

129
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:42,994
Bite here.

130
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:50,914
Why not the neck?

131
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:53,114
I used to be a man.

132
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:55,393
Can it be the same now?

133
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:04,713
Whatever. Now I'm healing your wounds.

134
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:06,193
I'm helping you.

135
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:02,513
Xiaoyao.

136
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,273
I'm fine.

137
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:10,434
You should eat more.

138
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:12,674
This way your wounds

139
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:15,034
can heal faster.

140
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:20,474
I'll be fine after I have
some tonic food.

141
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:26,073
Xiaoyao.

142
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:21,953
(Qi Garden)

143
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:24,114
Yue Liang and Shiran
have already bullied us to the extreme.

144
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:25,833
How can you endure this?

145
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,434
What did you say just now?

146
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,994
They were just following orders.

147
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:47,914
They had to do it.

148
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:49,474
I don't buy that!

149
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51,273
I can clearly see
that they don't take you seriously.

150
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:52,994
And Shiran.

151
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,474
He even wanted to search my room

152
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,753
and almost hurt Haitang.

153
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:00,633
Don't be angry.

154
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,833
I will definitely make them

155
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:06,713
apologize to you.

156
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:08,073
Who cares about their apology?

157
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:10,073
I just want them to stop bothering you.

158
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,314
My Lord.

159
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,314
Prince Shiran has sent
two apology gifts.

160
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:22,073
Show me.

161
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:25,874
Come in.

162
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,753
Greetings, Your Highness.

163
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:43,593
Prince Shiran ordered

164
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:47,393
from today on,
Your Highness would be my master.

165
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,073
Get up.

166
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:56,193
Xuan.

167
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:03,593
Don't be so formal.

168
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:05,794
Xuan,

169
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,473
are you going to let it pass

170
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:08,834
just because of two women?

171
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:19,714
The beauties are here.

172
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:21,753
What else matters?

173
00:17:31,914 --> 00:17:33,554
How did you become like this?

174
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,513
I'm going back to Haoling,

175
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:46,594
and I'll never ever come back.

176
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:53,993

00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:38,113
Stand upright.

191
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:41,873
Use moderate strength.

192
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:45,873
Hold the bow correctly

193
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:47,914
and the arrow calmly.

194
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:49,954
Push forward and pull back.

195
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:54,314
Stretch it to its full extent.

After your wounds heal,

204
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:43,954
you can leave on your own.

205
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:45,513
I don't know

206
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:48,393
if I should say goodbye to Fangfeng Bei

207
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:50,434
or to Xiang Liu.

208
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:53,993
Let's just part here

209
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:56,273
without saying goodbye.

210
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:23,194
You both keep an eye out.
Don't let anyone in.

211
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:24,873

Princess.

230
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,353
I have recently concocted
a lot of poisons

231
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:58,473
for you.

232
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:00,674
They should help with your healing.

233
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:51,554
What's wrong?

234
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:56,448
What exactly happened last night?

235
00:23:56,794 --> 00:23:57,753
It was such a big commotion.

236
00:23:57,984 --> 00:23:59,594
Did someone really
assassinate our uncle?

237
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:02,993
A map was lost from his mansion.

238
00:24:03,594 --> 00:24:04,914
They dared not let Grandfather know,

239
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,753
so they made up the pretext
of catching an assassin.

240
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:08,753
Map?

241
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:11,353
To prepare for sudden wars,

242
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:14,513
Xiyan has secret granaries and arsenals
in the Central Plains.

243
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:16,954
I guess it's the Chenrong rebels

244
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,153
who are targeting them,

245
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:20,794
so they stole the map.

246
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:22,873
So that's how it is.

247
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:25,434
Do me a favor.

248
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,393
Can you investigate into Fangfeng Bei's

249
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:29,353
experiences from his birth till now?

250
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:34,513
You're not really
attracted to him, are you?

251
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:35,473
What are you saying?

252
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:37,914
I'm just curious.

253
00:24:39,473 --> 00:24:42,233
Don't you think
that compared to Fangfeng Yiying,

254
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:44,640
Fangfeng Bei doesn't seem like
a Fangfeng family member at all?

255
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:45,472
Okay.

256
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,993
I'll tell you when I find out.

257
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:54,794
But you.

258
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:57,314
I heard

259
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:59,993
you made Nian run back
to Haoling in tears.

260
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,034
Are you mad at me?

261
00:25:10,434 --> 00:25:11,714
Are you enjoying

262
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:13,113
these days of debauchery?

263
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:14,473
That's a nightmare.

264
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,714
Women aren't the only ones who feel bad

265
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:19,314
about dealing with
people they don't like.

266
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:21,314
Men feel the same.

267
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:23,434
To be honest,

268
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,434
I'd rather get stabbed right now.

269
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,954
The one who suffers in this is you.

270
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:32,873
You're so harsh on yourself.

271
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,594
How could I be mad at you?

272
00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:54,113
Your dependence
on Free and Easy is getting stronger.

273
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:55,794
If it's another half a year,

274
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:57,314
I'm not sure

275
00:25:57,554 --> 00:26:00,233
I can completely remove
the poison from your body.

276
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:06,993
It won't take long.

277
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:09,554
Thanks to that assassin.

278
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:10,914
I'm lucky.

279
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,714
Now my uncles

280
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,153
completely believe

281
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,834
I'm a useless man.

282
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:17,954
The sooner the better.

283
00:26:24,393 --> 00:26:25,753
I don't want to go back.

284
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:27,834
I don't like those women.

285
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:29,873
I hate their smell.

286
00:26:31,393 --> 00:26:33,594
No one is forcing you to go back.

287
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,513
From the moment
my mother committed suicide,

288
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:39,513
I couldn't be willful anymore.

289
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,194
Jin Xuan is one of us,

290
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:53,834
but the other woman

291
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:55,434
is Yue Liang and Shiran's spy.

292
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,834
I can't let her
find out anything unusual.

293
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,353
Although I can't

294
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:04,353
help you drive those two women away,

295
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:06,594
I can save your nose,

296
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,434
so it can't smell temporarily.

297
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:09,353
Forget it.

298
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,273
I must remember today's humiliation.

299
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:14,314
In the future when I slack off,

300
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:17,074
I can think about what I endured

301
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:19,113
in order to survive.

302
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:21,794
I'm leaving.

303
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,993
The chiefs and elders
of the six families came

304
00:27:33,993 --> 00:27:35,633
to discuss the collapsed palace
with my father.

305
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:37,993
I'll find an excuse to go

306
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:39,473
and fan the flames.

307
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:42,473
Fenglong,

308
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:44,434
you are from Chishui Family.

309
00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:46,594
Don't be too eager about this.

310
00:27:47,194 --> 00:27:48,714
Otherwise, the Fifth and Seventh Kings

311
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,434
and even your father will be suspicious,

312
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:51,954
and it will all be for naught.

313
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:56,834
You're right.

314
00:27:57,993 --> 00:27:59,074
If I fail,

315
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:00,233
we can make do,

316
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:02,074
but Cang Xuan will be up the creek.

317
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,714
Did you forget?

318
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,594
I just came back from Gu Shu.

319
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:07,233
You went to the Xiling Family for help?

320
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,794
Great, you're always thinking ahead.

321
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:11,714
With their support,

322
00:28:11,914 --> 00:28:13,194
it's bound to be foolproof.

323
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:15,513
Fenglong, Jing.

324
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:19,674
How's their discussion?

325
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:22,194
I'm thirsty. I'll have a drink first.

326
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:35,674
The chiefs of the six families
unanimously agree

327
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:38,233
the Chenrong Mountain
is the symbol of the Central Plains.

328
00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:39,834
It can't be left to decay and ruin.

329
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:41,434
It must be meticulously repaired.

330
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:42,336
What does our father think?

331
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:44,594
Father thinks it's inappropriate
to repair it privately.

332
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:46,393
It'll raise
the King of Xiyan's suspicions.

333
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,194
So he decided to petition the king

334
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,920
to send someone to repair it.

335
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:52,233
That's great.

336
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:54,113
Cang Xuan can finally come here.

337
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:55,873
But how are you sure

338
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:57,594
the King of Xiyan
will definitely send Cang Xuan,

339
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:58,633
not someone else?

340
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:03,034
Would the man I picked out
be so incompetent?

341
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:05,873
I believe he can not only come

342
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:08,153
but also make
the Fifth and Seventh Kings escort him.

343
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:09,873
Do you agree, Jing?

344
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:18,674
An old palace at the Chenrong Mountain
collapsed, causing big concern.

345
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:22,674
It should be repaired
and restored to its former glory.

346
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:27,840
Prince Cang Xuan
is capable of such a task.

347
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,560
So he'll be appointed
as the repair supervisor

348
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,393
and head to the Chenrong Mountain

349
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:36,314
to oversee the renovation
of the palaces there.

350
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:38,954
I hope you will work hard

351
00:29:39,273 --> 00:29:41,273
and not let me down.

352
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:45,233
I will abide by your decree.

353
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,034
I have one request.

354
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,434
I hope to go to the Chenrong Mountain

355
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:51,273
with Princess Haoling Jiuyao.

356
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:53,194
Father,

357
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:56,194
Jiuyao is a princess of Haoling.

358
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:59,273
It is not reasonable for her
to go to the Chenrong Mountain

359
00:29:59,753 --> 00:30:00,753
without reason.

360
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:02,794
Father,

361
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:05,074
the Great Princess of Haoling

362
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:06,633
has been in Xiyan for a long time.

363
00:30:07,113 --> 00:30:09,633
Why not let her return to Haoling?

364
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:14,834
Jiuyao is the daughter
of the Princess General

365
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:19,744
who died for Xiyan.

366
00:30:20,594 --> 00:30:22,554
As long as Xiyan Kingdom exists,

367
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:26,113
Jiuyao can live here for her entire life

368
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:28,473
if she wishes.

369
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:30,674
Thank you, Your Majesty.

370
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:54,434
When wandering outside,

371
00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:57,554
I dreamt of returning.

372
00:30:57,993 --> 00:30:59,233
But when I really came back,

373
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:01,473
I tried everything to leave.

374
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:03,633
Last time I left,

375
00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:06,034
I thought I would be back soon.

376
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:08,153
I didn't expect it to be over 300 years.

377
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:11,153
I don't know how many years it will be

378
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:14,034
before I can return
to Zhaoyun Peak to swing.

379
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,074
I will plant phoenix trees
all over Zijin Peak

380
00:31:18,624 --> 00:31:21,034
and build a swing for you
that's exactly the same.

381
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:23,113
Alright.

382
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:27,554
Actually, I should have let you leave

383
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:28,873
like Nian.

384
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:30,873
Either back to the Wushen Mountain

385
00:31:31,233 --> 00:31:32,434
or to travel around Dahuang,

386
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:34,954
it's safer than taking risks with me.

387
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:37,594
Grandmother reminded us

388
00:31:37,873 --> 00:31:39,153
to support each other.

389
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:39,674
Did you forget?

390
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:41,153
Each other?

391
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:44,194
But I only see you supporting me,

392
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:45,873
not me supporting you.

393
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:48,034
What's the rush?

394
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:49,993
We're deities who have such long lives.

395
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:52,074
And you're afraid you won't
have a chance to do it?

396
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:54,434
I'm quite calculative.

397
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:57,153
Now you lean on me.

398
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:59,554
In the future,
I'll lean on you completely.

399
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:02,473
Alright, I will work hard

400
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:04,594
to let you lean on me for a lifetime.

401
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:21,536
(Zijin Palace, Chenrong Mountain)

402
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:29,513
Refurbishing the Zijin Palace requires

403
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:30,633
tens of thousands of materials,

404
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,834
and their quality is crucial.

405
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,233
After repeated discussions,

406
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,434
we have identified three vendors
that meet the requirements.

407
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:39,674
One is the Tushan Family.

408
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:42,594
It has the largest business in Dahuang.

409
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,873
Whatever is needed,

410
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,594
it can provide the best quality goods

411
00:32:46,753 --> 00:32:48,393
at the most reasonable price.

412
00:32:56,714 --> 00:33:00,034
Your Highness, here is the price list
from the Tushan Family.

413
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:03,233
Alright, let's leave it
to the Tushan Family.

414
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:05,273
Your Highness,
there are two other vendors.

415
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:07,513
Alright, you can all leave.

416
00:33:08,714 --> 00:33:09,513
I am tired.

417
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:46,976
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

418
00:34:06,993 --> 00:34:08,953
You can't take Free and Easy anymore.

419
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:10,233
But if you don't take it...

420
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:16,473
Don't let Xiaoyao know.

421
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,673
But the princess is better
at medicine than you, Your Highness.

422
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:20,314
I'm afraid you can't hide it anymore.

423
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,273
Ever since we got here,

424
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:51,394
you've been shutting
yourself in all day, seeing no one.

425
00:34:57,834 --> 00:34:58,473
What are you doing?

426
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:02,193
Prescriptions.

427
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,554
To ensure nothing goes wrong,

428
00:35:04,993 --> 00:35:07,233
I've been poring over medical books,
checking and rechecking.

429
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,993
Finally, I've found the safest method.

430
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:11,834
It can clear
the pill toxins in your body.

431
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:13,953
We can't delay any longer.

432
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:15,233
You need to prepare well.

433
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:16,874
We'll start tonight.

434
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:23,594
Right now, to me,

435
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:26,354
your pill toxins
are the biggest trouble.

436
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:28,034
Everything else has to be put aside.

437
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:39,594
This must be done in absolute secrecy.

438
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:42,273
We can't let the spies
of my uncles detect it.

439
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:43,794
I know.

440
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:49,834
You missed it again!

441
00:35:52,554 --> 00:35:53,874
Since you like this book so much,

442
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:55,233
why not let it stay

443
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:56,473
on your head longer?

444
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:03,513
You think
having spirit power is amazing?

445
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:05,713
I can make this book

446
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:07,594
stay on your head for two hours.

447
00:36:08,554 --> 00:36:09,433
Of course it's amazing.

448
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:12,354
I'm leaving.

449
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:19,513
Childish.

450
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:48,992
His Highness said
when the addiction strikes,

451
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,354
he may lose his senses and hurt you.

452
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:53,034
That's why I need to go in
and accompany him.

453
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:55,154
What if he hurts himself?

454
00:37:59,314 --> 00:37:59,913
Princess.

455
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:03,673
Why not use this rope
to tie His Highness

456
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:05,713
to prevent him
from hurting you or himself?

457
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:06,594
Good idea.

458
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:20,074
No need.

459
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:23,673
The only rope in the world
that can bind him

460
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:25,513
is his will.

461
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:41,913
Xuan.

462
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:45,794
Xuan.

463
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:49,713
Cang Xuan.

464
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:52,993
Cang Xuan.

465
00:38:54,993 --> 00:38:55,874
Cang Xuan.

466
00:39:00,273 --> 00:39:00,794
Cang Xuan.

467
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,953
Let go of me.

468
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:03,834
Cang Xuan.

469
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:09,874
Xuan.

470
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:26,953
Xuan.

471
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,074
Xuan.

472
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:34,513
I'm Xiaoyao.

473
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:41,753
I'm Xiaoyao, Xuan.

474
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:49,753
Please bear it.

475
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:53,314
Bear it a little longer.

476
00:39:55,273 --> 00:39:56,114
Please.

477
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:13,394
Xuan,

478
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:16,034
shall I sing the song you loved to hear

479
00:40:16,193 --> 00:40:18,233
when you were young?

480
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:20,634
