=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,640
=Episode 15=

3
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,039
(If I had kept my promise)

4
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,359
(to pick Xiaoyao up in Mount Jade,)

5
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,879
(Xiaoyao wouldn't have been lost.)

6
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,679
It was my fault.

7
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,240
Back then, you were young
and could barely protect yourself.

8
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,120
Even if you were there,

9
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,639
Queen Mother
wouldn't have let you take Xiaoyao.

10
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,999
Xiaoyao would know your predicament.

11
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,760
If I use my predicament as an excuse,

12
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,079
will it not be seen as a betrayal?

13
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,240
Xiaoyao has been outstanding
since childhood,

14
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,440
leading in cultivation among her peers.

15
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,240
But now her spirit power is weak.

16
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,399
She can hardly protect herself.

17
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,240
What has she gone through these years?

18
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,679
Her spirit power was abated.

19
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Xiaoyao waited for me
in Mount Jade for 70 years.

20
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,039
But I didn't go to pick her up.

21
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,679
When she suffered
in Dahuang, wandering around,

22
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,840
I did nothing for her.

23
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,439
No wonder she refuses to recognize me.

24
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,200
Xiaoyao has already done that

25
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,640
in her heart.

26
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,159
Yes.

27
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,200
Xiaoyao saved me twice.

28
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,280
No matter what she is now,

29
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,399
she's still Xiaoyao.

30
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,959
So much money.

31
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,760
Never seen so much.

32
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,319
Me neither.

33
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, my God.

34
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,119
To be honest,
I've never seen so much money either.

35
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,119
(What do you like?)

36
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,240
(I like money.)

37
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,999
(I wish I could roll
on a mountain of money.)

38
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,640
He really gave me a mountain of gold.

39
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,520
Well,

40
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,760
I have to try rolling
on a mountain of gold.

41
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,400
How is it?

42
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,640
It hurts.

43
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,920
But now I know what it feels like

44
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,039
to roll on a mountain of gold.

45
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,800
This was sent by His Highness.

46
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,119
He asked me to tell you
these mulberries are from Zhaoyun Peak.

47
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,999
Where is he?

48
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,599
He has been in a bad mood lately.

49
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,200
I don't know where he is now.

50
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,999
Oh.

51
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
He wants to tell you another thing.

52
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,599
If you feel bored,

53
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,520
go to Yiqing Garden.

54
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,279
Watch your step.

55
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:06,880
(Yiqing Garden)

56
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,879
If you're tired, I can carry you.

57
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,080
No, I'm fine sitting here for a while.

58
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
The melons are really delicious.

59
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,599
If you don't come up,

60
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,680
I'm going to eat them all.

61
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,960
Mother, I want to eat too.

62
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,520
- Slow down.
- Give me some.

63
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,879
Yummy.

64
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:53,480
I want more.

65
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,839
So delicious.

66
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,279
So delicious.

67
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,999
What's wrong?

68
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:10,760
Nothing.

69
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,839
It's just too hot.

70
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,319
It would be nice
to have some ice-cold melons now.

71
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:18,319
I'll go get it for you.

72
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,559
No need. I was just saying.

73
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,039
I'll be right back.

74
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:29,999
(It's been 300 years.)

75
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,760
(Its owner has changed.)

76
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
(Even if it's the same garden,)

77
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,360
(the scenery will be different now.)

78
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,599
On such a hot day, it's best to

79
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,400
cool down in Yiqing Garden.

80
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,960
It's a pity that my mother won't go out.

81
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,520
Everyone knows
His Majesty has only one wife

82
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,159
and favor only your mother.

83
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Her Highness is afraid
His Majesty will visit her later.

84
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,039
W-Why are you here?

85
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,080
W-Why can't I be here?

86
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,119
This is my home.

87
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,559
You lowly person can't be here.

88
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,919
Somebody, arrest him.

89
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,119
Return to Hanzhang Hall.

90
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:28,879
Be gentle, Miss.

91
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,359
Do you know your mistake?

92
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,879
You finally fell into my hands.

93
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:48,400
Xuan said you saved his life.

94
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,080
So, I won't take your life.

95
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,479
But you can't escape punishment.

96
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,760
That day...

97
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,679
That day...

98
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,679
I must have my revenge.

99
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,119
What happened that day?

100
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,080
You must make it clear.

101
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Hold out his hands.

102
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Hit his hands.

103
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:21,319
Your back is soft and fragrant.

104
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,119
Even if my hands are broken,

105
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,840
it is still worth it to touch it once.

106
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,479
Shut his mouth up.

107
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,760
Ever since I touched your back,

108
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,280
I've been thinking about it.

109
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,160
Your Highness.

110
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,640
Let...

111
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,280
Your Highness, he has
a grudge against you,

112
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,520
trying to say that to infuriate you

113
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,559
and ruin your reputation.

114
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,840
If you take it seriously,

115
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,439
you will fall for his tricks.

116
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,919
Your Highness, don't be mad.

117
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:56,999
It's really hateful.

118
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,296
Haoling values etiquette,

119
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:01,408
but he deliberately said so
to slander you.

120
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,799
He deserves severe punishment.

121
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,280
Yes, just kill him.

122
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,679
It doesn't matter
if Prince Cang Xuan blames you.

123
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,128
He's a prince of Xiyan,

124
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,696
not of Haoling.

125
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,400
He's just living here,
relying on His Majesty.

126
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,520
Why should you care?

127
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,040
Do it.

128
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,119
Hit his hands first, and then his mouth,

129
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,760
I'll take responsibility if he dies.

130
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,760
Yes.

131
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,760
Mr. Xiang, the supplies
have been delivered.

132
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:38,799
But now we're short of money.

133
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,160
The grain we purchased

134
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
will be used up before next spring.

135
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,080
I'll think of a way.

136
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,239
Mr. Xiang.

137
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:58,760
The accounts are good.

138
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,439
You may go.

139
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,239
Yes.

140
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,280
Tushan Jing is really useless.

141
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,200
You lowly man,
how dare you offend princess.

142
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,359
kill him.

143
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,520
You can't enter
without princess's permission.

144
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,319
Go and inform His Majesty.

145
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,799
Yes.

146
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,119
Mother, why are you here?

147
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:03,280
Stop.

148
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,616
(Consort Jing'an)

149
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,919
I

150
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,840
care the most

151
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,679
about you.

152
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,080
I promise

153
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,280
I'll be back soon.

154
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,720
Mother.

155
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,879
Mother.

156
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:53,999
Mother.

157
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,200
Catch this lowly man.

158
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,239
Mother.

159
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,840
Mother.

160
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,600
Mother.

161
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,799
Mother.

162
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,160
Mother.

163
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,319
Why did you abandon me?

164
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,239
Why?

165
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,760
Mother.

166
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,919
Why did you abandon me?

167
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,080
Why?

168
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,640
Why did you abandon me?

169
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,600
Why?

170
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,239
Go away.

171
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:47,008
Xiaoyao.

172
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,479
Xiaoyao, she's not.

173
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:51,319
Xiaoyao, she's not my auntie.

174
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,960
Xiaoyao, she's not your mother.

175
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,600
- He...
- Nian.

176
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,280
Take your mother to her room.

177
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,239
Xiaoyao.

178
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,439
Listen to me.

179
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:02,919
Mother.

180
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,080
Xiaoyao.

181
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,280
Listen to me.

182
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,520
Xiaoyao.

183
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,520
Xiaoyao.

184
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,840
She's not my auntie.

185
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,359
Mother.

186
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,559
She is my mother.

187
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,679
She is my mother, brother.

188
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,080
I want to ask her...

189
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,679
I want to ask her why she abandoned me.

190
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,600
Is it because I'm not good enough?

191
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,600
As long as she comes back,

192
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,840
I will be good.

193
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,160
Go and tell her.

194
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,200
Xiaoyao, I am your brother.

195
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,040
She is not my auntie.
Auntie died in battle.

196
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,919
She is Consort Jing'an.
She just looks like your mother.

197
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,040
My mother promised me.

198
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,999
She said she would be back.

199
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,799
She promised.

200
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,600
But she didn't return.

201
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,400
I don't blame her.

202
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,600
I just want to ask her

203
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,359
why she abandoned me?

204
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,879
Why did she abandon me?

205
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,559
Why?

206
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,720
Why?

207
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Why did she abandon me?

208
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,080
Why?

209
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,760
Brother.

210
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,400
Mother, I must find out who he is.

211
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,960
Why did Xuan and my father treat him

212
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,160
like that?

213
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,119
No way. I must figure it out.

214
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,679
Your Highness.

215
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,760
His Majesty ordered us to leave.

216
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,200
If you go back,

217
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,720
I'm afraid His Majesty will be mad.

218
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,239
Your Majesty.

219
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,879
It's just an external injury.

220
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,040
It will be fine soon.

221
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,760
You've already called me brother.

222
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:05,040
You can't deny it now.

Xiaoyao.

224
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,479
Nobody's called me that

I didn't pick you up

287

00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:36,920
Well,

325
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,440

If you want to live there,

329
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,359

330
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,040

331
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,400
Or you can choose other palaces.

332
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,119
No.

333
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,079
I'll stay in Huayin Hall.

334
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,239
So I can...

335
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,920
I can talk to Cang Xuan.

336
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,040
I also want to live with you,

337
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,560
but when you appear as a girl,

338
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,040
living with me in the same palace

339
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,239
might be inappropriate.

340
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,119
You can live here.

341
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,079
After I announce you're back,

342
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,640
you can move.

343
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Thank you, Master.

344
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:04,920
By the way,

345
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,119
he is the Jasper Mulberry

346
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,160

347

Your Highness.

350
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
I was sorry.

351
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,040
I was so stupid

352
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,479
that I couldn't recognize you.

353
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:30,640
Stop crying.

354
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,479
Since you know your mistake,
I must punish you.

355
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,160
I deserve it.

356
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:40,359
Grow mulberries every year

357
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,560
to brew wine for me.

358
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:44,599
Your Highness.

359
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,160
I kept a lot of good mulberries,

360
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,400
all saved for you.

361
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,599
Well,

362
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:50,959
I'm not smart,

363
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,680
failing to recognize you.

364
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,719
But,

365
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:54,760
- back then...
- Enough.

366
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,959
The food is getting cold.
Let's eat first.

367
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,400
I'll take my leave.

368
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,680
I can take care of her.

369
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,160
Eat meat.

370
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,280
How does it taste?

371
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,440
I can't believe
you can take care of people.

372
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,520
I once served anonymously
in the army for ten years.

373
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,599
There are no servants in the army.

374
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,839
Soldiers take care of each other.

375
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,320
I fed others,

376
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,879
and others fed me.

377
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,199
No wonder...

378
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,999
You experienced so much.

379
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,920
No wonder you seem casual.

380
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,719
Master and grandpa asked me
to gain experience.

381
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,680
Anyway, I have nothing else to do.

382
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,359
So, I did it.

383
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:10,719
Eat vegetables.

384
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,119
Do you want it again?

385
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,800
If you want more,
I'll give you my share.

386
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,640
I don't.

387
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,999
Luckily,

388
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,160
Master tolerated your behavior.

389
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,280
Send it to Mount Jade
and Xiyan Mountain.

390
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:44,359
Yes.

391
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:00,599
Heng,

392
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,119
our daughter has come back home.

393
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,160
I finally heard her

394
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,199
call me father again.

395
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,199
What should I call you now?

396
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,440
My father is King of Haoling.

397
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,119
And my mother is Princess General.

398
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:37,040
My name is Haoling Jiuyao.

399
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,719
I have a peach blossom birthmark
on my forehead,

400
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:42,119
so my parents also call me Xiaoyao.

401
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,160
It means vitality and prosperity.

402
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,719
But now, you can still call me Xiaoliu.

403
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,839
I know no matter who you are now,

404
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,839
you won't change.

405
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,560
But...

406
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,879
But what? Are you scared?

407
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,760
I've always been very scared.

408
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,160
I will if I start to care about

409
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,599
and like someone.

410
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,040
It's normal.

411
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,599
I don't get it.

412
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,719
This is the wine I brewed 200 years ago.

413
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,160
There are only two bottles of it left.

414
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,479
I've been keeping them.

415
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,599
Good wine.

416
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:05,800
Xiaoyao.

417
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,440
There are only the three of us here.

418
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:11,920
I want to know what happened

419
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
after you left Mount Jade.

420
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,640
It's okay
if you don't want to talk about it.

421
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:27,839
I have to tell it anyway.

422
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,760
But I'll only say it once.

423
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,280
If my father and grandfather

424
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
ask about it,

425
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,119
you can tell them for me.

426
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,400
Alright.

427
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,879
I left Mount Jade
with two maids of Haoling,

428
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,560
planning to go back
to Wushen Mountain to find my father.

429
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,280
His Majesty and her mother
have already divorced.

430
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,959
She's not a princess of Haoling anymore.

431
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,239
Doesn't she feel embarrassed

432
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,079
to return to Wushen Mountain?

433
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:57,119
I heard

434
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,160
her mother had an affair
with another man,

435
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,320
so His Majesty dumped her.

436
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:03,199
His Majesty showed mercy to her

437
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,320
and let her live.

438
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,040
She even asked us to tell His Majesty
that she misses him,

439
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,440
asking His Majesty to take her home.

440
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,160
That's ridiculous.

441
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,440
Think about it.

442
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,599
If His Majesty really cares about her,

443
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,400
will he let her wait

444
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,800
for 70 years in Mount Jade?

445
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:26,239
Nonsense.

446
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:31,599
Brother.

447
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,479
My father has already punished them.

448
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,160
It's all right now.

449
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:45,160
Then, I went to Jizhou,

450
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,520
because they said
my mother died there in the battle.

451
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:54,400
But she promised me
that she would come back.

452
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,680
I didn't believe

453
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,999
she would leave me heartlessly.

454
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,119
So, I went through hardship

455
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,760
to reach Jizhou.

456
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,999
But I couldn't find mother.

457
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,839
I didn't know where to go,

458
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,760
so I wandered around Dahuang.

459
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,999
Back then, the Central Plains were
in constant strife.

460
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,320
It was very unstable.

461
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,760
The notice says
Princess of Haoling is missing.

462
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,199
King of Haoling and King of Xiyan
are searching everywhere.

463
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,479
Any information provider
will be rewarded.

464
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,920
She's the most valuable in Dahuang.

465
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,680
If someone gets her,

466
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,520
he will make a fortune.

467
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
(Notice for looking for Xiaoyao)
You mortals are short-sighted.

468
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,079
What's the use of money?

469
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,320
I heard this little girl has lived
in Mount Jade for 70 years.

470
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,199
(Notice)
She's the only disciple of the Queen Mother.

471
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,079
She was fed
with immortal peaches and chalcedony.

472
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,640
Her body is full of spiritual energy.

473
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:45,199
If someone eats her,

474
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,839
cultivation will be improved greatly.

475
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,040
Move.

476
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:19,719
I only have this.

477
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,199
It's enough for today's meal.

478
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,560
Stand up, all of you.

479
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,920
None of you can run.

480
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,280
Whoever runs, I will eat him.

481
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,640
(If only I had no birthmark.)

482
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,439
Lift up your head.

483
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,239
(If I had freckles on my face,)

484
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:47,999
(a flat nose,)

485
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,159
(and smaller eyes,)

486
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,880
(he wouldn't recognize me.)

487
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,679
Bad luck.

488
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,600
(Although I didn't know why,)

489
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
(I could change not only my appearance)

490
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,239
(but also my gender.)

491
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:13,280
(I started to wander around
with various faces.)

492
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,760
I will never fear being recognized.

493
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,999
(One day, while looking at the mirror,)

494
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,080
(I suddenly realized
I forgot what I looked like.)

495
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,639
(I couldn't change back.)

496
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,840
A faceless monster!

497
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,439
No, I'm not a faceless monster.

498
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:43,959
I'm not a monster.

499
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:48,320
(My face was always changing,)

500
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,280
(and every face was fake.)

501
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,760
No matter how hard I tried,

502
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,999
I couldn't find my old face.

503
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:58,800
Later, I realized it wasn't

504
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,360
that I learned the illusion technique
on my own.

505
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,999
The truth was

506
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,159
I got an incurable strange disease.

507
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,199
Xiaoyao.

508
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,919
Any disease can be cured.

509
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,120
No matter how strange the disease,

510
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,320
there's always a cure.

511
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,360
What happened later?

512
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,439
As my face kept changing,

513
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,280
I didn't dare to see anyone.

514
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,520
I hid in the mountains and forests.

515
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,199
But thanks to Queen Mother's guidance,

516
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,280
my cultivation was not bad.

517
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,159
Some fierce beasts were not my match.

518
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,719
I was quite free in the mountains.

519
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,919
I just felt a little bored.

520
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,679
I couldn't play with

521
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,439
nor talk to anyone.

522
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,560
So I caught a monkey and talked to it.

523
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,239
And I teased a snake demon
that had yet to transform into a human.

524
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:00,439
I lived like this
for more than 20 years.

525
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,520
Then, I met a man.

526
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:04,399
(Nine-tailed fox)

527
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,479
(He was a nine-tailed fox.)

528
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,080
(He could also change faces.)

529
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,239
(We competed in changing faces.)

530
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,880
(The nine-tailed fox)

531
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,999
(had a mirror,
forged from the soul of ape,)

532
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
(that can remember the past.)

533
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:24,840
(He asked me
to record my face with the mirror.)

534
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:26,239
(Gradually,)

535
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,919
(I learned to maintain
my own appearance.)

536
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,199
(At first, I was very wary,)

537
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,560
(but he didn't treat me as a monster.)

538
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,760
(He even taught me many things.)

539
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:43,760
Is this where you live?

540
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,199
Why?

541
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,239
Your mother killed my best friend,

542
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,520
and cut off one of my tails.

543
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,840
Unfortunately, your mother is dead.

544
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,080
I have to let you pay the price.

545
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,320
(To vent his anger,)

546
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,239
(he tortured me in various ways.)

547
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:12,159
(He fed me strange things every day,)

548
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,760
(scattering my spirit power
into my meridians,)

549
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,320
(trying to make me
into the best spiritual medicine.)

550
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,919
It's been 30 years.

551
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,600
30 years.

552
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,479
In two more days,
it will be a full moon.

553
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,880
Finally, it's almost done.

554
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,760
Let me think about how to eat you.

555
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,159
You wish.

556
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,840
How dare you.

557
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,679
(It's a long time.)

558
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,479
(Perhaps he thought)

559
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,239
(I had forgotten
about the outside world.)

560
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:47,120
(Or perhaps I no longer
had spirit power,)

561
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,239
(so he lowered his guard.)

562
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,520
(When I deliberately provoked him,)

563
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:54,280
(he rushed into the cage)

564
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,199
(and beat me without any precaution.)

565
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,800
(He didn't expect)

566
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,040
(I secretly made
a poison with the herbs)

567
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,919
(I collected bit by bit.)

568
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,320
(I used my blood to poison him.)

569
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:44,040
Is this his broken tail?

570
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:47,719
Brother.

571
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:51,280
He imprisoned
and tortured me for 30 years,

572
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,959
but I took his life.

573
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,919
My grudges with him have been settled.

574
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:58,639
His tail is very rare.

575
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,679
You keep it.

576
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,439
It can help you transform
and break through barriers.

577
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,399
I don't want it.

578
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,560
Let him cool down.

579
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,439
You keep it for me.

580
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,120
Your family governs the world's foxes,
proficient in illusion technique.

581
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,479
What disease does Xiaoyao have?

582
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:33,280
Why can't she
recover her true appearance?

583
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,840
My family is good at illusion technique.

584
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,040
But I have never heard of this disease.

585
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,239
Xiaoyao.

586
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,040
It's all my fault.

587
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,679
You have suffered so much

588
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,760
these years.

589
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:15,320
It's my fault.

590
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,360
I didn't fulfill my responsibility
as a father.

591
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,840
Master, what's wrong
with Xiaoyao's face?

592
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,959
What disease has she got?

593
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,120
Master.

594
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,360
Her face changes.

595
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,080
It's not a disease.

596
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,159
Isn't it?

597
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,719
Not a disease? What is it?

598
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:54,600
There is a rare weapon inside you,

599
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:55,959
called Rejuvenating Flower.

600
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,159
It can help people
keep any appearance they want.

601
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,479
So it makes my appearance change.

602
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,399
But why is it sealed in my body?

603
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:10,800
Father, if you take it out,

604
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,120
I'll have my original appearance,

605
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,919
and it won't change randomly, right?

606
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,080
Yes.

607
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:19,159
Father, help me take it out.

608
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:21,080
I would rather be an ugly person.

609
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,199
I don't want
to become a false, faceless one.

610
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:25,959
Right now, I can't help you take it out.

611
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:28,199
But I promise you.

612
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:30,719
I will restore your true appearance.

613
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,439
It's okay.
I've waited so many years anyway,

614
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,080
I have enough patience.
