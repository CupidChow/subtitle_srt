=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,352
=Episode 33=

3
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:08,437
Xiaoyao.

4
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:02,756
Cang Xuan.

5
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:09,917
Brother.

6
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:12,917
- Brother.
- Don't call me brother.

7
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:16,756
I think about you day and night,

8
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:18,396
but look at you.

9
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:22,197
You run to see another man
as soon as you return,

10
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:23,676
not thinking about me at all.

11
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,717
Brother.

12
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:30,876
Brother.

13
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:32,676
Brother.

14
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:36,596
Brother.

15
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:38,557
- Wait for me.
- Don't call me brother.

16
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:41,357
I don't have such a heartless sister.

17
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,156
Brother,

18
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,796
you really don't want me anymore?

19
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:47,997
It's not me.

20
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:49,956
It's you who abandon me.

21
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,756
I heard that Jing
was in critical condition,

22
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:55,232
so I came to see him first.

23
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:56,676
Aren't you worried about me?

24
00:03:56,676 --> 00:03:57,717
How could I not?

25
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,396
I often thought of you
when I was unconscious.

26
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:03,904
I came to Zhiyi
to see it bustling as usual,

27
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:06,997
so I was slightly relieved.

28
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:10,277
After I saw Xinyue,
the first person I asked about was you.

29
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,157
This time, I was really scared to death.

30
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:26,877
In the middle of the night,

31
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,956
I often woke up alone from nightmares.

32
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,236
I was afraid that you would be
just like my mother and...

33
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:35,837
my auntie.

34
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,277
It's okay now.

35
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:46,516
Don't worry.
I'll be careful from now on.

36
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:58,676
Come back to Chenrong with me.

37
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:10,157
Can I go back with you
after Jing wakes up?

38
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:15,837
Brother.

39
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:20,117
Okay.

40
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:21,676
But

41
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:24,916
mind your manners.

42
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:28,356
You've clung to him so closely.
I wonder what others may think of you.

43
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,037
Don't you have pursuers?

44
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:33,277
And you have to
chase after him like this?

45
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:37,277
Yes, I'll remember your words.

46
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:43,037
How did Xiang Liu save you?

47
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:45,877
All the physicians I got said

48
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,757
you were...

49
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:53,317
I guess it's related
to the poisonous bug I gave him.

50
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:57,236
I was clinging to his vitality
to maintain a glimmer of life.

51
00:05:57,717 --> 00:06:00,236
Then he must have performed
a blood curse

52
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,196
to extend my life.

53
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:04,437
I will keep my promise to Xiang Liu,

54
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:06,916
and I don't want him to play tricks.

55
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:10,317
His rescue of me

56
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:12,437
came with conditions?

57
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,196
He's cold-hearted,

58
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,317
and he never does anything for nothing.

59
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,796
Of course, he wouldn't
save you for no reason.

60
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:21,356
What did he ask for?

61
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,956
A peak of the Chenrong Mountain.

62
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,356
(I was worrying about
how to repay his life-saving grace.)

63
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:33,796
(I didn't expect it.)

64
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:36,997
(That's Xiang Liu with Nine Lives)

65
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,717
(who never loses out on a deal.)

66
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:54,676
You really found Zhulong's tendon.

67
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,396
How is the bow and arrow forging going?

68
00:06:59,277 --> 00:06:59,916
Don't worry.

69
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:02,037
I've been forging this bow for 45 years.

70
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:03,117
I only need the bowstring.

71
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:05,557
Now the last material is found.

72
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,256
In at most three months,
I can forge the bow and arrow you want.

73
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:10,997
I'll come for it in three months.

74
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:12,277
No problem.

75
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,196
(Chenrong Mansion)

76
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:19,117
Let's toast with tea

77
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:21,037
to celebrate Xiaoyao's safe return.

78
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:32,476
It is still unknown
when Jing will wake up.

79
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,476
I just told Xiaoyao

80
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:45,636
that if Jing hadn't appeared
to save her, even if I rushed there,

81
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:47,717
it would have been too late.

82
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:50,317
Xiaoyao is very grateful
for Jing's life-saving grace,

83
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:53,516
and she happens to know some folk cures
that match Jing's symptoms.

84
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:55,717
So she wants to stay
in the Muxi Garden to help.

85
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:57,717
Whatever the cures,

86
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:59,597
the most urgent thing right now
is to save Jing.

87
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:01,076
Not only his family needs him,

88
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,717
but Cang Xuan and I
need him very much too.

89
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:06,117
Xiaoyao, are you sure
you can wake him up?

90
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,037
Pretty sure about it.

91
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:11,837
That's great. Xiaoyao's our lucky star.

92
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,236
Once she's back, it's all good news.

93
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:34,957
Yu Jiang. There's an assassin!

94
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,077
Xiaoyao,

95
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,836
he didn't come to assassinate me.

96
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,517
He is now under my command.

97
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:42,877
Greetings, Princess.

98
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,236
What's going on?

99
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:47,517
Let's leave them alone.

100
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:50,077
A lot has happened in these 37 years.

101
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,317
I will tell you bit by bit.

102
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:01,796
Sorry for not living up to your trust.

103
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,832
The food price
has increased by 30 percent lately.

104
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:06,517
The food I brought back this time

105
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,916
will only last for two months,

106
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:09,596
far from what the army needs.

107
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,077
This is not your fault.

108
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,276
You've done very well.

109
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:22,077
Thank you, Your Highness.

110
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:23,757
It's hard to go on without money.

111
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:26,036
I hope Xiaoyao can cure Jing soon.

112
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:27,476
With him around,

113
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,476
we'll have a lot less trouble
getting food and supplies.

114
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,517
But when Tushan Jing
will wake up is still unknown.

115
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:40,716
We can't put all our hopes on him.

116
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,716
You're right.

117
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:44,877
How about this?

118
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:48,716
I'll see if I can move some money
from somewhere else first

119
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,356
to alleviate the food shortage.

120
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:52,957
I'll try to think of a way too.

121
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:00,596
Jing,

122
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,236
Cang Xuan won't let me
sleep in your room.

123
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:05,317
But if we don't tell others,

124
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:06,796
no one will know.

125
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:09,356
Let's pretend this never happened.

126
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:16,317
Can you even hear me?

127
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,916
Your hair doesn't look
as good as before.

128
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,757
It needs some time of care.

129
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:39,957
What business is it of yours?

130
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:41,836
You don't even have a single hair.

131
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:47,476
Baldy.

132
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:00,676
Jing,

133
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,356
your bones will poke me again.

134
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:05,276
You're so skinny.

135
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,077
You need to eat more.

136
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:11,716
They all say you didn't want to live

137
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,676
because I died.

138
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:16,517
Do you really care about me that much?

139
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:18,877
Jing,

140
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,397
if you really see me
as important as your life,

141
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,676
will you never abandon me

142
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:27,596
no matter what happens?

143
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:37,957
Jing,

144
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:40,517
you're very smart.

145
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:45,397
You can't answer this kind of question.

146
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:48,557
Some things can't be said.

147
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:51,117
Once they're said, they seem fake.

148
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:56,236
Besides, even if you said it,
I wouldn't believe you.

149
00:12:57,197 --> 00:13:00,397
Things are unpredictable,
and people change.

150
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,997
After all, I don't even believe myself.

151
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:16,276
Jing,

152
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,276
wake up soon.

153
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:42,437
The princess's not out yet?

154
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:44,637
No.

155
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,437
Should we start working first?

156
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:50,957
No, the princess will be shy
if she sees us,

157
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:54,356
and then she might not come
to see our master in the future.

158
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:00,916
She's out.

159
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:20,356
Luckily, no one noticed.

160
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,836
Here's the list of death row convicts
from the Central Plains, Your Majesty.

161
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,596
Deal with them according to the law.

162
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:37,437
News from the Central Plains.
The Great Princess has woken up.

163
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:43,197
It's good.

164
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:50,957
Pardon these criminals

165
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,117
to accumulate blessings for Xiaoyao.

166
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:54,637
Yes.

167
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:05,276
Your Majesty,

168
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:07,236
Cang Xuan has sent an urgent message.

169
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:23,916
- Xiaoyao has woken up.
- That's great.

170
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,596
She must be weak after a long illness.

171
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,276
She needs to eat much nutritious food.

172
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,077
Prepare a gift list right away
and send the gifts.

173
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:32,397
Yes.

174
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:40,832
(Sunlight Hall)

175
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,317
I have no interest in you.

176
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:52,036
Why are you so persistent?

177
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:55,596
Although there is no one

178
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,036
in the world

179
00:15:57,197 --> 00:16:00,437
as both good-looking and talented as me.

180
00:16:00,736 --> 00:16:04,836
But as long as you don't use me
as a standard for choosing a husband

181
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:07,077
and lower your standards,

182
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:10,757
I believe it's not hard
to find a good man.

183
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:14,836
Do you know
what sets you apart from the rest?

184
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,317
Your unparalleled narcissism.

185
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:22,836
Thank you for the compliment.

186
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,596
I've heard 'someone' woke up
and that Father wants you

187
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:29,716
to go to visit her with gifts.

188
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:30,997
That 'someone' hasn't woken up.

189
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,676
It's the Great Princess
who has woken up.

190
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,716
His Majesty ordered me to prepare
some millennia-aged water marrow,

191
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:37,397
but there's none in the storeroom.

192
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:39,716
I need to see where I can get some.

193
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,637
Please,

194
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:44,036
let me leave.

195
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:49,676
Nian, I'm really in a hurry.

196
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,236
Millennia-aged water marrow.

197
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,117
I think I have a lot of it at my place.

198
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,997
May I get some if you don't need it?

199
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,356
So you're not in a hurry now?

200
00:17:03,476 --> 00:17:04,277
(Sunlight Hall)
No.

201
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,637
The weather is cool today.

202
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:09,836
I will take you out for fun.

203
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,476
You have time,
but I'm the one who doesn't.

204
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:12,877
Just millennia-aged water marrow.

205
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:15,196
Anyway, my pet is fed up with it,
and there's a lot left.

206
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:17,836
For pity's sake,
I'll give it to 'that someone'.

207
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:20,716
I appreciate it
on behalf of 'that someone'.

208
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,836
It has nothing to do with me.

209
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:24,196
Thank my pet instead.

I'll tie you up like Cang Xuan.

218

You're awake.

219
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:27,086
Why didn't you tell me when you woke up?

220
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:29,446
I was afraid it was a dream

221
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:33,045
and that if I made a sound,
you'd run away.

222
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:42,645
Is it still a dream?

223
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:46,966
No.

224
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,005
Jing Ye is still watching.

225
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:06,806
I didn't see anything.

226
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:11,245
Xiaoyao,

227
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,446
I've always wanted to be your husband,

228
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:17,966
to be with you openly and honorably.

229
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,645
But you are the Princess of Haoling.

230
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,686
Only the identity of Tushan Jing
is worthy of you.

231
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:28,645
So, I've been reluctant
to give up on this identity

232
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,686
that can marry you in a proper manner.

233
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,686
But I was wrong.

234
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:36,125
I don't want to be Tushan Jing anymore.

235
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,726
Whether I can be with you
openly and honorably is not important.

236
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,125
Even if I don't get
recognition for a lifetime,

237
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:48,326
even if I'm your servant for a lifetime,
it doesn't matter.

238
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:51,005
I just want to be by your side

239
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:53,165
to protect you.

240
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:58,285
Jing,

241
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,926
do you really see me

242
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:04,885
as important as your life?

243
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:06,926
Not the same.

244
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:11,926
You're more important than my life.

245
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:20,326
Xiaoyao,

246
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,645
you once complained about my thinking

247
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:25,966
I was not good enough

248
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:28,326
but unwilling to let go.

249
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,645
In fact, I know

250
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,326
you can still live well without me.

251
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:39,165
I also understand
that Fangfeng Bei is better for you.

252
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:43,045
But I can't let go.

253
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:45,966
As long as I live for a day,

254
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:47,846
I can't.

255
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:49,606
Xiaoyao,

256
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:51,966
I'm sorry.

257
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:55,645
I'm sorry.

258
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:01,446
Fool.

259
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,005
What I want

260
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:07,245
is that you will hold on to me

261
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:09,525
no matter what.

262
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:11,806
Don't abandon me.

263
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:15,966
My mother left me

264
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,606
for the greater good.

265
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:22,245
My grandfather, for my sake,

266
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:25,086
sent me to Mount Jade.

267
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,645
My father, for my safety,

268
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,566
didn't let me return to Haoling.

269
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:33,726
Cang Xuan promised
to pick me up at Mount Jade,

270
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:36,806
but in the end, he broke his word.

271
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:40,566
I waited for them for 70 years,

272
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:45,486
but they all abandoned me
for various reasons.

273
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:49,086
So

274
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:53,165
I'm really very happy

275
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,606
that you can't abandon me.

Jing, you're finally awake.

281
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:28,686
Sorry for the trouble
I brought you and Fenglong.

282
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:29,765
We're family.

283
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:31,125
You've just stayed for a while.

284
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:32,726
Jing, don't be such a stranger.

285
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:35,045
I'll have someone tell
my brother and Cang Xuan.

286
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:52,086
Now the major decisions of your family
are still made by Grand Madam.

287
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:55,486
For routine affairs,
Tushan Hou and Fangfeng Yiying

288
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:57,525
are each responsible for a part,
balancing each other out.

289
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:03,365
What's wrong?

290
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:17,165
Go on.

291
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:19,926
Shall we go somewhere else?

292
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:23,566
No need.

293
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:25,606
She's afraid of loneliness

294
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:27,885
and likes the company of human voices.

295
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:31,606
Miss,

296
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:33,885
Master and Prince Cang Xuan are here.

297
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:35,125
Go invite them in.

298
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:47,326
Jing,

299
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,486
I thought you'd already got past caring
about anything

300
00:24:57,645 --> 00:24:58,926
and planned to just sleep away.

301
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:01,086
But you seem still attached
to the mundane world.

302
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,005
I really troubled you this time.

303
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:08,005
Yeah, you did.

304
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:10,206
So, you'd better buck up

305
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:11,365
to help us.

306
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:12,165
Okay.

307
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,206
I'm glad you're fine.

308
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:17,606
Thank you for your concern.

309
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:20,086
Where's Xiaoyao?

310
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,365
Didn't you sleep well?

311
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,206
I slept a bit late.

312
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:37,525
You can look after the sick,

313
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:39,686
but you can't look after yourself?

314
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:50,525
Fenglong,

315
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,045
- these years...
- Jing,

316
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:55,966
eat this half bowl of porridge.

317
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:12,566
Jing, when did you become so obedient?

318
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:17,245
Xiaoyao,

319
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,645
pack your things later and go back
to the Chenrong Mountain with me.

320
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:28,285
Got it.

321
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:30,525
Let me help you.

322
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:36,686
Xiaoyao, what's going on
between you and Jing?

323
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:39,726
It's just what you think.

324
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:40,405
You!

325
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:42,566
You and Jing?

326
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,566
He has feelings for you?

327
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:46,566
Not only him.

328
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,245
We both have feelings for each other.

329
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:51,125
We love each other.

330
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:04,125
Jing, I won't hide it from you.

331
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:06,365
Cang Xuan and I are desperate for money,

332
00:27:06,765 --> 00:27:08,566
desperate for a large sum of money.

333
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:09,966
Got it.

334
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:11,686
Just "got it"?

335
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:12,926
Will you help us or not?

336
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:16,165
Can I say no?

337
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:17,206
Of course not.

338
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:18,326
Then why the question?

339
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:19,966
I don't need to ask you,

340
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:22,125
but you have to reassure Cang Xuan.

341
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:28,726
I can't help with other things,

342
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,765
but I know
a thing or two about business.

343
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:33,765
You can rest assured
about the money matter.

344
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:37,245
Look.

345
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:39,165
I told you as long as Jing woke up,

346
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:41,645
our pressing issue
would be resolved for sure.

347
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:43,486
Both of us are spenders.

348
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:46,086
We need the assistance
of this wealth-gathering fox.

349
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,446
It's a pity that his aspirations
are different from ours.

350
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,446
He helps us purely out of friendship.

351
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,206
Regardless of whose friendship,

352
00:27:53,926 --> 00:27:54,765
thank you anyway.

353
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:24,365
I want to tell you something.

354
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:27,486
Go ahead.

355
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:35,686
To solve your issues,

356
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:38,365
I need to rush back to Qingqiu.

357
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:40,926
After returning,

358
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,045
I plan to tell my grandma everything.

359
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:45,005
I've decided

360
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:46,885
whatever her attitude,

361
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:49,806
I will go back to Xiaoyao's side

362
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:51,446
and stay with her forever.

363
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:54,365
Tushan Jing,

364
00:28:56,806 --> 00:28:58,245
are you negotiating with me?

365
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:02,326
How could I use Xiaoyao to make a deal?

366
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:06,165
I'm asking for your permission.

367
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:10,566
You want to stay with Xiaoyao.

368
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,285
Is Xiaoyao in danger again?

369
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:20,726
I'm sorry, Fenglong.

370
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:24,926
I adore Xiaoyao and want to be with her.

371
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:39,206
You fell into unconsciousness
because of Xiaoyao?

372
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,206
I know you want to marry her,

373
00:29:44,926 --> 00:29:46,125
but I can't lose her.

374
00:29:48,846 --> 00:29:50,885
You know I want to marry her,
yet you still dare to covet her.

375
00:29:51,285 --> 00:29:52,966
You even lured my fiancée in my house!

376
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:53,365
Fenglong.

377
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:53,885
Tushan Jing,

378
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,645
I see you as my brother,
but what about you?

379
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:56,525
Fenglong, calm down.

380
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:57,846
I just want to kill him right now.

381
00:29:57,966 --> 00:29:59,486
Tushan Jing, get out of here.

382
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:00,765
Take your darn money and leave.

383
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:01,365
Anyone!

384
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,285
Don't think we must need your money.

385
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:05,165
- Drag him away!
- Tushan Jing.

386
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:07,486
Tushan Jing.

387
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:09,806
Tushan Jing.

388
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:16,045
Fenglong.

389
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:28,005
My brother is furious right now.
Don't take it to heart.

390
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:28,765
I know.

391
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,926
You should go and check on him now.

392
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:32,926
Fenglong.

393
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,245
I believe in your feelings
for Xiaoyao, but...

394
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:44,086
you're engaged as Tushan Jing,

395
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:47,525
and the Grand Madam of Tushan
values Fangfeng Yiying very much.

396
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:49,566
She won't agree
to cancel the engagement.

397
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:53,005
I was once desperate
to confidently walk up

398
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:55,125
to the King of Haoling

399
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:57,446
as Tushan Jing to marry Xiaoyao.

400
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:00,405
For this, I endured a lot.

401
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:03,086
But after experiencing loss once,

402
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:05,806
I found that nothing else matters.

403
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:08,765
As long as I can be with Xiaoyao,

404
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:10,606
I am willing to give up everything.

405
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:13,966
If my grandmother doesn't agree,

406
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:17,765
I can give up being Tushan Jing.

407
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,086
Are you sure?

408
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,005
If you give up being Tushan Jing,

409
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:28,686
you will be nothing.

410
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:30,525
Even if I'm not Tushan Jing,

411
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,165
I can still be Ye Shiqi.

412
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:35,885
The one with nothing?

413
00:31:36,806 --> 00:31:37,165
Yes.

414
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:51,606
I can't make this decision for Xiaoyao.

415
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,206
It will depend on her.

416
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:58,765
When I saved him,

417
00:31:59,125 --> 00:31:59,966
he had nothing.

418
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,285
So I don't mind

419
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:05,726
if he becomes nothing again.

420
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:57,664
(Prosperity)

421
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,464
(Tushan Mansion)

422
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:37,326
So similar.

423
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:40,846
It's like we're back at Zhaoyun Peak.

424
00:33:41,216 --> 00:33:49,161
♪I crossed the mountains and waters,

♪You are in my mind but not hold my hand♪

429
00:34:21,216 --> 00:34:26,486
Suddenly, everything
you told me came true.

430
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:30,605
37 years.

431
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:35,805
You may think it's fleeting, a flash.

432
00:34:37,006 --> 00:34:40,565
But for me, it's been an eternity and
night after night of worry.

433
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,165
These phoenix trees.

434
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:47,805
They grew from young saplings
to the current towering ones.

435
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:52,046
I remember every bit of their growth

436
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:55,286
as if it's been a thousand years.

Xuan, don't worry.

439
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:03,645
I'll be with you from now on.

440
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:05,446
I won't make you worry about me anymore.

441
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,046
If Tushan Jing
does cancel the engagement,

442
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:12,085
he'll rush to Master
to ask for your hand in marriage.

443
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:13,926
How then will you accompany me?

444
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:19,686
Then I'll have Jing come live
with me on the Chenrong Mountain.

Have you really thought it through?

448
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:40,085
Jing might not be the best man,

449
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:43,125
nor is he necessarily
the most suitable one for you.

450
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:47,526
But he's the one who will never
abandon me no matter what happens.

451
00:35:51,446 --> 00:35:51,885
Xuan,

452
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,206
you and I were abandoned as children.

453
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:57,805
I believe you understand what I want.

454
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:01,286
Even if Jing is willing
to give up his status,

455
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,286
we both know

456
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:07,085
that some bonds
are flowing in the blood,

457
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,206
not something
you can give up if you want to

458
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:11,565
or sever if you wish to.

459
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:14,805
The Grand Madam of the Tushan Family

460
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,006
is notoriously obstinate,

461
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:18,365
stubborn and hard to deal with.

462
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:20,565
Have you thought about the future?

463
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:24,405
The future doesn't depend on me.

464
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:25,885
It depends on Jing.

465
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:29,845
I'll wait it out and see
what result he will give me.

466
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:34,565
I haven't seen you waiting for others,

467
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:38,486
so it seems

468
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,085
that Jing is special to you.

469
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:47,206
Xuan,

470
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,405
stop worrying about me.

471
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,926
I've experienced
too many disappointments,

472
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:53,405
so I've long since learned

473
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:55,325
to always think
about the worst possible outcome.

474
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,125
Didn't you say it?

475
00:36:57,845 --> 00:36:59,325
If you don't want to be disappointed,

476
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:01,926
then never give yourself hope.

477
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:08,605
No matter what the result,

478
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:11,966
I'll be here.

479
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:17,246
I know.

If you don't agree,

00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:26,645
then I have to leave our family.

490
00:38:27,486 --> 00:38:28,206
You brat.

491
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:30,885
For the Great Princess of Haoling,

492
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:33,325
you suffered terrible internal injuries

493
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:35,165
and nearly lost your life.

494
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,805
What position do you put our family in?

495
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:39,405
You want me dead?

496
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:41,805
No matter how noble the princess is,

497
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:46,405
and how much you love each other,
you can never marry her.

498
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:48,645
Grandma.

499
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,046
The princess is already back.

500
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:09,966
Why are you still worried,
Your Highness?

501
00:39:10,486 --> 00:39:12,085
It's been 37 years since Xiaoyao

502
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,286
had an accident in the plum forest.

503
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,766
But every time I think about it,

504
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:20,766
I still feel the lingering fear.

505
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,165
You've asked so many guards
with strong spirit power

506
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:24,405
to guard the princess all day.

507
00:39:24,766 --> 00:39:26,766
This time, nothing will go wrong.

508
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,206
I can tell you
why I want to kill your sister.

509
00:39:46,165 --> 00:39:48,446
Because she shouldn't be
the Great Princess of Haoling at all.

510
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:51,006
She is the daughter of Chichen.

511
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:55,885
Xiaoxiao.

512
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:00,206
Your Highness.

513
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,446
I want you to go to Baili

514
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:02,880
and investigate something for me.

515
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:04,486
But you must act secretly

516
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:06,405
and not let others know.

517
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:14,125
I called you over

518
00:40:14,766 --> 00:40:16,006
because I want to tell you something.

519
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:19,365
Last night, I discussed
with several elders

520
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:22,766
and we decided to hold
a ceremony three days later.

521
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:27,085
Jing will serve
as the head of our family.

522
00:40:28,405 --> 00:40:31,885
The time is tight,
so not too many guests will be invited.

523
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:35,006
The Kings of Xiyan and Haoling
and representatives

524
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:38,526
from the six major families
including Chishui, Xiling and Guifang

525
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:42,085
in the Central Plains
will come to watch the ceremony.

526
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:44,365
That's enough.

527
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:47,565
Grandmother,

528
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,926
let's talk about this matter
in a few years.

529
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:51,286
A few years.

530
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:55,206
How long do you think I can live?

531
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:58,125
This time, whether you want it or not,

532
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,486
you must take over as the head.

533
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:01,006
Grandmother,

534
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:04,486
the head should be the capable one.

535
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:05,405
I disagree.

536
00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:08,046
Please cancel the ceremony
three days later.

537
00:41:08,726 --> 00:41:10,165
Please cancel the ceremony.

538
00:41:10,565 --> 00:41:11,805
My brother is the best choice.

539
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:12,565
Tushan Jing,

540
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:15,766
stop patronizing me.

541
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:17,885
I don't need your charity.

542
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:22,845
Grandmother.

543
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:25,085
Grandmother.

544
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,085
I won't hide it from you anymore.

545
00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:35,046
I only

546
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:37,325
have no more than six months

547
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:40,165
to live.

548
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,645
(Prosperity)

549
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:51,046
The physicians and maids
will take care of Grand Madam.

550
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:52,966
Masters, please go back.

551
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:00,165
Now Grand Madam is still clear-minded.

552
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:01,926
But in a few more days,

553
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:03,805
when her spirit power is exhausted,

554
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:05,605
she'll gradually lose consciousness.

555
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:09,006
I beg you to fulfill Grand Madam's wish

556
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,565
for the sake of our family,

557
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:15,125
and let her see the new family head

558
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,006
when she is clear-minded.

559
00:42:30,526 --> 00:42:31,006
Jing,

560
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:34,246
you can disregard my feelings,

561
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:36,365
but you can't let Grandmother down.

562
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:39,085
For you

563
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:40,845
and for the entire family,

564
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:41,966
she has given her life.

565
00:43:41,325 --> 00:43:43,405
High and thick as a wall.

566
00:43:45,046 --> 00:43:46,845
Like comb teeth stacks are close.

567
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:49,325
Stores are opened in rows.

568
00:43:51,085 --> 00:43:52,686
Wives and children repose

569
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:56,605
when all the stores are full.

570
00:43:58,046 --> 00:44:00,006
We kill a tawny bull,

571
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:04,165
whose horns crooked appear.

572
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:08,526
We follow fathers dear

573
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:11,645
to perform rites with cheer.

574
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:22,206
I thought no matter
how big this mansion was,

575
00:44:23,446 --> 00:44:24,726
where there's a will,

576
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,206
there's a way out.

577
00:44:29,726 --> 00:44:31,125
But I can never get rid of

578
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:35,365
this surname

579
00:44:43,526 --> 00:44:45,565
