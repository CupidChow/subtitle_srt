=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:36,512
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:40,768
(Chenrong Mansion)

4
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,330
Jing,

5
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:54,930
did you travel all the way to Zhiyi

6
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,091
just to persuade me to follow Cang Xuan

7
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,411
and join him in his great cause?

8
00:01:58,811 --> 00:01:59,411
Yes.

9
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,610
Cang Xuan is insightful, generous,

10
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,011
courageous, and loyal to friends.

11
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,970
He could be a good friend.

12
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,411
But as an ally...

13
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:25,131
I know.

14
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:27,810
Fifth King Xiyan Deyan
and Seventh King Xiyan Yuyang

15
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:29,730
have been running the Xiyan court
for centuries.

16
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:31,411
They have entrenched position

17
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,291
and great power.

18
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:35,211
Cang Xuan, however, is weak

19
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,890
with flimsy foundation.

20
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,051
He is not a match for the two kings.

21
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,970
Since you know it,

22
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,051
why do you still advise me
to ally with Cang Xuan?

23
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:45,730
Throughout history,

24
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,411
people are easy to do a favor

25
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,250
but hard to provide timely help.

26
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,530
If we judge the future
based on current situation,

27
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,344
we can only maintain the status quo.

28
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,651
If we want to realize our ambitions,

29
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,931
we must carve out a different path.

30
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,610
Isn't this like gambling?

31
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,810
A big gamble.

32
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:03,651
I'm surprised to hear that from you.

33
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,851
You've been modest and prudent.

34
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,810
I'm just analyzing the situation.

35
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,851
If we were one of the unknown families,

36
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,530
we might as well take a risk.

37
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,090
But we are among the Four Great Clans,

38
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,730
the head of all clans in the world.

39
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,011
Whoever is in power,

40
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:25,211
it won't affect our two families.

41
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:28,291
Why risk the lives of the clan members

42
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,771
for a prince
with little chance of winning?

43
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,371
Perhaps it won't affect your family,

44
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:36,131
but what about you?

45
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:37,690
Fenglong,

46
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,411
are you content to live
under the protection of your ancestors,

47
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,250
being a do-nothing leader
of the Chishui Clan?

48
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,530
Fifth King and Seventh King
fought alongside King of Xiyan.

49
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:00,851
I doubt

50
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,170
if Cang Xuan can protect himself.

51
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,130
It's okay if we can't hit the target.

52
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,890
Anyway, someone else can.

53
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,010
Who in the world

54
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:29,610
can match the Fangfeng Family
in archery?

55
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:33,251
As long as we can control them,

56
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:36,290
that's enough.

57
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,730
Exactly.

58
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:46,371
Cang Xuan.

59
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,931
You agreed to attend
the banquet held by Yue Liang?

60
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:50,811
Yes.

61
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,811
You must not go.

62
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,176
They are now the masters of Xiyan Town.

63
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:55,491
I'm new here.

64
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,850
If I put on airs,

65
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,371
it would seem
to outsiders that I'm ungrateful,

66
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,491
and excluding them.

67
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,651
You just came here

68
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:04,010
without finding your footing.

69
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:06,251
This is the best time
for them to handle you.

70
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,010
They wouldn't dare hurt you
at Zhaoyun Peak,

71
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,170
but once you leave this place,

72
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:12,010
you will enter their territory.

73
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,170
Without facing difficulties,
how can I fight back?

74
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:18,811
What's wrong with you?

75
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,570
Nothing.

76
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:32,610
I'm just a little scared.

77
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:35,491
But that's impossible.

78
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:39,091
What are you afraid of?

79
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,811
Nothing. I'll go with you.

80
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:45,890
Fine.

81
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:47,290
Bring your best guards.

82
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:49,010
Okay.

83
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,024
(Xiyan Town, Yue Liang Mansion)

84
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,651
Bravo.

85
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,251
You want to beat me
with your poor archery skills?

86
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,610
Don't just talk the talk.

87
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:18,010
Let's compete another day.

88
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:18,570
Okay.

89
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,840
Listen,

90
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,651
you guys bear witness to our deal.

91
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,931
I will teach this man a lesson.

92
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,971
Finally, you're here.

93
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:28,010
Why are you late?

94
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:30,051
Although I'm late,

95
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,610
I have brought an honored guest,

96
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:33,931
the top expert from Haoling Xihe Squad,

97
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,450
who once defeated Chishui Xian.

98
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,450
(Yu Jiang)
I'm Yu Jiang.

99
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:39,010
I'm from Haoling Xihe Squad.

100
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,850
Nice to meet you guys.

101
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:44,531
Nice to see you.

102
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:51,091
Thank you.

103
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:53,371
Princess, have desserts.

104
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,330
Have some fruit.

105
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:55,491
Thank you.

106
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,491
I've prepared musical instrument,
brush and ink.

107
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,651
Do you prefer playing or painting?

108
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,211
I can't do both.

109
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,890
What about couplets?

110
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,051
I can't either.

111
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:11,450
Do you enjoy playing Go?

112
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,691
I learned it from a young age,

113
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:14,091
trained by a master from Xiyan Kingdom.

114
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,371
I'm experienced in it.

115
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:16,730
I can play it with you.

116
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,371
I'm not very good at that.

117
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:22,410
I see.

118
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,010
Do you enjoy playing some games?

119
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,251
I've never tried any.

120
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,570
Your dress looks fashionable.

121
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,010
It must be a new dress made for you

122
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,971
by the disciples of Lady Xiezu

123
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:41,811
I don't know.

124
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:46,010
Maybe.

125
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,130
It should be.

126
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,691
It should be.

127
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,850
I hear that the Jintian Family is good
at making weapons.

128
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,570
They also excel at making jewelry.

129
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:59,651
But not everyone can let them make it.

130
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,771
Your jewelry is so exquisite.

131
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:04,570
The Jintian Family
did it for you, right?

132
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:07,130
My father gave it to me.

133
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:08,290
I just put it on.

134
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,290
I don't know.

135
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,730
I'll ask about it next time.

136
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,051
I'll ask him.

137
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,330
I'm getting a bit tired.

138
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,130
I'd like to take a stroll
in the courtyard.

139
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:31,211
I'll accompany you.

140
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,491
No, I'll go by myself.

141
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,011
You all sit.

142
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,530
Xiang Liu, what are you doing here?

143
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:20,011
You sneaked up on me.

144
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,610
I can't guess what you're up to.

145
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,251
I'm getting all sorts of wild thoughts.

146
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,530
But I didn't expect

147
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,451
that you mistook me for someone else.

148
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,170
(The poisonous bug
didn't respond at all.)

149
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,530
With you staring at me like this,

150
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,730
I really wish I was the one
you just mentioned.

151
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,811
You're really not him?

152
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,610
If you're willing to drink with me,

153
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:04,650
I can pretend to be him.

154
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:08,051
Okay.

155
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,530
What if I fall in love with you

156
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,891
at first sight?

157
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:32,891
You'll know

158
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,730
after this drink.

159
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,410
You poisoned me?

160
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,850
(He's really poisoned.)

161
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,691
With you holding my hand like this,

162
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:15,451
how could I refuse

163
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,170
whatever you ask me to do?

164
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,011
Why did you have to poison me?

165
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:23,931
You're really not afraid of death.

166
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,891
It depends on who's hands I'm dying by.

167
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,131
Antidote.

168
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,610
Feed me.

169
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,011
Why did you poison me?

170
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:46,571
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

171
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,970
It often happens?

172
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:50,571
That's not good.

173
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,090
Sorry.

174
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,451
How can I let you go?

175
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,131
What do you want?

176
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,170
I want you to remember me.

177
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:22,491
Fang

178
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,691
Feng

179
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:28,090
Bei.

180
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,571
Remember my name.

181
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,290
Don't make a mistake again.

182
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,451
You are Fangfeng Yiying's...

183
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:40,891
Second brother.

184
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,131
You know my younger sister?

185
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:47,451
Small world.

186
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,850
On the contrary, I think it's too vast.

187
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,051
It took me so long

188
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,011
to meet you.

189
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,730
You're not him.

190
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,072
(Cui Hall)

191
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,048
(Cui Hall)

192
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,131
Your Highness, you were
calm and easy back there.

193
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,610
Very impressive.

194
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,251
You flatter me.

195
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:30,811
I've been through too much,

196
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,251
so I can handle it calmly.

197
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,770
I heard a lot about you in Haoling.

198
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:36,891
You have lived up to your reputation.

199
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,170
I hear you never lose a duel.

200
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,290
I admire you greatly.

201
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,770
It's a pleasure

202
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,571
to meet you tonight.

203
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,051
Fangfeng Family?

204
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,970
Cang Xuan.

205
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:10,451
Cang Xuan.

206
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,610
Stay back.

207
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:27,170
Xiaoyao.

208
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,770
Guards!

209
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,970
Guards!

210
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,770
Yu Jiang, do you want
to make the Xihe Squad exterminated?

211
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,290
It's personal. Nothing to do

212
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,051
with the Xihe Squad.

213
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,770
I am the Princess of Haoling.

214
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,970
If I say it's involved, then it is.

215
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:09,451
You are the Princess of Haoling.

216
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:11,170
How can you destroy the Xihe Squad

217
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:12,530
for an outsider?

218
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,331
What about you?

219
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,730
You conspired with outsiders
to assassinate Cang Xuan,

220
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,331
bringing disaster to your clan.

221
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:19,730
I didn't.

222
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,891
Cang Xuan beheaded my brother.

223
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,931
I must take his head
to mourn my brother.

224
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,691
Stop!

225
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:21,811
Xiaoyao.

226
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:35,571
Don't move!

227
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,410
Don't move!

228
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:54,691
Fangfeng Family.

229
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,091
Move away!

230
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:01,931
Don't move!

231
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,931
You can't, Xiaoyao.

232
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:05,490
Don't move!

233
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,971
Move away.

234
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,410
I am the Princess of Haoling.

235
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,811
They won't kill me.

236
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:11,370
Trust me.

237
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,731
Trust me.

238
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,931
Xiaoyao, move away!

239
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:16,290
Don't move!

240
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,490
Move away!

241
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,530

It's alright now.

We're alive.

We're still alive.

252

Xiaoyao,

253
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,331
you're not allowed to do this again.

254
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,890

Chishui Xian, I know it's you.

261
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,008
(Chishui Xian)

262
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:23,931
Why?

263
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,931
You nearly caused the Xihe Squad
to be destroyed.

264
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,130
It's none of your business.

265
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,091
Why did you stop me?

266
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,691
There are a million ways
to seek revenge.

267
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,731
But you chose the most foolish one.

268
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:37,451
I didn't know you had a brother.

269
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:39,211
My name was Xuan Ming.

270
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,571
My brother was Xuan Ting.

271
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:44,370
Xuan Ting?

272
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:46,211
The notorious cruel official,

273
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,490
the Lord of Zhiyi?

274
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:48,451
Those are all rumors.

275
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,931
I don't believe my brother is like that.

276
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:52,770
My brother treated me well.

277
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,530
I worked so hard

278
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:57,170
and expected
to kill Cang Xuan to avenge him.

279
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,370
But you made me fail at the last minute.

280
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:01,211
I just stopped you from being used.

281
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:02,331
So what?

282
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:04,851
I only want to avenge my brother.

283
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,650
I can't watch you doom yourself.

284
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,170
Last time you won by luck.

285
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,731
Now, we can have another match.

286
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,331
If you can't beat me,

287
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,211
I will stop you from revenging.

288
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,530
Chishui Xian, you...

289
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,000
(Zhiyi, Chenrong Mansion)

290
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,451
Prince Cang Xuan
and Great Princess are safe,

291
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:28,250
but it's not due to my protection.

292
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,490
The killer feared the King of Haoling

293
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:31,691
and dared not to kill princess.

294
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:34,691
You didn't fail your duty.

295
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,290
After all, no one expected

296
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:38,530
that apart from a top-notch expert
like Yu Jiang,

297
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,290
they would arrange another assassin.

298
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:43,130
I shall take my leave.

299
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,571
Jing, you guessed right.

300
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:55,931
Luckily, you asked me
to send Chishui Xian to help.

301
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:58,691
I didn't expect princess to be so brave.

302
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,571
She even risked her life
to protect Cang Xuan.

303
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:02,490
Cang Xuan is lucky

304
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,211
to have such a good sister.

305
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:07,971
Indeed,

306
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,051
it's really lucky to meet her.

307
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,691
For your and princess's sake,

308
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:16,290
Chishui Family did Cang Xuan a favor.

309
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:18,130
But that's all we can do.

310
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,010
After all, Cang Xuan
is alone and helpless.

311
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,490
He can't compete with Fifth King.

312
00:22:24,451 --> 00:22:26,650
I don't want the Chishui Family
to get involved with him.

313
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:31,051
Cang Xuan is helpless in Xiyan Town,

314
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,451
but it might not be the case
if he leaves there.

315
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,130
What do you mean?

316
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,811
If Cang Xuan leaves Xiyan Town,

317
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,530
how can he be the king of Xiyan?

318
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:51,290
That's Xiyan Mountain.

319
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:22,811
Don't get up.

320
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:24,410
There's no need of formality.

321
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:26,890
Thank you, Grandpa.

322
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:36,211
Do you feel better?

323
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:38,370
Yes.

324
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,971
Zhaoyun Peak originally
belonged to your grandma.

325
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:45,851
The guards of Zhaoyun Peak

326
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,290
were personally trained by your grandma.

327
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,051
Although I live here,

328
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:54,051
I have my own guards.

329
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,811
Now that you're back,

330
00:23:57,211 --> 00:24:00,211
they'll follow your orders.

331
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,571
Thank you, Grandpa.

332
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:16,691
These guards can protect you
at Zhaoyun Peak.

333
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:19,770
But if you want Xiyan Mountain,

334
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,931
you can't stay at Zhaoyun Peak.

335
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,624
(Xiling Xie's Tomb)

336
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,752
(Xiyan Zhongyi's Tomb,
Zhuoshan Chang Pu's Tomb)

337
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,296
(Xiling Heng's Tomb)

338
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:37,811
Xiaoyao.

339
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,611
Let me take you back to Wushen Mountain.

340
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:43,971
I'll walk my own path alone.

341
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,290
Why?

342
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,211
I don't want you to protect me

343
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,611
in danger.

344
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,130
You want me to live a good life
in Wushen Mountain,

345
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,211
while you stay here waiting for death?

346
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,650
I'm not as weak as you think.

347
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,931
I deliberately hid my strength.

348
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,530
Even if Chishui Xian hadn't come,

349
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,851
I wouldn't have been in danger.

350
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:15,250
But I didn't expect
Fangfeng Bei would be there.

351
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,490
My enemies are stronger than I thought.

352
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:21,611
I'll be more careful.

353
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,091
Even if we have to part one day,

354
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:26,051
it definitely won't be now.

355
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,611
I've lost too many loved ones.

356
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:30,170
I absolutely can't lose you.

357
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,250
I've also lost too many loved ones.

358
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,051
I absolutely can't lose you.

359
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,691
If you don't want me
to be in danger again,

360
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:40,170
find a way

361
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,451
to eliminate potential danger.

362
00:26:43,211 --> 00:26:44,611
I will try my best.

363
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:48,250
I will sacrifice myself.

364
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:51,130
I will do whatever I can do.

365
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:52,611
But you must stay alive.

366
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,971
Otherwise,

367
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,650
not only will we feel unwilling,

368
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,851
but those behind us

369
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,250
won't rest in peace, right?

370
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:54,611
Prince Cang Xuan

371
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,811
is virtuous, generous,

372
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,811
smart, and diligent.

373
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,731
He is now appointed
as the Minister of Canal

374
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:05,290
and granted a mansion in Xiyan Town.

375
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,331
Hopefully, he will diligently
perform his duties,

376
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,130
help the people in need,

377
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,571
and not let His Majesty down.

378
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:17,611
Without Xiaoyao stepping in,

379
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:18,530
Cang Xuan

380
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:19,770
should have died.

381
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,331
Brother,

382
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:24,530
how about we...?

383
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:26,130
Absolutely not.

384
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,410
Father scolded Yue Liang and Shiran

385
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:32,931
for letting Yu Jiang escape.

386
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:34,971
If we act again,

387
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,530
it will definitely provoke our father.

388
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:39,811
Let's wait and see.

389
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:47,611
I think Cang Xuan

390
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,211
has pleased our father

391
00:28:49,451 --> 00:28:50,650
at Zhaoyun Peak.

392
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,811
Father offered him such a good position.

393
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:56,451
If he stabilizes his position with this,

394
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,611
it will be a big problem.

395
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,691
Whether it's a good or tough job,

396
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:06,250
it's still up to us.

397
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,611
I thought he would be afraid of Yu Jiang

398
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,010
and didn't dare to leave Zhaoyun Peak.

399
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:15,890
Unexpectedly,

400
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,451
he's quite bold,

401
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:22,010
being aggressive.

402
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,571
You're right.

403
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,971
Now that he's in Xiyan Town,

404
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:32,530
we should entertain him

405
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:35,370
as a host.

406
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,864
(Xiyan Town, Cang Xuan Mansion, Qi Garden)

407
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:46,170
Be careful.

408
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,250
Lift it slowly.

409
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,051
Clean it up.

410
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,931
Be careful with that box.

411
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,130
I have to live

412
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,432
in Xiyan Town

413
00:29:58,432 --> 00:29:59,931
to deal with work.

414
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,571
But you have no work to do.

415
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:03,971
You can stay at Zhaoyun Peak.

416
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,290
I'm wherever you are.

417
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,410
Okay.

418
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:10,890
You're wherever I am.

419
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,611
There's only one bottle
of green plum wine left.

420
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,370
Princess has been keeping it.

421
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,091
Should I put it aside,

422
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:26,490
or keep it with those empty bottles?

423
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,370
Princess of Haoling

424
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,370
can have any drinks she wants.

425
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:41,931
I'll get you some more.

426
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,731
No need.

427
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:46,130
You can drink this.

428
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,650
And throw away

429
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,770
those empty bottles.

430
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,451
But isn't this your favorite wine?

431
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:54,890
As time goes by,

432
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,770
it will have the flavor of waiting.

433
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,331
I've waited on Mount Jade for 70 years.

434
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,611
I've had enough of that.

435
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,691
No matter how much I love it,

436
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,211
once it has this flavor,

437
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,091
I don't want it anymore.

438
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:12,170
Take it away.

439
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,611
The mulberry wine
I brewed is almost ready.

440
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:16,530
I'll have Sang bring it over.

441
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:18,010
Yes.

442
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:26,650
You haven't received any news
from Jing recently.

443
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,170
Do you want me to write to him for you?

444
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,851
No.

445
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:33,211
Didn't you say it?

446
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:35,530
The only way to stop being disappointed

447
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:37,051
is not to give myself hope.

448
00:31:38,091 --> 00:31:39,851
If you have nothing else to do,

449
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:42,331
you could get me a pharmacy.

450
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:46,010
Are you going to make medicine?

451
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,931
You mean they are poisonous?

452
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,091
Severely poisonous.
Can they be delivered?

453
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:20,650
Yes.

454
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,851
Please send them to Qingshui Town.

455
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,370
The Qingshui Town

456
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,051
that you mentioned is located

457
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:28,971
at the far east of the Xiyan Kingdom.

458
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:30,170
It's almost by the sea.

459
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,490
That's why I ask the Tushan Family
for the delivery service.

460
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:35,571
Other delivery services are cheaper,

461
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:37,010
but I don't trust them.

462
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,611
Miss, you made a right choice.

463
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:39,931
Only the Tushan Family

464
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:41,530
dares to deliver your stuff.

465
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:42,691
I'll leave it to you.

466
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,691
Who is the recipient?

467
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,051
Once the goods arrive,

468
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:49,410
he will come to pick them up.

469
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,770
Alright.

470
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:17,811
Are you delivering goods?

471
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:22,731
Do you remember me?

472
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,410
Since I just escaped from your arrow,

473
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:28,851
it should be hard

474
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,731
to forget you.

475
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,811
How could I shoot an arrow at you?

476
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:34,971
You must be mistaken.

477
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,451
You'd better stay away from me,

478
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,530
because every time I see you,

479
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:47,530
I want to poison you.

480
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:51,971
Do you hate your friend?

481
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,290
It's not about my friend.

482
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,290
I hate you.

483
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:07,290
Why are you following me?

484
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,851
I'm bored.

485
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,131
You also seem bored.

486
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,051
We stay together.

487
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,490
It's better than
being bored alone, right?

488
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:16,450
What are you here for?

489
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:18,891
Don't say you're here for boredom.

490
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,411
(Tapestry Shop)
I can't do my things in the light,

491
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,010
so I'm busy at night.

492
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,970
I feel quite bored during the day.

493
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:29,851
I have to say

494
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,530
you're really...

495
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,091
Shameless.

496
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:35,891
If I'm not,

497
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:38,571
how can I dare
to pester such a pretty lady like you?

498
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,690
If you ignore me today,

499
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:44,930
I will prepare
for my next encounter with you.

500
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:51,290
Why do you want to meet me?

501
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:52,730
There is a lady.

502
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:54,331
She's beautiful.

503
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,171
I met her by fate and fell in love

504
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,811
with her at first sight.

505
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,611
Do you think I believe it?

506
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,051
If you believe it,

507
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,851
I dare not say it.

508
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:15,450
Do you want to see me shoot arrows?

509
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:20,811
I hear your family is good at archery.

510
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,131
Compared to me,

511
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:25,051
they are not good at archery.

512
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:28,571
I want to see your archery.

513
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,811
Follow me.

514
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:02,611
Are you trying
to shoot that pine tree in front?

515
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,250
People make mistakes.

516
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:15,371
Let's go back.

517
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,811
Flowers for the beauty.

518
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,770
The flower is not so good.

519
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:29,571
A token of my affection.

520
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:36,371
(His archery)

521
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,250
(is astonishing.)

522
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,490
(If he truly intended
to kill us that night,)

523
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:43,811
(neither Cang Xuan
nor I would have escaped.)

524
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,171
Good archery.

525
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,171
Are you interested?

526
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,171
Can you teach an outsider?

527
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,450
What you need to learn now

528
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:57,210
is the posture of archery,
not the core method.

529
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:58,450
Anyone can teach you.

530
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:00,450
However,

531
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:01,411
I am the best teacher

532
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:03,851
for you.

533
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,290
If you are willing to teach,

534
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,891
I will be happy to learn.

535
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:11,250
How can I say no

536
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,411
to you?

537
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,891
(I'll see)

538
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,171
(what you are really up to.)

539
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,371
Just use it as a target.

540
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,891
Okay.

541
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:37,851
Not bad.

542
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,091
Remember.

543
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,290
Stand upright.

544
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:42,930
Don't shrink your neck.

545
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,131
Hide your arm.

546
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:45,571
Don't bend over.

547
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,131
Don't lean forward.

548
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:48,250
Don't lean back.

549
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,490
Don't hold your chest.

550
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,250
It seems I'm not cut out for archery.

551
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,331
Stand upright.

552
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,250
Use moderate strength.

553
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:12,250
Hold the bow correctly.

554
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,290
Set the arrow calmly.

555
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:16,290
Advance and retreat.

556
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:20,611
Stretch it to its full extent.

557
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:24,811
What do you feel?

558
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:28,530
I didn't focus on hitting the target.

559
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,290
I just subconsciously focused

560
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,411
on drawing the bow and shooting.

561
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,730
I didn't expect I would hit it.

562
00:38:35,091 --> 00:38:37,131
You're smart. Try it again.

563
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:38,770
Okay.

564
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,611
I hit it again.

565
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:55,010
I thought that with my low spirit power,

566
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,490
I absolutely couldn't hit the target.

567
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:00,010
Archery requires skills.

568
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,930
It's about using strength
in a smart way.

569
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,970
If people without spirit power shoot

570
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,411
with correct method,
they still can hit those

571
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,730
with much higher spirit power.

572
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:08,930
Is that true?

573
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,930
Don't you know my sister,
Fangfeng Yiying?

574
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,411
Her spirit power
and cultivation are inferior to mine,

575
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,171
but her archery

576
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:18,331
is just a little worse than mine.

577
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,690
I see.

578
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,171
You just focused on the result.

579
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,290
Let's stop here for today.

580
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:44,970
If you go on,

581
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:46,651
you will only remember wrong feelings,

582
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:48,770
and your skills will get worse.

583
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,770
Take what you can get.

584
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,651
If you were a master,

585
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,490
your disciples would like you.

586
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,411
My method is only suitable

587
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:07,371
for smart people.

588
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:09,651
I'm flattered.

589
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:10,331
So,

590
00:40:11,371 --> 00:40:13,770
are you interested
in learning archery from me?

591
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,091
(Even if it's a trap,)

592
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:18,290
(I'll jump in.)

593
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,930
If you accompany me to kill the time,

594
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,530
I'll teach you.

595
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:26,930
Kill the time?

596
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:28,091
How?

597
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,290
For example,

598
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,010
I taught you archery today.

599
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:35,891
Shouldn't you

600
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,450
treat me to a meal?

601
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:40,730
Okay.

602
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:47,210
Take your time.

603
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,611
Miss.

604
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:51,091
Welcome. Please take a seat.

605
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,770
This lady is more beautiful

606
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,930
than those coming with you before.

607
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,851
As usual.

608
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,450
Okay, please wait a moment.

609
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,770
There is a lady. She is beautiful.

610
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,811
I met her by fate and fell in love

611
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,131
with her at first sight.

612
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,811
It seems

613
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,891
the beauties you have met

614
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:22,131
are all over Xiyan Town,

615
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:24,250
let alone in such a small tavern.

616
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,891
One, two, three...

617
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:30,450
Can I count them

618
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,530
on my fingers?

619
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,051
Don't look down on this small tavern.

620
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:35,851
It serves

621
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,770
the best roasted meat in Xiyan Town.

622
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:40,450
Here it is.

623
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:49,651
Please enjoy.

624
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:50,331
Thank you.

625
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,891
The part above the rib,

626
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,051
near the neck,

627
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:58,611
with some sebum, is the most delicious.

628
00:41:59,051 --> 00:41:59,611
Try it.

629
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:10,371
It is delicious.

630
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:13,930
I'm not bragging,

631
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:17,010
but I know where to eat nice food

632
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:18,770
or have fun in Xiyan Town.

633
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,331
I believe you.

634
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:23,770
You met so many beautiful ladies.

635
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:26,970
You have to rack your brains
to please them.

636
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,210
So, you know it better.

637
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:30,290
Since I met you,

638
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,331
I realized

639
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,131
what I learned before

640
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:37,171
is all for pleasing you today.

641
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,651
Your ability to please ladies

642
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:44,091
is even more impressive
than your archery.

643
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,690
The pastry in this place is not good.

644
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,690
The crust is too hard

645
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:52,651
with ashes from the stove.

646
00:42:54,611 --> 00:42:55,611
You eat the inside.

647
00:43:06,571 --> 00:43:07,371
What's wrong?

648
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:11,010
Nothing.

649
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:12,891
I'm now certain

650
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,411
you're not the person
I thought you were.

651
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:26,400
(Tushan)

652
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:30,411
(Xiaoyao,)

653
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,930
(what are you doing now?)

654
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,651
(Have you ever thought of me?)

655
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:49,490
Master, a message from Xiyan Town.

656
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:58,250
(Master.)

657
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,411
(All is normal as usual.)

658
00:44:01,051 --> 00:44:02,171
(Here is only one thing.)

659
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,651
(Great Princess of Haoling
and Fangfeng Bei are quite close.)

660
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:08,331
(They hung out together in the streets,)

661
00:44:08,448 --> 00:44:11,744
(having delicacies,
and enjoying entertainment.)

662
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:14,611
(Lately, they traveled together,)

663
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,210
(lingered in the mountains,
and stayed out late.)

664
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,490
(I am a heartless person.)

665
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,131
(I'm heartless to others,)

666
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,010
(and even more to myself.)

667
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:33,490
(No matter how good it is,)

668
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:35,250
(if it's not worth it,)

669
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,930
(I will abandon it.)

670
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,104
(Xiyan Town)

671
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,891
Where are we going today?

672
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:05,811
What is this place?

673
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:07,411
An underground casino.

674
00:45:09,571 --> 00:45:10,450
Are you coming?

675
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:12,411
