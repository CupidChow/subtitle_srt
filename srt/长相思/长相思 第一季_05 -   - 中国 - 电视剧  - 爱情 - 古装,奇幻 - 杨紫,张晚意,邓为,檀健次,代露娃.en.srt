00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,672
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,467
Actually, I prefer to eat mortals.

4
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:44,747
Someone like you is just enough

5
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:48,266
for each of my heads to take a bite.

6
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,427
You have little spirit power,

7
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:07,226
but your body is a treasure.

8
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:38,867
You...

9
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:41,067
You really

10
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:42,546
eat people?

11
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:44,386
Dare to talk nonsense now?

12
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:45,947
No,

13
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:46,826
no,

14
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:47,707
no.

15
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:09,867
Do you want me to come over?

16
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:12,826
No,

17
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:13,746
no.

18
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Xiaoliu.

19
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:18,506
I'm leaving.

20
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:24,386
Xiaoliu, are you...?

21
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:27,546
Bad bird,

22
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,027
you wait and see!

23
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:37,587
You're still up?

24
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:38,907
It's so late.

25
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,747
Go to sleep early
and take care of your body.

26
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,627
The secret report said you wanted
to see me about something important.

27
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:54,946
What exactly is so urgent?

28
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:07,707
Xiang Liu?

29
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:14,786
Are you looking for him?

30
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,786
Who sent you?

31
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:54,466
Catch him alive.

32
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:11,346
Xiaoliu, come quickly.

33
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:14,080
Shiqi has been busy all morning,
making all your favorite dishes.

34
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:18,706
Thank you for your hard work.

35
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:20,387
Let's eat.

36
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,586
These are all your favorites.

37
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:31,466
Eat more.

38
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:32,786
Thank you, Xiaoliu.

39
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:35,586
Where's Mu?

40
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:36,906
He still refuses to go out?

41
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,867
Xiaoliu, let's go and smash the winery
of that wretched man and woman.

42
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,546
With your strength,
you're going to smash their winery?

43
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,226
You'd be thrown out
before you reach the door.

44
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:46,827
I don't care.

45
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,546
Anyway, I can't put up with this.
This matter can't be left like this.

46
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,906
In this world, as long as you are alive,

47
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:54,466
you must swallow your anger
even if it's not fair.

48
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,786
You must concede
even if you are unwilling.

49
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:58,048
Let me tell you.

50
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:00,706
Even those princes
and princesses live the same way.

51
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:03,226
It sounds like you're telling the truth.
You're not them.

52
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:04,352
How do you know how they live?

53
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:08,307
You brat. I ought to teach you a lesson.
Is it right?

54
00:11:16,987 --> 00:11:17,666
Xiaoliu,

55
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:20,106
I heard what you said.

56
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,387
Don't worry.

57
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:23,187
I'm fine.

58
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:43,026
Master,

59
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:44,786
the worker from Mr. Yu's store said

60
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:46,466
this stuff was transported from Haoling.

61
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:47,546
It's very valuable.

62
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:50,368
In the future, one basket can exchange
for ten bottles of your tiger penis wine.

63
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,146
Okay. Go on with your work.

64
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:04,267
Xiaoliu, your visit graces our humble shop.
Sorry for the lack of reception.

65
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:05,666
What would you like?

66
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,546
Give me a pot

67
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,786
of your sweet wine here.

68
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:10,586
Alright.

69
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:16,346
Osmanthus wine.

70
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,627
It's sweet and smooth.

71
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:28,387
This is so sour.

72
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:29,987
Are you selling vinegar?

73
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,307
Forget it.

74
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,267
Give me a pot of
the strongest wine you have here.

75
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:43,906
Superior Shao Dao Zi.

76
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:45,747
Xiaoliu, have a taste.

77
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,427
This is your strongest wine?

78
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,387
It's diluted, isn't it?

79
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:01,387
It's so bland.

80
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:04,827
You're deliberately making trouble.

81
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:17,867
If you're still not satisfied,

82
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,387
I'll get you another drink.

83
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,146
I see you sell

84
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,387
something called tiger penis wine.

85
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,106
The one they're drinking.

86
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,067
Get me a jug of that to taste.

87
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:46,747
The taste of this wine is off.

88
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,106
I deal with a variety
of medicinal herbs year-round,

89
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,592
and I can tell
authenticity just by smell.

90
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,627
If someone drinks your tiger penis wine,

91
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,187
far from showing their masculinity,

92
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,387
I'm afraid they'd never
have an erection again.

93
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,067
Sir, don't listen to his nonsense.

94
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,106
Please don't go.

95
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:09,187
Sir.

96
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:20,576
Master,

97
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:23,264
the lady said she
has no appetite and cannot eat.

98
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,346
Take it to Nian.

99
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,586
These lychees are quite fresh.

100
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:28,666
Let me try.

101
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,507
Xiaoliu, my sister has been having
a poor appetite lately,

102
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:39,040
so I specially found
some fruits she likes for her.

103
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,992
Xiaoliu, please stop teasing me.

104
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,827
You really spoil your sister.

105
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:48,627
I'm sorry for the offense last time.

106
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:50,546
I apologize to you.

107
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:58,387
Let your sister apologize to Mu.

108
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:02,106
My sister is stubborn.

109
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:04,267
I'll apologize to Mu instead.

110
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,466
What a good brother,

111
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,427
willing to bend his head

112
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:10,346
rather than letting his sister suffer.

113
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,427
As her elder brother,

114
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:13,146
I should take responsibility.

115
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,867
I heard the mulberry wine here
is very good.

116
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,267
Mulberry wine is
the signature wine of our shop.

117
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,706
Isn't it because
your sister loves this wine

118
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:28,026
that you can make it so well?

119
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,906
Send a few jars of
the best mulberry wine

120
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:42,906
to the Rejuvenation Hall
and apologize to Mu.

121
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:44,627
If Mu accepts it,

122
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:46,427
from then on,

123
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,187
I won't come to your shop
to taste wine anymore.

124
00:15:59,072 --> 00:15:59,712
Let's go.

125
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:01,181
Alright, let's go.

126
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,947
Where is Mr. Xuan going
with so much wine?

127
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,666
It's for the Rejuvenation Hall,

128
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:17,706
and he is going to apologize to Mu.

129
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:31,187
My sister offended you the other day.

130
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,627
I apologize on her behalf
with the wine.

131
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,586
Alright.

132
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:21,747
Alright.

133
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:24,946
Isn't the wine for me?

134
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:27,066
What's the meaning
of you drinking it all yourself?

135
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:44,547
You're indeed generous, Mr. Xuan.

136
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:46,147
Today,

137
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:48,627
I accept you as my brother.

138
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:51,507
My brother's sister is my sister.

139
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:55,627
Being embarrassed
by my own sister is nothing.

140
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,306
Let's forget about this.

141
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:00,226
No one needs to mention it anymore.

142
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,826
How can we not drink
when we do such a big thing

143
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:08,466
as acknowledging a brother?

144
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:10,547
Come on.

145
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:14,306
Let's drink together.

146
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:17,226
Today we won't go home
until we're drunk.

147
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:18,346
Cheers.

148
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:19,066
Cheers.

149
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:30,720
This guy is quite a character.

150
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,867
He's capable of humbling
himself to coax his sister

151
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,704
and also shows manly spirit
when forming brotherhood with others.

152
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:56,027
Are you really not drinking anymore?

153
00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:58,747
I should

154
00:18:58,787 --> 00:18:59,507
go back.

155
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:01,706
Then the two of us

156
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:03,946
will drink again next time.

157
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:05,226
Alright.

158
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:07,787
We'll drink next time.

159
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:08,226
Alright.

160
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,106
I'll keep the wine.

161
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:15,706
I'm leaving.

162
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:16,747
Master, watch your step.

163
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:17,706
Watch out.

164
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:19,987
Slow down.

165
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,306
There's no one to assist me.

166
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,267
You had a good time,

167
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:40,747
but now I'm left to deal with the mess.

168
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:51,907
Let me do it. You rest.

169
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:53,147
I dare not.

170
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,627
Today it's my turn to wash dishes.

171
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:55,826
How can I let you help me?

172
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:00,027
Are you still angry?

173
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,106
Angry?

174
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:03,586
What's there to be angry about?

175
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,208
Mu already buddies up with him.

176
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,027
Why should I still be angry with him?

177
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:09,627
You're angry with me.

178
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,106
You don't talk to me.

179
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:13,907
I talk to you every day.

180
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:15,426
Aren't I

181
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:16,387
talking to you right now?

182
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,826
I want to hear you talk as before.

183
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:22,627
As before?

184
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:25,066
What's the difference
between before and now?

185
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:27,627
Aren't I treating you
the same as Pimply and Skinny?

186
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:28,987
Xiaoliu,

187
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:30,747
I'm sorry.

188
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:43,946
Master, be careful.

189
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:48,466
Are you alright?

190
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:12,586
With your status,

191
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:15,547
why stoop down
to apologize to a commoner?

192
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,106
Qingshui Town is full of hidden talents.

193
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:21,867
An unknown physician like Wen Xiaoliu

194
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:23,552
actually managed
to use poison to defeat Haitang.

195
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,346
Who knows how many other methods he has?

196
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:27,264
If we were to really confront him,

197
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:31,106
it would only lead to more trouble
such as his snooping and poisoning.

198
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:32,586
We have important things to do,

199
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,106
best not to complicate matters.

200
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,627
With the princess around,

201
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:37,667
how can there be no trouble?

202
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,186
Nian is just bored,
looking for some fun.

203
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:41,627
It's no big deal.

204
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,106
Why hasn't Jun Yi come back yet?

205
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,426
Not yet.

206
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:52,826
Did something happen?

207
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,627
Abracadabra.

208
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:02,627
I hope the Nine-Headed Demon

209
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:03,826
chokes to death while eating,

210
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:04,787
drowns while drinking

211
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,027
and falls to death while walking.

212
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:17,027
I didn't curse you.

213
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:17,987
I didn't curse you.

214
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:20,586
You just cursed me?

215
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:21,787
No.

216
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:23,586
No.

217
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,466
Don't hit my face.

218
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:15,507
Are you scared?

219
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:20,747
Yes.

220
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:21,946
Lying again.

221
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:25,426
That day by the lake,

222
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,946
you already knew the secret of my body.

223
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:28,987
I originally thought

224
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:30,867
you would eat me
to increase your spirit power,

225
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:34,186
but I didn't expect you to show mercy.

226
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,186
You just drank
a few mouthfuls of my blood.

227
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,147
Naturally, I'm not afraid.

228
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,106
Now I only drink
a few mouthfuls of your blood.

229
00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:48,306
Who knows which winter

230
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:50,547
I will use your flesh as a tonic

231
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,346
to nourish myself?

232
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,946
I'm completely yours now.

233
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:01,867
You can do whatever you want.

234
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:03,346
Lying again.

235
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:08,387
You're hurt?

236
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:12,706
Who is the person

237
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:15,426
that is so capable to hurt you?

238
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,987
You're sleeping on my bed.

239
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:25,346
Where should I sleep?

240
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,987
Xiang Liu.

241
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:54,547
Nine-Headed Demon.

242
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:07,547
Nine-Headed Demon.

243
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:09,907
Nine-Headed Demon.

244
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:46,106
What should I draw for you?

245
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:04,106
When healing your wounds
with internal energy,

246
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,547
you can't lose focus.

247
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,987
A minor mistake
will lead to more injury.

248
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:12,147
A serious one will
destroy all your spirit power,

249
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:14,547
and your consciousness will be confused.

250
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:20,387
How the tables have turned on you!

251
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:22,946
Focus on healing.

252
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,120
Don't be disturbed by me.

253
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:39,027
These two strands of hair.

254
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:46,147
Bad.

255
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:47,507
Too ugly.

256
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:54,226
What should I draw for you?

257
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:55,946
Let me draw a turtle for you.

258
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:57,946
No, not a turtle.

259
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:02,066
I got it.

260
00:27:16,946 --> 00:27:18,466
You look great!

261
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:20,027
Let me show you.

262
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:27,627
Do you look great?

263
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,867
Don't be angry.

264
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:32,946
Let me count.

265
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:36,466
One, two, three, four,

266
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:38,987
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

267
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,466
I'm still very curious.

268
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:45,426
What do your nine heads

269
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:46,826
look like?

270
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:49,667
When will you
let me see your true form?

271
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:55,306
I will eat you.

272
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:00,267
Want to eat me?

273
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:02,027
No problem with that.

274
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,747
As long as you don't
mind me being dirty,

275
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:06,787
you can eat me.

276
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:08,667
Come on. There you go.

277
00:28:18,226 --> 00:28:19,706
Looks like you're almost done.

278
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:21,867
Then I'll leave now.

279
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:23,747
I will disappear for a few days.

280
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:25,907
During these days, don't look for me.

281
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:27,968
When you start to appreciate
the goodness I have shown you,

282
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:28,826
I'll come back.

283
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:44,186
Shiqi,

284
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:45,667
come.

285
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:50,747
Xiaoliu.

286
00:28:59,186 --> 00:28:59,907
Come here.

287
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:03,586
Xiang Liu is a bit tired.

288
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:04,867
He's sleeping in the room.

289
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:06,787
You keep an eye on this door.

290
00:29:06,907 --> 00:29:08,027
Don't let anyone in.

291
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:09,226
After Xiang Liu wakes up,

292
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:10,147
he will leave naturally.

293
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:12,706
I have something to do,
so I'll leave now.

294
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:14,226
Tell Mu not to look for me.

295
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,787
This place is really nice.

296
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,826
Safe and sound,

297
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,066
with good wine to accompany.

298
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:52,547
However smart

299
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:53,667
Xiang Liu is,

300
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,346
he will never guess that I hide here.

301
00:29:57,387 --> 00:29:59,186
I am really amazing.

302
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,306
It's my uselessness.

303
00:30:07,826 --> 00:30:09,186
Although Xiang Liu
was injured this time,

304
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:10,586
the helpers I brought

305
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:11,627
were all killed by him.

306
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:13,066
Only I escaped.

307
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:15,787
I'm worried that
it has exposed our tracks.

308
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,267
If Xiang Liu investigates,

309
00:30:17,426 --> 00:30:18,907
it will threaten your safety.

310
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:31,027
Xiang Liu is indeed a dangerous person.

311
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:33,147
Since he can't be used by me,

312
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,306
we have to strike first.

313
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:39,507
Take advantage of his severe injury

314
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:41,267
and immediately dispatch
people to find him.

315
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:44,106
We must fully remove
the threat to avoid trouble later.

316
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:46,426
Yes. I will obey the order.

317
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:50,667
(The Nine-Headed Demon's life)

318
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:51,466
(is really valuable.)

319
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,306
(There are his enemies everywhere.)

320
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:55,907
(Will he escape safely)

321
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:57,387
(this time?)

322
00:31:13,346 --> 00:31:15,867
Your Lordship, a spy once found traces
of a white eagle nearby.

323
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:18,027
Xiang Liu is likely to hide here.

324
00:31:18,907 --> 00:31:21,907
Listen to me.
Search carefully house by house.

325
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:24,547
Don't miss any clues.

326
00:31:24,747 --> 00:31:25,346
- Yes.
- Yes.

327
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:42,016
Didn't you just change the bedding
for Xiaoliu yesterday?

328
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,136
Why are you changing it again?

329
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:49,826
Fussy man.

330
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,346
Pointless fussing.

331
00:32:53,627 --> 00:32:54,547
Remember to close the door.

332
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:13,408
Be careful. It's hot.

333
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:18,346
Mr. Xuan,

334
00:33:18,466 --> 00:33:19,747
I am really sorry.

335
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:21,387
I'm starving,

336
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:23,747
and I followed the aroma and came in.

337
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:25,747
I'm hungry, too.

338
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:27,488
A chance meeting
is better than a planned one.

339
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:30,346
How about having a meal with me?

340
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:34,747
Okay, yes.

341
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:44,547
This is freshly brewed wine,

342
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:46,586
just taken out of the wine cellar.

343
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:49,267
Have a taste.

344
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:53,346
Thank you, Mr. Xuan.

345
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,627
(Does he discover)

346
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,267
(that I was hiding in his wine cellar?)

347
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:01,226
(Is he planning to
poison me to silence me?)

348
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:17,706
Mr. Xuan,

349
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:20,027
what are you planning to do?

350
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:35,067
Steamed chicken.

351
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:36,307
Taste it.

352
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:38,226
Great cooking.

353
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,706
Are these dishes all made by Nian?

354
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:46,827
She only knows how to eat food
and doesn't know how to cook.

355
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:47,906
Unexpectedly,

356
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:50,107
you can both make wine and cook.

357
00:34:50,787 --> 00:34:52,347
Nian is really fortunate.

358
00:34:52,747 --> 00:34:53,706
She calls me brother.

359
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,744
Isn't it natural for me
to take care of her?

360
00:34:57,186 --> 00:34:58,866
How come I haven't seen her lately?

361
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:01,386
You want to see her?

362
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:02,946
No.

363
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:03,906
I was just asking.

364
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:05,107
I was just asking.

365
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:07,987
I had her embroider something for me,

366
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:10,347
and she's been doing it
in the room recently.

367
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:12,426
No wonder she hasn't been out
causing trouble.

368
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:17,307
Nothing.

369
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:20,666
I mean, Mr. Xuan, you really are

370
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,107
great at teaching your sister.

371
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:25,547
If Nian makes more offenses
in the future,

372
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:30,107
Xiaoliu, could you please be
a bit lenient considering she's a girl?

373
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:32,067
(In the future?)

374
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:33,866
(He said "future".)

375
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:37,386
(So he's not going to kill me today?)

376
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:39,186
No problem.

377
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:39,747
Rest assured.

378
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:42,107
The next time I see her,
I will definitely accommodate her.

379
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:45,547
Thank you for your generosity.

380
00:35:47,426 --> 00:35:49,386
You're really a good brother.

381
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,906
Being your sister is really fortunate.

382
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,866
Actually, I'm not a good brother.

383
00:36:08,706 --> 00:36:09,507
Mr. Xuan,

384
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:10,787
I toast you.

385
00:36:20,706 --> 00:36:22,466
Thank you for your hospitality today.

386
00:36:22,587 --> 00:36:23,347
It's getting late,

387
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,107
so I'll take my leave now
and let you be.

388
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,146
Feel free to visit in the future.

389
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,027
Don't worry,
I'm very familiar with this place.

390
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:30,987
No need to see me out.

391
00:36:52,507 --> 00:36:53,626
I was wrong.

392
00:36:56,186 --> 00:36:57,386
I was really wrong.

393
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,267
I won't do it again.

394
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,466
Aren't I back now?

395
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,946
My body and I are both yours now.

396
00:37:04,107 --> 00:37:04,827
I promise

397
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,787
I will clean myself up
thoroughly from now on,

398
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:09,426
and you can come and eat me anytime.

399
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:11,027
Please forgive me this time,

400
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:11,706
okay?

401
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:13,146
Just this once.

402
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:26,267
Why is it you?

403
00:37:26,507 --> 00:37:27,747
Why are you in my room?

404
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:32,987
I'm sorry.

405
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:34,587
I let you down.

406
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:38,146
That's not what I meant.

407
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,666
I mistook you for someone else.

408
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:44,226
I'm sorry for my harsh tone just now.

409
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:45,547
Don't take it to heart.

410
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,587
You can come into my room.

411
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,016
It's my fault.

412
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:17,027
Want to eat me?

413
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:18,747
It's fine with me.

414
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:21,466
As long as you don't
mind me being dirty.

415
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:24,146
Come on. There you go.

416
00:38:36,706 --> 00:38:37,987
Wen Xiaoliu,

417
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,146
we'll settle this account slowly.

418
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,946
We have all the time in the world.

419
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:03,107
My Lord, we received a message
from the Chenrong Army's remnants.

420
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:06,027
Xiang Liu has somehow healed his wounds.

421
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:06,866
This quickly?

422
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:08,480
Shall we attempt another assassination?

423
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:13,027
We've missed
the best opportunity to kill him.

424
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:15,987
For now, let's hold our forces.

425
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,027
Instruct our insiders to be careful

426
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:21,067
and not to arouse his suspicions.

427
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:22,946
Yes, I understand.

428
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:38,626
Why did you bring a pig's head home?

429
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:40,226
What if it scares the lady?

430
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:43,226
Haitang, take the pig's head
to the kitchen.

431
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:44,827
Don't let Nian see it.

432
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:45,946
Yes.

433
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:58,827
I just learned from Butcher Gao

434
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,507
that Wen Xiaoliu has been
in this town for decades,

435
00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:03,827
even longer than Butcher Gao.

436
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:07,626
Mu is a deserter from Xiyan
who refused to fight.

437
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:10,866
Skinny and Pimply are orphans
he and Wen Xiaoliu picked up.

438
00:40:11,587 --> 00:40:15,307
Wen Xiaoliu is timid and greedy
on normal days,

439
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,067
but he is gentle

440
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:19,226
and gets along well with his neighbors.

441
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:20,906
He hasn't committed any major crimes.

442
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,906
It sounds like
there's nothing suspicious.

443
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:27,587
He is simply an ordinary physician.

444
00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:31,244
(Wen Xiaoliu)

445
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:34,267
Look at me.

446
00:40:36,107 --> 00:40:37,507
You look like just a wine seller.

447
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:38,666
Flawless.

448
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:40,827
Yes, flawless.

449
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:42,912
It's highly likely
he's hiding something deep.

450
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:44,347
Have Jun Yi investigate further.

451
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:48,706
That makes sense.

452
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,827
Perhaps, Wen Xiaoliu is like you.

453
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:51,827
He is not what he seems.

454
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:05,267
Skinny.

455
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,307
What's up, Xiaoliu?

456
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:08,288
Has the wisteria at the foot
of the mountain bloomed yet?

457
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,386
I'm busy working.

458
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,264
I don't have the time
to care about wildflowers or grass.

459
00:41:14,624 --> 00:41:15,936
The flowers have bloomed.

460
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:19,706
Why are you asking, Xiaoliu?

461
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:21,747
Nothing. Just asking.

462
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:22,866
Go back to work.

463
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:53,787
Xiaoliu, eat it while it's hot.

464
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,347
Wisteria flower egg pancake.

465
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:57,426
You made this?

466
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:20,107
Ye Shiqi,

467
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:39,946
you always know
what I'm thinking, don't you?

468
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:42,027
But now,

469
00:42:43,626 --> 00:42:44,987
I don't want to eat this pancake.

470
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:53,747
There won't be a second time.

471
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:56,866
What did you say?

472
00:42:57,906 --> 00:42:59,146
No matter what happens,

473
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:02,507
I will never let you
be unable to find me

474
00:43:02,787 --> 00:43:03,968
when you need someone to lean on,

475
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:11,107
never again.

476
00:43:26,107 --> 00:43:26,787
Xiaoliu.

477
00:43:26,866 --> 00:43:27,787
Xiaoliu.

478
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:29,626
Hurry.

479
00:43:29,747 --> 00:43:30,666
Come with me to see.

480
00:43:30,787 --> 00:43:31,426
See what?

481
00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:33,027
You'll know when you see it.

482
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:33,626
Hurry.

483
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,626
