2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:51,934
Who dares to trespass
into the military camp?

4
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:53,974
I am Ye Shiqi.

5
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:56,574
I'm looking for Wen Xiaoliu.

6
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:08,614
Mr. Xiang.

7
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:09,614
Mr. Xiang.

8
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:10,493
He is my servant.

9
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:11,453
He's here for me.

10
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:12,614
Please don't hurt him.

11
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,814
Shiqi, don't fight.

12
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,254
Do what I say.

13
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:49,933
Go back.

14
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:55,293
I'm taking him away.

15
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:01,453
Mr. Xiang.

16
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:02,534
Mr. Xiang.

17
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,373
I am already yours.

18
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:24,814
No worries.

19
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:25,933
Just small injuries.

20
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,213
Don't set your sights on him.

21
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:46,614
He is mine now.

22
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,774
Upon investigation,

23
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,453
you're a civilian from Qingshui Town,

24
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:59,134
with no malice
towards the Chenrong Army.

25
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:01,534
You are free to go.

26
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:05,614
Thank you, sir.

27
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:07,254
When I go back,

28
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:10,213
I will widely publicize your kind heart.

29
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:14,894
Go home.

30
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:16,534
Mr. Xiang.

31
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:17,454
We're leaving.

32
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:26,854
Hurry up.

33
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:33,653
(A woman,)

34
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:36,653
(and a high-ranking deity)

35
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,574
(are trying to hide their identities.)

36
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:42,574
(Interesting.)

37
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:48,933
How did you find this place?

38
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,134
I waited for you.

39
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:52,294
You didn't come back.

40
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:53,814
I went to find you.

41
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,574
What if you can't find me?

42
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:57,854
I'll keep looking.

43
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:00,480
What if you can't find me forever?

44
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:01,814
Keep looking

45
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:03,134
until I find you.

46
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,414
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:11,294
I know you don't like carrying people.

48
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,653
Just think of me as a stone.

49
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:17,574
But stones don't talk.

50
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,814
Then consider me as a pig.

51
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:21,333
A pig that can talk.

52
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:23,373
Right.

53
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:25,093
Do you hate pigs?

54
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:29,454
Or you can think of me as…

55
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,814
Just be yourself.

56
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:33,933
I am willing to carry you.

57
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:36,093
Alright.

58
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,414
I am myself.

59
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:44,134
Xiang Liu is very cunning.

60
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:45,493
You must be careful of him.

61
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:46,974
If he finds out

62
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:48,414
you have something he can use,

63
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,613
he will definitely target you.

64
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:53,653
I really lost a lot this time.

65
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:56,493
I failed to make any money.
And I made myself suffer.

66
00:05:57,893 --> 00:05:58,974
Bad luck.

67
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:01,213
How could I
meet Xiang Liu with Nine Lives?

68
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,053
How will I live through this?

69
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:06,814
Don't be afraid.

70
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:16,854
I am not afraid of him.

71
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:19,093
I don't believe

72
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:20,613
no one in this world can poison him.

73
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,814
When I make a poison

74
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,254
that can bring him down,

75
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:27,014
he will die by my hand.

76
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:32,373
By the way,

77
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:34,734
don't tell Mu about this.

78
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:37,134
Mu has been fighting with Chenrong

79
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:38,173
for most of his life.

80
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:40,213
He is quite afraid of Xiang Liu.

81
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:46,574
Actually, I don't need to remind you.

82
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:49,213
Skinny and Pimply
have been trying to make you talk.

83
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:50,734
But over the past year,

84
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,613
I have come to understand.

85
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:56,014
They have told you the number
of moles on their bodies.

86
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:59,134
But they still know nothing about you.

87
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,134
I know you're Ye Shiqi.

88
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,854
I hope you will always be.

89
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:11,213
But that's impossible.

90
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:14,974
But as long as you don't leave me,

91
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:16,773
you'll be Ye Shiqi.

92
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:18,414
You have to listen to me.

93
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:23,694
You must only listen to me.

94
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,333
I've seen every inch of you,

95
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:20,014
But you've only seen my back.

96
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:21,254
Is that a loss for you?

97
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,213
Why are you so quiet?

98
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:34,214
Do you think I talk too much?

99
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,613
I have lived alone for more than 20 years.

100
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,853
At that time, I got a strange disease.

101
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:42,814
I was timid.

102
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:45,493
I was scared of looking in the mirror,
or meeting people.

103
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:48,094
So I hid, and roamed around.

104
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:52,053
In the beginning,
I didn't talk much either.

105
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,173
Until one day,

106
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:57,814
I discovered some fruit in the mountain,

107
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:00,094
but I never saw it before.

108
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,574
Suddenly, I was very scared.

109
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:04,853
I don't know why.

110
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:06,853
After that,

111
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:08,254
I started forcing myself to talk.

112
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:12,254
The funny thing is

113
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:13,853
when I caught a monkey,

114
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:15,413
I made it listen to me talk

115
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,173
for a whole day.

116
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:20,214
In the end,
the monkey couldn't stand it

117
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:22,613
and directly hit its head
against a rock, wanting to end its life.

118
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,680
(Several days later)

119
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:46,973
This is…

120
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,774
Pimply is getting married.

121
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:54,733
That's great.

122
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:56,293
Great.

123
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:03,894
My injury is almost healed.

124
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:05,733
Let's pack up and go back.

125
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:07,574
Mu and the others
are still waiting for us.

126
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:08,613
Let's go.

127
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:15,774
Take it.

128
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:19,254
Let's go.

129
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,454
Brother Liu.

130
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:33,613
Brother Liu.

131
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:35,214
Xiaoliu.

132
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:36,973
Brother Liu.
Where have you been these days?

133
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:38,240
You've been gone for so long.

134
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:39,373
You're finally back.

135
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,173
I accidentally found two spirit herbs.

136
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:44,214
I sold them for large sums of money.

137
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,613
Mu. Pick a time to send betrothal gifts
to Butcher Gao.

138
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:49,654
Pimply.

139
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:51,014
You're getting married.

140
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:52,768
You're getting a wife.

141
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,574
- I'm getting a wife?
- Come on. I'll cook for you.

142
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:56,574
He looks silly.

143
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:58,894
You…

144
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:12,053
What's the date today?

145
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:14,208
It will be the middle
of this month in two days.

146
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:15,533
No.

147
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:16,613
There's no time.

148
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:48,173
Have a rest.

149
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:49,214
Do it tomorrow.

150
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:50,933
I'll sleep when I'm done.

151
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,493
Let me do it.

152
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:58,214
Okay.

153
00:12:58,574 --> 00:12:59,654
I'll leave it to you.

154
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:05,894
Be careful.

155
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:07,293
Okay.

156
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:12,334
I mean you must be careful.

157
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:16,413
If the medicine goes wrong,

158
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:18,334
we can make it again.

159
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:33,173
Xiang Liu.

160
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,053
Why does he want you
to make poison for him,

161
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:38,694
and the more poisonous, the better?

162
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:39,894
I don't know.

163
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,533
Anyway, the medicine I make

164
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,014
either has a special color,

165
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:46,214
or a special smell.

166
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,094
It won't kill people.

167
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:02,853
You're here.

168
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:06,493
This is the stuff

169
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:07,613
your master wants.

170
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,014
I'll hang it up on you.

171
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:10,574
When you fly,

172
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:11,293
be careful.

173
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:22,373
Take care.

174
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:30,254
You evil creature.

175
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,053
Ugly and ill-tempered.

176
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:40,293
You evil creature!

177
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:44,173
What did you eat? It stinks.

178
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:47,894
Miss.

179
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:48,694
Miss.

180
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,413
I order 50 jars of liquor.
I'll pick them up in two days.

181
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,293
Fifty jars?

182
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:54,853
Yes.

183
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,814
In three days,
Chuntao and I will get married.

184
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:59,254
This is the wedding invitation.
Please pass it to Mr. Xuan for me.

185
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:00,853
Congratulations.

186
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,334
Miss.

187
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:11,053
This was sent from Rejuvenation Hall.

188
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,774
They invite Mr. Xuan to the wedding.

189
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:15,413
My cousin never attends any weddings
of the lowly people.

190
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:16,973
I see.

191
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,014
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

192
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:29,814
Good.

193
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:30,973
Good.

194
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,014
Second bow to your parents.

195
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,493
Husband and wife bow to each other.

196
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:48,254
Good.

197
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:56,053
Brother Liu.

198
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,373
Mu.

199
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:59,613
Thank you for raising me.

200
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:01,094
I…

201
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:02,574
I…

202
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:03,654
You.

203
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,973
I hope Chuntao and you
will have many children.

204
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:08,254
But don't worry.

205
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:09,293
With me here,

206
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:12,053
if you can't have kids in the future…

207
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,613
You can give me something to eat,

208
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,613
but don't stuff the peel into my mouth.

209
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:20,933
Nonsense.

210
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:39,493
Here comes an honored guest.

211
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:41,933
I'll excuse myself for a moment.

212
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,214
How's the medicine

213
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,173
I made?

214
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:49,733
Any problems?

215
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:53,454
Your medicine is very good.

216
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:55,574
This is a gift.

217
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,814
Are you reminding me

218
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,694
that you have one more hostage?

219
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:14,734
You are a deity.

220
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:20,173
When they all die, you might
still be as you are now.

221
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:23,814
Is it interesting?

222
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,173
I'm afraid of loneliness.

223
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:30,094
If I can't find enduring companionship,
brief one is also good.

224
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:36,893
Since you're here,

225
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,454
have a drink before you leave.

226
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,574
I brewed it.

227
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:43,253
Have a try.

228
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,814
Apart from the poison in the wine,

229
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,814
there's nothing of value.

230
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:01,374
So, have you been poisoned?

231
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:06,614
Do you really want to poison me?

232
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:08,854
Of course not.

233
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,653
I'm not one of Xiyan's soldiers.

234
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:13,053
For now, we're not enemies.

235
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:14,694
I just want to beat you

236
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:15,533
with hundreds of whips.

237
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,814
You wish.

238
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,974
This nine-headed serpent demon

239
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:44,374
treated my poison

240
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:45,454
as a tonic.

241
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,454
I must find your weak spot.

242
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:48,933
If I can't poison you,

243
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:50,533
I'll walk backwards.

244
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:12,734
Drink it.

245
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:17,773
Are you a fool?

246
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,133
You're drinking poison.

247
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:21,374
You gave me this.

248
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:29,614
Hurry.

249
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:30,933
Eat this.

250
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:38,013
You're really an idiot.

251
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:16,933
Mr. Xiang.

252
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:21,133
Sir, you're patrolling so early.

253
00:20:23,494 --> 00:20:26,094
You have devoted yourself
to the Chenrong Army

254
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,264
and have made great contributions.

255
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,694
You're truly a role model for us.

256
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:33,773
Who sent you?

257
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:37,214
What do you mean, sir?

258
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:38,694
I've always been loyal

259
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,334
to the Chenrong Army.

260
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:41,454
I swear.

261
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:46,013
I heard that the demon
is naturally suspicious.

262
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:47,253
Mr. Xiang,

263
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:48,173
please

264
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,694
don't doubt my loyalty.

265
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:53,773
This is far from the camp.

266
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,173
You shouldn't be here.

267
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:58,893
I'm here

268
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,533
on the orders of General Hong Jiang

269
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:02,454
to inspect this area.

270
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,334
If you don't believe me,

271
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:06,374
You can go
to the General for confirmation.

272
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:13,854
You may leave.

273
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:18,253
I shall take my leave.

274
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:35,253
My Lord.

275
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:37,974
The insider we planted in the
Chenrong Army has sent a message,

276
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,454
saying he has an emergency.

277
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:42,053
I presume it's about the matter
we instructed before.

278
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:45,413
You go to the mountain.

279
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:48,814
The insider's recent activities
have been somewhat frequent.

280
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:51,053
Xiang Liu isn't that easy to be fooled.

281
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:53,094
For safety's sake,

282
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:54,854
bring more people.

283
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:57,734
Be cautious.

284
00:21:58,533 --> 00:21:59,013
Yes.

285
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,334
Where is the braised meat shop?

286
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:15,374
It's just up ahead.

287
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:19,374
What's so good about the food made

288
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,773
by the lowly people?

289
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:22,413
My cousin insists

290
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,773
that braised meat goes best
with his new wine.

291
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:27,614
Here you go,

292
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:31,253
See you.

293
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:34,374
I'm going to deliver
the ordered food to Ms. Xiong.

294
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,413
You take care of the shop.

295
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:36,173
Understood.

296
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:37,694
Come back as soon as possible.

297
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:38,533
Don't worry.

298
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:39,533
Be careful on the road.

299
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:42,013
How dare you!

300
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:42,933
Watch the road.

301
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:43,694
Are you blind?

302
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:44,413
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:45,094
I'm sorry.

304
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,574
I'll make it up for you.

305
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,173
Let me wipe it off for you.

306
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:48,653
Haitang.

307
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:50,214
How?

308
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,614
Selling you wouldn't be
enough to compensate.

309
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:53,933
Hey, how can you talk like that?

310
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:54,893
Isn't it just a dress?

311
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,494
A dress?

312
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:57,653
You ignorant person.

313
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,893
Do you know
what my lady's clothes are made of?

314
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:01,133
Who is ignorant?

315
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:01,574
Chuntao.

316
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:02,214
Let it go.

317
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:04,494
Ladies, calm down.

318
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:05,413
Calm down.

319
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:11,533
You're back.

320
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:19,734
For me?

321
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:21,814
Thank you.

322
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:48,053
You picked this for watching?

323
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:50,173
It's delicious.

324
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:51,893
I thought it's for eating.

325
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,293
Here you go.

326
00:23:59,614 --> 00:24:00,413
Tastes good.

327
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:05,694
You take this. I'll help you.

328
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:11,494
When I wandered

329
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:12,854
In the mountains,

330
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:14,533
I ate anything when I was hungry.

331
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,173
So, I discovered a lot

332
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:17,094
of delicious flowers.

333
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:21,413
Tell me which flowers are eatable.

334
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:24,494
I'll pick them for you.

335
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:26,773
Okay.

336
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:33,494
Brother Liu.

337
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:35,454
Listen.

338
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,133
Ever since Pimply got married,

339
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:39,173
he's been acting like Butcher Gao's son.

340
00:24:39,214 --> 00:24:40,574
He doesn't help do anything
for our home.

341
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:41,454
You talk to him.

342
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,173
Stop nagging.

343
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:45,893
Most of the housework

344
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:47,334
is done by Shiqi.

345
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,773
And you sit around.

346
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:50,432
You have the face
to complain about Pimply?

347
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:51,533
We're all family.

348
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,494
Why should we quibble over anything?

349
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,454
We're glad
if Pimply is living a happy life.

350
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:57,653
If you could also start a family,

351
00:24:57,893 --> 00:25:00,334
we wouldn't mind if you do housework
at your father-in-law's house.

352
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:02,253
Brother Liu.

353
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:03,814
Emergency.

354
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:04,814
Please examine Pimply's wound.

355
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:07,854
What happened?

356
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:09,494
How did you get injured?

357
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:11,533
He was beaten by two outsiders

358
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:13,334
because of a dress.

359
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:15,253
We said we would compensate.

360
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:16,454
I can't believe this.

361
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,334
I'll avenge you.

362
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,334
Mu. Keep an eye on him.

363
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:21,494
I'll follow him.

364
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:23,214
Come in.

365
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:31,214
Bear with it.

366
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:34,413
Bandage.

367
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:44,933
Chuntao.

368
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:45,694
Don't worry.

369
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:46,694
He's going to be okay.

370
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,053
Shiqi.
Fetch a bottle of medicinal liquor.

371
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:49,734
Okay.

372
00:25:51,374 --> 00:25:52,013
Chuntao.

373
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:55,133
Remember, avoid spicy food during this period.

374
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,293
And when you go back at night,

375
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:58,253
help him dress the wound with medicine.

376
00:25:59,454 --> 00:25:59,893
I see.

377
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:01,094
Thank you.

378
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:05,413
Shiqi.

379
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:06,614
You stay.

380
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:07,933
I'll find Mu and Skinny.

381
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:08,814
I'm worried.

382
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:09,173
Okay.

383
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:13,133
Does your eye hurt?

384
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:15,974
This hurts.

385
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:17,173
What about your arm?

386
00:26:18,814 --> 00:26:19,533
Medicinal liquor.

387
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:21,933
Thank you.

388
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:24,533
Does it still hurt?

389
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:44,454
Move.

390
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:57,454
Haitang.

391
00:26:57,974 --> 00:26:59,053
Teach him a lesson.

392
00:26:59,133 --> 00:26:59,773
Yes.

393
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:09,533
It's terrible.

394
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,214
Look.

395
00:27:15,214 --> 00:27:16,293
It's awful.

396
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:19,814
He has given up.

397
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:22,133
Miss, please stop.

398
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:22,814
Haitang.

399
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:24,893
Go on.

400
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:25,494
Yes.

401
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:31,253
He has already given up.

402
00:27:31,374 --> 00:27:32,173
Why hasn't she stopped?

403
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:32,814
Yes.

404
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:33,494
Unbelievable.

405
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:35,013
That's too much.

406
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,133
According to the rules of Qingshui Town,

407
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:38,653
without a mortal grudge,

408
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:40,854
one should stop
once the opponent admits defeat.

409
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:44,094
Lady, please stop it now.

410
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,133
Why should I obey the
rules of Qingshui Town?

411
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:47,374
My rule is,

412
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:48,614
whoever offends me must die.

413
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:50,374
My cousin forbids me
from hurting people,

414
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:51,053
so I won't.

415
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,334
I'm just playing with him.

416
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:53,653
Xiaoliu.

417
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:54,773
Xiaoliu.

418
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:55,814
Kill me.

419
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,013
Kill me.

420
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:01,133
Kill me.

421
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:05,094
Kill me.

422
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:28,854
Kill me.

423
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:39,614
Haitang.

424
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:41,013
Did I tell you to stop?

425
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:45,574
Someone broke my magic.

426
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:47,334
His spirit power is higher than mine.

427
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:48,614
Miss.

428
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:49,734
Let's go back first.

429
00:28:49,814 --> 00:28:51,173
We'll deal with it
when Mr. Xuan returns.

430
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:52,133
Let's go.

431
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:54,614
Ladies,

432
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,413
I'll wait for you at Rejuvenation Hall.

433
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:01,533
Mu.

434
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:05,293
Mu.

435
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:09,773
Mu, are you okay?

436
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:26,454
Brother Liu.

437
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:27,334
Keep an eye on Mu.

438
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:29,094
Don't worry, Brother Liu.

439
00:29:34,574 --> 00:29:35,454
Mu,

440
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,694
Pimply and Skinny.

441
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,214
They all think I'm a good person.

442
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:42,094
But actually, when I was young,

443
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,694
I killed many people.

444
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,528
I haven't done it for a long time.

445
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:48,933
But just now,

446
00:29:50,814 --> 00:29:52,374
I really wanted to kill them.

447
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,173
They are deities

448
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:57,533
with strong spirit power.

449
00:29:57,653 --> 00:29:58,494
So what?

450
00:30:05,694 --> 00:30:06,694
Will you help me?

451
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,094
Don't worry.

452
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:24,854
When the time comes, you just need
to block them for me.

453
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:26,454
Let me figure out

454
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,533
their spiritual attributes.

455
00:30:27,854 --> 00:30:29,053
Then I will have confidence

456
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,614
to poison them.

457
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:33,454
Okay.

458
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:55,773
How is Haitang doing?

459
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:58,053
She has been poisoned.

460
00:30:58,214 --> 00:30:59,854
This poison is very peculiar.

461
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:00,814
I'm sorry.

462
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:02,334
I don't know

463
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:03,413
how to detoxify her.

464
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,334
That lowly person

465
00:31:04,413 --> 00:31:05,454
poisoned her!

466
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:07,413
No worries.
I'm going to kill him right now.

467
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:08,533
Nian.

468
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:09,773
Calm down.

469
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:10,494
Tell me

470
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,574
what happened today.

471
00:31:48,694 --> 00:31:49,173
Xuan.

472
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:49,933
It's here.

473
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:16,734
Xuan.

474
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:17,694
It's him.

475
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:21,854
My name is Xuan.

476
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:23,653
This is my cousin Nian.

477
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:24,494
Our maid Haitang

478
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:25,694
was poisoned by you.

479
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:27,454
So we are here

480
00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:28,694
to request you

481
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:29,694
to give us the antidote.

482
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:31,053
Xuan.

483
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,454
Why should you beg him?

484
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,494
If he doesn't give it,

485
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:34,854
we will fight until he does.

486
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,933
Your sister has a brother.

487
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:39,694
But I also have an older brother.

488
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:40,694
Today,

489
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:42,013
your sister offended my brother.

490
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:45,013
As long as your sister kneels
and apologizes to my brother,

491
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:48,928
I'll give this bottle of antidote to you.

492
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:51,013
See?

493
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,413
This person is just a rascal.

494
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:54,694
It was you who started trouble with me.

495
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:55,574
I didn't even

496
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:56,293
hurt them.

497
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,854
I was just playing a little trick.

498
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:58,734
What about you?

499
00:32:58,814 --> 00:32:59,494
You're relentless.

500
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:00,653
You tried to kill us.

501
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,454
If I didn't have a poison-avoiding bead

502
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:04,256
to protect myself,
I would be poisoned like Haitang.

503
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:05,173
Doctor.

504
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,854
Please give me the antidote.

505
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:17,974
If I don't give you the antidote,

506
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,293
are you going to snatch it?

507
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:22,464
You leave me no choice.

508
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:23,933
Shiqi.

509
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:44,293
Sorry.

510
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,094
I just want the antidote.

511
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:48,173
I didn't expect your spirit power
was so weak.

512
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,016
Fortunately, I didn't want to hurt you.

513
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:51,974
Your breath goes wrong.

514
00:33:52,214 --> 00:33:53,133
But you're fine.

515
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:55,854
You're so useless.

516
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:57,173
Can you fight against us?

517
00:34:45,174 --> 00:34:46,654
Are you okay?

518
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:48,094
Get lost.

519
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,013
You…

520
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:51,414
We've got the antidote.

521
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:53,134
Let's go back.

522
00:34:56,773 --> 00:34:57,493
See you.

523
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:06,654
You lowly person.

524
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:51,493
Do you know them?

525
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:53,493
That woman is a lady

526
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:54,894
of a grand deity family.

527
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:57,293
Are you afraid they would recognize you,

528
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,213
so you hid?

529
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:01,733
Or do you think

530
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:03,894
I shouldn't provoke them,

531
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:07,614
so you hid,
letting them take the antidote?

532
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,080
I was afraid they would recognize me.
But I'm more afraid you make enemies with them.

533
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,894
Don't follow me.

534
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:14,374
Come up.

535
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:19,854
Xiaoliu.

536
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:58,253
You cared about him so much.

537
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,334
Why did you suddenly hate him?

538
00:38:02,174 --> 00:38:03,493
He has nothing to do with me.

539
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:06,854
What did he do

540
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:08,334
to make you so angry?

541
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:13,253
I'm not angry with him.

542
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:15,934
I'm mad at myself.

543
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:19,053
Why would I have thoughts

544
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:21,094
of depending on others,

545
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:23,453
and put my hopes on others?

546
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:25,654
I clearly know

547
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:27,453
the more I hope,

548
00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:29,493
the more I get hurt.

549
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:31,854
Rather than this,

550
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:33,773
I might as well rely on myself.

551
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,533
Deities and mortals are the same.

552
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:40,134
When they're young, they have parents,

553
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:41,934
brothers, and sisters to accompany them.

554
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:44,672
When they grow up, they have husbands,

555
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:46,293
wives, and children to accompany them.

556
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:48,574
Isn't it normal to have thoughts

557
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,533
of depending on others?

558
00:38:51,614 --> 00:38:52,854
I'm different from others.

559
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:55,654
How are you different?

560
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:57,733
I don't have parents,

561
00:38:58,574 --> 00:38:59,733
brothers,

562
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,053
and sisters.

563
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:16,574
When I was desperate and helpless,

564
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:19,053
I've never relied on anyone.

565
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:21,493
Now that I've grown up,

566
00:39:22,174 --> 00:39:23,936
I shouldn't have the thought
of relying on others.

567
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,854
Even if I fall,

568
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:30,654
the only one who can catch me is myself.

569
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:12,414
Go down.

570
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:55,134
Can you swim?

571
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:56,533
Do you want to have a competition?

572
00:40:58,374 --> 00:40:59,453
With you?

573
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:03,053
If you dare,

574
00:41:03,134 --> 00:41:04,253
don't use your spirit power.

575
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:07,253
What?

576
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:08,733
You dare not?

577
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:11,213
Really?

578
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,773
You dare not compete with me?

579
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:16,654
Are you afraid of losing?

580
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:21,854
Since you're begging me,

581
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:23,414
I agree.

582
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:26,414
When did I beg you?

583
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:28,894
Didn't you?

584
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:32,453
Alright.

585
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:33,952
Let's say I begged you.

586
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,253
Let's start.

587
00:41:58,374 --> 00:41:59,293
You won.

588
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:00,574
I'll grill a fish for you

589
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:01,894
as a reward.

590
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:06,414
When you were young,
you lived in Haoling?

591
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:08,213
People who can swim

592
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:09,453
must be from Haoling?

593
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,453
Not really.

594
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:14,213
Swimming can make you feel joyful

595
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:15,293
and relaxed.

596
00:42:16,854 --> 00:42:18,814
It must be related to your experiences
when you were young.

597
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:22,814
You're a nine-headed serpent demon.

598
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:26,053
You can think with nine heads.

599
00:42:26,654 --> 00:42:28,414
It's extraordinarily powerful.

600
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:30,533
Even your words have depth.

601
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:32,854
Don't you know this is a taboo topic?

602
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:41,414
I've always been curious.

603
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,854
How did your nine heads grow?

604
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:48,693
Did they grow

605
00:42:49,414 --> 00:42:50,773
in a horizontal row?

606
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:57,174
Or did they grow in a vertical row?

607
00:42:58,053 --> 00:42:59,616
Or are they arranged from left to right?

608
00:43:00,894 --> 00:43:01,854
Three on the left,

609
00:43:02,053 --> 00:43:03,414
three on the right,

610
00:43:03,654 --> 00:43:04,654
and three in the middle?

611
00:43:06,134 --> 00:43:08,253
Don't your nine heads fight over food?

612
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:11,053
Which one eats first?
As for the last one to eat…

613
00:43:23,693 --> 00:43:25,614
Actually, I prefer to eat mortals.

614
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:29,654
Someone like you is just enough

615
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:33,334
for each of my heads to take a bite.
