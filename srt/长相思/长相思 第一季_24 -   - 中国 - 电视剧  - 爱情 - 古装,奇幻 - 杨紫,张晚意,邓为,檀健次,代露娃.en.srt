00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,760
=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,696
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,970
And that. Why didn't you catch it?

4
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,570
What if it breaks?

5
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,131
It won't break that easily.

6
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:05,771
I dare not accept your gift.

7
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,011
I'm afraid it'll be
like the green plum wine.

8
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:09,971
Suddenly disappearing

9
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,451
after I get used to it

10
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,690
without even an explanation.

11
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:19,130
Someone by my side has become disloyal.

12
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,130
Before I find out who it is,

13
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:22,690
I'm afraid to cause you trouble.

14
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,811
So I stopped sending the wine over.

15
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:25,971
And...

16
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:30,850
And what?

17
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:32,570
Last time I saw you,

18
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,490
you complained
that I was trying to smother you.

19
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,091
I...

20
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,770
I tried my best to restrain myself
so as not to annoy you.

21
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,011
You're really trying to make me angry.

22
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,091
Xiaoyao.

23
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:48,251
Stop. I don't want
to talk to you right now.

24
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:07,770
Fine, even if you really had
a reason not to send me wine,

25
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,210
you didn't even write to me.

26
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,290
Then why did you come to Xiyan Town

27
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,371
with Fangfeng Yiying this time?

28
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:15,891
Do you really want
to cancel the engagement?

29
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:17,811
Yes, I will do it.

30
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,930
My grandma has already agreed.

31
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:24,891
These years, Fangfeng Yiying
has accompanied her,

32
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,251
and they have deep feelings.

33
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:29,210
My grandma doesn't want to rush things

34
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,331
or make the Fangfeng Family
hate our family.

35
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,290
Yiying came along this time

36
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,490
because my grandma wanted us

37
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,251
to get used to relating
as brother and sister.

38
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:42,570
Your grandma really agreed?

39
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,611
She told me that she would
find an appropriate opportunity

40
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,731
to discuss with the Fangfeng Family
about canceling the engagement.

41
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:58,451
Xiaoyao.

42
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,011
Alright.

43
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,891
Then I will accept

44
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:18,250
this purple fish core now.

45
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:21,731
Xiaoyao,

46
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,331
thank you for coming back for me.

47
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,850
Actually, I didn't come back for you.

48
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:39,410
I did it for Cang Xuan.

49
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,810
As long as you come back,

50
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,290
I am satisfied.

51
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:47,491
Aren't you angry?

52
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,931
Don't worry about Cang Xuan's matter.

53
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:51,690
Since I have promised you before,

54
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,130
I will definitely try my best.

55
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,331
Promised me?

56
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,370
Under any circumstances,

57
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,331
you must not harm Xuan.

58
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,410
Alright.

59
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,651
(Even I myself forgot about it.)

60
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,130
(But he still remembers.)

61
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,690
This time I have another appointment

62
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,931
in Xiyan Town.

63
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,451
He will come to visit Cang Xuan tonight.

64
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,211
You two have traveled a long way.
Please have a seat.

65
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:49,211
We'll just have some water.

66
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:51,011
We have to visit our elders later.

67
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,250
It'd be bad if they smell alcohol.

68
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,810
Alright, then we'll have water.

69
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:07,370
Thank you.

70
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,051
Please.

71
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:22,931
This time, we came to see you
for important matters.

72
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,250
Time is limited.

73
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:26,570
Let's get straight to the point.

74
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,171
There is no need
for formality between us.

75
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:29,570
Just say it.

76
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,810
Since you chose to return to Xiyan Town,

77
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,728
I suppose you are determined
to claim that throne.

78
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,256
But you left the town
when you were young,

79
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:38,491
and your uncles have been ruling
for over 1,000 years.

80
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:39,970
I'm not looking down on you,

81
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,410
but what do you have
to compete with them?

82
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,530
I do have the ambition,

83
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:48,544
and it's true
that I'm struggling in Xiyan Town.

84
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,850
You could say I'm barely surviving.

85
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,171
If you have any suggestions,

86
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,731
feel free to speak.

87
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,090
Since Xiyan Town is already occupied

88
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,211
by your uncles,

89
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,410
with no place for you,

90
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,536
why don't you give it up?

91
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,130
Giving it up?

92
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:28,250
Look, that's the Xiyan Mountain,
and next to it is Xiyan Town.

93
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,250
I've known this map very well
since I was a kid.

94
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,331
I really can't see anything.

95
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,491
I'd appreciate your teaching.

96
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,051
Xiyan Town is located
in the northwest of Dahuang.

97
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,370
It's surrounded by mountains,
hindering transport,

98
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:44,810
and it's hard to capture.

99
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,168
In the war
between Xiyan and Chenrong long ago,

100
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:49,211
Chenrong tried several times
to eliminate Xiyan but failed.

101
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,970
It was wise for His Majesty

102
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,011
and Lady Xiezu to choose
to build a town here.

103
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,370
But thousands of years have passed,

104
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:57,051
and Xiyan

105
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:59,850
is no longer the one that was secluded
in a corner of Dahuang.

106
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,410
The North, the West, the South,

107
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:05,690
the Central Plains

108
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,891
now belong to Xiyan.

109
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:11,771
Cang Xuan, can you see clearly?

110
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,810
Do you see the territory
that you would rule one day?

111
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:18,051
Yeah, I see it clearly.

112
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,211
Give up Xiyan Town
and come to the Central Plains.

113
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,651
The center of the entire Dahuang
is the latter one.

114
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,370
Only by holding it,

115
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,731
can you overlook the entire Dahuang.

116
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:34,370
The North, the West,
the South and the East

117
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,130
are under its control.

118
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,971
One day, if you want to march south,

119
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:41,610
it will also be easy.

120
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,490
My brother suggests you choose
the Chenrong Mountain

121
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,096
not out of our family's self-interest.

122
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,291
Actually, only I know about this matter.

123
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:00,570
You're usually so smart.

124
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:03,011
Why are you being petty at this time?

125
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,050
She doesn't understand
our ambitions at all.

126
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:08,050
Forget the Chenrong and Xiyan families.

127
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,490
Stop getting tangled
in those old matters.

128
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:21,531
A word from you woke me up.

129
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,211
I will never forget this favor.

130
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:29,690
Don't thank me.

131
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,610
Go to the Central Plains

132
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,451
means giving up Xiyan Town.

133
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,690
You'll either win

134
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,451
or lose everything.

135
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:38,851
No turning point then.

136
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,130
You're ballsy betting so much.

137
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:42,331
I admire you.

138
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:45,250
My ambition is not just a throne.

139
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:47,211
Why couldn't I give up?

140
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,771
In my lifetime,

141
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,610
I hope to see a real prosperous empire

142
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:01,451
that leaves a glorious legacy
throughout history.

143
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,211
I thought we would
come here for nothing.

144
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,851
We didn't give you any promises at all
but asked you to abandon

145
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,531
all you have and go
to the Central Plains.

146
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:28,291
I didn't expect you to say yes.

147
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,011
If I can make achievements,

148
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,771
Fenglong will choose to

149
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,291
make a great cause with me naturally.

150
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,130
If I can't,

151
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,930
promises can't bring any changes.

152
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,091
We have to go.

153
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:49,291
To avoid suspicion,

154
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,291
we can't meet with you
before we leave Xiyan Town.

155
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,490
Life is long.

156
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:57,771
Today we can only have a cup of water.

157
00:10:58,451 --> 00:10:59,651
When I get to the Central Plains,

158
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,130
I will drink a lot with you.

159
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,130
Good, I'll wait for you
in the Central Plains.

160
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,651
Cang Xuan is having
a secret talk with Fenglong.

161
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:13,891
Don't you join them?

162
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,091
They all have great ambitions

163
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,810
to achieve great things.

164
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,211
And I just want to be with you,

165
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,011
like in Qingshui Town.

166
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,930
These are deadly poisons
that can kill quickly.

167
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,771
Can you use these poisons

168
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,570
to draw two pictures for me

169
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,331
on these two handkerchiefs?

170
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:40,570
Okay.

171
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,971
Here you go again,
as if you're afraid I will forget.

172
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,490
I...

173
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,451
I didn't mean that.

174
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,570
I didn't mean to forbid you.

175
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,091
I...

176
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,211
I didn't...

177
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,370
I know.

178
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,050
It's because
you've been poisoned, you fool.

179
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:20,851
I did tell you to be careful.

180
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:22,891
Get up.

181
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:34,610
Drink this,

182
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:36,411
and you'll be able to move soon.

183
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:40,851
Back then,

184
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,130
it was your care

185
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,891
that kept me alive.

186
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,331
When you go back,

187
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,651
take this handkerchief
with the lotus painting.

188
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,651
You haven't painted for many years,

189
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,971
so that person
will definitely be suspicious.

190
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,411
He'll surely check it
over and over again.

191
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,050
By then, the poison
will have entered his body.

192
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,810
Will he die?

193
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,810
He won't unless it touches a wound.

194
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,810
Even if it does,

195
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,211
you just need to cut the lotus in time

196
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:32,690
and apply it to his wound.

197
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:33,851
Then it's okay.

198
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,690
I knew you'd certainly
ask me for the antidote.

199
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,370
I've prepared it for you.

200
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:43,651
You are just too soft-hearted.

201
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,570
Without your soft heart,

202
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,610
I'd have become a skeleton long ago.

203
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,411
Your coronet is crooked.

204
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,050
Your hair is much better than before.

205
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,250
Who takes care of your hair now?

206
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:12,130
Is it Jing Ye or Lan Xiang?

207
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:13,771
Neither.

208
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,610
You have other maids?

209
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:20,810
I do it myself. I'm not used
to having people do it for me.

210
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:28,490
Let me do it for you in the future.

211
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:31,930
Use mallow leaves

212
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,411
picked in the early morning
and soaked for half a day.

213
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,730
Start washing in the afternoon

214
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:39,730
and then get your hair dried in the sun.

215
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:43,091
The scent will be
of plants and sunshine,

216
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,291
much better than hair dried

217
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:46,451
with spirit power.

218
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:49,050
Go to the Central Plains,

219
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,490
and let's go pick
mallow leaves together then.

220
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,250
Going to the Central Plains?

221
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,411
If Cang Xuan goes to the Central Plains,

222
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,048
you'll go with him, right?

223
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,730
That's good.

224
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,810
You will leave

225
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,771
tomorrow morning?

226
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,250
Send me messages.

227
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:17,250
By any means,

228
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,930
you must send me a message.

229
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,250
I don't like waiting.

230
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,570
Okay.

231
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:25,730
Xiaoyao,

232
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,011
knowing you miss me

233
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,730
and will be angry
if I don't contact you,

234
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm very pleased.

235
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:37,850
Xiaoyao kept chatting with me

236
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,411
and lost track of time.

237
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,171
Then she said she was tired

238
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:42,771
and fell asleep in a daze.

239
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:45,811
Are you leaving?

240
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:48,370
Yes, early tomorrow.

241
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:52,691
Don't break her heart.

242
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:55,571
If you fail her and break her heart

243
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,090
in the future,

244
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,210
I will definitely take your life.

245
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,571
If that day really comes, kill me.

246
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:14,891
Go to bed early.

247
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:09,651
Jing?

248
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,450
He's gone,

249
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:33,411
yet left a wisp of hair
to drive me wild with want.

250
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,130
What's so good about this map?

251
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:22,691
It was extremely difficult

252
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,864
to come to this town,

253
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,256
and now, it's also extremely difficult

254
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,200
to leave here.

255
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,531
Are you worried
that your uncles won't let you go?

256
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,411
A bird in a cage
or a bird returning to the forest.

257
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,330
If you were them,
which would you choose?

258
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,850
Then naturally,
I would cage you little bird

259
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:45,250
in a cage.

260
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,531
I have experience escaping cages.

261
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:54,651
If you can't resist,
then show weakness to the enemy.

262
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,130
I think so too.

263
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,891
There's no other way.

264
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:10,130
Destroying yourself

265
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:12,370
or abandoning yourself,

266
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:13,811
which one would you choose?

267
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:17,051
I haven't only been a wandering doctor.

268
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,531
Other than treating infertility,

269
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,250
I'm well-versed in swindling, eating,

270
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,090
drinking and gambling.

271
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:26,531
Can't you act like a lady?

272
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,490
Nope.

273
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,730
I'll take care of my own affairs.

274
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:34,171
You

275
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,531
just go and play

276
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,130
with Fangfeng Bei.

277
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,850
By the decree of the King of Xiyan,

278
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,370
since the five Huhe families

279
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,730
took charge of grain shipping,

280
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:58,811
they have been diligent and flawless.

281
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,850
Cang Xuan, the Minister of Canal,

282
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,090
should abolish the new policy
and maintain the old system

283
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,730
and must not interfere
in taxation matters.

284
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:22,171
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

285
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:25,891
The old illness that I got
when I fought with His Majesty

286
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,051
suddenly recurred.

287
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,490
Cang Xuan

288
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,171
is really overestimating his abilities.

289
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:39,691
The five Huhe families
in charge of grain shipping

290
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,571
are all founding heroes.

291
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:45,051
The tax from shipping

292
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,411
is the reward for their military service

293
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:49,411
from His Majesty.

294
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,730
Even His Majesty has to think twice
before reclaiming it.

295
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,850
How could Cang Xuan

296
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:56,811
do as he says?

297
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:00,090
Now, he has offended
all the great families at once.

298
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,610
Still too young and too impulsive.

299
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,370
That kid

300
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,691
lost both parents and lived
under somebody's thumb as a boy.

301
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:13,651
Now, he's ostracized by everyone.

302
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,730
It's inevitable that he feels depressed.

303
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:21,171
Let Yue Liang and Shiran accompany him.

304
00:23:23,456 --> 00:23:25,024
You mean...

305
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,370
Killing without seeing blood
is the best strategy.

306
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:55,970
Your Highness.

307
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,210
It seems that you don't like
these tacky women.

308
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,171
All of you, leave.

309
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,531
Thank Your Highness for the seat.

310
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:24,210
You're quite interesting.

311
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,210
Did I say you could sit?

312
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,608
You do have a sharp eye.

313
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,370
Miss Jin Xuan is an udumbara demon,

314
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,931
also the master
of all flowers in Xiyan Town.

315
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,490
You're flattering me.

316
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,051
I'm just a lone girl wandering
in a foreign land.

317
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,330
I hope Your Highness
can show compassion.

318
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:04,032
(Tushan Mansion)

319
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,970
Lan Xiang, your poison has been removed.

320
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:39,730
I deserve to die. I'm sorry, Master.

321
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:45,376
Lan Xiang, we
grew up together in the mansion.

322
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:48,051
Our master has always been
kind and benevolent to us.

323
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:51,450
How could you do such a thing?

324
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:54,850
You must be forced to do this.

325
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,610
Tell me, and perhaps I can help you.

326
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:58,730
Tell the truth.

327
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,490
Who made you do this?

328
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,610
I know what I did was unforgivable.

329
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:04,610
I only ask for death.

330
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:06,330
Our master's kindness

331
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:08,730
has been met with your ungratefulness.

332
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:10,370
If you refuse to say,

333
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,411
then I won't force you.

334
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,931
But for the safety of our family,

335
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,330
I only ask you one question.

336
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:18,771
Is that person targeting me

337
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,370
or our family?

338
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,691
It is...

339
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,090
It is you.

340
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:32,571
Lan Xiang,

341
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,210
you can't stay in this mansion anymore.

342
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:37,691
Jing Ye will send you back
to your hometown.

343
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:39,691
Stay out of all this mess
after you go back

344
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,090
and live a good life.

345
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,811
Thank you for your kindness, Master.

346
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,811
I have nothing to repay you with.

347
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:53,850
Here's the green plum wine.

348
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:04,384
A few bottles of wine,
and you're this happy?

349
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:07,130
Jing can continue to send wine,

350
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,651
which means he has solved
all the problems around him.

351
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:10,651
Of course I'm happy.

352
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,610
You care about him a lot.

353
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:14,931
Don't forget

354
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:17,011
he's engaged.

355
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:20,850
Alright.

356
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:23,610
Then let me care about you too.

357
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:26,090
How is your trip
to the Central Plains going?

358
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,531
Don't leave.

359
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:38,011
Cang Xuan.

360
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,850
(I'm happy because now
Jing can freely help you)

361
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,210
(after solving his troubles.)

362
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:56,850
I've heard Cang Xuan's been having

363
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,651
a tough time and seeking pleasure
everywhere to alleviate his depression.

364
00:31:00,128 --> 00:31:02,411
Now he's a well-known profligate
in Xiyan Town.

365
00:31:02,848 --> 00:31:04,691
When the Fifth and Seventh Kings
lower their guard,

366
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,811
he'd be allowed to come here, right?

367
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,171
No matter how debauched Cang Xuan looks,

368
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:11,531
if there's no good reason to come here,

369
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:15,531
an abrupt petition will only arouse
suspicion and ruin all previous efforts.

370
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,291
That's true.

371
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,210
Where can we find the reason?

372
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,571
I do have a method,

373
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:28,970
but I'm not sure about it.

374
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,011
What method? Tell me about it.

375
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:32,610
Are there still people living

376
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,330
on the 28 peaks in Chenrong now?

377
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,850
After the fall of Chenrong,

378
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:38,970
the royal descendants
living there scattered,

379
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,130
and most of them moved to Zhiyi.

380
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,210
Now there are only some guards and maids
who watch over the palace.

381
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:48,891
Since Cang Xuan wants
the Chenrong Mountain,

382
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:50,970
the opportunity lies in it.

383
00:31:51,651 --> 00:31:53,571
There's no one living
on the Chenrong Mountain anymore.

384
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:54,811
What opportunity could there be?

385
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,571
Cang Xuan,

386
00:32:18,411 --> 00:32:20,090
this pill is called Free and Easy.

387
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,370
With just one pill,

388
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:24,250
you can forget all your worries.

389
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,411
Is there such a good thing
in the world?

390
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,011
I won't harm you.

391
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,450
Just take one pill.

392
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,171
Not to mention worries,

393
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:40,571
you won't even feel the pain.

394
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,531
Miss Jin Xuan, you serve him.

395
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,210
If I can't forget my worries,

396
00:32:55,811 --> 00:32:57,850
you must be punished.

397
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,771
Cang Xuan, let's have another drink.

398
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,730
Help him up.

399
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:15,232
Your Highness.

400
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,170
You can hardly walk straight
and you're trying to support me?

401
00:34:24,928 --> 00:34:25,650
Cang Xuan,

402
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,650
bad luck.

403
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,531
The busybody Yinglong is ahead.

404
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,752
(Yinglong)
What's there to be afraid of Yinglong?

405
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,410
Your Highness.

406
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,450
General,

407
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:47,250
let's enjoy ourselves.

408
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:02,291
Your father was a renowned warrior
who died for his country,

409
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,011
and your mother was a heroine
with an unyielding spirit.

410
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:08,531
How could they have a son
who willingly degrades himself?

411
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:15,450
Aren't you just a snake demon
who luckily transformed into a Yinglong?

412
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,331
We gave you a bit of face
to let you guard the palace,

413
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,051
and now what?

414
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,531
You've become so bold,

415
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:26,571
thinking of rebelling?

416
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:30,210
Today,

417
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,011
I will teach you a good lesson.

418
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:42,890
Your Highness.

419
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:49,490
Your father and your auntie

420
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,371
treated me like their own sibling.

421
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,131
Remembering their kindness,

422
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,730
I guided and reprimanded you.

423
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,730
But now that you've chosen
to wreck yourself,

424
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,730
it's pointless to say anything more.

425
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,890
Who cares that he's a Yinglong?

426
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,851
I still scared him away, didn't I?

427
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:24,051
You're so mighty.

428
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:34,142
(Qi Garden)

429
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:41,851
Xuan,

430
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:45,051
why are you back so late?

431
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:46,690
Slowly.

432
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:58,970
Xuan,

433
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,730
didn't you promise me yesterday

434
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,490
you wouldn't hang out with them anymore?

435
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,571
Everyone was there today.

436
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:07,890
I should go.

437
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:10,051
Today you use this excuse,
tomorrow that excuse.

438
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:11,410
You're full of reasons.

439
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,970
Women should butt out of men's business.

440
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,250
Xuan.

441
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,531
Are you feeling unwell?

442
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:00,331
Physically, I'm fine,

443
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,571
but mentally...

444
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,531
I've been acting for so long,

445
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,450
and sometimes even I can't tell
if it's real or not.

446
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,091
If one day I truly become like this,

447
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:18,291
would you leave me?

448
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,170
You just need to ask yourself.

449
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,811
If one day I become unbearable,

450
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,410
would you abandon me?

451
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:26,210
Never.

452
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,571
If one day you become like that,

453
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,170
it must be because something happened.

454
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,371
I would always be by your side,

455
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,771
helping you slowly recover.

456
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,091
Even if you don't want to recover,

457
00:38:42,771 --> 00:38:43,970
that's fine too.

458
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,051
I will always be with you.

459
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:53,490
So you already know my answer.

460
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,650
Yes, I do.

461
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:04,771
Why didn't you tell me in advance

462
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:07,091
that you'd take the pills made
by the witch doctor?

463
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:10,851
I could have prepared
some antidotes for you.

464
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,571
I consulted a physician.

465
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:19,690
Those pills are addictive.

466
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,611
Maybe it's terrifying
for ordinary people,

467
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,210
but I can quit.

468
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,371
To reassure my uncles
to exile me to the Central Plains,

469
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,690
I must make them believe

470
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:36,811
that I am already a useless person

471
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:38,811
and can't do anything more.

472
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:41,490
The pills are not just addictive.

473
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,011
It's a slow-acting poison,

474
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:46,410
which will harm your internal organs.

475
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,811
But you're here, aren't you?

476
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:50,331
Even if you quit later,

477
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,091
your spirit power will be damaged.

478
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:53,250
I've told you before.

479
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,011
I don't rely on spirit power.

480
00:39:59,011 --> 00:39:59,930
When can you stop doing it?

481
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,331
Apart from making my uncles believe,

482
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:07,331
I also need to wait for an opportunity.

483
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:12,576
(Chenrong Mountain)

484
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:16,250
(Chenrong Mansion)

485
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,170
Jing, you are truly smart.

486
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,091
Fortunately, we had prepared
on the Chenrong Mountain in advance.

487
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,690
Coupled with the thunder,

488
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,170
the plan is seamless.

489
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:27,011
Even the weather's in your scheme.

490
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:29,851
Just going with the situation.

491
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:32,410
Now the opportunity appears.

492
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,611
If no one lends a hand,

493
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:36,771
it will quickly pass.

494
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,930
Just an insignificant palace collapsing

495
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,410
due to disrepair.

496
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,690
Father has always been cautious.

497
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,051
He will certainly downplay it.

498
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,930
This time we must do the opposite.

499
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,690
We must amplify it.

500
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:53,170
Right,

501
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,730
we're just one step away on our end.

502
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,851
I don't know how the progress is
on Cang Xuan's side.

503
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:01,771
Can he make the Fifth and Seventh Kings
stop doubting?

504
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:03,531
He should be almost there.

505
00:41:05,056 --> 00:41:08,064
(Qi Garden)

506
00:41:14,091 --> 00:41:14,851
Who's there?

507
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,450
Your Highness, what is your intention
of suddenly leading troops

508
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,730
into the mansion?

509
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,051
To catch an assassin
by the Fifth and Seventh Kings' order.

510
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:44,210
Anyone who obstructs

511
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,291
will be killed.

512
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,170
Yes!

513
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,051
Search.

514
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,611
I won't be blackmailed by you,

515
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:27,011
nor will I help you cover up.

516
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,811
I suggest you leave as soon as possible.

517
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,291
There's still time
to choose someone else.

518
00:42:56,131 --> 00:42:56,851
One,

519
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:01,410
two,

520
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,811
three.

521
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:12,672
(My poison has no effect on him.)

522
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:17,450
Although you have strong spirit power,

523
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:20,571
from your breath, you seem
to have been seriously injured.

524
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:26,250
I still suggest you choose someone else.
