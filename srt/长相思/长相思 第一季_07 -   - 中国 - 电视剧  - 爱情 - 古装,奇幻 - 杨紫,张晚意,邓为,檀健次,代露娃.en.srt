2
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:42,593
Sorry about that.

4
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:44,313
Goodbye and take care.

5
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:48,352
I was in a hurry, so I forgot the gift.

6
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,834
I'll have Sang deliver it later.

7
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:52,714
Mr. Xuan, you could save the courtesy.

8
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:54,593
It's nothing.

9
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:57,873
I am annoyed every time I see you.

10
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:00,394
If it weren't for my brother,
I would order to lash you.

11
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:06,353
If it weren't for your brother,
I would slap you.

12
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:12,034
Mr. Xuan, is there anything else?

13
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,513
Where's Ye Shiqi?
He's always with you, but he's not here.

14
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:21,994
I asked him
to cook more dishes in the kitchen.

15
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:23,554
He must be busy now.

16
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:26,554
Alright, I'll take my leave.

17
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:28,914
Take care.

18
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:48,873
Back in the spring six years ago,

19
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,593
you were lying in that bush.

20
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:54,354
It's been over six years.

21
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,233
You left the banquet abruptly just now,

22
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:03,233
so Xuan is suspicious of you.

23
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:05,114
He's sure to start investigating you.

24
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:13,120
Actually, you and Nian
are the same type of person.

25
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:16,832
Looking down from on high,
and overlooking all living beings.

26
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:19,394
But when I see Nian in that state,

27
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:20,873
I really want to slap her.

28
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:22,914
But when I see you, I...

29
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,754
What do you want?

30
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:27,873
I want to pull you down to earth.

31
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:30,914
Don't wipe it.

32
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:07,513
Come here.

33
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:17,593
He's not going anywhere.

34
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:20,113
Say what you want right here.

35
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:22,313
Are you coming over by yourself,

36
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:24,914
or you want me to come to you?

37
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:26,713
I...

38
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:34,034
Xiaoliu,

39
00:04:34,794 --> 00:04:35,474
step back.

40
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,234
We're all friends here.

41
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:56,634
We're all friends.

42
00:04:57,553 --> 00:05:00,448
You must know there's a happy event
at Rejuvenation Hall today,

43
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:02,634
so you brought a gift, right?

44
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:14,354
Shiqi.

45
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:25,194
Get on.

46
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:27,074
Alright.

47
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,034
Xiaoliu.

48
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:32,234
Don't worry, Shiqi. I'm fine.

49
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:34,634
You go home. I'll be back soon.

50
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:36,034
Go home.

51
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:37,794
I'm coming.

52
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:49,056
Go home, Shiqi.

53
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:50,674
Go home.

54
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:17,354
Chubby!

55
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:21,833
Chubby, you crazy bird, stop it.

56
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,514
Chubby!

57
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:04,713
Are you in a bad mood today?

58
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:09,514
Don't think I don't know.

59
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:10,873
You must be upset.

60
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:14,313
Whenever you're upset,
you would torment me for fun.

61
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,954
That crazy bird nearly got me killed.

62
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:26,354
Why is your spirit power so low?

63
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,514
I practiced hard.

64
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,433
Originally, my spirit power was not low

65
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:32,713
but rather high among my peers.

66
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:35,393
It's all because of that stupid fox.

67
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,074
In case my spirit power
didn't go in vain,

68
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,074
he used medicine to disable me,

69
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,833
which made my spirit power

70
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:44,433
go into my vessels little by little,

71
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:45,952
making it easier for him to eat me.

72
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,880
I heard that
the pain of dispersing one's power

73
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,544
is like bones being drilled
and marrow extracted.

74
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:31,993
It seems that my forty lashes
were too light for you.

75
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,393
I'll have to find other torture tools.

76
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,752
Do you think it gets smoother
the more you practice, like singing?

77
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,513
It's precisely because
I suffered so much back then

78
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:44,593
that I'm really afraid of pain now,
more than most people.

79
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:50,034
How did you endure
those thirty years in the cage?

80
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:55,073
In the beginning,
I fought against the fox.

81
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:56,354
I always provoked him.

82
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,432
But later, I got scared
after being tortured,

83
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,794
so I didn't dare to do that anymore.

84
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:03,114
In the end,
I stayed silent and uncooperative,

85
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:04,384
even trying to end my own life.

86
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:09,994
Even someone like you would seek death?

87
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:10,794
Yes.

88
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,034
But I never managed to die.

89
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:14,953
Later on,

90
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:17,914
I went from wanting to kill myself
to wanting to kill him.

91
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:23,273
Our mentality is really strange.

92
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,354
You can tell whether
you're happy or not,

93
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:26,874
or painful or not

94
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,674
by comparing yourself with others.

95
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:33,153
Do you need me to
delve deeper into my miserable past?

96
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:36,034
I could exaggerate it a bit.

97
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:40,674
I'm sure you would think
there would be no other miseries.

98
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,874
You look quite different tonight.

99
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:56,833
Did something unpleasant happen?

100
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,073
You lived by the water
when you were a child?

101
00:11:57,824 --> 00:12:00,646
(Gourd Lake)

102
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:53,874
So beautiful.

103
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,513
Life is precious

104
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:04,153
as long as we can enjoy such views.

105
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:10,153
Even the rarest scenery would become
dull if being seen too much.

106
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:12,994
It will only be meaningful
if there's someone by my side.

107
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:15,633
Sceneries are dead.

108
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:18,914
Only meanings from people
will bring them alive.

109
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:15,040
Why are you in a bad mood?

110
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,554
The Central Plains are now stable.

111
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,593
The King of Xiyan will
eventually round up Hong Jiang.

112
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:26,874
The trend of the world is irreversible.

113
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:29,073
It's not something
an individual can stop.

114
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:40,874
Actually, you're just a demon,
a despised nine-headed demon.

115
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:44,674
For the arrogant deities in Chenrong,

116
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:51,073
you're probably less than nothing
in their eyes.

117
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:54,273
Why are you worrying about Chenrong?

118
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:57,474
What can you gain
from following Hong Jiang?

119
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:01,073
In your view, what should I do?

120
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:07,674
If you like power, you might as well

121
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,354
defect from Hong Jiang
to the King of Xiyan.

122
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:28,554
I was wrong.

123
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,234
I was wrong.

124
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:34,474
I was wrong.

125
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,474
It's okay. I'm thick-skinned.

126
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:37,914
Xiaoliu!

127
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:44,474
Are you alright?

128
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,393
A bowl of hot soup goes down,

129
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,393
and all my internal organs
are comfortable now.

130
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:27,314
You shouldn't spoil me like this.

131
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,074
What if I get used to your care,
but then you leave?

132
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:32,314
What should I do then?

133
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:33,674
I won't leave.

134
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,594
People who make promises are countless,

135
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,434
but those who keep them
are hard to find.

136
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:49,153
Sleep tight.

137
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:03,513
Just ignore Xiang Liu.

138
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:08,113
I'll deal with him in the future.

139
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:33,113
Don't worry. I've already
thought of a way to deal with him.

140
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:42,400
(Chenrong Army Base Camp)

141
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:46,554
Mr. Xiang.

142
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:52,273
Somebody!

143
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:54,794
Another one fainted.

144
00:18:54,954 --> 00:18:56,473
Quick, send him away.

145
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:05,113
What's going on?

146
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:06,674
Mr. Xiang,

147
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:10,194
recently in the camp,
many people got sick from malaria.

148
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:21,314
Why is there a carriage?

149
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:24,153
Xiaoliu, come up. Let's have a look.

150
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,434
The young lady from a big family

151
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:39,113
is pretty indeed.

152
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,714
(Yu Mansion)
Xiaoliu, isn't that Mr. Yu?

153
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:48,914
Yes, it's him.

154
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,873
Xiaoliu, I'm not mistaken, am I?

155
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:59,914
The half king of Qingshui Town,
Mr. Yu, also has to salute this lady.

156
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:01,794
The entire West River Street,

157
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:06,074
including your pharmacy and my restaurant,
belongs to Mr. Yu.

158
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:08,153
You're not mistaken.

159
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,954
It seems we have an honored guest
in Qingshui Town.

160
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:25,113
Skinny.

161
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:28,993
Have you remembered the rhymes
I taught you to distinguish herbs?

162
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:29,753
Yes.

163
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:31,168
I'll give you a test.

164
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:31,513
Okay.

165
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:32,594
Shiqi.

166
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:36,113
Go ahead.

167
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:42,074
What is this?

168
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:43,034
White peony root.

169
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:49,674
Xiaoliu, why did you hit me?

170
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,194
Just hitting your pig-like head.

171
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:52,873
White peony root? You idiot.

172
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:56,352
Largehead atractylode for the spleen and qi,
and white peony root for blood and menstruation.

173
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,048
Why can't you remember?

174
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,616
Shiqi has already
distinguished all the herbs

175
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,034
within less than six months.

176
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:03,233
And you? It's been so many years,
and you still can't remember.

177
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,794
It's been years,
and you still can't remember.

178
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:06,194
You just can't remember, right?

179
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:06,794
Xiaoliu.

180
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:08,914
Drink some water.

181
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:13,554
Let me check.

182
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:16,914
Skinny,

183
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:22,034
if I teach you again, can you remember?

184
00:21:24,753 --> 00:21:27,794
Largehead atractylode is for blood
and menstruation,

185
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:29,834
eliminating dampness and diuresis,

186
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,273
arresting sweating
and preventing miscarriage.

187
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:33,554
Remember?

188
00:21:33,914 --> 00:21:34,914
Can you remember?

189
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:36,674
Are you able to remember?

190
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:39,233
Something's wrong!

191
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,513
Something's wrong!

192
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,434
What happened?

193
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:44,834
I-I heard

194
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:48,834
Mr. Yu wants to take back the shops
near the river for other uses.

195
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:52,834
Our Rejuvenation Hall is by the river,
so it will also be taken back.

196
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:54,674
What should we do, Xiaoliu?

197
00:21:56,034 --> 00:22:00,594
When we rented this place,
it was just a wasteland.

198
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:02,034
Xiaoliu and I

199
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:04,794
put in so much effort
to make it what it is now.

200
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:08,113
Even if Yu Xin
is half king of Qingshui Town,

201
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:09,794
he shouldn't be so overbearing.

202
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:11,714
Taking it back at will?

203
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:15,393
I like being near the water.
I don't want to move.

204
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:18,954
It seems it's time to meet
the king of Qingshui Town.

205
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:20,314
I'll go with you.

206
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:21,753
Okay.

207
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:27,552
(Yu Mansion)

208
00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:33,233
Mr. Yu.

209
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:35,674
Save the courtesy.

210
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:36,954
Just speak up.

211
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:40,034
I heard you wanted to take back
the shops by the river.

212
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:41,513
That's right.

213
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,314
It includes Rejuvenation Hall.

214
00:22:44,714 --> 00:22:47,194
You intend to rent it out again
after taking it back, right?

215
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:48,873
Whomever you rent to is the same.

216
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:50,473
Why not continue renting to us?

217
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:52,794
Regarding the rent, it's negotiable.

218
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:53,873
We can pay more.

219
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:56,674
(Mr. Yu)
Let alone for this one shop,

220
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:59,834
even the rent for all the shops
on the entire street

221
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:01,554
is nothing.

222
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:04,153
Can't we negotiate?

223
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:07,554
After you take it back,
you can't just leave it idle.

224
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:09,194
It needs to be used.

225
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:11,873
You've been in Qingshui Town
for over twenty years, right?

226
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:14,434
To be honest,

227
00:23:15,314 --> 00:23:18,314
I'm just a servant,
merely running errands.

228
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,034
My master is extremely wealthy.

229
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:25,696
Let alone for this one shop,
even if the entire Qingshui Town is idle,

230
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,353
it won't have any harm.

231
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:28,993
I have to go.

232
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:30,794
I won't keep you any longer.

233
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:33,856
I'm sorry to bother you.

234
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:40,753
Miss Jing Ye.

235
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:43,714
Stop!

236
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,113
Master.

237
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,233
They all say you're dead,
but we don't believe it.

238
00:23:52,928 --> 00:23:55,680
It's been ten years.

239
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:57,434
Heaven has pity on us.

240
00:23:57,594 --> 00:24:00,153
I finally found you.

241
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:11,554
Why don't you talk, Master?

242
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:13,314
I am Jing Ye.

243
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:14,714
Did you forget?

244
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:15,714
And Lan Xiang.

245
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:17,714
You once joked that our names
together sound like

246
00:24:18,153 --> 00:24:19,616
"the fragrance of
an orchid in the night."

247
00:24:22,314 --> 00:24:25,113
Yu Xin, send a message to the Madam now.

248
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:26,674
Tell her we've found the junior master.

249
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:27,954
Yes.

250
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:28,993
Master,

251
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:32,914
have you even forgotten the Madam?

252
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:52,194
Take your time with
your family affairs. I will leave first.

253
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:57,034
Master.

254
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:57,714
Master.

255
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,954
Xiaoliu, time to eat.

256
00:25:33,674 --> 00:25:36,674
Xiaoliu, did Mr. Yu agree to
let us continue renting here?

257
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:45,714
I can't eat anymore.

258
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:50,753
I can't have it, either.

259
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:53,993
I've been living here
for more than twenty years.

260
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,473
I can't bear to leave.

261
00:26:01,753 --> 00:26:05,113
Don't worry. We can rent
for as long as we want.

262
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:06,753
Even if we don't pay the rent,

263
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:08,034
no one dares to take it back.

264
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,513
Really? You convinced Mr. Yu?

265
00:26:12,794 --> 00:26:13,554
Kind of.

266
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:15,794
Thank God.

267
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:18,074
That's great. Let's eat.

268
00:26:18,153 --> 00:26:19,714
Come on. Let's eat.

269
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,794
Mu, don't worry.

270
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:24,753
I will definitely
stay with you all the time

271
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:25,920
and take care of you until you die.

272
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:29,794
You have a short life.
I'm sure I can accompany you to death.

273
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:32,794
I won't let you be lonely and helpless,

274
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:44,554
but I don't know
who will be with me when I die.

275
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,873
Bad boy, you're talking nonsense again.

276
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:54,153
Where's Shiqi, Xiaoliu?

277
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,873
Why hasn't Shiqi come back yet?

278
00:26:57,473 --> 00:26:58,208
He's not coming back.

279
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,834
We don't need to
prepare meals for him anymore.

280
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:01,834
He's not coming back? Where did he go?

281
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,296
He's staying in Mr. Yu house.

282
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,873
Really?

283
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:06,194
He's working for Mr. Yu now?

284
00:27:06,554 --> 00:27:09,194
Mr. Yu is the one
who pays the most in Qingshui Town.

285
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:12,194
If Shiqi can live a decent life there,
we will benefit too.

286
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:14,794
So many good things happened today.

287
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:16,353
Let's add dishes to celebrate tonight.

288
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:17,714
Okay, I'll go buy groceries later.

289
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:18,753
I'll go buy the wine.

290
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:20,000
Enjoy the meal.

291
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:23,434
I'm full.

292
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,674
Why are you still wearing this?

293
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:26,513
Your clothes are scented?

294
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:28,633
I don't like the smell.

295
00:28:29,513 --> 00:28:31,233
From now on, no more scent.

296
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:35,993
You should go home now,
in case your family worry.

297
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:37,728
I...

298
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:40,273
I still want to be Ye Shiqi.

299
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,753
There is no Ye Shiqi in this world.

300
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:16,074
My Lord, I've known Ye Shiqi's identity.

301
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:34,240
(Upon investigation, Ye Shiqi is Tushan Jing,
second son of Tushan Family)

302
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:38,834
It's him.

303
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:12,513
Xiaoliu, let me do it.

304
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:14,714
Thank you.

305
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:16,714
What for? It's my duty.

306
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:19,714
Xiaoliu, were you waiting for someone?

307
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:21,594
No.

308
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:23,194
I must have seen it wrong.

309
00:30:23,674 --> 00:30:26,034
When you turned your head and saw me,

310
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,200
you seemed a little disappointed.

311
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,954
So I thought
you were waiting for someone.

312
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,834
Xiaoliu, why don't you go home first?

313
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:34,473
I'll finish washing soon.

314
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:38,153
Are you used to living here these days?

315
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:45,594
Ever since I came to Rejuvenation Hall,
I've felt settled like never before.

316
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,194
I can sleep till daybreak.

317
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:52,113
Xiaoliu,

318
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:55,200
thank you for helping me and Skinny

319
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,920
to get together and for giving me a family.

320
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:01,513
Aren't you worried about the future at all?

321
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:11,914
Rather than regret in the future,
you'd better stay away now.

322
00:31:12,753 --> 00:31:14,674
As long as your heart
becomes cold and hard,

323
00:31:15,594 --> 00:31:16,794
the pain will be less.

324
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:24,714
Once the heart becomes hard and cold,

325
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:28,554
it can indeed block out pain,
but it will also block out joy.

326
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,113
What's wrong, Xiaoliu?

327
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:44,273
Your words inspired me.

328
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:47,233
Thank you, Tian'er.

329
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:49,794
You're welcome.

330
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:08,674
I can't feel his pulse. He's dying.

331
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:32,273
Mr. Xiang, malaria is toxic
and hard to prevent.

332
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:33,993
The number of patients
is increasing day by day.

333
00:32:34,194 --> 00:32:35,993
We urgently need
a large amount of medicinal materials,

334
00:32:35,993 --> 00:32:36,833
but...

335
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:39,594
I will figure it out.

336
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:42,113
List out the needed medicinal materials.

337
00:32:42,473 --> 00:32:44,633
Yes, I will write it down immediately.

338
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:37,074
There's no scent on your clothes.

339
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:40,554
You don't like it.

340
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,434
The herbal medicine made by me. Wear it.

341
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:56,034
What? Don't you like it?

342
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,954
Never mind.
You can keep using the scent.

343
00:34:17,594 --> 00:34:18,834
How many maids did you have before?

344
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:20,913
Two.

345
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:23,648
How much money do you actually have?

346
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:28,114
I...

347
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:29,993
I haven't counted.

348
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:34,034
Did your previous issue happen
because of money?

349
00:34:34,993 --> 00:34:35,634
Yes.

350
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:40,554
Does Jing Ye look better or Lan Xiang?

351
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:51,034
Do you still remember the herbs
I told you about before?

352
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:52,834
I do.

353
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:57,433
Those herbs seem ordinary,
but by adding a little thing,

354
00:34:57,594 --> 00:35:00,074
you can take down
either deities or demons.

355
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:05,594
You're not that nine-headed demon.

356
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:06,794
You don't have nine lives.

357
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,233
Don't eat things randomly.

358
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:11,433
Okay.

359
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:15,354
So does Lan Xiang
look better or Jing Ye?

360
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:27,034
The intimate people
would be the most unreliable.

361
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:28,753
Look out for yourself.

362
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:30,874
Okay.

363
00:35:31,953 --> 00:35:34,753
Don't take action,
enduring and pretending to be dumb.

364
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:38,354
Or if you have to,
do it decisively and completely.

365
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,473
Never be soft-hearted.

366
00:35:42,154 --> 00:35:43,872
If you really can't beat them down,

367
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:46,913
you can come back
and help me grow medicine.

368
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,513
Anyway, you won't starve.

369
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:51,673
Okay.

370
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:54,154
My Lord,

371
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,953
many people in Chenrong Army
got sick from malaria and lack medicine.

372
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:01,114
Xiang Liu is trying
to gather medicinal materials.

373
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:08,154
If he can't control the disease,

374
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,433
it will inevitably
lower the army's morale.

375
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:13,634
It is the time
to force the Chenrong Army to surrender.

376
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:14,753
Pass the order.

377
00:36:14,953 --> 00:36:17,074
Buy up the main medicines
Xiang Liu needs,

378
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,394
so they have no medicine to use.

379
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,993
When they have nowhere to go,

380
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,136
take the opportunity
to lure them to surrender.

381
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:24,193
Yes.

382
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:26,473
However...

383
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:27,753
Tell me.

384
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:28,993
My Lord,

385
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:31,794
the men of the Fifth and Seventh Kings
have been active lately.

386
00:36:32,114 --> 00:36:33,394
If we act now,

387
00:36:33,913 --> 00:36:36,433
I'm afraid the credit
will be taken by your uncles,

388
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:37,673
which will benefit them but not you.

389
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:42,354
If they can surrender earlier,
the world can be peaceful sooner.

390
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,354
How can I give up for personal gain?

391
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:49,314
Even if I want the throne, I can't leave
the interests of the people behind.

392
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:52,193
I am impressed
that you care for the entire world.

393
00:36:53,554 --> 00:36:55,673
Go. Be cautious.

394
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:56,154
Yes.

395
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:08,233
As you all know,

396
00:37:08,713 --> 00:37:12,354
there are three royal families
and four noble families in Dahuang.

397
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:17,114
Today, I want to talk about
one of the four noble families,

398
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:20,233
the richest family in Dahuang,
the Tushan Family.

399
00:37:20,993 --> 00:37:23,874
The Tushan Family are descendants
of the nine-tailed deity fox.

400
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:25,753
They have been running businesses
for generations.

401
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,233
Their businesses
are throughout the entire Dahuang.

402
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,513
The Qingqiu Hill
where the Tushan Family live

403
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:33,233
is built with jade tiles
and gold bricks,

404
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:35,433
as well as various exotic animals
and monsters in the garden.

405
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:40,394
Although the Family is not a royal one,
it is like a royal family.

406
00:37:40,874 --> 00:37:45,513
Their offspring are continuous,
and their influence is deeply rooted.

407
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:51,154
Even the two emperors
have to show them some respect.

408
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:54,874
Don't be envious, everyone.

409
00:37:55,594 --> 00:37:58,713
After all, wealth
is like a wisp of smoke.

410
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:03,233
Anyway, you can't wish for it
if Heaven doesn't bestow it to you.

411
00:38:09,114 --> 00:38:10,953
Xiaoliu, come sit here.

412
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:12,154
Mr. Xuan.

413
00:38:17,953 --> 00:38:18,433
Thanks.

414
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:21,673
The Tushan Family is large
and has a big business,

415
00:38:21,794 --> 00:38:23,794
but their descendants are not many now.

416
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:27,354
This generation's direct line
only has a pair of brothers.

417
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:31,394
Known as Master Qingqiu,
the junior master of the Tushan Family

418
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:34,114
is intelligent, handsome,

419
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:38,394
and proficient in zither, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

420
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:42,354
Not only is he elegant and witty,

421
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,394
but he is also good at
running businesses.

422
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:48,314
So all the girls in Dahuang

423
00:38:48,314 --> 00:38:53,794
call Master Qingqiu
the man of their dreams.

424
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:55,473
Xiaoliu.

425
00:38:56,673 --> 00:38:57,154
Xiaoliu.

426
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,114
You didn't recognize him in new clothes?

427
00:39:02,193 --> 00:39:03,874
This roasted ginkgo seed
is really delicious,

428
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:05,834
but it's a bit troublesome to peel.

429
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:06,953
Try it.

430
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:09,233
- Having this.
- (The junior master of the Tushan Family)

431
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,233
is not only accomplished
in both literature and martial arts,

432
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,993
but his tactics
are also quite remarkable.

433
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,554
So much so that
in Qingqiu Hill and even Dahuang,

434
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:21,594
everyone only knows the junior master,
but not the senior master.

435
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:24,233
As the saying goes,

436
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:26,074
from the same family
but with different destinies.

437
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:45,634
Sit, please sit.

438
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:52,513
What are you waiting for? Sit.

439
00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:57,913
Master Qingqiu
is famous all over the world.

440
00:39:58,154 --> 00:40:01,554
He might be the next leader
of the Tushan Family.

441
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:03,673
Across the whole world,

442
00:40:03,673 --> 00:40:06,713
the number of young ladies
from prominent families

443
00:40:06,713 --> 00:40:08,834
who want to marry him
is simply countless.

444
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:12,794
The Lady of Tushan
had been selecting for a long time,

445
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:17,673
and finally decided on
Miss Fangfeng for the junior master.

446
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:20,154
Miss Fangfeng

447
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:23,953
traveled around with her father
and brothers since she was a child.

448
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:26,273
She is unlike ordinary girls.

449
00:40:26,713 --> 00:40:29,634
Not only was she born
as beautiful as a blooming flower,

450
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:31,874
but she also
has excellent archery skills.

451
00:40:34,394 --> 00:40:38,634
Unfortunately,

452
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:40,513
during the wedding preparation,

453
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:44,554
the junior master was seriously ill.

454
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,913
The wedding had to be canceled.

455
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:50,034
The lovers failed to get married.

456
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:51,904
Over these years,

457
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,193
the junior master
has been healing in seclusion.

458
00:40:56,554 --> 00:41:00,634
The power of the family
has changed hands to the senior master.

459
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:06,193
This is exactly the turning of fate
and the unpredictability of destiny.

460
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:11,154
Once the trend changes,
fortune is beyond one's control.

461
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:13,554
What's your name?

462
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,673
Next time we meet,

463
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,664
it wouldn't be appropriate
to pretend not to know you.

464
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:20,433
But even if you lent me
ten times the courage,

465
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:22,114
I wouldn't dare to call you Shiqi.

466
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:26,753
Even if you don't mind,
your wife would shoot me with an arrow.

467
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,433
Even if you don't tell me, I'll hear it
from someone else sooner or later.

468
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:37,673
Tushan Jing.

469
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:41,753
Tushan Jing.

470
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,473
How do you write it?

471
00:42:04,953 --> 00:42:07,154
What's the name
of your soon-to-be bride?

472
00:42:13,874 --> 00:42:16,713
Six years.
I've taken you in for six years.

473
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,473
You exempt me from six years of rent.

474
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:22,874
From now on, we owe each other nothing.

475
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:31,794
Master Qingqiu?

476
00:42:32,913 --> 00:42:34,834
I'll have to call you that
from now on, right?

477
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:52,753
Look, Xiaoliu saved you,

478
00:42:53,913 --> 00:42:56,394
but you didn't even
reveal your true identity to him.

479
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:58,193
No wonder Xiaoliu is angry.

480
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:03,354
Wait until Xiaoliu calms down
and then sincerely apologize to him.

481
00:43:05,993 --> 00:43:06,656
I'll take my leave.
