Yes, you're indebted to me.

21
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:06,811
You have to pay me back some day.

22
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,290
Okay.

23
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:12,570
I haven't drunk during this period

24
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,971
for fear of messing things up.

What is all this?

32
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:52,331
Why is there so much wine?

33
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:54,050
Since we got here,

34
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:56,731
Jing has been sending you wine
every 15 days.

35
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,290
You wanted to quit drinking,

36
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,731
so I saved them all for you.

37
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:02,930
Unconsciously,

38
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,770
it's been several months
since we were here.

39
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,451
Each box contains 15 bottles of wine.

40
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,650
Between you and Tushan Jing,

41
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,531
is there anything related
to the number 15?

42
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,171
He always does something
about the number 15,

43
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,090
as if he is reminding you of something.

44
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:29,970
In order to detoxify you,

45
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:32,530
I haven't drunk wine
for several months.

46
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:34,690
I really miss it.

47
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,771
Are you missing the wine

48
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,810
or the person who sends you the wine?

49
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,250
I was always thinking about you before.

50
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,290
I miss neither of them.

51
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,570
But now, I kind of miss both.

52
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:58,090
Cang Xuan.

53
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:01,530
The wine is delivered,

54
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,130
and my task is completed.

55
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:04,250
I'm leaving.

56
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:16,576
(Chenrong Mountain, Cao'ao Range)

57
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,331
Without it leading me,

58
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,130
it would be hard to find this place.

59
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:57,651
Why are you so quiet?

60
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,011
Long time no see.

61
00:05:59,530 --> 00:05:59,970
Yeah.

62
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,570
We used to see each other
every day in Qingshui Town.

63
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,850
Now, it's too hard to see each other.

64
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:06,090
Sometimes,

65
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,891
there's no one to talk to.

66
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:12,051
My family's merchant group
will often come in and out of here.

67
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:13,491
I can often see you.

68
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:17,731
This place is really nice.

69
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,130
Who lived in this thatched house

70
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,850
on Chenrong Mountain?

71
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,211
I asked the mountain guards,

72
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:23,451
but no one knows.

73
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,250
They only know
this place is called Cao'ao Range.

74
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,810
It was a forbidden place for Chenrong.

75
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,570
This place is Cao'ao Range?

76
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:52,931
After I discovered it,

77
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,410
I cleaned it up.

78
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,530
This house must be built
by a top expert of the Wood Spirit.

79
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,090
A thousand years later,

80
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:04,130
the spirit power has not dissipated.

81
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,250
So, the house does not look old at all.

82
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:08,891
Do you know who owned this house?

83
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:09,931
Who?

84
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:12,931
Chi Chen,

85
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,491
the infamous brutal demon in Dahuang.

86
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,491
I've read the books in the Zijin Palace.

87
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,690
The King of Chenrong
made it a forbidden place

88
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,250
because of him.

89
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:26,570
Chi Chen?

90
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:29,570
This was his residence?

91
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,410
Everyone in Dahuang thinks
Chi Chen loves an extravagant life.

92
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:39,090
I didn't expect his residence
in Chenrong was so simple.

93
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:42,850
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,451
I didn't know he once lived here.

95
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,011
Let's leave now.

96
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:51,451
My mother and Chi Chen

97
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,011
both died on the battlefield

98
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:55,211
for their own countries.

99
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:57,250
No one is to blame.

100
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:58,891
Besides,

101
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,690
why should we push ourselves

102
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,051
for a person who has been dead

103
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,211
for hundreds of years?

104
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:06,370
You like this place.

105
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:07,690
So do I.

106
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:11,051
Let's consider this place
as our own house.

107
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,410
We can meet here.

108
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:14,051
Alright.

109
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,171
Brother.

110
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:20,891
I'm going out.

111
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,624
Let's talk when I come back.

112
00:08:22,624 --> 00:08:24,130
Are you going to see Cang Xuan?

113
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,370
Yes.

114
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,090
Brother,

115
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,331
can you tell Cang Xuan

116
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:32,130
not to hang out with women all day,

117
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,730
but do something serious?

118
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,690
The clans in Central Plains
are dissatisfied with him now.

119
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:39,891
How can he...

120
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,050
Don't you know

121
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,451
why he behaved like that?

122
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,851
I know, but...

123
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,291
Seeing him surrounded by women,

124
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:50,690
I feel upset.

125
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,250
Xinyue,

126
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,930
if you want a devoted man,

127
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,411
he is not the right person.

128
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,050
Cang Xuan has too many things
in his mind.

129
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,531
Women are trivial to him.

130
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,370
If you are determined to marry him,

131
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,730
don't expect him to have only you

132
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,211
and always put you first.

133
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,810
Now he is just putting on a show

134
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,370
with singers and dancers,

135
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,651
and you can't stand it.

136
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,011
In the future,
you'll face more painful things.

137
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,971
I advise you to give up.

138
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:25,211
Are you really my brother?

139
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,531
You don't help me at all.

140
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,130
You just want me to give up.

141
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,531
Because I'm your brother,

142
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,651
I don't want you to marry Cang Xuan.

143
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,291
What if I insist?

144
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,490
Then you must accept
that he has many women by his side.

145
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:45,504
(Chenrong Mountain, Shengyun Peak)

146
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:47,971
Sorry to keep you waiting.

147
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,130
I just got here.

148
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,771
I can't hold a feast for you.

149
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,331
I can only bring a pot of wine for you.

150
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:56,091
What a coincidence.

151
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,011
I could only offer you water
in Xiyan Town.

152
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,891
I've been very sorry about that.

153
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:04,651
Today, I brought home-brewed wine.

154
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,291
Try it.

155
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:16,490
Congratulations to you and me.

156
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,331
We really met on Chenrong Mountain.

157
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:28,771
I have never admired anyone in my life

158
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:30,851
except you.

159
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,490
I was forced by the situation

160
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:35,370
and had to make a bolder move.

161
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,851
But you chose to help me

162
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:41,851
when you had many choices.

163
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:43,851
I am very grateful.

164
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:44,851
You're wrong.

165
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,091
Actually,

166
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,411
I also only have one choice.

167
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,810
Because only you have a big heart

168
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,211
to accommodate Dahuang.

169
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,211
I am so lucky

170
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:00,570
to have a confidant like you.

171
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,610
I only have a promise.

172
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,771
From now on,

173
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,451
I am willing to share weal and woe

174
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,130
with you.

175
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:14,930
Fenglong,

176
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,610
you have a special status.

177
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,891
You're not alone,

178
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,570
but with the Chishui Family behind you.

179
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,730
Are you sure you want

180
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,730
to tie your family

181
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,930
to my uncertain future?

182
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,570
I'm willing to follow Your Highness

183
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,170
and never regret.

184
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,851
From now on,

185
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:48,651
you and I

186
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,531
will fight side by side.

187
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,451
It turned out
Tushan Hou tempted Lan Xiang.

188
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,610
I guess

189
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:05,730
he still hasn't let go of his hatred.

190
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,730
Are you still unwilling to kill him?

191
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:14,651
I've been fatherless.

192
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,568
My brother was of the same age as me,

193
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,011
yet he thought
a brother was like a father,

194
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,930
so he took care of me in every way.

195
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,250
Before my grandmother
revealed the truth,

196
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,331
we were good brothers
for more than 400 years.

197
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:33,531
He was once the best brother
in the world.

198
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,411
Xiaoyao,

199
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:43,211
I know the securest way is to kill him,

200
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,091
but I can't do it.

201
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,570
I often complain
that you're too soft-hearted

202
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,091
and indecisive.

203
00:12:59,091 --> 00:12:59,891
But deep down,

204
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,291
I'm quite happy
that you are soft-hearted.

205
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,730
My grandparents,

206
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:07,490
my parents, brother,

207
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,170
and even I are all hard-hearted.

208
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,771
I like you,

209
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,331
because you're different from us.

210
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:18,411
Can you

211
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,050
say it again?

212
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,050
You're different from us.

213
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,291
Not this one, the previous one.

214
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,490
We are all hard-hearted?

215
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,851
Not this one.

216
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:39,851
I...

217
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,250
I like you.

218
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,570
Why are you nervous?

219
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:48,451
I know you like me.

220
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,971
What's wrong? Are you aggrieved?

221
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,930
Tell me. I'll help you
as your elder sister.

222
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:58,490
Sister.

223
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,851
She is bullying me.

224
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,370
Shameless. Who is your sister?

225
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,050
You're much older than me.

226
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,930
Sister, are you helping or not?

227
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:20,610
I really brought this on myself.

228
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,331
Sister.

229
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:24,690
Alright, stop it.

230
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,211
I say it.

231
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,730
What I just said is...

232
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,570
I like you.

233
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,050
I'm confessing.

234
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:54,651
And I'm not shy.

235
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,250
Why are you blushing?

236
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,130
I'm happy.

237
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:03,771
What's the big deal?

238
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,451
As long as you behave well,

239
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,891
I'll say it to you every day

240
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,211
to make you happy.

241
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,610
Okay.

242
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,011
Where's Xiaoyao?

243
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,211
Your Highness.

244
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,851
Princess went to meet a friend.

245
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,170
She hasn't come back yet.

246
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,011
Do we need to find her?

247
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,771
No need.

248
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:32,531
I'll wait for her.

249
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,170
She'll come back soon.

250
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:36,971
Yes.

251
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:00,771
Xuan.

252
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,531
Why are you still up

253
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:05,891
so late?

254
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,331
So are you.

255
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:12,411
I haven't seen Jing for a long time.

256
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,610
We chatted and lost track of time.

257
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,851
I won't let it happen again.

258
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,570
Look what I brought you.

259
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:30,250
As I said,

260
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:32,730
Jing refined the white fox tail
into a spiritual weapon.

261
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,370
This little puppet can only transform
into you.

262
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,930
If you use this as a substitute,

263
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:39,971
neither Xiaoxiao nor Jin Xuan

264
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,810
can recognize you.

265
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:44,851
Take it.

266
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:47,651
No.

267
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,331
You must take it.

268
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,130
I know

269
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,250
the nine-tailed fox hurt me,

270
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:56,490
so you're very bothered by it.

271
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,810
But because of that,

272
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:01,730
you should make good use of this puppet.

273
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,051
Xuan, you have to protect yourself.

274
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,090
Only then can I be at ease.

275
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:08,970
Is that okay?

276
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,210
Xuan, is that okay?

277
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:16,811
Xuan.

278
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,250
Thank you.

279
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,771
Xiaoyao.

280
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,450
Say whatever you want.

281
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,531
Jing has been with you
in Qingshui Town for many years.

282
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:39,970
I know he must be special to you.

283
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:42,531
But he is not Ye Shiqi

284
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,531
but Tushan Jing.

285
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,130
He's the future leader
of the Tushan Family.

286
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,931
I know.

287
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,891
I received the news

288
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,051
that the Grand Madam is not
in good health.

289
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,891
She wants Jing to be the leader
as soon as possible.

290
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,691
Jing carries the fate of a clan.

291
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,250
He can't do whatever he wants.

292
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,051
I know.

293
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:11,171
Also,

294
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,730
Tushan Jing has a marriage contract
with Fangfeng Yiying.

295
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:17,490
This involves the interests
of two clans.

296
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:21,610
The Fangfeng family never waives
the alliance with the Tushan Family.

297
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,250
It's not easy for Jing
to cancel the marriage.

298
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,651
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

299
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,531
I hope that you don't get into it.

300
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:45,411
I'm afraid he isn't good enough for you.

301
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:47,811
I see.

302
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,171
I get something for you too.

303
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,250
What is it?

304
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,210
I've checked out
Fangfeng Bei's background.

305
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,411
Xiaoyao, look.

306
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,651
It looks like a rockery
from the outside,

307
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,970
but it's a maze set up by a formation.

308
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:38,970
There is a different world.

309
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,210
Many visitors come.

310
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,450
If you like to be quiet,

311
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,051
we can walk inside later.

312
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,210
Today Fenglong
and you celebrate birthday.

313
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,370
I'm afraid all the clansmen
in Central Plains

314
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:49,691
will come to celebrate, right?

315
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,931
Actually, there are no outsiders today.

316
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,531
The people in this garden

317
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:56,291
are all my relatives.

318
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,051
But we are not.

319
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,051
Why not?

320
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,850
Cang Xuan's grandmother Lady Xiezu

321
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:03,450
is the lady of the Xiling family.

322
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:06,090
His grandmother's mother
is my grandfather's grandmother.

323
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,970
Speaking of which,
I should call him uncle.

324
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,811
His uncle,
the leader of the Xiling family,

325
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,651
married the lady of the Jiang family.

326
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,051
Their son and his cousin

327
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,210
is the cousin of Miss Jiang.

328
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,691
Miss Jiang is the cousin of Miss Shen.

329
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:18,171
I am the cousin of Miss Shen.

330
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,250
I should also call him cousin.

331
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,850
I'm totally confused

332
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:25,210
about these cousins.

333
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,411
Are you?

334
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:30,011
The Four Great Clans have been allied
with the clans in Central Plains.

335
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,771
Starting from Lady Xiezu,

336
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:34,411
you all have relatives
in Central Plains.

337
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:37,450
Indeed.

338
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:39,811
We are all relatives.

339
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:45,171
No wonder my grandfather
has been worried about Central Plains.

340
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,931
All the clans' bloodlines

341
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,250
are intertwined.

342
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,931
They may fight each other,

343
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:54,051
but at the critical moment,

344
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:56,090
they will surely unite.

345
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:22,970
I consider myself not bad at chess,

346
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,850
but every time I play against you
and Cang Xuan,

347
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,370
I often lose.

348
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:28,330
You just seldom dig into it.

349
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,850
You've been
in Central Plains for a while,

350
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:33,970
but you rarely come out.

351
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:36,090
My brother and I were worried
that you wouldn't come.

352
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,531
I'm not a sociable person.

353
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:39,370
I've declined the banquets
as much as possible.

354
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:41,250
But I have to

355
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:42,730
attend your banquet.

356
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:51,171
Your Highness.

357
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,171
Please.

358
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,931
Xiaoyao, there are many fun places
in Zhiyi.

359
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:00,771
If you have any place you want to go,

360
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:02,210
let my brother accompany you.

361
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,571
I'm not praising my own brother.

362
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,490
He doesn't like to be around girls.

363
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:08,891
He seems careless,

364
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,411
but he must be thoughtful to you.

365
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,610
Greetings, Your Highness.

366
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:23,571
No need of that.

367
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:24,970
Xiaoyao,

368
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,210
someone has been thinking about you.

369
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,651
Bei, look who's here.

370
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,490
Why are you here too?

371
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,970
What do you mean by that?

372
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:43,011
How come you're here?

373
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,411
I haven't seen Fangfeng Bei
for a long time.

374
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:54,931
And I want to ask him about something.

375
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,931
Fangfeng Bei, come with me.

376
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,571
Excuse me.

377
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:38,730
I'll go find someone
to drink with in the garden.

378
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,011
I just remembered
I have something to tell my brother.

379
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:49,450
Excuse me for a while.

380
00:23:58,051 --> 00:23:59,651
Brother, are you stupid?

381
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:02,490
Someone else will have Xiaoyao
if you don't act.

382
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,330
What are you talking about?

383
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:09,531
Cang Xuan.

384
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,490
My brother is smart,

385
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,490
but he becomes silly
when he sees Xiaoyao.

386
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,090
He obviously likes her,
but he can't say it out.

387
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,291
You're my brother's buddy.

388
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,330
You have to help my brother.

389
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,850
I can only create opportunities for you.

390
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:36,411
As for Xiaoyao's own feelings,

391
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,610
I can't control that.

392
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,130
Thanks.

393
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,691
That's enough.

394
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,450
Let's take a walk outside.

395
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,811
We can find Xiaoyao as well.

396
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:46,411
Okay.

397
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,600
Are you crazy?

398
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,610
This is the Chenrong Mansion.

399
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,610
If others knew your real identity,

400
00:24:57,771 --> 00:24:59,090
I wouldn't be able to save you again.

401
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:01,970
This is not Xiyan Town.

402
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:03,691
it's Central Plains.

403
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:05,531
Given the current situation,

404
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,330
the Central Plains
won't help the Chenrong Army

405
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,210
fight King of Xiyan,

406
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:11,931
but they definitely won't help him
catch us either.

407
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,370
I forgot Chenrong Yi is the descendant
of the Chenrong royal family.

408
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:20,171
Fine.

409
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,850
I don't need to worry about you.

410
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:24,850
Just forget it.

411
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,370
How's your archery?

412
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:36,531
What?

413
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,571
Since I promised to teach you archery,

414
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:41,130
I am your master.

415
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:44,771
Can't I check
if my disciple is slacking off

416
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,090
as a master?

417
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,210
You can.

418
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,210
I've been practicing lately.

419
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:55,531
My grandfather found a master
to teach me.

420
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,771
He can kill among many people in a war.

421
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,051
But his archery
requires strong spirit power,

422
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,370
not suitable for me at all.

423
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:05,011
After a few lessons,

424
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:06,330
I let him go.

425
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,531
I'll teach you.

426
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:16,330
You?

427
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,571
Xiangliu teaches me archery?

428
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:23,291
Are you scared?

429
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,411
You have had courage
to tease the snake demon, right?

430
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:29,970
There's nothing to be afraid of.

431
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:33,370
I dare to learn from you.

432
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,291
The wine you brewed does taste better.

433
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,771
If possible, please give me more.

434
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:45,610
I send it to mother.

435
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:48,291
It's rare for you
to ask me for something.

436
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:49,130
Even if I don't have it,

437
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,450
I'll have to brew it for you.

438
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:53,970
Thank you in advance, Your Highness.

439
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:56,610
Brother.

440
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,811
Since you came here,

441
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,250
you haven't had a chat with Xinyue.

442
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:03,210
I'll go find Jing.

443
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,090
The maze is quite interesting.

444
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:17,370
If you're not careful,
you can lose your companions.

445
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,771
(Xinyue,)

446
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,970
(if you want a devoted man,)

447
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,490
(he is not the right person.)

448
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:34,970
(If you are determined to marry him,)

449
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,450
(don't expect him to have only you.)

450
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:40,691
What's wrong?

451
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,450
Let me see.

452
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:47,571
It got a little red.

453
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:49,291
It'll be okay if you put ice over it.

454
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,011
Let's go back.

455
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,891
What's making you so upset?

456
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,370
It's you.

457
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,450
Me?

458
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,011
Nian,

459
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,370
you've been upset lately.

460
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,571
Can you tell me what's on your mind?

461
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,691
Father,

462
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,490
what's wrong with Xuan?

463
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,051
He has changed.

464
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,450
Now he spends his days with women,

465
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,610
only caring for pleasure.

466
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:38,011
As he is in that position,

467
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,771
every action he takes

468
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,610
must be up to something.

469
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:50,571
So, you mean

470
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,291
spending his days with women

471
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,811
is just a show, and he doesn't enjoy it?

472
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,850
What I mean is,

473
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,330
Cang Xuan is determined
to gain the throne.

474
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:02,171
Now he's destroying his reputation

475
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,370
to deceive his enemies.

476
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,250
And to gain the support
of the Central Plains clans,

477
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:08,771
he must form an alliance
with them through marriage.

478
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:12,490
But even so,

479
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:14,291
he doesn't need
to sacrifice himself for that.

480
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,850
You didn't, right?

481
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:16,811
So,

482
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:18,931
you only have my mother.

483
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,610
You're right.

484
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,490
But Haoling
suffered the Five Princes Rebellion.

485
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,130
Back then,

486
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:32,450
because of my selfish thought,

487
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:35,490
I refused to form an alliance
with the Baihu and Changxi tribes,

488
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,891
leading them to support

489
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,490
the rebellion of the Five Princes.

490
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:43,051
During decades of war,

491
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,171
people were displaced
or lost their lives.

492
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:50,571
Do you really think I was right?

493
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:56,891
I don't know.

494
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,370
I've taught Cang Xuan for 100 years,

495
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:03,130
hoping that he can do better than me.

496
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,130
I believe that he can do it.

497
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,011
Fangfeng Bei, the second son
of the leader of the Fangfeng Family.

498
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,171
His mother was of humble birth,
and he was often bullied as a child.

499
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:31,891
He picked up bad habits
when he was young,

500
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,490
heavily in debt.

501
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,970
He was unable to repay.

502
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:37,891
So he fled to the Far North,

503
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,210
with no news for 45 years.

504
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:43,891
His family thought he was dead.

505
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,730
Unexpectedly, Fangfeng Bei returned home

506
00:31:45,931 --> 00:31:47,811
with thousands of Ice Crystals

507
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,090
and was valued by the family.

508
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,450
His mother had been bedridden
for many years.

509
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:55,411
But Fangfeng Bei

510
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,571
took good care of her patiently.

511
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,250
His mother passed away in peace.

512
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,171
And everyone admired him.

513
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,490
They praised Bei for his filial piety.

514
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:11,771
The real Fangfeng Bei

515
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,171
died in the Far North, right?

516
00:32:15,776 --> 00:32:16,210
Yes.

517
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,051
Why did you choose him?

518
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:22,011
I didn't choose him.

519
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,171
He chose me.

520
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:30,767
(The Far North)

521
00:32:43,232 --> 00:32:45,600
(Fangfeng Bei)

522
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,850
Your meridians are broken.
I can't save you.

523
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,691
I-I know.

524
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,411
Please.

525
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:58,571
Please do me a favor.

526
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,651
What can you exchange

527
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,571
for my help?

528
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:09,291
I-I can

529
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,730
give you all my spirit blood and power.

530
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,771
I only ask you

531
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,171
to take care of my mother.

532
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,771
And let her live her remaining years
in peace.

533
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,651
Alright.

534
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:29,730
As you wish.

535
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,931
I didn't expect a nine-headed demon

536
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:03,051
could be willing to be someone's son

537
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,531
and take care of a sick person
day after day.

538
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:08,930
If you knew it,

539
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,571
you wouldn't have agreed
to Fangfeng Bei, would you?

540
00:34:15,296 --> 00:34:16,291
In this deal,

541
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,611
I actually got the better end.

542
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,051
How so?

543
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,051
Since I hatched from the egg

544
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,371
and opened my eyes,

545
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,250
I haven't seen my parents.

546
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:33,051
Because of Fangfeng Bei,

547
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,250
I had a mother.

548
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,410
Although she was sick,

549
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,410
her unconditional love made me

550
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:44,571
understand the mother-child bond.

551
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,531
Any other questions?

552
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:54,131
You've already kept your promise
to Fangfeng Bei

553
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:56,210
and taken care of his mother
until her death.

554
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,051
Why do you still pretend
to be Fangfeng Bei now?

555
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:00,771
I pretend to be him?

556
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,490
I have just been myself
in these 400 years.

557
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,808
Whether it's Fangfeng Bei, Xiang Liu,
or Nine Lives,

558
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,930
they're all just names.

559
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:14,291
Right.

560
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,291
Fangfeng Bei and you

561
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:18,531
seem to be totally different.

562
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,410
But both of you are indifferent inside.

563
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,170
Is this your true face?

564
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,291
Who could have a fake face
for over 400 years?

565
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,291
Otherwise, I have to avoid mistakes
every time I transform?

566
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:40,410
You look exactly like Fangfeng Bei?

567
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,131
Not exactly.

568
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:45,410
When Fangfeng Bei ran away from home,
he was not yet an adult.

569
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,291
Decades later,

570
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,170
his looks and personality could change.

571
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:51,291
Furthermore,

572
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,771
He had a frostbite
on his face in the Far North.

573
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:55,771
And he had a physician cure his face.

574
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,890
I see.

575
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,970
How many true faces do you have?

576
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,771
They all say you have nine true faces

577
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,250
and 81 transformations.

578
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,131
Is that true?

579
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:25,170
I didn't say anything to upset you.

580
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,371
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

581
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:29,571
You don't have to answer.

582
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,170
You come to me?

583
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:34,371
Or should I come to you?

584
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,531
You can bite my arm.
The blood is the same.

585
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,970
Someone is peeping at us over there.

586
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,611
Shouldn't you do something?

587
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:12,930
Your Highness,

588
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,450
I'm the second son
of the Fangfeng family.

589
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:17,410
There's something I can't do.

590
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,210
Leave it to me. Where is he?

591
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,288
Let me see
how accurate your shooting is.

592
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,811
Jing? Why are you here?

593
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,650
I didn't know you were there.

594
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:44,811
Are you hurt?

595
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,291
No.

596
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:07,571
Give it back to you.

597
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:25,792
Why are you alone?

598
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,531
Aren't you with my sister?

599
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,331
I...

600
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,571
Fangfeng Bei, you tricked me.

601
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:35,531
It's just a joke.

602
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,490
I just saw my sister.

603
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,490
She's looking for you.

604
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,291
Is it fun to fool an honest man?

605
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:08,371
It's more fun to fool you.

606
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,490
Time will tell.

607
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,490
Let's wait and see

608
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:13,611
who is the winner.

609
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:19,490
Good. Being a princess makes you bolder.

610
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,011
You're so eager to see Tushan Jing.

611
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:28,450
Why did you run away just now?

612
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,690
How can I get out of this maze?

613
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,771
There are many interesting things
to see in this maze now.

614
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,051
Aren't you interested?

615
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:40,450
For example,

616
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,970
my sister and Tushan...

617
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:43,490
No.

618
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,571
Don't regret it then.

619
00:40:16,672 --> 00:40:18,170
I just played chess with Jing.

620
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,851
Looks like I've lost.

621
00:40:20,611 --> 00:40:22,970
Cang Xuan, why don't you take my place?

622
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:24,611
And I'll take Jing's place.

623
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,531
Let's try turning the game around.

624
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,250
Alright.

625
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,136
Miss.

626
00:40:56,131 --> 00:40:56,851
What's the matter?

627
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,690
Miss Zhan is not feeling well.

628
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:00,611
Mr. Fan has taken her home first.

629
00:41:01,131 --> 00:41:01,771
Got it.

630
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,291
Miss Zhan, Fan Zhang's fiancee?

631
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,650
Who else could be?

632
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,410
It is said the Zhan family
had a feud with Chi Chen

633
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,890
and were wiped out.

634
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,611
Now she is the only child left.

635
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:17,091
Fortunately, the Fan family

636
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,210
has been taking care of her.

637
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,051
Chi Chen is the General of Chenrong,

638
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:25,051
but after his death,

639
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:27,072
no one in Central Plains mourned
for him.

640
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,371
People should hate him.

641
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,851
Chi Chen was brutal and violent,

642
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:32,970
causing too many deaths.

643
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,170
Everyone can curse Chi Chen,

644
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,051
except the Chenrong family.

645
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,531
Tell me why.

646
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:53,011
You should ask your father about this.

647
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:57,730
You will find out

648
00:41:58,531 --> 00:42:00,331
which side is indebted.

649
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:01,930
Fangfeng Bei.

650
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,690
What's going on?

651
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,091
Miss Fangfeng,

652
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,051
keep your brother in check.

653
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:19,051
Think about his status before he speaks.

654
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,011
He can't be rude in my place.

655
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,051
I've been living
in the Tushan Mansion for decades,

656
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:27,730
helping them with the business.

657
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:29,690
How can I control him?

658
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,611
You do it yourself.

659
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,771
You're not married
into the Tushan family yet.

660
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:37,811
Don't consider yourself

661
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,291
to be Lady of Tushan.

662
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,771
I respected you before.

663
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,650
You really think...

664
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,170
Xinyue!

665
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:46,930
Xinyue,

666
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,291
why are you so angry?

667
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,331
You hypocrite.

668
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,410
Jing, I apologize on behalf of Xinyue.

669
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:31,890
Miss Fangfeng, sorry about that.

670
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,371
Please don't take it to heart.

671
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,250
My mother spoiled Xinyue.

672
00:43:36,571 --> 00:43:39,051
I don't blame her. I was reckless.

673
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:41,170
Miss Fangfeng,

674
00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:42,690
please calm down.

675
00:43:42,976 --> 00:43:44,250
I will punish myself with three cups

676
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:45,690
as an apology to you.

677
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:55,571
She's my friend.

678
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,210
It's normal to argue.

679
00:43:59,091 --> 00:44:00,051
If I take it to heart,

680
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:01,611
I will be petty.

681
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:03,771
Thank you, Miss Fangfeng.

682
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,730
So sweet.

683
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,851
Xiaoyao and I will leave first.

684
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,170
Let's get together another time.

685
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:53,051
Today is the birthday
of Fenglong and Xinyue.

686
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:55,450
It seems a bit inappropriate

687
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:56,650
for us to leave suddenly.

688
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,170
Anyway, my reputation is already ruined.

689
00:45:00,051 --> 00:45:01,690
Offending more people

690
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,011
will only make the two uncles
feel more at ease.

691
00:45:05,091 --> 00:45:06,771
Sometimes, I ask for trouble.

692
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:08,992
You don't have to worry about me.

693
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:11,851
Xiaoyao.

694
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,730
In future,

695
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,371
I will be your good brother.

696
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,450
How can I not care
whether you're happy or not?

697
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:25,811
Sounds like you were

698
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,210
a bad brother before.

699
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:31,611
Anyway,

700
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:34,690
at least one of us

701
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:36,811
should be happy, right?

702
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:38,890
What's wrong?

703
00:45:40,851 --> 00:45:41,611
Nothing.

704
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:43,051
What's going on?

705
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,571
Why one of us is happy?

706
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,131
What about you? Why are you not happy?

707
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:51,131
Xiaoyao,

708
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,291
do you think I chose this path

709
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,531
for happiness?

710
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,450
From today on,

711
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,531
I will be a good brother,

712
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,730
taking good care of you.
