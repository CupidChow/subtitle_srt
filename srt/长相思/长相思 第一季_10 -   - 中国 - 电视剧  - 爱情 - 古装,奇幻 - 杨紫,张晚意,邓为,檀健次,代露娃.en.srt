=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,544
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:49,505
Xiaoliu.

4
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:36,426
Why did you save Xuan?

5
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:45,216
Because...

6
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:49,385
Because I figured out his true identity.

7
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:54,706
A few days ago, I was wondering

8
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:57,986
why you are so idle,

9
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,066
watching me recover
from my injuries every day.

10
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:01,905
Then I found out

11
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,025
you were not looking after me,

12
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,586
but waiting for Xuan.

13
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:11,105
Tushan Jing

14
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:14,905
asked me to hide in the mountain

15
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,665
because he knew

16
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,825
you and Xiyan had been fighting
for hundreds of years.

17
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,185
Xiyan can't do anything about you.

18
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,706
If you didn't want Xuan to find me,

19
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:28,946
Xuan definitely couldn't.

20
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:30,825
But

21
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,545
you figured out his identity,

22
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:36,025
and you knew he wanted to kill me.

23
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,265
So you used me as a bait,

24
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:41,385
trying to lure and kill him.

25
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:45,185
I used you as a bait.

26
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,105
So what?

27
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,905
True, it doesn't matter.

28
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,306
After all, he wants to kill me.

29
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:57,105
But I knew later

30
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:01,265
he is the eldest grandson of
the legal wife of the King of Xiyan.

31
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,745
If I had killed him for you,

32
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:09,066
the King of Xiyan would definitely
avenge him with all his might.

33
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:14,226
Then I would never have peace,

34
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,146
and in Dahuang,

35
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:18,586
there would be no place for me.

36
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:25,945
I thought you had some guts.

37
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:28,026
I disappointed you.

38
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,146
You dare to confront the King of Xiyan,

39
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,706
while I dare not.

40
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,345
The wrath of the emperor
brings blood flowing a thousand miles.

41
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:37,586
I can't bear it.

42
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,545
How did you figure out Xuan's identity?

43
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:43,225
When you were chasing him,

44
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:46,665
I heard one of his attendants

45
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,426
shouting

46
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:49,825
something like

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,186
"Save His Highness".

48
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,466
It was vague,

49
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:56,146
but

50
00:04:57,026 --> 00:05:00,825
there's a very limited number of people

51
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,706
you want to kill at all costs.

52
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:06,146
One can figure out who he is

53
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,146
with a little thought.

54
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:18,626
So you know
that I want to kill him at all costs.

55
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,026
I ruined your plan.

56
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:24,026
If you want to kill me,

57
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,232
just do it.

58
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:28,832
Killing you

59
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,065
would be too easy for you.

60
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,026
Is that guy crazy?

61
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:24,265
With such a serious injury,
he is in the mood to do such a thing.

62
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:28,986
Your Lordship,

63
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:31,866
I am a man.

64
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:32,906
Are you?

65
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:36,385
If you are,

66
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,586
how did you manage to lure Feifei out?

67
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,026
I don't believe you can't
change your appearance and voice.

68
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,746
I trust a beast's intuition more.

69
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:52,265
If the intuition of beasts is accurate,

70
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:54,866
your Chubby wouldn't
have been poisoned by me,

71
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,906
there would be no traps in the world,

72
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,545
and hunters wouldn't be able to hunt.

73
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:02,026
What illusion technique are you using?

74
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,480
With low spirit power

75
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:06,906
you can make it untraceable.

76
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:09,586
Everything seems real.

77
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,064
My body is real.

78
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,706
Come on.

79
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:23,866
Touch it.

80
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,306
Come on.

81
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:27,385
Touch it

82
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:30,146
only if you won't suspect
that I'm a woman anymore.

83
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:34,266
I'm not interested in your fake body.

84
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:37,986
No wonder.

85
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:41,585
You demons only have males and females
but not men and women.

86
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:45,225
Too bad I can't change into
a nine-headed female demon

87
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,905
to cater to you right now.

88
00:08:58,426 --> 00:08:58,946
I...

89
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:01,025
Well, I...

90
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,785
I didn't mean it.

91
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:35,946
Ouch, ouch.

92
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:41,545
Xiaoliu, Xiaoliu.

93
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:52,306
Xiao Liu,

94
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,665
Master, there's enough
spiritual medicine for Mr. Liu.

95
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,200
He'll recover soon with it.

96
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:32,626
As cultivation is hard,

97
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:35,360
why do you consume
your own spirit power, Master?

98
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:37,585
Xiaoliu was injured
by overwhelming demon power.

99
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,506
Although my spirit power can't heal him,

100
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,826
it can alleviate his pain.

101
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,186
Then let me do it.

102
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,626
Master, you have many
important things to deal with.

103
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:51,426
How can you
waste your spirit power to heal others?

104
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,785
His safety is the most important.

105
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:55,506
Master.

106
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,304
You may leave.

107
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:00,746
Yes.

108
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,345
Xiang Liu, Xiang Liu.

109
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:27,905
Xiang Liu.

110
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,746
Don't move,
or your wound will open again.

111
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,386
(He hurt you like this)

112
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:50,545
(and you're still thinking about him?)

113
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:52,665
Please

114
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:54,426
don't...

115
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:57,665
Don't...

116
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:02,426
As long as you get better,

117
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:04,465
I promise you anything.

118
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,785
I heal so soon.

119
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,345
Much spiritual medicine
must have been used.

You finally woke up.

128
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:11,345
Did Mr. Liu's condition worsen?

129
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:13,344
Let me help him.

130
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,603
Miss, you are indeed impressive.

131
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:31,265
Mr. Liu saved my life,
but I have nothing to repay now.

132
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:33,522
Please accept my courtesy.

133
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:42,802
Thank you for saving my life.

134
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,609
If there is a chance in the future,

135
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,162
I will repay you, Master Qingqiu.

136
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:48,882
Mu and the others
are still waiting for me.

137
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:49,802
I'll take my leave.

138
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:55,649
Before I came,

139
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,522
you were chatting happily.

140
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:01,537
Did I disturb the two of you?

141
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:03,713
Is that why Mr. Liu left?

142
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,433
He was having a good chat with Ye Shiqi,

143
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,922
not with your master.

144
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:23,922
Xiaoliu.

145
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:25,963
Don't worry.

146
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,162
Just take the medicine on time,
and you will have a baby.

147
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:30,843
Thank you, doctor.

148
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:31,882
Take care.

149
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:42,723
Xiaoliu, have some water.

150
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:44,323
Thank you, Tian'er.

151
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:48,882
Doctor, doctor.

152
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:51,003
Come sit over here.

153
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:52,402
Let me check.

154
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:53,522
What happened?

155
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,363
When repairing the leaky roof,

156
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:56,562
he was hit by a tile.

157
00:18:57,963 --> 00:18:58,843
This wound is no big deal.

158
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,963
I'll bandage it up,

159
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,682
and he'll be fine
after a few days of rest

160
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:03,723
Thank you, doctor.

161
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,402
Skinny, do the bandaging.

162
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:17,162
Xiaoliu, I suddenly have a stomachache.
I have to go to the toilet.

163
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,963
Xiaoliu, let me do it.

164
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,443
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

165
00:19:55,922 --> 00:19:57,282
Here, press it.

166
00:19:57,522 --> 00:19:58,443
Okay.

167
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:09,003
These few days, have a light diet.

168
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:11,323
Rest well. Prevent the wound from water.

169
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:14,282
Thank you, doctor.

170
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:15,483
It's my pleasure.

171
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:16,723
Take care.

172
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:18,603
Take care.

173
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:19,723
Take your time.

174
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,083
Usually, I watch you teach Skinny.

175
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:37,603
I've seen it so many times,

176
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,083
so I can sort of imitate it

177
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:40,642
and make easy treatments.

178
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,443
You are quite gifted

179
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,282
in observing and serving people.

180
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,123
Are you complimenting me, Xiaoliu?

181
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:55,642
Isn't diagnosing an illness
about observing people?

182
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,323
Isn't taking care of the sick

183
00:20:58,593 --> 00:20:59,762
about serving people?

184
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:05,802
I think you could study medicine.

185
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:13,123
Skinny and Pimply
have been with me for over 20 years,

186
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:15,323
but they are not cut out for this work.

187
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:18,562
I think you can do it.

188
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:22,162
If you are willing, study hard.

189
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:25,203
Learn my skills in treating infertility.

190
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,203
Wherever you and Skinny go,

191
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:28,562
you will never starve.

192
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:31,882
Are you really willing to teach me?

193
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:34,003
Why wouldn't I?

194
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:36,323
Once you can work,

195
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:37,682
I can finally be idle.

196
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:42,642
I've been married to Skinny for so long.

197
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:44,843
Not to mention arguing with him,

198
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:47,443
I've never criticized him.

199
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:51,083
It's not that we are
more affectionate than other couples.

200
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,083
It's just that I have no one to rely on

201
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:57,682
and my background is poor.

202
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,363
So I always compromise

203
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:00,802
and humor him.

204
00:22:02,203 --> 00:22:03,203
But I know

205
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:05,522
this is not a long-term solution.

206
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:08,282
I have no way out.

207
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:10,762
I can only keep going until the end.

208
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:18,402
Thank you, Xiaoliu.

209
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:22,762
Thank you for giving me the chance

210
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:25,003
to learn a skill,

211
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:27,963
be independent, and earn my own bread

212
00:22:28,323 --> 00:22:29,642
like Chuntao.

213
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:40,282
In the future, you and Skinny

214
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:41,843
should treat Mu well.

215
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:44,723
If you both die while Mu is alive,

216
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,843
ask your children
continue to take care of him.

217
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:53,162
Xiaoliu,

218
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,402
are you leaving Qingshui Town?

219
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:04,323
Xiaoliu, rest assured.

220
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:06,922
I will definitely
take care of Mu and Skinny.

221
00:23:08,642 --> 00:23:09,843
Are you entrusting your family?

222
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:20,282
What? You don't welcome me?

223
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:26,723
Tian'er, do your business.

224
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,363
Mr. Xuan, sorry for
not welcoming you sooner.

225
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:32,203
Please come in.

226
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:43,162
Drink water.

227
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,243
Empty.

228
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:50,203
Thank you, Mr. Xuan.

229
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:54,882
Mr. Xuan, what brings you here?

230
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,243
W-What can I do for you?

231
00:23:57,443 --> 00:23:58,243
Why did you save me?

232
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:09,363
If you die, the poisonous bug
inside you will also die.

233
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,882
I-I've raised it with great difficulty.

234
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:13,282
I don't want it to die.

235
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:23,402
Although I captured Nian,

236
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,483
I didn't really harm her.

237
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:27,123
I just tricked her.

238
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:28,882
Your people hurt me,

239
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,243
so I didn't spare you either.

240
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:32,522
Xiang Liu used me to set a trap,

241
00:24:32,682 --> 00:24:33,882
but I saved your life.

242
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:36,353
Let's call it even.

243
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:37,402
We are even.

244
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:43,243
When will you remove the bug?

245
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:47,483
When you leave Qingshui Town.

246
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:48,603
Why can't you do it now?

247
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:52,123
You're a person with grand aspirations.

248
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:54,762
You will definitely
leave Qingshui Town soon.

249
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:55,843
Don't worry.

250
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,203
When you leave,

251
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:58,843
I will definitely remove the bug.

252
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:01,083
The bug doesn't really harm you.

253
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:02,843
It can only make you suffer from

254
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:04,562
what I'm suffering.

255
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:06,003
As long as you don't harm me,

256
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,203
you won't suffer.

257
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:10,042
I just want to live in peace with you.

258
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:19,297
Alright.

259
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:31,723
When you have time,
come to the winery for drinks.

260
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:33,802
Okay.

261
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:35,603
Also, take care of yourself.

262
00:25:36,363 --> 00:25:37,642
Especially when you're injured,

263
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:38,882
restrain your desire.

264
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:39,682
Alright.

265
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:41,665
What?

266
00:25:58,522 --> 00:25:59,483
(Can I really)

267
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:01,522
(come to drink with you,)

268
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:04,042
(Cang Xuan?)

269
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:23,162
Your body is not impaired, My Lord.

270
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:26,363
Wen Xiaoliu also said
this poisonous bug wouldn't harm me.

271
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,682
It can only make suffer from
what he is suffering.

272
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:32,323
But I don't believe even a word he said.

273
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:34,402
He refuses to remove the bug from me.

274
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,963
He must have other plans.

275
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:40,882
I asked a few people
who are good at removing poisonous bugs.

276
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:44,363
Only the person
who placed the bug on you can remove it.

277
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:47,363
I heard that someone had a similar bug,

278
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:50,203
and when the person
who placed the bug died,

279
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:52,922
the person who had the bug also died.

280
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:54,323
I'm worried

281
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:57,963
that Wen Xiaoliu
will use it to control you.

282
00:27:01,323 --> 00:27:03,203
Although I don't like being threatened,

283
00:27:04,762 --> 00:27:06,642
I'm not afraid of being threatened.

284
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:22,282
Pour it.

285
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:22,603
Thanks.

286
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:23,483
Tian'er, come.

287
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:25,642
The last dish is ready.

288
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:27,243
Wow.

289
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:29,963
Xiaoliu, try this cured meat.

290
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:32,162
This was especially given
by a patient to thank Tian'er.

291
00:27:32,203 --> 00:27:33,003
Alright.

292
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:38,042
They sent two pieces in total.

293
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,762
I asked Mu to steam one,
and there's one left.

294
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:42,562
Tomorrow, I'll let Skinny send it
to Pimply and Chuntao.

295
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:43,282
Okay.

296
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,123
Let's toast Tian'er.

297
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,642
Congratulations to Tian'er.

298
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:50,882
You've made progress in medicine.

299
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,402
Now you can even run your own clinic.

300
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:53,243
Come on.

301
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:53,603
Congrats.

302
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:53,963
Cheers.

303
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:54,882
Congratulations, Tian'er.

304
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:58,922
I should toast you, Xiaoliu.

305
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:01,185
Thank you for your careful guidance.

306
00:28:09,762 --> 00:28:10,603
Come on. Let's eat.

307
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:14,963
Eat more.

308
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:15,922
It is really delicious.

309
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:19,841
It seems that your wounds
have completely healed.

310
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:20,801
You should also eat one.

311
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:37,562
What are you looking at, Xiaoliu?

312
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:38,282
Nothing.

313
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,203
Come on. Let's drink.

314
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:41,601
Xiaoliu, have another drumstick.

315
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:43,363
Pour it.

316
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:44,162
Ok, some more for you.

317
00:28:44,963 --> 00:28:45,682
Pour for me first.

318
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:46,603
Ok, you first.

319
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:47,282
Pour it.

320
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:48,123
Okay, here.

321
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,049
(I'm afraid of loneliness.)

322
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:52,162
(If I can't find
enduring companionship,)

323
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:53,963
(brief one is also good.)

324
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,562
Xuan, cheers.

325
00:29:57,243 --> 00:29:57,802
Haitang,

326
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,203
help Nian get back to rest.

327
00:30:00,802 --> 00:30:01,243
Yes.

328
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:10,162
Why? I'm not drunk.

329
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:12,882
I want to drink
and enjoy the plum blossoms with Xuan.

330
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:23,522
Watch the steps.

331
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:29,123
The Second Princess
is such a light drinker.

332
00:30:29,843 --> 00:30:31,323
How dare she compete with His Highness.

333
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,522
The Great Princess

334
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,402
liked to drink secretly
when she was young.

335
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,762
She has grown up now,
and must not be a light drinker.

336
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:21,323
On such a snowy day,

337
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:26,402
it's most suitable for a family
to chat and drink together.

338
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:27,963
Cheers.

339
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:37,162
When you have time,
come to the winery for drinks.

340
00:31:41,522 --> 00:31:42,753
I'll go out and have a look.

341
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,042
I'll go out.

342
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,921
(He will leave soon.)

343
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:00,282
(If we don't drink now,)

344
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:02,762
(we won't have the chance.)

345
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:15,402
(Forget it.)

346
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:27,723
Since you're here,
why don't you come in?

347
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:34,402
I just saw
that there was no light in the house.

348
00:32:35,123 --> 00:32:36,363
I thought there was no one here.

349
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:38,603
Please.

350
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:01,522
The plum tree is in full bloom.

351
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:05,123
Nian wants to see it,

352
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:06,882
so I planted it for her.

353
00:33:10,682 --> 00:33:12,123
You

354
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:14,443
really cherish your sister.

355
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:20,042
Where is Nian?

356
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,162
How come she allows me

357
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:23,243
to sit here and drink?

358
00:33:24,123 --> 00:33:25,682
Nian is a light drinker

359
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:26,922
and gets drunk easily.

360
00:33:27,402 --> 00:33:28,963
She's having sweet dreams in the room.

361
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:47,617
This mulberry wine

362
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:51,963
is different from that
I've drunk elsewhere.

363
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:56,922
It's a brew from many years ago.

364
00:33:57,483 --> 00:33:59,162
It's rare that Nian was in the mood

365
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:00,162
to drink today,

366
00:34:00,443 --> 00:34:01,363
so I took it out.

367
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:05,483
Then I must drink more.

368
00:34:13,362 --> 00:34:15,523
You both are children of noble families.

369
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:18,203
Why did you come
and suffer in Qingshui Town?

370
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:29,483
Tell me.

371
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:37,043
No one will believe it.

372
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,003
I will.

373
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:45,082
For my sister.

374
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:49,443
For Nian.

375
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:51,082
For taking her out to travel.

376
00:34:58,882 --> 00:34:59,803
Why did you save me?

377
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:08,922
I'm not drunk yet.

378
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:10,682
It's not appropriate to ask now.

379
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:12,523
Then I'll wait until you're drunk.

380
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:18,243
Impossible.

381
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:20,682
Why is it impossible?

382
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:25,483
Because...

383
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:32,963
Because...

384
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,803
Because I'm going to sleep.

385
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:22,642
Xiaoliu.

386
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:25,443
Xiaoliu!

387
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:52,842
You really aren't afraid of death.

388
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:11,521
Come in.

389
00:37:27,585 --> 00:37:30,602
What brings you here, Master Qingqiu?

390
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:32,563
I'm Ye Shiqi of Rejuvenation Hall now.

391
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:56,963
You still can't
remove the poisonous bug?

392
00:37:58,563 --> 00:38:00,243
I've tried everything, but none worked.

393
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:01,283
I don't know why.

394
00:38:04,763 --> 00:38:05,763
Do you want my help?

395
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:07,723
Who's there?

396
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:39,642
Who is it?

397
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:42,483
No one. I must have misheard.

398
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:48,362
I have other things to do.
You may leave.

399
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:51,402
And, don't bring me these anymore.

400
00:38:51,842 --> 00:38:52,842
Although I'm not rich,

401
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:55,203
I can afford the snacks.

402
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:06,882
You're no longer the homeless Ye Shiqi.

403
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:09,043
Your home is in Qingqiu Hill.

404
00:39:10,322 --> 00:39:12,162
The Tushan family doesn't need me.

405
00:39:13,203 --> 00:39:13,963
But I need...

406
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:24,162
I'll take my leave.

407
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:30,922
These braised dishes and green plum wine

408
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:32,322
are made by me.

409
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:34,322
Have a try.

410
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,963
If you like them,
I can make more for you next time.

411
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:40,443
That scared me.
