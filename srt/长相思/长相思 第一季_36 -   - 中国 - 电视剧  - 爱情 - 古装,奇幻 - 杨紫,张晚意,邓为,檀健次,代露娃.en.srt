00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,760
=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,288
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:46,316
Xuan.

4
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:54,795
You are drafting the restoration plan
for Daming Palace?

5
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,835
Grandfather hasn't issued
the imperial order,

6
00:01:58,835 --> 00:01:59,916
but Daming Palace

7
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:01,636
still collapsed under my watch.

8
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,236
I need to do what I should.

9
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:06,556
I heard that Yue Liang
has checked the accounts

10
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:08,355
over and over again,

11
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,915
yet, he found no discrepancies.

12
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:12,640
We should thank Jing for that.

13
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:14,435
He personally sorted out the accounts.

14
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,795
If Yue Liang wants to find out

15
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:17,275
a mistake made by Chief Tushan,

16
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,515
it won't be easy.

17
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:20,435
Even if there's no evidence
of embezzlement,

18
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:21,596
Yue Liang

19
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:23,075
probably won't let it go easily.

20
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:24,956
I have never cut corners,

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,880
so naturally, I'm not afraid
that he'll find out

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,995
the evidence of my embezzlement.

23
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,995
But I worry he would follow the clues

24
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:33,836
and find out other things.

25
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:41,956
Xuan,

26
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:44,596
I need to make a trip to Qingqiu Hill.

27
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,355
If it's for Tushan Jing,

28
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:49,676
then go.

29
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:52,355
If it's for my sake,

30
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,036
asking for help from the Tushan family,

31
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:55,196
then forget it.

32
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:56,915
What are you saying?

33
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:58,876
I promised Jing

34
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,288
to treat his grandmother's illness.

35
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:02,676
Recently, I've been reading
various medical books,

36
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:03,840
and learning about folk cures.

37
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,836
Finally, I found a method that may work.

38
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:09,836
It's my fault.

39
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,236
If it weren't for me,

40
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,275
Grand Madam might have agreed

41
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:15,596
to your marriage with Tushan Jing.

42
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:18,275
But because of me,

43
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,036
in such a situation now,

44
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,075
I'm afraid Grand Madam

45
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:25,515
will object even more.

46
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:29,596
I agreed to help treat
Grand Madam's disease

47
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:31,515
only because
I happened to be able to do it.

48
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:33,596
I didn't think about pleasing her,

49
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,715
nor did I hope that she could agree to

50
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:37,956
let me be with Jing because of this.

51
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,075
Tushan Jing seems

52
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:40,196
very eager to be with you,

53
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:42,836
yet he has not taken
any concrete actions.

54
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:44,435
It's not easy

55
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:45,596
to make Fangfeng Yiying

56
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:46,720
cancel the engagement willingly.

57
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,792
But to force her to have no choice
but to break off the engagement

58
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:50,752
is not difficult.

59
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,355
I understand what you mean.

60
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:57,075
As long as we disregard her life,

61
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,555
there are ways to force her family
to cancel the engagement,

62
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:02,915
even if it means
killing Fangfeng Yiying.

63
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:05,476
Then the engagement
would naturally be dissolved.

64
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:08,915
But what I want

65
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:10,876
is someone who can be with me for life.

66
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,676
Only a person with a kind nature

67
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,876
would possibly be kind to me.

68
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:17,955
Even if in the future,

69
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:19,395
I become less good,

70
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,395
he can still tolerate and understand me.

71
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,796
Some people may be

72
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:25,835
ruthless and decisive,

73
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,636
but only towards outsiders.

74
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:29,995
I don't buy it.

75
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:31,516
A ruthless person

76
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:32,672
would make an exception for me?

77
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:33,876
I'm not that narcissistic,

78
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,476
nor do I have such strong confidence.

79
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,395
Why would they?

80
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:44,555
Of course,

81
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:45,835
except for you.

82
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:47,316
You are the best to me.

83
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:48,636
Xuan.

84
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:50,155
Alright.

85
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:52,395
Go ahead.

86
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:53,995
Come back early.

87
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:55,616
Then I'll be going.

88
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:23,196
Jing.

89
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:37,920
- Xiaoyao...
- There's something...

90
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:41,440
You go first.

91
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,632
The relationship between your Family
and the Central Plains' clans

92
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:46,395
has always been close.

93
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:48,576
Could you speak
something nice about Cang Xuan

94
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:49,756
in front of them?

95
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:51,235
I stayed in Zhiyi

96
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:53,216
just to find ways
to help Cang Xuan turn things around.

97
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:55,115
The attitude of my uncle, Chief Shen,

98
00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:55,835
has softened.

99
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:57,155
For the other clans,

100
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,880
it's hard to change their minds
in a short time.

101
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:00,756
But I will work harder.

102
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:02,596
It's okay.

103
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,160
Being able to change
the Shen Family's attitude

104
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,916
is already good.

105
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:06,356
Thank you, Jing.

106
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:09,916
Xiaoyao,

107
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:10,835
I...

108
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:19,916
I didn't expect

109
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:21,516
that you had done

110
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,555
so much for me in the dark.

111
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:24,995
Jing,

112
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:26,235
you are really nice.

113
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:29,516
Actually,

114
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:32,756
I'm not as nice as you think.

115
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,955
If you're not nice,

116
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,196
then there are no nice people
in the world.

117
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:45,636
Xiaoyao,

118
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:47,596
- I...
- Princess,

119
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:48,835
the medicine box is ready.

120
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:54,876
Then let's set off to Qingqiu Hill.

121
00:06:58,715 --> 00:06:59,155
Okay.

122
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,728
I've heard that
there's nothing wrong with the accounts,

123
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,995
and there is already someone

124
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:04,916
defending Cang Xuan
in front of His Majesty at the court.

125
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:05,955
It's Yinglong,

126
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:07,995
that stubborn old man.

127
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:10,275
I'll settle scores with him

128
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,395
after I take down Cang Xuan.

129
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:15,715
Your Highness,

130
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,024
Fan Zhang seeks an audience,

131
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,636
saying he has a secret about Cang Xuan

132
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:21,216
and wants to report it
to Your Highness alone.

133
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:22,196
A secret?

134
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:24,555
That's worth hearing.

135
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:29,596
Everything you've said

136
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,196
is true?

137
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:33,596
Absolutely true.

138
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:34,596
There's no falsehood.

139
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,115
If Your Highness doesn't believe me,

140
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:37,504
you could send someone to check with me.

141
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:38,656
No need to send anyone.

142
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:40,555
I'll go myself.

143
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
(Tushan Mansion)

144
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:19,555
I made it.

145
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:22,516
This longevity poisonous bug

146
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:24,316
can't cure your illness,

147
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:26,835
but it can extend your life
by two to three years.

148
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:29,596
Grandma,

149
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:31,435
how do you feel?

150
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:35,636
Much better.

151
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,156
Much better.

152
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:44,956
Thank you, Princess.

153
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,196
Grand Madam, you're welcome.

154
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:47,475
Miss.

155
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:48,864
Miss, what's wrong with you?

156
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:49,475
What's wrong?

157
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,076
I'm fine.

158
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:56,076
Maybe I didn't
get a good rest last night.

159
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:58,316
I'm a little dizzy.

160
00:08:58,915 --> 00:08:59,516
Miss.

161
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:02,115
Princess, could you take a look?

162
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:31,995
Princess,

163
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:34,235
how is

164
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:35,876
my health?

165
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:48,276
Miss Fangfeng,

166
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:50,995
you're pregnant.

167
00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:56,876
Grandma,

168
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:57,915
it's not Jing's fault.

169
00:09:57,915 --> 00:09:59,316
It's all because of me.

170
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:00,595
Please don't blame Jing.

171
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:01,516
Grandma.

172
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:04,595
You're having Jing's baby.

173
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:07,115
You are a great benefactor
to our Tushan family.

174
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:08,595
What's wrong with that?

175
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,156
I can die without regret.

176
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,636
I can die without regret then.

177
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:16,716
Grandma.

178
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,355
(I'll believe you)

179
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:20,160
(as long as you shake your head.)

180
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,076
(Tushan Jing,)

181
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,196
(deny it.)

182
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,316
Princess, I won't fight for anything.

183
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:39,555
I can't fight either.

184
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:42,396
I just hope I could
deliver the child safely.

185
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:44,636
I beg for your mercy, Your Highness.

186
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:54,595
Why do you beg me

187
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,675
when you give birth to a child?

188
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:02,355
What are you talking about?

189
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:02,675
Grandma.

190
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:04,516
The child you have

191
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:07,115
is the legitimate eldest grandson
of our Tushan family.

192
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:08,675
Of course, you must deliver it.

193
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:10,716
Princess,

194
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:14,115
can my child

195
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:15,836
be born safely?

196
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:20,235
Your pulse is stable,

197
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:22,035
free from illness and pain.

198
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:24,675
Pay attention in daily life.

199
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,995
Both you and the child
will naturally be safe.

200
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:31,475
Thank you, Princess.

201
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,636
Congratulations, Grand Madam.

202
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:35,072
Congratulations, Grandma.

203
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:36,316
Same to you.

204
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:37,716
Jing.

205
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:38,836
Come back.

206
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:44,675
Xiaoyao,

207
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:45,995
I...

208
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:50,475
Go ahead.

209
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:52,276
I'm listening.

210
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,595
One night more than three months ago

211
00:12:56,995 --> 00:12:58,915
Fangfeng Yiying tried to commit suicide.

212
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,456
Grandma asked me to guard her.

213
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,196
Jing.

214
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:38,396
I just want to be your wife.

215
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:39,995
If I am still wrong,

216
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:41,795
then you just kill me.

217
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,516
You must be inflicted by

218
00:13:57,675 --> 00:13:58,995
a drug that makes you confused

219
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:00,995
and stimulates your lust.

220
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:04,320
But you've been
studying medicine with me

221
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,316
for so many years.

222
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:07,555
How could you easily

223
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,196
fall for Fangfeng Yiying's drug?

224
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,915
It was Grandma who gave me the drug.

225
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:24,836
I am done.

226
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:26,784
Grandma, you shall go back and rest.

227
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:28,435
Leave the rest to me.

228
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,475
When Miss Fangfeng wakes up,

229
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:32,595
I'll give her the soup.

230
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:34,956
Okay.

231
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:40,915
So it was Grand Madam.

232
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:43,756
Xiaoyao,

233
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:47,836
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:00,196
I don't hate you.

235
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,636
But between you and me,

236
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:05,555
the relationship ends here.

237
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:10,115
From now on, we are strangers.

Xiaoyao.

256
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,355
You're finally back.

257
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,636
Xuan has been busy these days.

258
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:02,048
I asked him if there was anything

259
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,196
I could help with,

260
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:04,636
but he always treated me like a child

261
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:05,876
and brushed me off.

262
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:06,595
Xiaoyao,

263
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:08,195
why don't you go ask Xuan?

264
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:09,436
Even if we can't help,

265
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:10,676
our father can.

266
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:11,916
Xiaoyao.

267
00:17:13,396 --> 00:17:14,315
Xiaoyao,

268
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:15,916
please help me.

269
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,195
Can you go ask him?

270
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:17,916
Xiaoyao.

271
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:19,556
- Xiaoyao.
- Nian, let go of her.

272
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:21,556
Xiaoyao.

273
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:23,835
Xiaoyao.

274
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,115
Bring Yin over.

275
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:27,595
Xiaoyao,

276
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:29,315
don't scare me.

277
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,756
Help!

278
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:36,676
Xiaoyao.

279
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:53,115
Princess was overly heartbroken suddenly

280
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:54,436
but didn't vent

281
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:55,636
the emotions.

282
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:57,995
Instead she suppressed them
and injured her heart meridian.

283
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,036
The blood she just spat out
is from stagnation at the heart.

284
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:01,600
It's actually beneficial to spit it out.

285
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:02,835
During this period,

286
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:04,355
Princess must rest and keep calm.

287
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,115
She should not have
any extreme emotions.

288
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:07,355
I see.

289
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:09,636
I will take my leave.

290
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:18,156
Yes.

291
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:29,636
Xiaoyao,

292
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:31,556
what happened to you

293
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:33,796
that could make someone like you so sad?

294
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:35,676
Someone like me?

295
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:41,475
You make it sound like
I don't have a heart.

296
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:44,516
Now in this room,

297
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:46,075
only the three of us siblings are here.

298
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:48,315
If you can't laugh,

299
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,796
then don't force a smile for others.

300
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:54,075
It's not about smiling for others.

301
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:56,876
I just got used to it.

302
00:18:58,556 --> 00:18:59,995
I can't cry.

303
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:04,756
Anyway, whether I'm laughing or crying,

304
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:07,315
I have to face each day.

305
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:10,156
I might as well face it with a smile.

306
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:13,676
I've already lost.

307
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:15,676
I can't

308
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,876
lose my dignity.

309
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,835
In front of me,

310
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:38,115
you could cry or smile

311
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:40,075
as you wish.

312
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:42,756
I'll be fine after some sleep.

313
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,436
You don't need to stay with me.

314
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:48,036
Leave.

315
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:33,396
Take away all these wild flowers.

316
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,676
Replace them with Poinciana flowers.

317
00:20:37,115 --> 00:20:37,796
Yes.

318
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:40,436
From now on,

319
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,835
anything related to the Tushan Family

320
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,916
is not allowed in the Zijin Palace.

321
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:48,036
Yes.

322
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:50,835
In the future, once I see it,

323
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,075
I will throw it away immediately.

324
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:35,595
You still have a fever.

325
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:39,235
But Yin said
your constitution is unique,

326
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,876
so don't rush to take medicine.

327
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:43,916
The most important thing
is to keep calm.

328
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:46,048
Don't act rashly out of joy or anger.

329
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:48,436
Why are you staying with me?

330
00:21:50,835 --> 00:21:52,075
Is there no maid

331
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,916
in the Zijin Palace?

332
00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:56,396
How could I rest easy?

333
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:03,235
I'm fine.

334
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,156
What haven't I experienced
since I was a child?

335
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:09,796
Am I really going to
take drastic action

336
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:10,876
for a man?

337
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:13,436
Yeah, you're fine.

338
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,955
The one who's sick, feverish,
and vomiting blood isn't you.

339
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:16,835
It's someone else.

340
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:20,276
It's not as serious as you think.

341
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:22,396
It's not a big deal.

342
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:24,756
It'll be fine in a few days.

343
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:29,036
Many times,

344
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:30,676
I've told myself over and over

345
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:34,475
that it's not a big deal.

346
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,235
Mother's suicide

347
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:43,355
is not a big deal.

348
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,516
After all, everyone's mother

349
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:50,315
will die sooner or later.

350
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:55,075
Having to leave Zhaoyun Peak for Haoling

351
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,475
is not a big deal.

352
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,235
After all, every man must venture out

353
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:03,715
into the world after growing up.

354
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:07,876
I just did it a little earlier.

355
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:11,436
Uncles want to kill me

356
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:16,036
and it's not a big deal.

357
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:21,315
After all, every family
has malicious relatives.

358
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:25,436
Xuan,

359
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:35,796
don't be sad.

360
00:23:39,276 --> 00:23:41,516
There are plenty of men in this world

361
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:43,232
who are better than Tushan Jing.

362
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,796
I'm not grieved because of him.

363
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,075
Have a good rest.

364
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:15,036
Didn't you say it too?

365
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,036
It'll be fine in a few days.

366
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:20,156
Once you're better,

367
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:23,796
I'll take you and Nian

368
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:25,756
to travel down the mountain.

369
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:05,276
Xuan,

370
00:25:11,796 --> 00:25:13,276
don't leave me.

371
00:25:15,276 --> 00:25:16,676
I won't leave you.

372
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:20,595
I will always stay with you.

373
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:35,315
Your Highness,

374
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:37,440
the congratulatory gift
has been sent to Qingqiu.

375
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:41,916
For the wedding of Chief Tushan,

376
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:44,796
it may be not good for you
not to attend in person.

377
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:46,636
At this critical juncture,

378
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:48,835
you need the support
of the Central Plains' clans.

379
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,432
You shouldn't alienate
the Tushan Family.

380
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:51,595
Good point.

381
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:54,636
I know I should go.

382
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:58,276
But Tushan Jing hurt Xiaoyao.

383
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:00,355
No matter how much I need his help,

384
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:02,144
I can't bring myself to be nice to him.

385
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:02,876
Your Highness,

386
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:04,756
you shouldn't be so irrational.

387
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:05,715
I'm being very rational.

388
00:27:06,075 --> 00:27:07,595
They bullied Xiaoyao like that.

389
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:08,676
If I were irrational,

390
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:10,595
I would have rushed
to Qingqiu Hill long ago,

391
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:11,744
and turned the wedding

392
00:27:12,516 --> 00:27:13,516
into a funeral.

393
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:14,916
Your Highness.

394
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:16,995
As a man, why are you so garrulous?

395
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:18,556
His Highness won't go if he says so.

396
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:19,595
Leave now.

397
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:21,276
Why are you pushing me?

398
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:22,368
Good advice is harsh to the ear.

399
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:23,556
I'm doing it for His Highness.

400
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:25,355
Doesn't he understand
the principles you know?

401
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:30,475
His Highness knows them
better than anyone.

402
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:32,556
But he and Princess
only have each other.

403
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:33,636
People

404
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:36,195
always need to
have some guts to look human.

424
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:56,355
Is this where Cang Xuan
hides his troops?

425
00:29:56,576 --> 00:29:58,326
(Chenrong Mountain Cemetery )
Yes, this should be

426
00:29:58,326 --> 00:29:59,436
where Cang Xuan hides his troops.

427
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:00,355
Are you sure?

428
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:02,436
Behind this is
the King of Chenrong's tomb.

429
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:03,636
If you're wrong,

430
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:05,888
it's hard to explain it
to the Central Plains.

431
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:07,516
There's no mistake.

432
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,516
If there were no secrets here,

433
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,432
why would they set up

434
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:11,796
such a hidden formation?

435
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:12,436
Great.

436
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:14,944
Call for experts in breaking formations

437
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,036
to break it.

438
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:36,955
Where are you going, Princess?

439
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,075
You're still sick.

440
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:16,995
This is the Tomb of King of Chenrong.

441
00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:19,200
You think the Central Plains
has no manpower?

442
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:22,835
So, are you guilty?

443
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,995
Your Lordship and all the clan leaders,

444
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:27,835
I invited you here today

445
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:29,995
to make a witness.

446
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:34,715
Your Highness,

447
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,128
they're about to break the formation.

448
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,235
Everyone, just wait and watch the show.

449
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:01,516
Yue Liang, have them stop
breaking the formation.

450
00:32:01,715 --> 00:32:04,096
If you knew this day would come,
why did you do it in the first place,

451
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,156
Cang Xuan?

452
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:14,595
Your Lordship.

453
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:16,032
Esteemed clan leaders.

454
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,176
Please follow me inside to take a look.

455
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:27,235
Your Highness,

456
00:32:27,835 --> 00:32:29,156
aside from the altar,

457
00:32:29,796 --> 00:32:30,715
there's nothing else here.

458
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:34,715
Impossible.

459
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:36,595
It's impossible.

460
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:44,224
(Memorial Tablet of Chenrong Yanzhuan)

461
00:33:14,556 --> 00:33:16,195
Since Your Highness
has already discovered this,

462
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:17,715
I won't hide it anymore.

463
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:19,475
Yes,

464
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:21,556
this is where I secretly

465
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:22,556
worshipped my grandfather.

466
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:24,756
My grandfather, Chenrong Yanzhuan,

467
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,115
died in battle at Mount Xun,

468
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:28,995
but his body was lost
and he didn't even have a grave.

469
00:33:30,436 --> 00:33:31,556
I was heartbroken,

470
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,752
so I secretly built this altar
in this royal tomb to worship him,

471
00:33:36,036 --> 00:33:38,195
without telling anyone.

472
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:42,752
I will confess my guilt and
accept punishment from King of Xiyan.

473
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:54,276
(Chenrong Yi)
My son worshipped our ancestor privately.

474
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:56,355
He was wrong.

475
00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:58,195
I will write to His Majesty
to confess our guilt.

476
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,276
However His Majesty
decides to deal with it,

477
00:34:00,796 --> 00:34:01,955
I am willing to accept.

478
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:03,916
But, Your Highness,

479
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:06,075
shouldn't you also

480
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:08,035
give an explanation

481
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,496
for intruding into
King of Chenrong's tomb?

482
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:11,115
Right.

483
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:13,075
Your Highness must
give us an explanation.

484
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,676
If Your Highness can't explain,

485
00:34:17,236 --> 00:34:18,355
we will have to petition

486
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:20,236
the King of Xiyan to make a judgment.

487
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:22,956
Right. Right.

488
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:53,755
Your Highness.

489
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:55,396
Your Highness, I...

490
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:57,555
It's all thanks to you.

491
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:40,196
I'm sorry.

492
00:35:40,876 --> 00:35:42,196
I didn't know that was your strategy.

493
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:44,396
I almost ruined your plan.

494
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:47,396
If it wasn't my strategy,

495
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,555
could you shoot Yue Liang?

496
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,008
Do you know the consequences of
killing Prince of Xiyan?

497
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:02,835
Of course I know the consequences.

498
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:05,515
Right,

499
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:06,496
and you still dared to do it?

500
00:36:06,996 --> 00:36:08,196
But I can't bear

501
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:09,632
the consequences of
losing you even more.

502
00:36:11,555 --> 00:36:12,275
Xiaoyao,

503
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:25,996
you will never lose me.

504
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:32,396
I know.

505
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:34,996
You are already powerful now.

506
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:37,315
No matter what happens,

507
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:39,075
you can protect yourself now.

508
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:23,876
Your Highness.

509
00:37:33,236 --> 00:37:33,795
Your Highness.

510
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,088
Yue Liang has written a suggestion,
saying that the Daming Palace collapsed

511
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,315
because you neglected your duties.

512
00:37:38,315 --> 00:37:39,636
He asked to relieve you of your duties,

513
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:41,636
and appoint someone else to take over
Chenrong Mountain.

514
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:44,595
Yue Liang is quite smart.

515
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,904
He knows the Central Plains' clans
are dissatisfied with him,

516
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,344
but they are also dissatisfied with me.

517
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:51,328
He himself has no hope of
staying in the Central Plains,

518
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:53,436
but he also doesn't want me here.

519
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:54,396
Your Highness,

520
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:55,636
Yue Liang still has Xiyan Mountain

521
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:56,676
if he leaves the Central Plains.

522
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:57,515
But you have nothing else

523
00:37:57,515 --> 00:37:58,636
apart from Chenrong Mountain.

524
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:00,396
Your Highness,

525
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:02,035
you must not return to Xiyan Town.

526
00:38:02,636 --> 00:38:04,000
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

527
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:11,236
Cang Xuan,

528
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:19,196
I came up with a good way for you

529
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,795
to stay in Central Plains successfully.

530
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:22,436
Look what's in the box.

531
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:41,636
These are notes left by
the former kings of Chenrong?

532
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:42,196
That's right.

533
00:38:42,876 --> 00:38:43,996
The whole box of notes

534
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:45,275
was transcribed for you by Xinyue.

535
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:50,315
Are those something
Xinyue asked you to bring here

536
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:52,035
or did you secretly bring them yourself?

537
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:53,824
What do you mean
by "I secretly brought them"?

538
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:55,476
She was thin-skinned

539
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:56,315
and shy,

540
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:58,176
so I took the initiative
to bring them over for her.

541
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:06,835
These are the kings of Chenrong's notes.

542
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:08,035
Such a valuable gift

543
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:10,315
should be sent out at the right timing.

544
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:12,075
As long as you marry Xinyue,

545
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:14,035
for the Central Plains' clans,

546
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:15,275
you will be one of them.

547
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,956
Not only will they stop
nitpicking at you

548
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:18,555
for the collapse of the Daming Hall,

549
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:20,515
but also appeal to King of Xiyan
on your behalf.

550
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:22,595
Did you discuss this with Xinyue?

551
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:23,676
Do I need to?

552
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:24,996
Aren't her feelings for you

553
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,275
obvious?

554
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,275
It is not a trivial matter.

555
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:49,156
You should ask Xinyue's opinion first.

556
00:39:50,636 --> 00:39:51,515
You don't need to say it.

557
00:39:51,876 --> 00:39:52,795
At this time,

558
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:55,595
I won't marry Cang Xuan no matter what.

559
00:39:55,996 --> 00:39:56,636
Why?

560
00:39:57,156 --> 00:39:58,396
Don't you like Cang Xuan?

561
00:39:58,912 --> 00:40:00,640
Back then, no amount of persuasion
could deter you.

562
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:01,795
Now, Cang Xuan

563
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:02,916
is in need of help.

564
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:05,115
Yes.

565
00:40:06,315 --> 00:40:07,515
I do like him.

566
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:08,476
But

567
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:11,115
for people of our status,

568
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:12,595
does liking matter?

569
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:14,956
You know the situation

570
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:16,075
he is in now.

571
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:17,035
Let alone

572
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:18,848
the faint hope of
ascending to the throne of Xiyan,

573
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:20,835
he can't even stay
in the Central Plains.

574
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:22,636
By then,

575
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:24,436
he will be like a street dog,

576
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:25,196
with nothing.

577
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:26,515
What should I do?

578
00:40:27,156 --> 00:40:27,716
Follow him

579
00:40:28,236 --> 00:40:29,476
and become a street dog

580
00:40:29,476 --> 00:40:30,476
with nothing?

581
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,355
As long as you are willing to help him,

582
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:34,196
he can stay in the Central Plains

583
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:35,075
and turn the tide.

584
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:35,916
Xinyue,

585
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,355
you can't just reap without sowing,

586
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,795
and not take any risks.

587
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:41,676
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

588
00:40:42,716 --> 00:40:43,876
What is he to me?

589
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,275
What has he done for me?

590
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:47,716
Why should I take risks for him?

591
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:48,835
Anyway,

592
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,156
marry him themselves if they want.

593
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:53,355
I will definitely not do so.

594
00:41:04,156 --> 00:41:04,755
Cang Xuan.

595
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:05,636
Fenglong,

596
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:07,876
I've carefully considered your proposal.

597
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:10,236
But now I can hardly protect myself,

598
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,196
so I'm not a good match for Xinyue.

599
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:14,156
Let's forget about

600
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:15,595
the marriage.

601
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:18,515
But I appreciate

602
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:20,835
your good intentions.

603
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:37,396
Cang Xuan,

604
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,275
about the marriage proposal,

605
00:41:39,595 --> 00:41:40,716
I have another suggestion.

606
00:41:49,196 --> 00:41:49,716
Pretty.

607
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:52,115
The lotus Princess conjured
is so pretty.

608
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:55,275
How can there be
only a flower but no leaves?

609
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:57,636
It would be better
to conjure a few more lotus leaves,

610
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:00,275
and some lotus pods.

611
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:01,716
That would be lively and interesting.

612
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:03,355
Why are you so hard to please?

613
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,992
Don't want to conjure them for me?

614
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:07,196
Alright then.

615
00:42:07,676 --> 00:42:09,024
You can continue to play chess with me.

616
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,555
With your poor chess skills,

617
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:12,716
I'd rather conjure
lotus leaves and pods for you.

618
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:14,996
You are so annoying.

619
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:16,996
If it weren't for you
being Great Princess,

620
00:42:17,115 --> 00:42:18,075
and having Father's favor,

621
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:20,115
you would be annoying wherever you go.

622
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:21,555
Yeah, yeah.

623
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:23,555
Unfortunately, there are no ifs.

624
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:25,075
I am the Great Princess of Haoling.

625
00:42:25,315 --> 00:42:26,795
I am loved by Father.

626
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:31,396
Your Highness,

627
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,115
this is what General Yinglong

628
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:34,115
asked me to deliver to you.

629
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:38,996
(Your Highness,)

630
00:42:39,396 --> 00:42:41,716
(I have heard about the rumors of)

631
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,392
(Princess Jiuyao's birth,)

632
00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:45,248
(but I don't know about)

633
00:42:45,835 --> 00:42:46,835
(the details.)

634
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:48,595
(However,)

635
00:42:48,956 --> 00:42:50,315
(back then, Princess General)

636
00:42:50,595 --> 00:42:52,676
(did have mutual affections
with Chi Chen.)

637
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,355
(Princess General)

638
00:42:54,476 --> 00:42:56,256
(admitted in front of
all the generals and soldiers)

639
00:42:56,355 --> 00:42:58,835
(that she fell for Chi Chen.)

640
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:02,396
What if I don't accept it?

641
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:03,396
Hold it back if you don't.

642
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:16,916
Let me check this lotus pod.

643
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:22,196
Why is this fake?

644
00:43:22,396 --> 00:43:23,555
It's not edible.

645
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:24,956
Are you stupid?

646
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:26,035
Of course it's fake.

647
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,716
Great, you naughty girl.

648
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:29,075
You're the only one in the world

649
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:30,144
who dares to be so rude to me.

650
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:32,436
Give it back.

651
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:33,196
No.

652
00:43:33,355 --> 00:43:33,956
Give it back.

653
00:43:34,035 --> 00:43:34,676
Why?

654
00:43:34,676 --> 00:43:35,835
This is what you just gave me.

655
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:36,595
Give it to me.

656
00:43:36,835 --> 00:43:37,555
Come and get it.

657
00:43:37,568 --> 00:43:38,115
Come and get it.

658
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,075
Can't reach it, huh?

659
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:42,115
(If one day,)

660
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:43,396
(the rumor becomes true)

661
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:46,115
(that Xiaoyao is Chi Chen's daughter,)

662
00:43:47,515 --> 00:43:48,795
(then besides me,)

663
00:43:49,632 --> 00:43:51,488
(I'm afraid no one else
in the world can protect her.)

664
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:54,876
(Xiaoyao,)

665
00:43:56,315 --> 00:43:58,595
(you can't bear
the consequences of losing me.)

666
00:43:59,795 --> 00:44:00,515
(Same for me.)

667
00:44:02,396 --> 00:44:03,795
(As long as you live well)

668
00:44:04,795 --> 00:44:05,835
(and happily,)

669
00:44:07,115 --> 00:44:07,636
(the rest)

670
00:44:09,075 --> 00:44:10,035
