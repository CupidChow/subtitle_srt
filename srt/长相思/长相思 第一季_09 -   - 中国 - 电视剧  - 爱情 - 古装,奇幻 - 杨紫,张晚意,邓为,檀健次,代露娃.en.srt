=Episode 9=

3
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:48,626
Unbelievable. She fell asleep.

4
00:01:59,026 --> 00:01:59,785
How are you doing?

5
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,666
You alright?

6
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:03,225
Do you need to treat injuries?

7
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,106
I'll do it when this is over.

8
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:12,145
Once Xuan gives the medicine
to your men,

9
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,466
I'll take Nian back.

10
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:15,386
You can find a place
to cure your injuries then.

11
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:19,585
Do you know Xuan's real identity?

12
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:24,065
I could even smell the money off him.

13
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:27,106
But he doesn't seem like a man
from a prominent family.

14
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:29,466
He looks powerful.

15
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:32,546
And it requires substantial financial
and material support.

16
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:35,425
Only a wealthy family can achieve it.

17
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,186
I might have guessed.

18
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:39,906
What is it?

19
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:42,785
I still need to confirm it.

20
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,225
If I guess right,

21
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:49,785
you'll be probably in danger.

22
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,106
Why is that?

23
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,106
I heard he's very protective
of his family.

24
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:57,266
You kidnapped his sister.

25
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:59,145
And it's unforgivable.

26
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,705
He definitely wants to kill you.

27
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:03,826
I dragged you into this trouble.

28
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:05,865
Before I can get rid of him,

29
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,145
you stay with me.

30
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:11,425
No need.

31
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,106
You don't believe me?

32
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,386
I do.

33
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:19,266
I believe you, really.

34
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,186
But you think I am the kind of person

35
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:22,546
who hides behind others,

36
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:24,225
waiting for the danger to pass?

37
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:27,505
As you wish.

38
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:28,946
But,

39
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,546
don't get yourself killed.

40
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:49,985
My men have received
the medicinal materials

41
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,065
and have safely retreated.

42
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:53,746
Alright.

43
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,145
Then I'll take her back.

44
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,906
Let's part ways here.

45
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,186
We might meet again if possible.

46
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,505
If not, just forget about me.

47
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,425
What I want is your blood,

48
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:10,186
not you.

49
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:17,426
Come on.

50
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:19,946
You lowly person.

51
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,185
Xuan will never let you off.

52
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:23,305
You'll be dead.

53
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,866
You've made me kind of scared
of your brother.

54
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:30,785
Now it's too late.

55
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:45,185
Come here.

56
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:47,225
Move.

57
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:51,225
Sit.

58
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:58,225
W-What are you going to do?

59
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,986
W-What did you feed me?

60
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,266
Poison.

61
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:20,546
You have a poison-avoiding bead
with you.

62
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:23,225
But I bet you don't have one
inside your body, do you?

63
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,826
How dare you!

64
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:31,946
Back off.

65
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:34,386
Come here.

66
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:38,785
I don't believe in your blood,

67
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,225
you have a poison-avoiding bead.

68
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,065
Xuan.

69
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:46,666
Xuan will definitely detoxify me.

70
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:49,345
Considering what you just said,

71
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:50,866
I should poison you with another type.

72
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:53,546
Your spirit power
has ice attribute, right?

73
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:54,866
Tell me.

74
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:57,905
Which acupuncture point

75
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,465
is tricky?

76
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:10,465
Let me see.

77
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,586
Which one?

78
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,586
Which one?

79
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:18,946
I'll cut off your hand.

80
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:20,546
I will kill you.

81
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:22,745
I will kill you.

82
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:25,905
Alright, let's go.

83
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:28,426
If your cousin wants to kill me,

84
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:29,706
you will die with me.

85
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:32,465
What?

86
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,505
Do you want me

87
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,986
to find an acupuncture point
on your chest?

88
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:54,465
Come on.

89
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:56,946
Come on.

90
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:57,946
Don't cry.

91
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,505
Otherwise, I'll hit you.

92
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,266
Come on. Stop crying.

93
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:27,025
It's all right.

94
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,146
You're safe now.

95
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:32,185
I'm here.

96
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,465
I'm here. It's alright.

97
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:56,866
Xuan.

98
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,065
Take him back.

99
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,176
Nian.

100
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:13,248
What did Wen Xiaoliu do to you?

101
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,360
Are you feeling unwell?

102
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:18,546
He pricked me with a hairpin.

103
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,185
And he poisoned me.

104
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:22,065
Get the physician Wucheng.

105
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,225
Yes.

106
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:26,866
Where did he prick you?

107
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:28,025
What poison?

108
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:32,665
Tell me how he poisoned you.

109
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:40,992
I am sorry.

110
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:43,065
I didn't protect you well.

111
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:46,505
My Lord.

112
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:49,826
Wen Xiaoliu has admitted it.

113
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:51,545
But he refuses to give the antidote.

114
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,706
Please advise on how to deal with him.

115
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:56,386
Get the most experienced interrogator.

116
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:58,865
Just leave Wen Xiaoliu alive.

117
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,706
Understood.

118
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:12,065
His Lordship said to leave him alive.

119
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,946
It means we can do anything to him

120
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,906
as long as we don't kill him.

121
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:21,425
Where should we start?

122
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:25,185
Start with his hands.

123
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,906
So he can never poison anyone again.

124
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:31,346
Okay.

125
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:41,105
There are maggots in this box.

126
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:43,586
They love dead human flesh.

127
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:46,266
I'm smearing the corpse oil
on your hands

128
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,105
to tell them that your hands are edible.

129
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,586
You'll be in excruciating pain.

130
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:58,105
Someone once tried

131
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:02,946
to bite off their wrists
to get rid of the pain.

132
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:18,425
We should put out this lamp.

133
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,946
Yes, he will feel it more in the dark.

134
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:23,946
And his pain will get worse.

135
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:27,786
Guess what? We did the same to someone.

136
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,586
That person went mad.

137
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:30,946

191
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,976
♪I only have eyes for you♪

192
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:14,464
♪I'm willing to spend the rest
of my life with you♪

193
00:14:58,745 --> 00:14:59,906
Master Qingqiu.

194
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:02,386
Heard a lot about you.

195
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:04,745
What can I do

196
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,985
for you?

197
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:10,985
I want you to get Wen Xiaoliu out.

198
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,665
I once asked him to go with me,

199
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,386
but he refused.

200
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:20,466
Let him suffer a bit.

201
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm not here to beg you to save him.

202
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,536
I'm here to make a deal with you.

203
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,786
As long as you help me with it,

204
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,865
you can name your price.

205
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:35,456
You're very generous.

206
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,665
What if I ask a fortune for that?

207
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,146
Whether or not
you take the deal is up to you.

208
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,065
Whether or not
I can afford the reward is up to me.

209
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:47,305
As far as I know,
you never turn down money.

210
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:48,665
You're right.

211
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:51,826
I never turn down money.

212
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:53,906
However,

213
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,586
even if I need a reward,

214
00:15:58,146 --> 00:15:59,745
Wen Xiaoliu should pay me.

215
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:05,266
What are you to Wen Xiaoliu?

216
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,065
Master Qingqiu.

217
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,625
I'm responsible for killing,
and you're for saving.

218
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,784
Salt,

219
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:32,745
cooking wine,

220
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,665
and onions and ginger.

221
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,586
Roast the fish belly.

222
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,466
It seems like he's reciting a recipe.

223
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,146
Why is that?

224
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:43,985
Are the maggots not working?

225
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:49,226
There's nothing wrong with them.

226
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:53,826
He's a tough man.

227
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:18,185
Shiqi.

228
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:19,905
Yes.

229
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:23,545
Window.

230
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:52,185
The injury is a bit severe.

231
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:54,946
Does it hurt?

232
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,905
No, the medicine is working.

233
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:04,226
Take it.

234
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:19,785
Are we in the Chenrong Army?

235
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:23,905
Yes, I asked Xiang Liu for help.

236
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:26,746
I sneaked into the dungeon to save you,
while he led a raid on Xuan.

237
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:33,305
You didn't have to.

238
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:34,946
I knew how to escape.

239
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,065
I will return to Qingshui Town later.

240
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:40,665
You give me the antidote.

241
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,226
I will end your feud with them.

242
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:46,025
I didn't poison Nian.

243
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:47,626
As I know about her,

244
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,986
she can get a good physician.

245
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:52,706
No matter how I poison her,

246
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,145
she could probably be cured.

247
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,665
So, I just deceived her.

248
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:59,226
Xuan cares about her very much.

249
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,746
If his physician
can't figure out the poison,

250
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:03,665
he will become more worried.

251
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:07,145
So, Xuan will make me alive.

252
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:12,905
But it's just a short-term solution.

253
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:15,826
So, I didn't poison Nian.

254
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:18,265
But I did it to Xuan.

255
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:20,986
What poison?

256
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:23,905
To be precise,

257
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:29,586
it's not poison but a poisonous bug.

258
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:31,106
A poisonous bug?

259
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:33,226
In short,

260
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:35,826
I've planted a poisonous bug in my body.

261
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,305
And another one

262
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:38,946
has already integrated into Xuan's body.

263
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,826
From now on, whenever my body hurts,

264
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,185
he will endure the same pain.

265
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,665
It must be difficult to raise it, right?

266
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:52,466
Of course, it's very hard.

267
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:56,145
Why did you raise it?

268
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:00,746
To control Xiang Liu.

269
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:03,025
That nine-headed demon practices

270
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:05,506
with poison
and is immune to all sorts of toxins.

271
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,785
I racked my brains
thinking of this method.

272
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,346
Unexpectedly, I planted it in Xuan,

273
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:12,025
not in him.

274
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,488
Will it harm your body?

275
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,106
No.

276
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:18,144
Are you sure?

277
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:19,866
I guarantee it with my life.

278
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:21,856
Don't talk nonsense.

279
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:32,866
How many days have passed
since I was captured?

280
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:34,304
Four days.

281
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:37,506
It's almost time.

282
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:39,385
No need for painkillers anymore.

283
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:42,946
Xiaoliu, leave your matter
with Xuan to me.

284
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:45,586
Xiang Liu warned me a long time ago.

285
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:47,626
He said Xuan would deal with me harshly

286
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:48,586
and asked me to follow him.

287
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:49,506
I refused.

288
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:51,905
If I were timid,

289
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:53,746
I wouldn't have taken you in.

290
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:56,545
I've been used to being alone

291
00:20:56,746 --> 00:20:58,905
and bearing everything by myself.

292
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:02,545
Since I dare to do it, I can face it.

293
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,626
You don't have to face it alone.

294
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:12,145
Master Qingqiu.

295
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:14,106
I saved your life,

296
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:15,226
and you saved mine.

297
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:17,506
We are even now.

298
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,586
That's it.

299
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:20,545
From now on,

300
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,425
don't bother yourself about my business.

301
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:03,866
How long have you been here?

302
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:06,626
I heard you planned
to plant a poisonous bug in me.

303
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:09,466
I didn't do it, did I?

304
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,065
I planted it in Xuan.

305
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:16,106
When will it work

306
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:17,986
in Xuan's body?

307
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:19,665
It's not time yet.

308
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:21,905
Anyway, since I planted it in him,

309
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:23,346
he could have a hard time.

310
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,905
You hurt his sister,

311
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:31,145
and planted a bug in him.

312
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:33,425
He won't let you off.

313
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:35,746
I hope he can't remove your bug easily,

314
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:38,145
so he will have some scruples about you.

315
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:42,425
The poisonous bug was prepared for you.

316
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:44,466
Only I can remove it in this world.

317
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:49,946
Go to sleep.
Heal your hands as soon as possible.

318
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:22,025
Eat more.

319
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:24,986
I can't eat anymore.

320
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,025
Xuan, I heard the lowly guy was rescued.

321
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:30,145
You must kill him to relieve my hatred.

322
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:31,665
Don't worry.

323
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,226
Xuan, what's wrong with you?

324
00:24:57,785 --> 00:24:59,265
Master Qingqiu.

325
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:02,746
Why do you look timid
when visiting a sick person?

326
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:12,986
Here are Guixu Crystal and chalcedony
from Mount Jade.

327
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:14,785
It can cure his injuries.

328
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:16,506
I'll bring more later.

329
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:19,905
See you.

330
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,480
Thanks for taking care of Xiaoliu.

331
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:30,305
I'll take Xiaoliu away

332
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,746
when things settle down.

333
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:35,065
That depends on

334
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:37,545
whether he is willing to go with you.

335
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:48,986
It hurts.

336
00:25:48,986 --> 00:25:49,826
It hurts.

337
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:54,866
It hurts.

338
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:01,185
I really sympathize
with those who tortured you.

339
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,545
They tortured you physically,

340
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,425
while you make them suffer mentally.

341
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:10,305
I regret planting
the poisonous bug in Xuan.

342
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,466
I should have done it in you

343
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:14,466
to let you suffer this piercing pain.

344
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:17,065
Luckily, you planted it in Xuan.

345
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,145
It works for him.

346
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:22,626
I'm a nine-headed demon.

347
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:25,626
It won't work for me
even if you're deadly in pain.

348
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:29,626
Are you ok...?

349
00:26:40,986 --> 00:26:44,305
Thanks to these, I feel I'm alive again.

350
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:46,545
This stuff really helps.

351
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:48,946
It hurts so much.

352
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:54,106
You can soak your hands
in this valuable stuff.

353
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:56,785
Can't you use some painkillers?

354
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:58,905
I won't even if I can.

355
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,746
Since I'm in pain,

356
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,626
I have to make Xuan suffer with me.

357
00:27:02,785 --> 00:27:04,226
Otherwise, I've suffered for nothing.

358
00:27:07,145 --> 00:27:08,425
You're in pain,

359
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:10,385
but you're asking for it.

360
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:13,706
Well,

361
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:15,425
I shouldn't talk to you.

362
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:31,626
It hurts.

363
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:39,346
You think you won?

364
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:41,586
You idiot.

365
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:58,826
What's wrong with his hand?

366
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,185
He has no external injuries.

367
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:03,946
And according to his pulse,
no internal sickness, either.

368
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:06,826
I'm afraid he's been poisoned,

369
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:09,265
so he's been painful.

370
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:10,706
What poison?

371
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,506
It must be Wen Xiaoliu.

372
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:14,466
I'll kill him when I catch him.

373
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:16,265
Can you remove this poison?

374
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:17,986
I...

375
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:23,946
Your Highness, don't worry. It's tricky,

376
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,626
but I can remove it.

377
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:28,586
That's good.

378
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:29,706
Nian.

379
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:33,145
I remember

380
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,425
Haitang brought a lot of medicines.

381
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:41,065
Go get some painkillers.

382
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:42,226
Okay.

383
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:47,586
Please forgive me.

384
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:49,025
I don't know this poison.

385
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,346
I really can't think of a solution.

386
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:53,946
Just do your best.

387
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:55,226
Yes.

388
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:04,385
My Lord, how do you feel?

389
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,545
The pain is gradually disappearing.

390
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:12,905
Looks like your medicine is effective.

391
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:15,626
That's good. I'll take my leave.

392
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:20,305
My Lord.

393
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:24,065
My Lord, we've found Wen Xiaoliu.

394
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:26,752
Good.

395
00:29:28,305 --> 00:29:31,185
I'll settle new and old scores with him.

396
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:47,265
Why is my heart beating so fast?

397
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:50,586
Poisonous bug.

398
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:52,425
Xiang Liu.

399
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:59,145
Xiang Liu, Xuan is coming.

400
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,025
I know.

401
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:05,986
Xuan is going to start a fight.

402
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:08,185
I also want to kill him.

403
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:12,185
It will be a fight to the death today.

404
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:18,025
Find a place to hide later.

405
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:21,185
No worries. I will.

406
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:22,946
Nine-headed demon.

407
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,506
Xuan would bring a lot of men.

408
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:28,506
Can you beat them?

409
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:30,986
If I don't kill him today,

410
00:30:33,185 --> 00:30:34,626
he will definitely kill me one day.

411
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:48,545
Xuan is here.

412
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:51,265
Nine-headed demon.

413
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:56,185
You must come back alive.

414
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:04,425
Get ready.

415
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:20,466
(What is Xuan really?)

416
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:22,706
(How can he
have so many deity subordinates?)

417
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:25,746
My target is Wen Xiaoliu, not you.

418
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:29,106
The Chenrong Army is collapsing.

419
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,826
Why do you have to step in?

420
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,425
I'm not protecting him.

421
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:35,346
I just want to kill you.

422
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:37,145
Let's see if you can.

423
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:32,544
Right hand.

424
00:33:39,826 --> 00:33:40,466
Left leg.

425
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,336
Anyway, you can't feel the pain, right?

426
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,226
Cang Xuan.

427
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:28,066
(The grandson of King of Xiyan,
game is over.)

428
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:37,026
I will bring you back
from Mount Jade as soon as possible.

429
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:37,865
Okay.

430
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:40,066
I'll wait for you.

431
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:41,865

432
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:23,345

Yes?

460
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:17,385
Is there any poison that can make
the poisoned person feel the pain

461
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:20,266
of the person who poisoned them?

462
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,185
Poison can't do this.

463
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:25,986
But the poisonous bug can.

464
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:28,345
Oh, I remember.

465
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:30,946
You're in pain without any wounds.

Your symptoms are consistent
with those being planted poisonous bugs.

467
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:35,026
How do we solve this?

468
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:40,506
My Lord.

469
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,105
I'm not proficient in that.

470
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:45,786
I can't think of a solution.

471
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:47,625
Aren't you a disciple
of the King of Chenrong?

472
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:49,105
Why don't you know how to solve it?

473
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:51,746
I'm sorry.

474
00:38:52,946 --> 00:38:54,746
Physicians don't learn this.

475

Be careful.

481
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:10,425
I see.

482
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,546
Wen Xiaoliu tried to plant this in me.

483
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:17,466
But he just saved me.

484
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:18,825
He must have an ulterior motive.

486
