00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,760
=Lost You Forever S1=

2
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,466
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:52,634
Grandpa, please.

4
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,130
I will protect Xiaoyao.

5
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,529
Cang Xuan.

6
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:01,410
With your current abilities,
you can't protect her at all.

7
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,690
Xiaoyao.

8
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,289
I'm not late, right?

9
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:16,890
No.

10
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,569
I arrived early.

11
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,370
You look troubled.

12
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,330
Is it about recruiting the army?

13
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,810
Didn't I tell you
to leave the rest to me?

14
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,530
I came here to tell you

15
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,810
that I'm going to Chishui

16
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,170
to bring you the best warriors.

17
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,730
You're leaving?

18
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,849
Why? What's wrong?

19
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,970
Wait until the new year.

20
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,450
Why is that?

21
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,090
Grandpa is furious about

22
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,370
the recent burglary.

23
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,689
My two uncles are also making a scene.

24
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:44,929
The entire Zhiyi is under curfew.

25
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,090
The curfew doesn't
apply to me no matter what.

26
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,890
Don't worry. I will be careful.

27
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,330
What about Xiaoyao?

28
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:53,610
What about her?

29
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,890
Xinyue will take care of her.

30
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,049
Just do me a favor.

31
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,489
Keep Xiaoyao company these days.

32
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,489
Fine, I'll go back to Chishui
after the festival.

33
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,569
Finally, news on Xuan.

34
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,890
You can't hide it from me.

35
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,810
Xuan

36
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,370
is with Chenrong Xinyue now?

37
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,409
Cang Xuan made his choice.

38
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,689
Even if it's not Chenrong Xinyue,
it'd be a woman from the Central Plains.

39
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,129
Cang Xuan's destiny

40
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,689
is written the moment
his father died in the war.

41
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,050
You can't be his one and only.

42
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,330
Forget about him.

43
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,289
Father.

44
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,010
Find me a husband.

45
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,010
I don't want Xuan anymore.

46
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:40,529
I'm sure

47
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,650
among all the admirable men in Haoling,

48
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:44,170
I can find someone better.

49
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,529
Alright.

50
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,849
I'll trust you to select a husband

51
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,249
for Nian.

52
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,689
This is

53
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,650
quite a challenge.

54
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,610
I mean

55
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,770
the princess is distinguished,

56
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,650
good-looking, and highly...

57
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:10,569
cheerful.

58
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,730
Ordinary men

59
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,730
don't deserve her.

60
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,409
Are you saying that

61
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,129
no one in Haoling

62
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,689
is good enough for Nian?

63
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,969
I'm afraid so.

64
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,249
You came from
my maiden clan Dragon Squad.

65
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,569
You're my nephew and my disciple.

66
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,050
You're distinguished and capable.

67
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:43,930
You've watched Nian grow up

68
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,770
and know her well.

69
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,050
That's right, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,089
As Nian's cousin,

71
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:52,129
I will naturally
shoulder the responsibility

72
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,050
of finding her the best husband.

73
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:56,050
Haoling is a great kingdom.

74
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,930
How come we can't find
a presentable young man?

75
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:00,730
Of course, we can.

76
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,490
I'll find her any type of man

77
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,809
she prefers.

78
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,890
Get to it.

79
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

80
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,089
Master Qingqiu.

81
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,450
It's been so long.

82
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,650
Please be seated.

83
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,089
Why are we meeting here?

84
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,809
You must have figured out that I am...

85
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:58,770
Fangfeng.

86
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,170
Just get to the point.

87
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,849
I'm a businessman.

88
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,689
I'll do whatever I'm allowed to do.

89
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:07,890
Naturally, I won't

90
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,210
do anything forbidden.

91
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:18,770
I'd like you

92
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,930
to deliver some goods to Qingshui Town.

93
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,969
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

94
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,569
Report to the authority if you do.

95
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,890
Understood.

96
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:31,849
The whole city is in chaos for days.

97
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,409
The burglar is still at large?

98
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,730
They can't hide something
as obvious as provisions.

99
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,890
There are roadblocks everywhere.

100
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,490
The burglars can't run away.

101
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,569
Why would I deliver goods for you?

102
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,849
You're a business.

103
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,409
Naturally, I'm doing business with you.

104
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,969
What can you possibly offer me?

105
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,569
Xiaoyao, why are you here?

106
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,610
I heard the Tushan Family
is good at tracking people.

107
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:08,610
What?

108
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,529
You can't tell if you're being followed?

109
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,809
Can we talk business now?

110
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,650
You're threatening me with Xiaoyao?

111
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,689
I'm just telling you what I can offer.

112
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,689
Tushan Jing, will you

113
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,689
take this deal or not?

114
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:07,210
I will never let anyone
use Xiaoyao to get a deal.

115
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,410
But I will do what you said.

116
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,729
You taught Xiaoyao archery

117
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:21,410
as her mentor.

118
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,970
I truly appreciate it.

119
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,650
This time, I'm repaying you

120
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,090
on her behalf.

121
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,410
Repaying me on her behalf?

122
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,850
Have you asked her opinion?

123
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,530
It's between Xiaoyao and me.

124
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,169
Don't worry about it.

125
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:44,929
Of course.

126
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,090
Accept it or not. It's up to you.

127
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:50,450
You can turn me down.

128
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,530
Here's the time and address.

129
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,530
Send someone there.

130
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,010
I'll deliver the goods to Qingshui Town.

131
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:28,729
Goodbye.

132
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:22,929
Another mistake.

133
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,450
I think it's cozier for me
to listen to others play.

134
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,450
Play something nice for me.

135
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,330
I haven't met
the former "Master Qingqiu".

136
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,169
Neither do I know

137
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,809
what delicate tunes

138
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:02,210
he's managed to play.

139
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,530
Maybe I won't hear that in my lifetime.

140
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,770
Although it's a pity that upsets me,

141
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:12,929
I don't really think

142
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:14,489
it matters much.

143
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,530
Tushan Hou may have
destroyed your hands,

144
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,530
but he can't take away the joy
when you play.

145
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:26,929
Joy is a feeling.

146
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,689
It doesn't get damaged

147
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,729
along with your hands.

148
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:36,450
You're right. I was obsessed.

149
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,689
I've never studied music.

150
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,290
I know nothing.

151
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:44,929
Just pluck the strings

152
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,770
and I'll find it amazing.

153
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,890
What should I play?

154
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,970
Do you remember the song
I sang for you the other night?

155
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:46,065
♪You're like the wind on the water,

Master is playing the zither.

159
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,809
He hasn't played ever since

160
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,729
his hands got hurt.

161
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:09,090
I thought I'd never hear him play again

162
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,290
in my lifetime.

163
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:17,147

Did the banquet start in Yiqing Garden?

172
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,369
Yes.

173
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,210
Would you like to take a look?

174
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:26,369
Sure.

175
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,890
If I go, Nian will be awkward.

176
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,569
Never mind. Let her choose.

177
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,729
It can be anyone
as long as she likes him.

178
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,120
(Hanzhang Hall)

179
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,369
He's also fine. Keep him.

180
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,809
Princess.

181
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,530
He has a mole between his eyebrows.

182
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:08,330
It may not be so nice
to have a flaw on his face.

183
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,410
That's a Beauty Mole.

184
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:12,609
I find it pretty.

185
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:17,010
That guy with the flute.
He's dressed in green.

186
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,169
So frivolous like a playboy.

187
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,290
You're jealous of his gown.

188
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,890
The one who sang

189
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,850
didn't have a nice voice.

190
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,290
Come on, Ru Shou.

191
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:29,770
You're so picky.

192
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,609
No wonder
you're still single at this age.

193
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,210
I...

194
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:35,609
Anyone else?

195
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,569
Go on.

196
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:38,489
Your Highness.

197
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,369
You've seen all 20 people present.

198
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,210
That's it? I can't decide.

199
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,010
Why don't you open your eyes

200
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,970
and look closer?

201
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,530
So? Which one is the best?

202
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,129
I have to pick the best?

203
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,530
Yes.

204
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:36,770
You, then. I think you're the best.

Cang Xuan.

226
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:47,650
I brought you
some great warriors from Chishui.

227
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,290
They all have great spirit power.

228
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:51,969
Happy? Surprised?

229
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,489
Are you too thrilled to talk?

230
00:19:57,849 --> 00:19:59,329
We're buddies. It's no big deal.

231
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:04,969
You left Zhiyi and went to Chishui?

232
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:05,849
That's right.

233
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:09,770
Didn't I tell you

234
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,290
to keep Xiaoyao company these days?

235
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,729
Why did you go to Chishui

236
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,410
without telling me?

237
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,050
I know what you're thinking.

238
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,729
But I can't prioritize girls
over my buddies.

239
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,050
Of course, I must help you first.

240
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,329
Why didn't you tell me
that you were leaving?

241
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,050
I wanted to surprise you.

242
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:31,690
So? Happy?

243
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,089
Yeah.

244
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:38,530
I'm so happy.

245
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:50,969
Leave it if you don't want to learn.

246
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:52,410
I can play for you.

247
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,209
But Xinyue keeps checking on me because

248
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,449
you're teaching me.

249
00:20:57,849 --> 00:20:59,609
I have to tell her something.

250
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,650
It's too embarrassing
to say that I learned nothing.

251
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,209
It doesn't bother me.

252
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,249
Just tell her I'm a bad teacher.

253
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:08,770
But it bothers me.

254
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,410
How about this?

255
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,449
Teach me something really simple

256
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,770
that doesn't require technique or rhythm

257
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,890
and can be played with my eyes closed.

258
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:24,249
Jing, teach me.

259
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:25,810
Okay?

260
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,690
Fine, I'll teach you.

261
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:30,969
I must prove to Fenglong and Xinyue

262
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:33,010
that I learned from the best.

263
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,650
You have great potential.

264
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,170
Keep working on it.

265
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,129
Tell me the truth if we're friends.

266
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,969
I think your talent lies somewhere else.

267
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,609
If anyone asks you to play the zither,

268
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,849
you'd better say no.

269
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,449
It's fine. Jing and I are also

270
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,650
good at different things.

271
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,449
Xiaoyao.

272
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,449
You let your mentor down.

273
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,089
Even if you play,

274
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,290
don't tell anyone that
you learned from Master Qingqiu.

275
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:22,249
It's not her fault.

276
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,729
I'm a bad teacher.

277
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:26,410
Right?

278
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,650
I'm very clever.

279
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,609
An overly lenient mentor

280
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,930
and a shameless disciple.

281
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:32,530
That's why you're so bad.

282
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,449
Who's shameless?

283
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:37,969
Whoever is getting irritated.

284
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:39,449
Alright.

285
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,290
I'll teach you a lesson first.
Who's shameless?

286
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:42,930
Come back.

287
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:44,650
You're unbelievable.

288
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:46,849
You can't play well
and you're scolding me.

289
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,329
Your Majesty.

290
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:53,050
It's the hour
for the new year's worship ceremony.

291
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,770
Please take a look.

292
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,209
Deyan.

293
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:02,770
Here.

294
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:05,410
You will be in charge
of the ceremony this year.

295
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:07,650
Pay extra attention.

296
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,810
I swear I will
pay extra attention and do my best.

297
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,170
The Great Princess of Haoling will be
in the Central Plains for the festival.

298
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,690
Have we prepared a gift for her?

299
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,209
Your Majesty.

300
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,570
We have prepared gifts
for all royal descendants accordingly,

301
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:30,369
including the Great Princess of Haoling.

302
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:32,770
Zhoushan,

303
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:35,489
go to my treasury

304
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,729
and find something fancy for Xiaoyao.

305
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,530
She grew up
without any seniors by her side.

306
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,290
Make it up to her.

307
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,170
Understood.

308
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:49,969
Your Majesty.

309
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,290
Shall I get more gifts
for Prince Cang Xuan?

310
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:57,249
No, follow the regulations.

311
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,410
Understood.

312
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:21,729
Xiaoyao.

313
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,849
What's wrong?

314
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,369
Nothing.

315
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:34,010
Really.

316
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:37,609
It's just that I'm going back
to Qingqiu Hill for the new year.

317
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,369
I have to be there
to pay tribute to our ancestors.

318
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:47,209
When are you leaving?

319
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:51,010
Tomorrow.

320
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,449
Send regards to Granny
for me and Xinyue.

321
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,010
Of course.

322
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,410
You have to go by road
due to the bad weather.

323
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:01,690
It will take long.

324
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,530
Travel safe, Jing.

325
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:05,890
Thank you, Xinyue.

326
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:23,170
These are for Jing.

327
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:26,570
If you get delayed

328
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:28,010
and his legs hurt,

329
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,890
apply a thick layer of ointment
to his wounds.

330
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:33,890
Remind him to apply the ointment

331
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,209
whenever he goes out in the snow.

332
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,890
If it keeps hurting after he returns,
put an herbal bath for him.

333
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,650
I've put the herbs in sachets.
One sachet every time.

334
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,089
Thank you, princess. I won't forget.

335
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,329
I'm leaving then.

336
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,690
Safe trip.

337
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:20,290
See you next year.

338
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,570
See you next year.

339
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,129
Let's go.

340
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,129
Master's legs hurt on snowy days.

341
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,930
Miss Fangfeng never paid attention.

342
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:48,329
But the princess is considerate enough

343
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,209
to prepare ointment and herbs.

344
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,890
If only the princess can be our lady.

345
00:28:57,209 --> 00:28:58,089
Mind your words.

346
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,010
Master is engaged.

347
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,969
Princess is just grateful
that Master is teaching her.

348
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:04,849
What about the engagement?

349
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,969
Even married couples can get divorced.

350
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:10,890
They're not even married yet.

351
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,530
Haven't you ever heard of anyone
canceling an engagement?

352
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:30,178
(Chenrong Mansion)

353
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:01,209
(If you're the lotus in the wind,)

354
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:03,770
(I'd be the wind on the water.)

355
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:06,489
(Meet and miss.)

356
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,570
(If you're the moon in the cloud,)

357
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,489
(I'd be the cloud in the sky.)

358
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,410
(We fall in love.
We cherish each other.)

359
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:18,609
(If you're the vine on the tree,)

360
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,170
(I'd be the tree in the mountain.)

361
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,290
(Accompany and depend on.)

362
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,290
(Despite the joy
and sorrow in the world,)

363
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:29,209
(despite the gatherings
and partings in life,)

364
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,449
(my heart will always remain the same.)

365
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,249
(I'd like us to stay together forever,)

366
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:38,650
(never to part.)

367
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,512
♪Looking back on my old days♪

368
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:45,849
Come on.

369
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:47,449

(Cui Hall)

391
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,369
Father hasn't punished anyone
for the burglary.

392
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:45,050
On the contrary, he entrusted
the new year's worship ceremony to you.

393
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:49,369
I bet he values you a lot.

394
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,729
We dispatched so many soldiers

395
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,890
but failed to get the provisions back.

396
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,050
Neither did we catch that viper.

397
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,329
The Chenrong Rebels

398
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,810
impose a huge threat
to our Xiyan Kingdom.

399
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:06,690
It's been hundreds of years.

400
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,449
Even Father couldn't handle them.

401
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,850
What can we do?

402
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,330
Mu Fei is here.

403
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:25,530
- Let him in.
- Yes.

404
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:37,010
May you be well,
Fifth King, Seventh King.

405
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,209
I came all the way from Zhiyi
to pay respect.

406
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,130
You know the major families

407
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,969
in the Central Plains well enough.

408
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,209
Are they still against

409
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:48,570
Cang Xuan nowadays?

410
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:49,810
Prince Cang Xuan

411
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,969
sent the Great Princess of Haoling
to the Chenrong Mansion

412
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,290
to "keep Miss Chenrong company".

413
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,090
In fact, she's also getting along
with Chishui Fenglong.

414
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:01,810
The major families saw them

415
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:04,929
meddling with
the Chishui and Chenrong clans

416
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,130
and got a bit terrified.

417
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,810
They're complaining a lot less.

418
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,370
Haoling Jiuyao

419
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,290
doesn't stay in Haoling

420
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:14,889
but follows Cang Xuan

421
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,689
all around.

422
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,130
About Princess General,

423
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,850
there is something I can't figure out.

424
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:35,649
I hope you could enlighten me.

425
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,130
Go ahead.

426
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,930
(Plum blossom in the outskirt of Zhiyi)

427
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:47,290
Greetings, Princess.

428
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:49,889
Please get up.

429
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:54,209
Xiaoyao rarely joins such a gathering.

430
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:56,290
She came to keep me company.

431
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:58,130
You must treat her well.

432
00:35:58,209 --> 00:35:58,969
Of course.

433
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:03,850
Stop there.

434
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,969
You hit me?

435
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,290
Xinyue, let's have a snow fight.

436
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:10,370
Come on.

437
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,130
Come here.

438
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,689
Let's join them.

439
00:36:13,169 --> 00:36:14,570
It's okay. Go ahead.

440
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:16,889
Take this!

441
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:25,209
My apologies.

442
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,130
Don't be nervous. Get up.

443
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,689
It's okay. Go on playing.

444
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,290
The plum blossoms here are beautiful.

445
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:07,570
Next time, we could
invite Cang Xuan to admire them.

446
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,850
Miao Pu.

447
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,729
Someone has set up a formation.

448
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,570
Ouch.

449
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:38,050
Come out and kill me.

450
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:40,570
