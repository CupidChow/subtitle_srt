Still, my expert opinion on women says that charming Tetsuko

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,830

Yes, Ma'am.

175
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,640
Exact change. Come again.

176
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,630
Thank you.

177
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,800
That'll be 300 yen.
<i>[Extra Dry: Taiyo Beer]</i>

178
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,740
Treat yourself, right?

179
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,590
Heave-ho!

180
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,850
What..

181
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,650
Sensei...

182
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,970
You are Sensei, yes?

183
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,340
I've actually frequented this bathhouse, ever since I was little.

184
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,540
Who thought you'd be a fellow regular.

185
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,230
It's just a coincidence. A coincidence!

186
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,820
<i>No way. I run into the boss at a healing spring?</i>

187
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,230
<i>Calm down. We're five meters apart. No eye contact, and I'll be fine.</i>

188
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,180
You look wonderful in a T-shirt.

189
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,170
Hey, boundaries! Our baths are separated, remember?

190
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,210
"Happiness" indeed.

191
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,700
<i>[Happiness]</i>

192
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,480
<i>What the hell is he on?</i>

193
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:24,260
May I take this chance to ask you three, very serious questions?

194
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,480
No, it's off-hours.

195
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,330
Are you currently dating anyone?

196
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,400
"No" means nothing to you, right?

197
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,300
No, I am not.

198
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,280
I see. Then my second question.

199
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,040
Whatever. Go on.

200
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,540
Who exactly is "Hitotose"?

201
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,020
As I recall, you said you had a "Hitotose-kun"-

202
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,440
I did not.

203
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,310
But I heard you, clearly.

204
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,130
I fumbled my words.

205
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,930
I was trying to say Murai-kun, when I mixed up names.

206
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,300
That's quite an extreme fumble, no?

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,050
"Murai"... "Hitotose"...

208
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,390
Those names have nothing in common.

209
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,350
It's getting chilly out here.

210
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,470
Bye.

211
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,640
One last question.

212
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,680
Sensei,

213
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,520
why won't you look me in the eye?

214
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,910
Because there's no need to.

215
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,240
Good night.

216
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,370
Tetsuko sent this...
<i>[Lunch break. Rooftop. Be there. - Tanaka]</i>

217
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,720
Yes, I found it piercing my desk this morning.

218
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,590
Don't go! It'll be your doom!

219
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,580
Nah, I bet otherwise, it'll be the start of something new.

220
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,370
Dude, you're being rash!

221
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,590
Thanks for the concern, Hirai. Kiri, I'll exceed your expectations.

222
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,940
This battle...

223
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,270
will decide everything.

224
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,330
<i>My kitten,</i>

225
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,120
<i>he's simply a student who's top of his class.</i>

226
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,820
<i>His only merit is that we look a bit alike, nothing more.</i>

227
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,950
<i>Relax. Only have eyes for me, okay?</i>

228
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,010
Delusion gauge...

229
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,650
Maxed out.

230
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,860
Any who come to disrupt my heart...

231
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,010
must be slain!

232
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,790
Woah. Yuka-chan, Hitomi-chan. What do you twins want?

233
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,600
<i>We must discuss the Blonde Murai-san Incident.</i>

234
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,230
I'll get straight to the point.

235
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,440
Give up on me liking me, immediately.

236
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,010
No!

237
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,350
That was fast.

238
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,150
I want to marry you.

239
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,450
These feelings of mine will not change in the slightest.

240
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,800
Your declaration is way too shallow.

241
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,970
I'm not making a baseless statement here.

242
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,620
I

243
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,780
- have always... always-
- You're still a student!

244
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,520
My determination to love you will not waver, no matter what the future holds.

245
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,200
Sensei, I will stand the test of fate!

246
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,970
Words are words, empty as ever.

247
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,510
People's feelings change.

248
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,920
Don't promise me a future.

249
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:05,210
However, there is a chance you'll fall for me.

250
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,560
What?

251
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,260
If I abandon this chance of a lifetime,

252
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,170
I'll be abandoning my very purpose of life.

253
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,060
<i>Don't waver, my kitten.</i>

254
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,780
A chance? You know nothing about me.

255
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,180
You don't know how I feel, what I like, why I'm irritated...

256
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,070
Nothing.

257
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,080
Don't go talking about your chances with me!

258
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,250
<i>Hear that?</i>

259
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,800
<i>Just give up already.</i>

260
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,080
I felt malice in the air.

261
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,400
I've heard you loud and clear.

262
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,440
Even so, I will love you with all my might.

263
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,890
I will love you, head on.

264
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,310
My feelings for you won't ever change.

265
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,440
Don't you forget it.

266
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,850
<i>Those are the eyes.</i>

267
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,850
<i>Those eyes of his, make me...</i>

268
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,310
Fine. Do what you will.

269
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,410
<i>Love is the shortest and most direct path</i>

270
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,010
<i>to the heart.</i>

271
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,360
See? Isn't he cute?

272
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,930
Dear Sister, it's true.

273
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,100
He's Hitotose-san, in the flesh!

274
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,990
Direct, indeed.

275
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,640
<i>[Next time]
Can you lend me this game?</i>

276
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,130
<i>There has to be something about this game right?</i>

277
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,280
<i>Sensei suddenly said "Hitotose-kun."</i>

278
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,750
<i>I can't afford to lose!</i>

279
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,100
<i>Could you also do us a favor?</i>

280
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,020
