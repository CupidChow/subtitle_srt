<i>Are you in there, Tanaka Sensei?</i>

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,890
I didn't see you around

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,150
so I went to every female washroom and called out to you like I'm doing now.

You really won't give up.

Sensei, Regarding your cheeks that you promisedー

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,150
Do you plan to do it in school?

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,450
No, I don't mean that.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,070
Hey!

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,280

I still haven't told you the reason... why I came back.

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,500
You see, I'm getting married.

Yeah, you've ignored her for one month.

You've kept Tetsuko in suspense for so long, she's now desperate.

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,580
Oh, she's on leave.

116
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,850
Why?

117
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,600
Calm down, Murai. Your will to punch someone is as great as mine.

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,400
Please... Please don't lump me together with you.

119
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,170
Huh?

120
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,730
Why are you so worked up?

121
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,550
She's our form teacher, that's why.

122
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,660
I see. I'll leave after reading out the announcements. Bear with me for thirty seconds.

123
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,570
So Murai, are you and Tanaka dating?

124
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,910
Huh?

125
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,330
Well... Sorry if I got it wrong.

126
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,350
But you see, I've been in this job for years, so I can pick up hints like these.

127
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,270
What, is it just me?

128
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,600
I don't know what you're talking about, but this is absurd.

129
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,220
Do you have any evidence?

130
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,460
Not yet. That's why I called you out.

131
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,150
Before you do something funny and it becomes an evidence.

132
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,040
My break time is precious, so I'll take my leave now.

133
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,140
Lock away those overflowing emotions into the prison in your heart.

134
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,740
A minor like you can be protected from anything, but not Tanaka.

135
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,300
You understand, right? As the smartest kid in your cohort.

136
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,790
This doesn't make sense.

137
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,590
How can you say that when you have no evidence?

138
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,440
It's my responsibility as head teacher to protect you all.

139
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,430
Including that thick-headed new form teacher.

140
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,440
He got me.

141
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,410
Totally.

142
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,860
Damn producers.

143
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,180
You've released an outrageous one this time!

144
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,540
It's a victory!

145
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,320
Yeah! Our victory!

146
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,310
Do you feel better?

147
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,960
My job is only to find ways to bury her loneliness.

148
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,790
Even though I've slept with her now,

149
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,260
that was just a one-night stand.

150
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,710
He thinks he's Hades?

151
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,300
He's the evil one.

152
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,480
He destroys everything, and brings about doom.

153
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,570
This style of Yamakado brings tears to countless heartbroken couples.

154
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,640
Hold your head up high, Murai!

155
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,250
We will find a way.

156
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,720
That will definitely be A.

157
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,890
Nah, I think it's B.

158
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,890
It's here, it's here. A message from Tetsuko.

159
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,730
She said it must be B.

160
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,880
- Are you sure?
- Let's put our faith in Sensei.

161
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,650
As expected of Tetsuko!

162
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,300
A way to cheer Tetsuko Sensei up?

163
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,040
Yup. It's been a week already.

164
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,440
That's so kind of you, Murai-san.

165
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,250
No, I'm not.

166
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,510
That's because we're gaming buddies.

167
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,710
Murai-san, you're really a good friend!

168
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,950
if i were...

169
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,950
Excuse me...

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,750
may I know where is the classroom for Year 2, Class 1?

171
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,860
Year 2, Class 1?

172
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,260
Stop it! I'll definitely not allow Yayoi to pretend to be Murai's girlfriend!

173
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,400
It's just an act!

174
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,830
Sure, I can show you the way. But, don't students carry a phone nowadays?

175
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,880
Oh, my phone got swept away by the river.

176
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
- What?
- Yayo-chan?

177
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,010
Yayo-chan, it's you?

178
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,790
Oh, Chii-chan, there you are!

179
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,250
I didn't expect you to come all the way here.

180
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,230
You really can't control yourself, huh?

181
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,000
Shall we go to a café and discuss about the random walk theory?

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,490
Let's do that!

183
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,620
Then I'll feed you pancakes like this, "Ah..."

184
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,550
Can I go now?

185
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,430
Okay! This will totally remove suspicionー

186
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,310
Huh? Hirai?

187
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,020
Sorry, Yayo-chan. That you had to do this.

188
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,310
It's to protect the person you like, right?

189
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,610
Yes.

190
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,220
Why are you here?

191
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,170
Is my role the adulterer?

192
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,520
What?

193
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,760
Are you trying to kill me?

194
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,390
Why don't you do it with another girl then?

195
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,330
I like guys who are smarter and sincere.

196
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,570
What part of me do you not like?

197
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,520
You think that all girls will fall for you by doing that.

198
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,610
You're really stupid.

199
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,440
The worst!

200
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,850
<i>Tanaka. Resurrected.</i>

201
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,600
<i>But if I bury myself in work, I'll collapse.</i>

202
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,460
<i>If I lock myself at home, I'll just get laid every night in my games.</i>

203
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,070
<i>Isn't there any safe haven for me?</i>

204
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,970
<i>A safeー</i>

205
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,620
Murai-kun?

206
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,110
Hey there.

207
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,830
Good morning. I'm sorry for the troubleー

208
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,290
- It was tough on you.
- Huh?

209
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,540
Don't push yourself too hard.

210
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,320
Oh, about the camp, I've come up with the proposal. Let's discuss later.

211
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,010
Sure.

212
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm the one who's desperate.

213
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,350
<i>How long must they be sealed up?</i>

214
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,410
- Sensei Tanaka.
- Yes?

215
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,050
About the camp, while you were on leave, I pushed itー

216
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,290
I entrusted it to Yamakado. You can take over from there.

217
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,430
Got it. Thank you.

218
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,810
Jeez, that blondie sure has many tricks up his sleeves.

219
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,100
- Oh, right. I'm surprised you have such a hobby.
- Huh?

220
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,830
You love gaming, right?

221
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,700
My seven-year-old grandchild is also into gaming recently.

222
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,010
What?

223
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,080
Tanaka. Do you have some time after this? I need to discuss with you the camp details.

224
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,970
Chat with you next time. About gaming.

225
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,810
<i>What happened when I was away?</i>

226
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,160
- Tanaka!
- Yes, Sir!

227
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,560
Are you sure you want to give me a treat?

228
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,400
It's to thank you for listening to my alternative plans.

229
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,750
Thanks!

230
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,450
I did it!

231
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,070
What did you just say?

232
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,260
I said...

233
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,870
I finally crossed the line.

234
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,250
I don't know if I should even be telling you this.

235
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,800
Beyond my expectations...

236
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,910
What?

237
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,850
- One more beer, please!
- Got it!

238
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,440
You're drinking oolong tea, right? One more oolong tea, too!

239
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,540
Sorry, sorry. Can I ask you a question? Just one question.

240
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,180
Just one question, yeah? Sure. Go on.

241
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,710
The person you crossed the line with...

242
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,580
is Blondie?

243
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,770
<i>Kitten...</i>

244
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,240
How did you know?

245
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,810
Thanks. For telling me so frankly like this. I'll keep it a secretー

246
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,680
Whoa... Tanaka?

247
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,260
So cold!

248
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,330
<i>[Fureai  bridge]

249
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,320
Tetsuko?

250
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,300
What's going on?

251
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,800
I sent you home, but you were sound asleep, and the door was auto-locked,

252
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,450
so I waited till you're awake.

253
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,250
I'm so sorry!

254
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,280
Here you go.

255
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,920
Thank you.

256
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,140
Your family must be worried.

257
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,340
Hm? I don't have any.

258
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,260
Oh, you're single? I thoughtー

259
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,970
I'm divorced. Three years ago.

260
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,300
Thanks for the drink.

261
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,290
Are you not interested?

262
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,510
What?

263
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,990
Doesn't matter if you're divorced. You're still my head teacher.

264
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,790
Don't you gossip with the other teachers about me?

265
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,360
Well, I don't have such a hobby.

266
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,900
In the first place, gossiping about others...

267
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,350
is a waste of time and has no meaning in my life.

268
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,120
I don't need it at all.

269
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,080
Is that so?

270
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,910
Say, Yamakado Sensei...

271
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,650
About what I said earlier at the restaurant...

272
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,640
I can't remember how much I told you when I was drunk, but please don't tell anyoneー

273
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,000
Of course, I won't.

274
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,850
It's your choice to like whoever you want.

275
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,130
Live your life however you like.

276
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,900
But listen...

277
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,460
Don't make the wrong choice that can ruin your life.

278
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,190
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

279
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,550
What?

280
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,590
Wait a minute. Ruin?

281
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,010
Wrong choice?

282
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,340
Isn't that a little overboard?

283
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,750
I'm giving you serious advice as an adult. You should end it right now.

284
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,930
No way!

285
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,780
Isn't it my freedom to adore and worship whoever I like?

286
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,080
Do you tell people, "You're making the wrong choice", if their religion is not the same as yours?

287
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,810
Huh? That's a totally different matter.

288
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,670
What you're doing now is considered unacceptable by society's standards.

289
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,420
Unacceptable? Unacceptable?!

290
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,280
That's why I've been secretly doing it without telling anyone!

291
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,950
You've already done the deed by the time I noticed it.

292
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,390
If word about it spreads, you won't be able to stay in this school anymore.

293
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,750
Nah, you're biased! You totally don't understand!

294
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:47,080
Even if everyone knows I'm a Hitotose geek, it's impossible to get me fired from the school!

295
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,710
What the hell? You think being a geek is breaking the law?

296
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,220
Let me tell you,

297
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,080
I don't care who's trying to stop me, but I sure don't plan on giving up Hitotose!

298
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,280
Did you hear that? Our bond has not broken off.

299
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,590
Sorry...

300
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,830
but who's Hitotose?

301
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,840
Huh? Like I said...

302
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,540
- Aren't you talking about Hitotose?
- Aren't you talking about Murai?
