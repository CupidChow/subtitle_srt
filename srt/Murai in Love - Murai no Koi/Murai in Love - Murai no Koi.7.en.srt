1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,780
I finally crossed the line.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,480
Tetsuko?

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,940
What's going on?

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,190
Who's Hitotose?

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,980
- Aren't you talking about Hitotose?
- Aren't you talking about Murai?

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,250
<i>My boss has discovered I'm a hopeless otaku,</i>

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,160
<i>no thanks to that nightmarish evening.</i>

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,250
<i>Meanwhile, Murai-kun suspects I have something going on with Boss,</i>

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,550
<i>and has put some respectable distance with me.</i>

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,080
<i>However, one event was about to change everything.</i>

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,400
You all know Takebe High's annual Winter Camping Trip with the Vice-Principal.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,980
For those interested, I shall be chaperoning this year's trip.

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,560
This is a great opportunity to suck up to your teachers.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,750
Looks like Mr. Vice Principal was next in line for a cold,

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,310
and three days before camp too.
<i>[Steel yourself! 3 Days Until the Camping Trip]</i>

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,880
You'll be the only chaperone, okay?

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,610
I'm anything but okay.

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,810
Thought so.

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,800
And so, I'm joining as an emergency chaperone.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,770
Thank you, Sir.

22
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,900
Did you hear? Hirai's got a fever of forty degrees.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,200
Also sir, it's raining.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,690
That's what it means to camp.

25
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,940
Prepare yourselves for a day of Sensei  Tanaka planned fun.

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,220
Please don't raise their expectations.

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,850
You two...

28
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,260
sure get along.

What?

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,780

43
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,100
Back over there.

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,710
We thought they were trailing behind us.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,170
But we suddenly lost them.

46
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,620

00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,670
He says you're aiming for Tokyo Uni,

51
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,530
but caught a cold from studying.

52
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,690
Don't tell me it's because of what I said.

53
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,160
<i>You're really stupid. The worst!</i>

54
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,950
And what if it was?

55
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,160
You're an idiot beyond saving.

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,910
I'll prove myself to you with results.

57
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,510
I'll prove I'm serious about you.

<i>[One hour into being lost]</i>

59
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,300
So this must be despair.

60
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,190
Any longer, and we'll be spending the night together, alone.

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,420
We will not.

62
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:35,090
Despite our sticky situation, I feel as though I've lucked out.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,910
After all, I get to spend time with the person I love.

64
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,510
I've been holding back, ever since December.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,150
I wanted a climactic ending with you.

66
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,550
<i>Murai-kun...?</i>

67
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,450
However, things didn't go my way at all.

68
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,070
Time flies, and now it's been 8 months since my career form.

69
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,700
My results? Fruitless.

70
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,360
That's why I'm happy.

71
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,330
I want to savor the little time I've been given now.

72
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,030
Hey, so...

73
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,740
I haven't even had a moment to question this,

74
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,130
but... why me?

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,180
Why do you think?

76
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,150
Answering a question with a question, huh?

77
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,450
If I tell you why, it's my loss.

78
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,290
After all, I promised.

79
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,080
Promised whom?

80
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,190
A question for you instead.

81
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,210
Why did you fall for Hitotose?

82
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,660
Huh?

83
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,910
Your friend asked me the same question.

84
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,020
Sensei Yamakado, why'd you get a divorce?

85
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,730
I've got no plans sharing my private life with students.

86
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,290
Right. You're a closed off guy.

87
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,330
Do you hate people?

88
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,630
Actually, the opposite.

89
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,500
That's why I've learned to draw a line.

90
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,390
Learned to?

91
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,670
In other words, something happened in the past.

92
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,360
Perhaps you got involved with a female student?

93
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,270
His eyes.

94
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,390
His eyes?

95
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,170
See, I was ostracized from grade school to high school.

96
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,840
But in high school, I got close to making a friend.

97
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,790
When I met Hitotose-kun in college,

98
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,190
I recalled that friend's eyes.

99
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,570
Sensei.

100
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,180
Huh?

101
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,660
Don't misconstrue my words. That was a one-sided issue.

102
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,950
Oh, I thought it was a rumor. So it's true.

103
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,340
Then what about intoxicating Sensei Tanaka, and taking her to your car?

104
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,310
My lips are sealed, promise.

105
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,640
Just don't lay hands on Sensei Tanaka.

106
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,820
So that's your goal.

107
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,130
Hey! Way too close!

108
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,200
Hello?

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,130
- That's the boss!
- Hey!

110
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,120
- Tanaka?
- Boss!

111
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,520
Where are you two?

112
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,040
Did something happen between you and Sensei Yamakado?

113
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,970
Excuse me? No, nothing happened.

114
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,280
You two have gotten much closer while planning this trip -

115
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
I said you're overthinking it.

116
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,590
Besides, even if anything happened, I wouldn't tell you.

117
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,530
It's not your business as a student.

118
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,600
Then if I weren't a student,

119
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,300
what would've happened to us?

120
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,850
I can't answer your question about assumptions.

121
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,640
Boss!

122
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,610
Boss! Boss!

123
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,470
Boss!

124
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,700
You irk me with every move you make.

125
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,740
I know you flirt with others.

126
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,560
I just can't overlook your attitude.

127
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,790
You're serious about me, right?

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,860
Then do me a favor.

129
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,770
Say that I'm special,

130
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,390
and really mean it.

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,080
Now.

132
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,950
8 x 1 is 1.

133
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,840
8 x 2 is 16.

134
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,680
8 x 3 is 24.

135
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,260
8 x 4 is...

136
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,490
32.

137
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,620
You made me learn my 8 times table,

138
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,300
and that makes you special, beyond doubt.

139
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,380
You're such a dumbass.

140
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,000
Did you only come to pick a fight?

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,790
Yes. I did.

142
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,180
The Fukunaga Mart

143
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,640
is having its biggest sale yet.

144
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,010
Then I'll buy out the whole store.

145
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,110
Listen up, we're going to make legendary curry.

146
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,990
Legendary...

147
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,880
That's what it said in her plans.

148
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,900
I wrote that in a fervor. It's really just plain old seafood curry.

149
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,840
Don't say that. We'll make it legendary.

150
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,580
I didn't expect you to be so gung-ho.

151
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,830
I've always been gung-ho. My enthusiasm is easily misunderstood.

152
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,920
Woah, it's good.

153
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,670
Dampness is key here.

154
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,530
Drinking coffee in the open wilds is a treat.

155
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,050
Is this not ready?

156
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,080
Give it a bit longer.

157
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,660
Sensei, are you an outdoors guy?

158
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,650
Yeah, I go camping alone too.

159
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,980
That sounds nice. You can join me once you graduate.

160
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,800
Really?!

161
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,740
- Oh, erm...
- Let's drop that already.

162
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,610
We're here to have fun.

163
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,870
All right, back to cooking everyone.

164
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,340
Thanks for the meal.

165
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,110
Hey, look up you all.

166
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,280
Come on, smile!

167
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,350
I love seeing my album fill up with photos like this.

168
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,080
<i>Perhaps we misunderstood him.</i>

169
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,020
Sensei Yamakado is just a bit awkward.

170
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm sure he became a teacher with earnest intentions.

171
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Yes, I agree.

172
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,480
Murai, if Yamakado...

173
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,650
Never mind.

174
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,890
Listen, I found nice place up the mountain.

175
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,080
I hear tonight's the best time to stargaze.

176
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,030
<i>If Hades falls in love, Murai doesn't stand a chance.</i>

177
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,650
<i>Murai... Please take your shot tonight.</i>

178
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:16,010
Sensei. A couple students snuck out to stargaze.

179
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,160
Give me a damn break already...

180
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,450
Leave them.

181
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,990
I cannot.

182
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,740
I'll go find them alone as planned then.

183
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,010
I'm pulling your leg.

184
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,800
Think of the students.

185
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,920
So even you can worry.

186
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,690
Not really. I'm just the chaperone.

187
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,960
When you two got separated, I briefly considered the worst case scenario.

188
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,070
To me, kids are unfinished books.

189
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,940
Every time I interact with a student,

190
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,380
I'm reading a new book.

191
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,920
Not only that, but each one is an unfinished masterpiece.

192
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,360
To have a hand in that creative process

193
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,930
is an honor, no?

194
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,950
Boss, you're a poet.

195
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,180
Of course, I am.

196
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,790
What's most difficult, is we must be in the right.

197
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,900
I always struggle drawing that line.

198
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,770
What about you? Why'd you become a teacher?

199
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,060
I don't have as beautiful a reason like you.

200
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,230
It made me stable, but...

201
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,810
I also became one out of spite.

202
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,570
Out of spite?

203
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,250
My mother wanted to be a teacher.

204
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:08,010
However, she gave up after becoming pregnant with my brother.

205
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,270
Soon after, I was born.

206
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,540
Then, our father caused trouble, and vanished without a trace.

207
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,430
- By the time I was in grade school...
<i> - Mom!</i>

208
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,380
<i>my mother left home.</i>

209
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,270
<i>My brother became a police officer, all while raising me.</i>

210
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,990
One day...

211
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,190
out of the blue,

212
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,090
our mother returned, despite abandoning us.

213
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,340
Seriously...

214
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,750
She was such a disgrace.

215
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,320
I wanted to become a teacher,

216
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,810
and really gloat it in my mother's face.

217
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,220
I wanted to tell her she wasn't my mother.

218
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,660
And did you?

219
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,970
No, she died before I could.

220
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,890
I'm the worst, aren't I?

221
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,660
"Heartless" doesn't even begin to describe me.

222
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,880
No, you're not heartless.

223
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,210
You just wanted...

224
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,150
your mother to compliment you.

225
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,470
You wanted her approval. Her pride.

226
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,810
Are you a poet?

227
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,200
I already told you I am.

228
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,340
But I've never tried hard, ever.

229
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,460
People who are trying, never realize it themselves.

230
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,770
Come to that realization already.

231
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,080
After all, I've noticed.

232
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,800
I've noticed your efforts.

233
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,150
Great job becoming a teacher.

234
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,010
He's out to kill me here.

235
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,450
Princess!

236
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,600
A smile, compliment, and head pat?

237
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,950
He's a cup of cocoa, whipped cream and all!

238
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,730
And no one hates hot cocoa!

239
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,850
Princess, you're too easily charmed.

240
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,260
I'm going to look over there again. You stay here.

241
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,890
Is this truly alright?

242
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,330
Murai, what are you doing?!

243
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,330
<i>Murai!</i>

244
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,540
Sensei.

245
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,790
Please, look at me.

246
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,330
Murai-kun?

247
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,590
I love you, Ayano-san.

248
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,200
First name out of nowhere?

249
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,710
Quit looking down on us adults already.

250
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,510
Then quit looking down on me because I'm a child.

251
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,530
I'm saying all this for your future.

252
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,880
I have no place in a future without you.

253
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,550
Sensei,

254
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,110
I'm sorry I only cause you trouble.

255
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,300
I'm sorry I cannot give up!

256
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,300
Tanaka Sensei?

257
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,870
<i>Tanaka and I are dating.</i>

258
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,930
<i>He'll come back. Definitely.</i>

259
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,200
<i>My duty is over.</i>

260
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,870
<i>Do what your heart tells you to.</i>

261
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,930
<i>But what are you going to do with Murai?</i>

262
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,760
<i>He's not as weak as you think.</i>

263
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,860
<i>Do you remember?</i>

264
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,720
<i>No wonder I couldn't turn away from you.</i>

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,300
