00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,290
I suggest you come on out. It's for the better.

179
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,690
He's in a maid outfit. Don't let him escape.

180
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,710
Yes, Sir.

181
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,620
Where did you go wrong this time?

182
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,120
Hah... I'm losing my touch.

183
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,100
I want to see Murai's match before I'm captured for real.

184
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,380
Surrender while you can.

185
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,780
Now our champion is pissed!

186
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,860
<i>Can our alum attain victory?</i>

187
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,410
Where's Kiri-kun? We're about to begin!

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,090
Have you seen my sister?

189
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,400
Good job boy. Now tap out.

190
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,940
Never... give up...

191
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,380
You're going to fly out the ring.

192
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,590
Never...

193
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,390
give... up!

194
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,950
Here. Someone take him.

195
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,200
<i>Will he be out the ring?!</i>

196
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,950
<i>[Takebeichi  Tournament]</i>

197
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,830
Murai-kun!

198
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,370
<i>Match set! Our victor is-</i>

199
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,160
Wait!

200
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,530
Come on, Murai. Is this going to be one-sided?

201
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,060
Don't sully my reputation.

202
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,990
Your defense squad is by your side.

203
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,540
Guys...

204
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,660
What do we do in this case?!

205
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,930
What should we do?

206
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,370
Safe.

207
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,040
Safe, safe.

208
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,020
Safe, safe, safe.

209
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,870
Safe, safe.

210
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,370
Safe, safe, safe, safe.

211
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,480
Safe, safe, safe.

212
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,830
He's safe!

213
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,430
Heave-ho!

214
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,330
Never... give up.

215
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,890
Hell yes! Beat him, no matter what!

216
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,960
Murai, Murai, Murai!

217
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,340
Murai, Murai!

218
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:38,630
- Murai, Murai, Murai, Murai!
- Go!

219
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,130
- Come on!
- Don't lose to him!

220
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,590
Murai, Murai, Murai!

221
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,740
You have guts, I'll give you that.

222
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,020
Murai, Murai, Murai!

223
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,540
Murai.

224
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,150
I'm a failure of a hero.

225
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,440
<i>Match set!</i>

226
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,110
<i>In an unexpected turn, our Champ has been thrown out the ring.</i>

227
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,630
<i>Our winner is the challenger from Year 2, Class1, Murai-kun!</i>

228
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,870
Damn, I added too much power.

229
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,550
Sir...

230
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,450
<i>Mao, here you go.</i>

231
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,840
<i>Wow, it's a gold medal!</i>

232
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,210
<i>That's a medal for the coolest person in the world.</i>

233
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,620
<i>I'll be sure to treasure it forever and ever.</i>

234
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,720
Complex feelings, right?

235
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,400
Complex? How so?

236
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,480
Oh?

237
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,970
Well, that was your older brother, wasn't it?

238
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,380
Must be difficult to see a student take all the credit.

239
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,370
My brother is a mature adult who knows better.

240
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,400
If you'll excuse me.

241
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,170
I hope you don't regret this choice.

242
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,160
After all, reality will only hurt more.

243
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,290
<i>Attack!</i>

244
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,840
<i>I finally crossed the line.</i>

245
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,050
<i>Is the person you crossed the line with... blonde?</i>

246
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,760
<i>- This style of Yamakado brings tears to countless heartbroken couples.
- I win!</i>

247
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,990
<i>Here comes our chance!</i>

248
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,970
<i>Are you not interested?</i>

249
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,140
