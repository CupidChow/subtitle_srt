Hi! Good afternoon.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,070
If you walk spread out like that, you'll block traffic.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,930
What's Tetsuko's deal?

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,660
There's no rush. You've already shook hands, after all.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,590
- Right.
- But it's been over a month since then and nothing happened!

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,920
Talk about what you want!

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,700
Like, "I want to do this", or, "I want to do that"!

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,610
Of course, I'll do those things. This and that.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,410
One day.

You were just smiling.

17

That's true.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,080
You'll have endure not being able to see Tetsuko for over a month.

Wait, where is Hirai?

23
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,880
Hirai is in trouble with a group of girls.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,270
Again?

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,200

Not at all.

Of course.

What?

38
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,900
Your hair. I thought you had long hair, so I was surprised.

39
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,950
Kind of.

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,570

179
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,420
But no matter how strong I got, there was one thing I couldn't change.

180
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,970
I want to be your wife, Chi-chan!

181
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,880
I did my best!

182
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,400
I worked so, so hard to give up my strength

183
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,110
and become cute enough for you!

184
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,830
Yayo-chan...

185
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,800
I mean, "Colorful Rainbow Happy Summer Festival"?

186
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,920
"Colorful" and "rainbow" are redundant, and "happy" is just dumb. Who thought this up?

187
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,960
Tanaka?

188
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,390
Good afternoon.

189
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,730
What are you doing next Sunday?

190
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,770
We're short-staffed.
<i>[August 14 (Sunday)]</i>

191
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,830
Three guys going to a summer festival.

192
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,010
We're the coolest.

193
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,180
Tetsuko turned Murai down. We have to cheer him up too!

194
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,750
That's true.

195
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,410
Kiri? Hirai?

196
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,740
- Sorry for the wait! Murai, you're here!
- What do you want me to do?

197
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,630
- What do you want me to do?
- Want to go scoop goldfish?

198
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,040
What? Scoop goldfish?

199
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,570
Goldfish, goldfish, goldfish!

200
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,350
Oh, this is my friend-

201
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,710
I'm Fukunaga, Murai-kun's childhood friend.

202
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,290
Well, hello! You're cute! Do you have a boyfriend? Want to go around the stalls with me?

203
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,410
What?

204
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,460
Well, he already likes someone

205
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,380
so I guess this means I'll keep you company, instead.

206
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,430
Sorry, I'm not fond of flashly guys.

207
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,590
Well, there's one other guy. What about him?

208
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,350
Hirai?

209
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,430
Hey, over here!

210
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,700
Watch it!

211
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,730
- What is it?
- You didn't mention her!

212
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,180
Sorry. She really wanted to come.

213
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,430
Don't apologize! I need to give you a letter of commendation!

214
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,140
Today... my summer finally begins!

215
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,470
Oh, really?

216
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,940
Do you know the person Chi-chan likes?

217
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,140
And if I do?

218
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,020
It doesn't matter.

219
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,410
Don't get in our way, alright?

220
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,060
"Our"?

221
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,190
Sorry!

222
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,040
I mean, sorry that took so long! Let's go walk around!

223
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,250
Okay!

224
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,840
Don't go lumping you two together. I won't get in your way.

225
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,350
But his heart is a battleground.

226
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,020
All right. Let's go to my family's stall.

227
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,360
Yes, let's go.

228
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,440
Wait, Chi-chan!

229
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,300
- Gyoza, gyoza!
- Do you want to go get gyoza?

230
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,090
<i>[Colorful Rainbow Happy Summer Festival]</i>

231
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,310
- Hey. Thanks for making time for this.
- It's no trouble.

232
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,550
- It's a pain, but let's get going. The summer festival patrol.
- Yes!

233
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,570
That hurts, Dad! Stop!

234
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,100
My own son, ditching our stall!

235
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,150
What are you thinking, sticking your nose in Murai-kun's business?

236
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,590
Hirai-kun, you go over here!

237
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,210
But I have nothing to do with this!

238
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,390
You can attract some customers with your good looks!

239
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,520
Oh? What about Murai? Murai?

240
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,220
He can't leave that girl alone!

241
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,840
- I'll help out, too.
- I will, too!

242
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,990
It's fine! It'll get cramped with too many people! Go walk around over there.

243
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,480
You two look cute together!

244
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,430
- Kiri, I'll do a loop, and then we'll swap.
- Okay.

245
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,180
You'd better come back! In five minutes- No, one minute!

246
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,170
You don't need to come back!

247
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,740
We'll make our rounds from the back then.

248
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,590
- All right. See you.
- See you around.

249
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,420
Let's go.

250
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,230
Do you think patrol is a pain in the ass?

251
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,470
No, not really.

252
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,570
That's good then.

253
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,750
Call me if anything happens. I will go patrol over there.

254
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,360
Sure.

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,360
I ended up coming anyway. Under the guise of patrol.

256
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,140
How underhanded, even if I say so myself...

257
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,890
Chi-chan!

258
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,410
Chi-chan!

259
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,310
Chi-chan?

260
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,940
I can't do this.

261
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,560
- Sensei!
- Wait, Chi-chan!

262
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,510
I'm sorry, excuse me!

263
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,710
- Excuse me!
- Chi-chan!

264
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,560
Ready?

265
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,860
When someone else likes the same character you like,

266
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,390
and you can't stand it,

267
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,720
<i>[Same faves, get out!]</i>

268
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,980
they're a "Same faves, get out!"

269
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,140
Same faves, get out...

270
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,450
In the previous scene,

271
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,610
Murai-kun was holding another woman's hand.

272
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,910
The man with the same face as the Lady's favorite character?

273
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,140
Holding the hand of another woman?

274
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,160
The Lady could never stand for this! You understand?

275
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,680
<i>This is my own fault. Murai-kun didn't do anything wrong.</i>

276
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,460
<i>I shouldn't have done all that...</i>

277
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,470
Sensei?

278
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,890
Murai-kun?

279
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,990
- Sensei!
- Go back!

280
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,580
- Your companion is going to get the wrong idea!
- You're wrong.

281
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,980
Go back now!

282
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,910
I don't want to!

283
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,050
Could you get off?

284
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,700
I don't want to.

285
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,040
I thought you couldn't come.

286
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm on patrol. The other teachers are here, too.

287
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,540
I came with my friends, as you told me to.

288
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,120
That girl back there is a friend, too.

289
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,240
Really...

290
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,210
Do you actually doubt-

291
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,090
I don't doubt you!

292
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,810
Is someone here?

293
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,480
Sensei Tsuji?

294
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,380
I thought I heard a weird scream from over here.

295
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>Crap! Crap, crap, crap!</i>

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,030
<i>If he sees us like this, he'll really give me a ticket to the underworld!</i>

297
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,780
If I hadn't come, this wouldn't have happened...

298
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,830
Come with me.

299
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,280
What a pain...

300
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,090
<i>Take your hands off her!</i>

301
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,290
<i>Mao!</i>

302
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,720
<i>You're gonna have to beat me.</i>

303
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,680
<i>Can I eat your cheeks?</i>

304
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,160
<i>Your attitude is a blasphemy towards someone who is truly in love. You're a coward.</i>

305
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,700
