4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,610
You see, I didn't take this photo on purpose.

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,070
But to think he's a student of ours...

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,880
- It's not her fault!
- Murai-kun...

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,910
If it's anyone to blame, it's me who couldn't hold back my feelings.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,900
Keep quiet!

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,580
Please excuse us.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,810
I've gotten the student's confession.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,020
The photo of the inappropriate behavior that you have taken was a punishment game between the students.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,810
The two of them are not at fault. I'm very sorry!

13

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,520

- Also,

15
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,000
I can prove that the two of them are not in a romantic relationship.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,080

Please don't lose your focus until it's over.

42

Please don't blame yourself, Tetsuko.

We're glad that you didn't get fired from the school.

Why are you here?

47
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,200
Training.

48
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,390
I heard about what happened.

49
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,480
"Don't worry about me."

50
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,660
You were so competitive and brutal,

51
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,840
and if you're feeling bad about it now, I'm totally fine.

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,370
The way you said it...

53
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,370
Anyway, I'm currently dating. With someone else.

54
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,060
What? With whom?

55
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,140
Okay. Back to training.

56
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,680
Is that what they call "youth"?

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,390
Is that it?

58
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,600
Opportunity doesn't come knocking twice.

59
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,230
That is called love.

60
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,910
But...

61
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,750
there are people who don't give up.

62
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,050
He's not as weak as you think.

63
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,780
For sure.

64
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,210
I know that.

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,190
<i>Saying that I know, was a lie.</i>

66
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,190
<i>Sensei, why won't you look me in the eye?</i>

67
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,790
<i>Are your ears still pierced?</i>

68
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,890
<i>Come with me.</i>

69
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,040
<i>Okay!</i>

70
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,890
I feel I should apologize to you, after all.

71
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,720
Is that so?

72
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,330
For all that you did to save me.

73
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,210
I'm very sorry.

74
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,870
That's the part about you... that I like.

75
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,450
You self-proclaimed you're a geek, and a woman of steel.

76
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,250
If being alone is what you want in life, you should follow it through.

77
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,390
But you're unable to do that, right?

78
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,240
Do what your heart tells you to.

79
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,430
But...

80
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,670
what are you going to do with Murai?

81
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,080
There's no evidence,

82
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,530
but there was a teacher who was rumored to be involved with a student.

83
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,750
That teacher denied everything,

84
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,840
but that didn't stop the rumors from disappearing completely.

85
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,520
And that teacher changed workplaces to protect the student.

86
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,700
However,

87
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,480
I'm sure the student who's left behind

88
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,700
must have continued to struggle.

89
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,090
And again, the teacher also...

90
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,340
But...

91
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,930
that student will one day become an adult who can walk alone.

92
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,930
Perhaps that was what the teacher believed in,

93
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,460
and thus made the decision to leave?

94
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,520
You may be right.

"and we remember each other,"

178
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,470
"wouldn't that be called fate?"

179
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,400
"Wouldn't that be called real love?"

180
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,040
"Jeez... I get it, I get it."

181
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,600
Then that's if we remember, alright? However,

182
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,300
if I've forgotten,

183
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,150
it won't be fair if you force me to remember.

184
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
That's the rule, okay?

185
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,860
"Understood."

186
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,560
"If you've forgotten,"

187
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,060
"when that time comes..."

188
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:00,380
<i>When that time comes, I will stand the test of fate!</i>

189
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,730
No wonder I couldn't turn away from you.

190
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,590
Those eyes.

191
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,150
Thank you.

192
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,540
Ayano-san.

193
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,160
I have... always been thinking about you.

194
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,820
Even though you were just a kid then.

195
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,010
Ah, gosh... that's the rule, huh?

196
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,530
It's been a while.

197
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,040
Things going well for you?

198
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,250
Yes.

199
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,560
She's caught the eye of one hell of a guy.

201
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,240
<i>The day when she finds happiness in real life.</i>

202
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,520
My duty is over.

203
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,400
Sire,

204
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,420
please take care.

205
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,840
Same for you too.

206
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,250
We can still do something!

207
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,020
After all, Murai and Lord Hitotose both look alike in the first place! Right?

208
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,040
Am I right?

209
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,180
He's no longer here.

I panicked when you suddenly wanted to form a band.

212
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,650
Huh?

213
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,840
So you skipped school to practice for this?

214
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,940
Hey.

215
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,850
Okay, okay, okay.

216
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,180
Kiss! Kiss!

217
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,380
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

218
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,610
Wait, wait, wait! In the first place, I'm a teacher, and you're a student.

219
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,460
I may have remembered everything, it doesn't mean we've established a romantic relationship.

220
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,520
Sensei? What's wrong?

221
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,340
<i>I'm... a ”Sensei.”</i>

222
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,240
<i>Idiot! I should have realized it earlier!</i>

223
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,370
<i>Someone was always there for me, protecting me.</i>

224
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,730
<i>I was never alone!</i>

225
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,730
<i>That's why... that's why... I'll also be present!</i>

226
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,690
<i>Right here. I have to be here for someone!</i>

227
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,410
I won't quit being a teacher!

228
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,340
How peaceful.

229
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,080
Yes, it is.

Also known as Tetsuko.

233
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:04,140
I don't mind you calling me Tetchan if you think we're close enough.

234
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,630
I'll hand out the worksheets now.

Hey, stop smiling and work on the lesson plans.

237
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,570
What? I'm not smiling.

238
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,040
See you.

239
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,100
I thought you'd look for me.

240
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,270
What?

241
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,620
About the career discussion.

242
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,710
You won't listen to anything I say.

243
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,790
That's right.

244
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,250
This part of him is both cute and terrifying at the same time.

245
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,420
Don't appear till I get home.

246
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,170
You were the one who summoned me.

247
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,930
Surprisingly, you're one shrewd lady.

248
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,770
I'm just accepting what I like.

249
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,970
I've decided not to hide myself.

250
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,650
Then why don't you accept him then?

251
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,100
Don't hide it.

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,260
What does "kekkon shite kudasai" here mean?

253
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,130
"Please marry me."

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,950
Sure. Let's get married.

Still too early.

260

Sensei. Which do you prefer, Guam or Hawaii?
