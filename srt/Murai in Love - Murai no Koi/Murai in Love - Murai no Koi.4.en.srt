8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,720
<i>I first met Hitotose-kun four years ago.</i>

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,830
<i>At that time, I just entered university and was lost in life.</i>

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,980
<i>I saw him on the streets,</i>

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,180
<i>and I was unable to take my eyes off him.</i>

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,290
<i>Why...</i>

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,700
<i>do you like Hitotose?</i>

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,060
<i>I'm sure it's not just about his looks.</i>

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,310
<i>I think it's not his appearance.</i>

16
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,770
<i>What I saw in his eyes...</i>

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,250
<i>were the sparkles inside.</i>

18

<i>I don't have that many friends, but it was exactly the same as someone that I knew.</i>

19

Teacher?

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Murai-kun.

21
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,450
Do you like Murai?

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,690
Aren't you dreaming too much?

23
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,800
He's just a normal high school student.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,000
He always looks sleepy and is a problematic guy.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,700
Do you feel happy to put down your own friend?

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,660
What? I don't mean that.

27
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,750
Murai and I are... Ouch!

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,740
Why did you do that?

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,380
Chi-chan said it was a sensei.

30
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,870
Is the person whom he likes a sensei?

31
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,500
He said he wants to marry her.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,660
All the best to you.

33
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,970

Sensei?

72
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,990
I lied about having an appointment.

73
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,120
And I made up another lie to come here.

Okay. See you then.

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,280
Thanks for the mask.

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,850
It's unforgiveable.

I thought you weren't the type to get angry easily.

83
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,210
Five seconds.

84
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,160
No, give me three seconds.

85
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,020

"You gave it away"?

102
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,900
You said you would continue to play it before marrying the bassist Tenten.

103
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,060
Don't mention that name to me!

104
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,130
Tenten is my dark history!

105
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,670
Dark history!

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,430
I don't want to hear it at all.

107

You are not fit to call me <i>Brother</i>!

What?

140
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,140
I said, "I would like your blessing to marry your sister."

141
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,900
What?

142
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,740
- I said, <i>Please let me...</i>
- Mao!

143
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,850
My brother Mao Tanaka is a police officer.

144
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,180
He's usually a good young man,

145
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,890
but it involves me, he is prejudiced...

146
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,440
I understand.

147
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,460
Because you are important to him, just like you are to me.

148
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,410
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,480
Can I challenge your brother?

150
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,200
What?

151
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,560
I will try my best.

152
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,430
You still haven't had enough after getting beaten up like this?

153
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,600
Because I want him to acknowledge our marriage.

154
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,140
You have not even asked my opinion.

155
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,060
So if I manage to beat him,

156
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,230
can I eat your cheeks?

157
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,170
What? What?

158
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,700
What do you want to do?

159
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,500
When I saw your brother fondling your cheeks,

160
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,960
<i>I thought that was nice.</i>

161
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,010
When I woke up this morning, I thought of your cheeks.

162
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,200
During summer holidays, I woke up three days consecutively thinking about this.

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,980
Do you think I'm a bread?

164
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,280
No one can do that to me, except my brother.

165
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,870
Oh, the extra class is starting.

166
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,000
Murai-kun, you don't have to join the class.

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,990
No, I will.

168
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,150
I want to see you, even it's for a second.

169
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,650
Did he really say that?

170
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,360
Tell him that I'll be waiting for him.

171
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,410
- Do you think I'll say it to him?
- Thank you for the food.

172
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,460
How long will you stay here?

173
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,960
I'm leaving tomorrow.

174
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,850
- What about work?
- I took a leave.

175
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,920
- Aren't you going home?
- I already went back before coming here.

176
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,420
Why did you come here?

177
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,940
That reminds me.

178
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,970
Doesn't that student look like this character? They look similar.

179
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,390
I would've been charmed if not for my strong will.

180
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,160
- That's right.
- Yes.

181
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,050
What about his heart?

182
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,340
What?

183
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,070
Do you like his heart?

184
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,990
I don't know. I've never been in love before.

185
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,950
What about Tenten?

186
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,610
He's just waving to me on the opposite side of Ganges River.

187
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,270
There's a side of you I don't know.

188
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,900
Okay, please eat the bittergourd.

189
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,360
No, I won't.

190
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,190
Didn't you use to eat it? Quick finish everything.

191
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,340
- Impossible.
- Just a mouth will do.

192
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,090
<i>Yuukatan-sama. Thank you for exchanging the convenience store</i>

193
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:31,910
<i>limited edition bromide for Hitotose. I'm waiting at the cafe in front of the station with the bromide of Kenshin Uesugi.</i>
(bromide: commercial photographic portraits)

194
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,390
<i>I'm dressed in a white blouse.</i>

195
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,950
Are you Tanaka-san?

196
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,920
Nice to meet you, Yuukatan-sama. I am...

197
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,170
<i>I've seen this uniform before.</i>

198
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,470
Can I ask who you are?

199
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,570
You are Tanaka Sensei from Class 2-1. Am I right?

200
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,740
Do you mean the Tanaka who's in a bad state?

201
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,730
- Princess! Can you hear me?
- Princess!

202
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,270
Surely Yuukatan-sama...

203
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,410
- can't be a student at my school.
- Take your medicine!

204
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,090
Please get well after seeing this.

205
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,040
Do you have the antidote? Please save her.

206
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,690
This!

207
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,560
Princess!

208
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
His name is Murai-san, but he looks like Hitotose.

209
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,170
You are lost for words, right?

210
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,160
- Dearest Sister.
- What, my little sister?

211
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,060
I think Murai-san is in Class 2-1.

212
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,670
- You are mistaken.
- We have not said anything.

213
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,010
Even if you say anything, it's wrong.

214
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,340
With all due respect, what we've said now are all true.

215
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,200
What do you mean by "true"?

216
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,230
You are the one whom Murai-san likes!

217
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,320
Bromide! Thank you very much.

218
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,340
To have a fave beyond your own dimension, can you keep your sanity?

219
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,930
Have you both talked about your feelings?

220
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,860
- Or are you already attached?
- Of course not!

221
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,460
What are you doing?

222
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,890
I'm training myself.

223
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,370
Why?

224
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,650
A battle is coming.

225
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,250
- Hirai.
- Yes?

226
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,660
Have you ever eaten someone's cheeks?

227
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,810
No.

228
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,590
I see.

229
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,600
Why? Do you want to eat someone's cheeks?

230
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,300
Yes.

231
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,630
If possible, I would like to hold it in my mouth

232
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,310
and chew it slowly.

233
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,110
That sounds erotic.

234
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,260
Can I take a video?

235
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,720
If you want to grow muscles, you need to eat meat. Meat!

236
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,690
- How about a rice ball?
- You've already had a lot of rice balls.

237
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,200
Yayo-chan?

238
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,110
What is this video? You are doing it the wrong way.

239
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,020
You should do a squat... this way!

240
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,730
Do not push the knee forward.

241
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,130
Did you send her the video?

242
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,050
Yes, we exchanged contacts.

243
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,580
<i>[Second semester]</i>

244
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,260
- Is something going on between you and Murai?
- What?

245
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:23,070
He's been sleeping in class since the second semester, and it never happened before.

246
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,470
But I think he was awake during my classes.

247
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,550
Is that  because he likes you?

248
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,450
Of course not!

249
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,910
I'm just joking. You look scary.

250
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,610
It's good to be in the arts course.

251
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,000
The only thing to keep me alive in the second semester might be the school festival.

252
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,020
Hello...

253
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,440
Wow.

254
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,010
Hey, Tetsuko.

255
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,010
I have a question to ask.

256
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,940
About Murai?

257
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,580
Is something troubling him lately?

258
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,090
Recently, he seems to be feeling sleepy.

259
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:28,600
You're right, Tetsuko. Do you feel lonely without him around?

260
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,960
I'm just worried as a teacher.

261
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,200
Oh yes, you're a teacher.

262
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,570
You have no obligations as a teacher towards us, so why not try others instead?

263
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,640
Aren't you friends with Murai-kun?

264
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,920
Did you become his girlfriend?

265
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,720
No. Of course not.

266
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,710
Oh, she just made it clear.

267
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,160
<i>Stupid brats.</i>

268
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,850
I like the way that you are.

269
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,380
And for that, let me tell you.

270
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,210
Murai is training his body now.

271
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,940
He's doing it for your sake.

272
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,050
For me?

273
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,300
Your arms are not going up.

274
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,660
Reach your limit of five times. You can do it!

275
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,040
Eh? What about your limit?

276
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,760
Sensei.

277
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,100
Everyone is worried about your lazy attitude in class.

278
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,000
Please stop what you are doing.

279
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,240
Chi-chan.

280
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,530
You, during the festival...

281
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,420
Won't you acknowledge your feelings? Just say it if you like him.

282
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,330
Leave if you can't do it.

283
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,870
I've liked him ever since ten years ago.

284
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,030
Just leave him alone. You don't need to come here purposely.

285
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,040
Your attitude is a blasphemy towards someone who is truly in love.

286
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,820
You are only feeling lonely, right? You just like the feeling of being pursued.

287
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,590
It's just all beautiful talk. You won't acknowledge yourself as being weak.

288
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,770
You're a coward.

289
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,170
You are a cafe au lait woman who doesn't make things clear.
<i>(T/N: cafe au lait woman: a woman who thinks highly of herself)</i>

290
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,580
You'd better disappear from this world!

291
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,410
Yayo-chan.

292
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,040
This girl...

293
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,940
Lonely? Egoistic?

294
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,280
A coward? Bring it on!

295
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,240
Everyone has a little rabbit or two inside their hearts.

296
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,500
I will make things clear to you!

297
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,080
- Murai-kun, I allow you to eat them.
- Eh?

298
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,500
If you beat my brother, you can eat them! My cheeks are for you!

299
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,670
Eh!

300
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,310
Only if you win. If you win, I'll acknowledge you.

301
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:25,000

It will be a real battle between the challenger and champion. I'll take her away from you!</i>
