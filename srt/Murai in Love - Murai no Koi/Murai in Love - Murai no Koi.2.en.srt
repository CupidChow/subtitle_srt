Murai-san with blonde hair!

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,300
I can already see the Love Scrolls fandom going crazy!

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,020
Hey! Hitotose just came to the real world!

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,120
Did you just say Hitotose?

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,480
<i>[Hitotose: "That's a natural reaction all because I like you, my kitten."]</i>

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,370
Hitotose, a character from "Sengoku Scrolls: Love in Bloom,"

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,960
also known as Love Scrolls, is a ninja of the Date Army.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,360
In particular, Hitotose is known for his reckless behavior

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,980
and has many diehard fans.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,030
He's very hard to play rated at the advanced Platinum A++ level.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,850
That's a lot of information.

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,330
But there's no doubt he looks exactly like Murai.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,250
Hitomi-chan, can you lend me this game?

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,620
Of course, I can.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,170

- Yes, Principal?
- This won't do for the new employee training report.

- Redo it by Monday.
- What?

Hey, there has to be something about this game right?

58
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,580
Yesterday, Sensei suddenly

59
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,780
said "Hitotose-kun,"

60
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,800
"I already have Hitotose-kun."

61
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,550
<i>Hey, my kitten.</i>

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,280
<i>Your hair pin flew off from the intense training.</i>

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,980
<i>Here, returned.</i>

64
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,790
<i>Isn't that a lively hairpin.</i>

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,620
<i>[Shut up!!!] [Outstandingly fresh ♡] [Now's the time!! (Shoulder bump)]</i>

66
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,620
<i>[Outstandingly fresh ♡]</i>

67
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,660
Outstandingly... fresh.

68
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,660
<i>You're the cutest in this country...</i>

69
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,090
Also,

70
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,310
Sensei was clearly flustered

71
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,360
and avoided making eye contact with me after I dyed my hair blonde.

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,980
Then she definitely plays Love Scrolls!

73
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,710
Not only that!

74
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,890
The fact that she can't look at blonde Murai now

75
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,170
means that Tetsuko thinks of Hitotose as-

76
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,640
That's why I can't afford to lose!

77
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,610
At least not to him.

78
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,110
I'm done with preparations for the quiz.

79
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,030
I also redid the Career Plan form.

<i>I can't believe she's posting first thing in the morning!</i>

83
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,470
<i>She drew a early morning shot of Hitotose-kun!</i>

84

<i>Yuu-katan is basically a God!</i>

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,470

<i>I screwed up!</i>

89
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,500
Hey, what was that?

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,850
She smiled! She definitely smiled.

91
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,770
So she can actually make those expressions too?

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,420

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360

You...

97
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,970
I saw you working hard through the window

98
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,690
and just felt like snapping this.

99
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,720
Thank you.

100
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,110
Ah.

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,430

102
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,590

How's it going? Do you think you'll be able to beat Love Scrolls?

112
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,370
No, I'm still far off.

113
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,420
I can't compare with Hitotose-

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,330
You're very close.

115
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,640
In return, could you also do us a favor?

116
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,470
- What?
- We never said anything about lending the game to you for free.

123
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,560
It's shockingly realistic!

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,990
Even the people not here for Hitotose will be super excited!

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,790
Excuse me but what is this...

00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,990
Today we're selling dearest Sister's newest <i>doujin</i> works.

127

If you help us with sales,

128
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,170

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,990
I didn't think I'd see you here.

143
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,330
Welcome

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,720

Who's that?

146
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,870
Hey, can I film a video? It should be okay right?

147
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,500
<i>How do I look? This should be spot on, right?</i>

<i>Here, returned.</i>

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,660
<i>I see.</i>

150
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,180
<i>So that's what this is about.</i>

151
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,950
What?

152
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,070
So you knew everything.

153
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,890
<i>You knew everything</i>

154
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,440
and totally mocked me.

155
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,570
"Mocked you"?

156
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,310
It must have been a whole lot of fun for you!

157
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,830
<i>A Mongolian chop?</i>

158
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,190
Are you okay with being misunderstood like that?

159
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,550
But there's nothing I can do now.

160
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,120
I thought I could win if I beat the game.

161
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,040
I thought she'd pay attention to me,

162
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,290
but I was wrong.

163
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,580
<i>No matter how much our eyes meet, she's not looking at me</i>

164
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,140
<i>but at Hitotose.</i>

165
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,890
But if it were Hitotose, he'd chase after her.

As the Murai-san Defense Squad since young, we've believed and followed you until now.

Murai-san where there's a will, there's a way.

168
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,960
This world is filled with different preferences.

169
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,810
Now's the time to give it your all, Murai-san!

170
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,540
I finally realized.

171
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,520
I was being made a fool by my student all along!

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,710
Indeed that would make sense. It's a cruel trick by an honors student

173
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,270
to socially obliterate a new teacher!

174
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,960
It's all in the past, My Lady! Let's sing and forget all about it!

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,770
Making a fool out of me!

178
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,710
Hey, wait!

179
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,160
She's disguised, but it's probably Tetsuko!

180
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,120
- For instance,
- Oh.

181
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Yes?

182
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,770
If I like someone who doesn't exist,

183
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,890
and someone who looks exactly like them actually appears

184
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:10,790
and told me "I like you,"

185
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,320
what should I do?

186
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,120
That's totally Murai-

187
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,200
Well that must be pretty great news. For me, that'd be someone who looks like Audrey Hepburn.

188
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,700
But they'll also feel hurt.

189
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,570
Because I'm not actually <i>seeing</i> her.

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,330
<i>I felt like I had no place to belong to in middle school.</i>

191
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,040
<i>Going to school seemed useless.</i>

192
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,200
<i>What the hell. Why are you here again? You're so annoying.</i>

193
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,630
<i>Blue cherry blossoms. Red and purple leaves.</i>

194
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,390
<i>You see a world that is unknown to me.</i>

195
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,800
<i>You must think it's a weird drawing.</i>

196
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,420
<i>Not at all.</i>

197
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,750
<i>I like it.</i>

198
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,320
<i>Your art.</i>

199
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,670
<i>I was happy. He was the first one to see me for who I was.</i>

200
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,440
<i>Murai.</i>

201
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,390
Look at this.

202
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,840
<i>So cute!</i>

203
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,790
This is the face that has his gaze set on you.

204
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,470
Do you see a single lie on this face?

205
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,240
<i>Are you embarassed?</i>

206
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,890
He's so cute!

207
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,310
Right? Murai's super cute.

208
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,270
I don't care who you like!

209
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,270
But that doesn't mean you can just ignore him like that.

210
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,360
Murai isn't a knockoff of anyone else!

211
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,430
Sensei,

212
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,190
have you really seen Murai for who he is?

213
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,800
<i>Sensei, why won't you look me in the eye?</i>

214
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,630
He's my student.

215
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,880
Tetsuko?

216
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,770
Say any more, and I'll kill you!

217
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,320
<i>Go, Tetsuko! Go for it!</i>

218

219

220
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,450
<i>Someday...</i>

221
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,230
<i>It's true that I was escaping,</i>

222
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,160
<i>not facing my own intentions while neglecting his feelings.</i>

223
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,120
<i>I'm such a coward.</i>

224
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>Run, Tanaka!</i>

225
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,670
I...

226
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,230
I found out about Hitotose

227
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,370
and tried to act like him.

228
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,330
It was shallow of me.

229
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,450
But it was to get you to pay attention to me.

230
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,890
Murai-kun,

231
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,210
I know what you're trying to say.

232
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm sorry for disregarding you.

233
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:04,710
I'm flattered that you feel this way.

234
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,040
However, I can't respond to those feelings.

235
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,440
There's two reasons.

236
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,250
First of all, it's because we are teacher and student.

237
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,910
Another reason is

238
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,890
I have someone else I like.

239
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,900
I...

240
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,650
I like Hitotose-kun.

241
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,690
Sensei...

242
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,750
You must think I'm stupid, right? But...

243
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm serious too.
