1
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,280
Elder sister

2
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,399
You used to help me dress up

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,240
Today, I will comb your hair

4
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,320
Sister, look how beautiful these peach blossoms are

5
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, they are

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,640
This year's peach blossoms in the manor

7
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,799
are blooming better than ever

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,640
Young lady

9
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,120
I have one more question

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,159
Sir, may I ask

11
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,359
Earlier, when my senior Yan Shiyi took the Peach Blossom Powder

12
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,560
he was fine

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,519
But others experienced hallucinations from the Peach Blossom Powder

14
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,480
and even died

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,079
But that was because of the red candles

16
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:29,560
That's right

17
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,079
Only the Peach Blossom Powder that has been burned

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,280
can unleash its full toxicity

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Yan was only testing the poison

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,079
and took only a small amount

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,519
so he was unharmed

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,959
As expected

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,359
We also saw red candles at the crime scene

24
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,599
which led us to suspect this

25
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,000
This is something I made based on Young Hero Yan's condition.

26
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,719
It's the antidote for the Peach Blossom Powder.

27
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,959
Although it can't save his life,

28
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,519
at least it can

29
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,359
help clear the remaining poison from his body.

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,319
He'll be able to live a bit longer.

31
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,360
At most, three months.

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,240
At least, one month.

33
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,360
But the old illness in his heart and lungs

34
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,080
is still beyond my ability to cure.

35
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,120
However, I see that Young Hero Yan has a chivalrous heart.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,080
In the future, he will surely meet

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,400
someone with greater medical skills

38
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,400
who can help you cure the poison.

39
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,240
Thank you, Miss.

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,639
Thank you, Miss.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,159
Lord Han Dao,

42
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,479
could you pick a peach blossom for me?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,520
Alright.

44
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,159
Come quickly.

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,360
Sister, help me put it on.

46
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,680
Elder sister

47
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,280
Do you think I'm pretty?

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
My younger sister has been beautiful since she was little.

49
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,520
A face

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
and peach blossoms

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,960
reflect each other's rosy glow.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,759
No, that's not good.

53
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,479
They've taken poison.

54
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,079
The criminals Yun Qingxuan and Yun Xiaoying have both been brought to justice.

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
They committed suicide out of fear of punishment.

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,600
The case of Peach Blossom Manor

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,240
has been solved.

58
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,959
What if those two sisters aren't dead?

59
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,040
I actually think

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,199
everyone should

61
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,839
have a chance to start over.

62
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,439
So you knew all along.

63
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:26,720
Senior Brother,

64
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,279
I need to return to the capital to report on the case of the imperial consort's death.

65
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Come back with me.

66
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,839
I'll ask the imperial physician to treat you.

67
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,680
I'm used to being free.

68
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,959
The capital isn't right for me.

69
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,319
What,

70
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,319
do you still want to hide?

71
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,240
Keep it from me?

72
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,439
Are you afraid you'll die in front of me?

73
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,519
Even Yun Qingxuan said

74
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,720
you have at most three months left.

75
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,360
But didn't she also say

76
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,720
there might be a hidden master out there?

77
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,920
Junior Brother,

78
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,879
if I'm lucky enough to survive,

79
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,000
at your coming-of-age ceremony in three months,

80
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,439
I'll personally place the coronet on you and give you your courtesy name.

81
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,959
This is my promise to you.

82
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,959
And I will definitely keep it.

83
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,959
Farewell.

84
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,680
Junior Brother,

85
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,519
I'm breaking my promise again.

87
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,439
When we parted back then,

88
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,079
I knew you were lying to me.

89
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,639
All that about being at my coming-of-age ceremony in three months

90
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,039
to place the coronet on me and give me a name

91
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,639
was just because you thought

92
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,200
you wouldn't live another three months.

93
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,159
You wanted to find a place to hide

94
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,080
so I wouldn't find you.

95
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,039
The promise you couldn't keep back then,

96
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,639
I'll fulfill it for you now.

97
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,440
Senior Brother

98
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Don't worry.

99
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,399
I won't die today.

100
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,919
Then we'll hold the coming-of-age ceremony today.

101
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,639
This hair crown

102
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,639
was prepared for you by Master before she passed away.

103
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,559
Now that Master has left us,

104
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,200
the eldest brother is like a father.

105
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,639
I will perform the ceremony on her behalf.

106
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,759
Today is an auspicious day.

107
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,039
Qingshan has a son.

108
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,440
He now receives his coming-of-age crown.

109
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,919
With the capping ceremony complete,

110
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,159
may you be virtuous in both deed and heart,

111
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,879
and enjoy long-lasting happiness and longevity.

112
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,440
Senior Brother,

113
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,200
you need to change your habit of frowning.

114
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,559
Otherwise, others will easily guess what you're thinking.

115
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,440
I'll change.

116
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,320
Also,

117
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,559
you must not act on impulse anymore.

118
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,840
Alright.

119
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,440
Don't worry, I will remember.

120
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,080
After I die,

121
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,639
you must take good care of yourself.

122
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,639
Senior Brother,

123
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,440
Senior Brother,

124
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,879
Senior Brother, wake up!

125
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,000
Don't die, Senior Brother!

126
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,720
A gentleman's kindness

127
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,240
should be repaid, just as the valerian returns the ring.

128
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,080
This medicine might cure Young Hero Yan's stubborn illness.

129
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,799
It's alright now.

130
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,720
Master

131
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,279
Now that we part, the mountains are high and the roads are long.

132
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,440
But don't worry.

133
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
My junior and I

134
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,519
will definitely pass on the swordsmanship of the Qingshan Sect

135
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,360
as well as our medical skills.

136
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,000
Master

137
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,679
As we leave this time,

138
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,279
we don't know when we'll meet again.

139
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,759
But rest assured,

140
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,399
my senior and I will work together to punish evil and promote good.

141
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,519
We're leaving now, Master.

142
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,039
Junior brother

143
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,679
What do you think, after we leave the mountain,

144
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,200
should we take on a young disciple?

145
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,799
Let's find someone quiet and upright,

146
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,799
with extraordinary bones.

147
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,519
No, that's too much like you.

148
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Always wearing a grumpy face

149
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,879
isn't much fun either.

150
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,720
Soon, we'll head straight to the capital.

151
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,759
I heard the Immortal's Drunk at Fanlou

152
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,200
is even better than the Peach Blossom Brew at Peach Blossom Manor.

153
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,960
It's even tastier.

154
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,679
After we visit the capital,

155
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,159
let's head north to see the vast snowy landscape.

156
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,080
Then we'll ride our horses—

157
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,360
No, I don't want to.

158
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,519
If not, let's go west.

159
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,559
Let's see the endless desert and its solitary smoke.

160
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,840
The place where the long river meets the round setting sun.

161
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,480
Or we could go to a small town in Jiangnan

162
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,519
and ride a painted boat in the misty rain.

163
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,000
Do you have any temporary mute medicine?

164
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,360
What, being with your senior brother

165
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,039
makes you so relaxed you don't even need to talk?
