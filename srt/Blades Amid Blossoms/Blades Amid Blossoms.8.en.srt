1
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,399
All things in the world

2
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,960
are always intricately connected through mutual generation and restraint.

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,240
They merge together.

4
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,200
I am fire.

5
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,840
Yunyang is metal.

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,119
Although metal and fire are incompatible,

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,119
they can still form a golden core.

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,719
This is also a kind of harmony.

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,520
And you,

10
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,159
are the most important.

11
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,240
Me?

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,399
Important?

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,400
You are a pool of water.

14
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,040
Water gives birth to all things.

15
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,120
This manor cannot do without you.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,000
An alchemy furnace is just a lifeless object.

17
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,400
Only you are the best living alchemy furnace.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
One day,

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,879
I will make you spit out your inner core.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,359
If I spit out my inner core,

21
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,319
will I die?

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,200
Life and death are your fate.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
It is a fate you should feel honored by.

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,000
I will let you enjoy all the riches of the world.

25
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,599
And I will make you suffer all the pains of love.

26
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,599
Only in this way

27
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,400
by cutting off your mortal spirit

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,319
and destroying your feelings,

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,120
can you refine the best inner core.

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,199
Aren't you afraid I'll tell Yunyang?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,319
He is my son.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,240
I know him better than anyone.

33
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,199
Everyone has something they desire.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,719
I know what he wants.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,680
It's a pity,

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,919
what he has always wanted is never you.

37
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,000
But I can promise you,

38
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,960
after you spit out your inner core,

39
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,560
your body

40
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,319
can be buried outside Peach Blossom Manor.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,680
You should know,

42
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,840
to have such a place to return to

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
is truly something unique to you.

44
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,280
Your inner core is about to be born.

45
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,319
What did this pillar ever do to you?

46
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,080
Big Brother,

47
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,360
have you seen Hongxiu?

48
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,400
I haven't seen her.

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,599
Maybe she went to talk to our sister.

50
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,720
Father is obsessed with immortality.

51
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,800
He seeks out immortals and elixirs.

52
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,639
If you ask me,

53
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,639
it's all just an illusion.

54
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,519
Big Brother,

55
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,160
what is it you really want to do?

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,639
Of course,

57
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,759
I want to do what I've always wanted.

58
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't want to repeat Darn it's mistakes.

59
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,759
Blindly pleasing him

60
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
will only drive us mad or to our deaths.

61
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,680
Have you figured it out?

62
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,959
I knew it.

63
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,040
You've always been on my side.

64
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,240
Tomorrow,

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,000
if Father asks you to go to his room again,

66
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,079
just have someone tell me.

67
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,240
I'll go in your place.

68
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,079
Big Brother,

69
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,319
it's my turn these days.

70
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,040
No.

71
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
You're not well.

72
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,000
Take good care of yourself.

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,879
But—

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,360
Big Brother, no buts.

75
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,879
Just do as I say.

76
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,480
Don't worry.

77
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,160
These days won't last much longer.

78
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,560
Yan Shiyi, what are you doing?

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,680
The walls have ears.

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,040
The walls have ears.

81
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,120
This entire manor is filled with their spies.

82
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,120
We need to keep our voices down.

83
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,279
Where were we just now?

84
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,399
We were just talking about—

85
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,040
Yun Yang, Yun Su, and Hong Xiu are all suspects.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,680
Then tell me,

87
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,079
who do you think the killer is?

88
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,120
I actually have a few theories.

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,879
If I report this to His Majesty,

90
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
I'm afraid Peach Blossom Manor will be razed to the ground.

91
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,839
The canary I raised has grown up.

92
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,040
It's become a hawk that pecks out people's eyes.

93
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,000
If you let my sister go,

94
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,839
I'll keep my mouth shut.

95
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,319
Or maybe it's like this:

96
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,879
If you let my sister go,

97
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,399
I'll keep my mouth shut.

98
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,560
There's another possibility.

99
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,959
Yu Niang lied.

100
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,480
Why are you here?

101
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,199
Everything has been taken care of.

102
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,560
Yes.

103
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,959
Very good.

104
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,759
I won't treat you unfairly.

105
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,279
But remember what you should do.

106
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,639
Yes, yes.

107
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,879
So on the surface, Uncle He seems to be with Yun Su.

108
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,319
And also with Yun Yang.

109
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,399
But in reality, he doesn't belong to anyone.

110
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,000
Anyway,

111
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
each of them is a suspect.

112
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Just investigate them one by one.

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,679
They'll slip up sooner or later.

114
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
Yun Su's room is heavily guarded.

115
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
It's hard for outsiders to get close.

116
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,360
You're always good at sneaky things.

117
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,440
You go.

118
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,120
Alright.

119
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
Anyway, I came to the manor

120
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,799
to investigate Yun Su in the first place.

121
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,120
Big brother.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,679
Go back.

123
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,399
Be good.

124
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,039
Stop peeking.

125
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,159
Come here.

126
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,799
Ming'er.

127
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,559
You've grown up too.

128
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,879
There are some things you should know now.

129
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,720
Your younger brother has been weak and sickly since childhood.

130
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,759
He's not even ten years old.

131
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,639
Father, how could you...

132
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,960
As my son,

133
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,360
you should be even stronger.

134
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,679
Yun Ming.

135
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,840
Are you alright?

136
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,559
Let's go.

137
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,399
Yun Ming

138
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,240
Yun Ming

139
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Father took the wrong elixir

140
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,879
and now he can't see.

141
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll go in instead of you.

142
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,720
You should go back.

143
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,600
Brother

144
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,360
Father

145
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,600
Why are you the one coming?

146
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,159
It should be Yun Ming's turn this time.

147
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Yun Ming is physically weak.

148
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:08,960
I'll take his place.

149
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,720
You haven't recovered yet.

150
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,320
You want to take his place?

151
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,159
Can you handle it?

152
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,679
Father, you don't need to worry.

153
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,799
I've always been stronger than Yun Ming since childhood.

154
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,759
If that's the case,

155
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,519
let's begin.
