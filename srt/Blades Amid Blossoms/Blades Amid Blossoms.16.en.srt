1
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,359
Who is it?

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,479
It's Young Hero Yan.

3
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,719
I want you to take me to find a certain medicine.

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,799
What medicine?

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,560
The medicine Yun Yang gave me.

6
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,960
Young Hero Yan, you must be joking.

7
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,000
This medicine...

8
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,320
is the very foundation of our Peach Blossom Manor.

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,159
How could the young master

10
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,400
tell a mere servant like me?

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,599
If you don't know,

12
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,400
then you're of no use to me.

13
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:10,599
I'm useful!

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,519
I'm useful!

15
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,480
Young Hero Yan,

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,200
all the medicines of Peach Blossom Manor are here.

17
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,519
Where is the mind-altering medicine?

18
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,599
Young Hero,

19
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,159
please don't tell the manor master.

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,879
Otherwise, my life will...

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
That depends on whether you cooperate.

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,799
I'll cooperate!

23
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,439
I'll definitely cooperate!

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
Young Hero Yan, look,

25
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
this is our Peach Blossom Manor's

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,039
unique secret recipe.

27
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,400
When using it,

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,479
you must pay attention to the dosage.

29
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,639
Otherwise, it could be dangerous.

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,080
Look at its color.

31
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,120
I haven't arrived yet.

32
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,800
You want to use torture too?

33
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,120
You’re really bold.

34
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,120
Young Master.

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Are you feeling guilty?

36
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,879
Lord Han Dao, please don’t make baseless accusations.

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,840
The suspect Yan Shiyi took Uncle He hostage.

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,639
He tried to sneak into the pharmacy.

39
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,879
To plant Peach Blossom Powder.

40
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,400
To frame me.

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,199
I caught him in the act.

42
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,560
I invited you here, my lord.

43
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,919
Of course, I wanted to interrogate him with you.

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,960
Alright.

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,199
Please.

46
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,879
Suspect.

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,680
Yan Shiyi.

48
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,199
Let me ask you.

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,439
Why did the Young Master give you medicine?

50
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,719
Yun Yang found out about my old friendship with Master Yun.

51
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,879
He wanted to buy me off.

52
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,120
What is the Young Master trying to do?

53
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,719
This is a life-saving medicine.

54
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,080
But I, Yan, cannot accept a reward without merit.

55
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,680
My father doesn’t need a servant like you.

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
But I am a good master.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,479
What benefit is there for me to serve the Young Master?

58
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,680
I can save your life.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
How do I know

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
that in this medicine

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
you haven't poisoned me?

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,879
You're a disciple of the Qingshan Sect.

63
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,240
The Qingshan Sect is famous for its medicine.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,079
Whether it's the right remedy for the illness,

65
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,560
you'll know once you try it.

66
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,480
What do you want me to do?

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,959
I haven't decided yet.

68
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,279
You haven't decided yet?

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,040
You're quite talented.

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,759
You're useful to my father,

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
and even more useful to me.

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,920
When I decide, you'll know.

73
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,680
This medicine can ease your pain.

74
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,639
As long as you belong to me,

75
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,000
you'll never lack medicine from me.

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,319
Young Master,

77
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,879
let me ask you,

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,959
what medicine did you give Yan Shiyi?

79
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,199
Of course, it's the Longevity Powder.

80
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,040
You're lying!

81
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,399
The medicine you gave me clearly causes hallucinations.

82
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,439
Nonsense.

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,519
This is a famous medicine from my Peach Blossom Manor.

84
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,319
You can ask around.

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,319
Many people have taken this medicine,

86
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,560
but no one has ever reported hallucinations.

87
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,680
That's nonsense!

88
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,439
You—

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,120
So you really do want to slander me.

90
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,560
Guards!

91
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,519
Search him!

92
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,399
Wait!

93
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll do it.

94
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,680
Please.

95
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,319
Junior disciple

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,879
You’ve recovered from your fever.

97
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,639
Aren’t you still alive too?

98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
I’m just lucky.

99
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,959
I kept this worthless life

100
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,759
so you could kill me again.

101
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,240
Do you realize what time it is now?

102
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,879
And you’re still saying things like that.

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,439
Some things must be said, no matter the time.

104
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,319
This isn’t mine.

105
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,879
Cold Blade

106
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,519
Cold Blade

107
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,399
Sir

108
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,720
Sir

109
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,160
Sir

110
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,920
Yun Su

111
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,879
Sir, junior disciple

112
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,600
Sir

113
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,399
Sir

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,079
Are you alright?

115
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,480
So this is the hallucinogenic Peach Blossom Powder.

116
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,399
The poison Yan Shiyi always carries.

117
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,079
You’re framing me.

118
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,839
It was found on you.

119
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,720
How could I be framing you?

120
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,000
It seems that unless we use torture,

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
you won’t tell the truth.

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,800
Yun Lang

123
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,639
Why did you lie to me?

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,759
If we can’t share a bed in life,

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,279
then let’s share a grave in death.

126
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,399
Master

127
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,199
You—

128
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,279
Sir, are you going to bend the law for personal reasons?

129
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,319
Who do you think you are?

130
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,399
Even if torture is to be used,

131
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,160
it should be done by me.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Of course.

133
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,679
Then I’ll witness your interrogation skills.

134
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,240
Suspect Yan Shiyi

135
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,600
Is this medicine yours?

136
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,519
Someone is trying to frame you.

137
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,159
Yes.

138
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,600
Do you have any evidence?

139
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,879
Sir,

140
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
The branding iron is getting cold.

141
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,600
What is it?

142
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,279
Could it be that you can't bear

143
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,200
to torture the suspect?

144
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,399
Nonsense!

145
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,000
You—

146
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,919
Junior brother,

147
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,039
If you still don't believe me,

148
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,600
go ahead and torture me.

149
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,639
I'm fine.

150
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,960
Sir, don't fall for his ruse.

151
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,799
I'm best at tormenting villains.

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,919
Applying salt water to a wound that's just about to heal—

153
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,600
Enough.

154
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,120
The suspect Yan Shiyi has been ill for a long time.

155
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,399
If the young master ends up killing him,

156
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,399
I'm afraid you'll be suspected of silencing him.

157
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,919
Five days have already passed.

158
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,879
There are two days left.

159
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,159
Within these two days,

160
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,600
I will definitely find the real culprit.

161
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,159
During these two days,

162
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,840
if anyone dares to torture Yan Shiyi—

163
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,039
Just like this chain,

164
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,919
Young Master,

165
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,639
now your cell

166
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,159
has been requisitioned by the court for investigation.

167
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,000
You have no objections, do you?

168
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,960
If it's for the investigation,

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,080
I naturally have no objections.

170
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,840
But if it's for you and your fellow disciples to cover for each other,

171
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,480
then I can only report it to the capital.

172
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,039
And have you punished.

173
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,960
Of course.

174
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,799
Within two days,

175
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,679
if I can't find the murderer,

176
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,799
I will accept punishment myself.

177
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,279
Alright.

178
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,000
Then let's wait and see.

179
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,519
Shiyi,

180
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,919
you all may leave for now.

181
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:31,919
Yes.

182
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,159
Shiyi,

183
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,840
Shiyi,

184
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,480
Senior Brother,

185
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,799
I was wrong.

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,039
I wrongly blamed you.

187
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,759
Yunyang,

188
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,039
go investigate Yunyang.

189
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,799
But

190
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,679
your purpose in coming to Peach Blossom Manor

191
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,039
was to investigate Yun Su.

192
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,360
Yun Su is already dead.

193
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,080
Your mission is over.

194
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,639
Why are you still holding onto Yunyang?

195
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,679
That's not your concern.

196
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,039
Can't you

197
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,960
think about your own life for once?

198
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,679
I...

199
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,679
am your last family in this world.

200
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,159
I have to help you.

201
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,799
Shiyi...

202
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:29,879
Senior Brother

203
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,200
Senior Brother

204
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,799
After all, how many people truly get what they seek?

205
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,919
Who knows if we spend our days dreaming of being a fish?

206
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,639
What are you trying to say?

207
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,039
People, after all,

208
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,519
have always had insatiable desires.

209
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,440
The Master has already gotten what he wished for.

210
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,080
There's no need to blame yourself.

211
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,559
Xiao Ying is dead.

212
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,720
Yun Ming has gone mad.

213
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,559
The two people I cared about most in this world

214
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,840
have both ended up like this.

215
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,080
The price of getting what you want

216
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,440
is indeed a heavy one.

217
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,240
You are not a fish, so how can you know a fish's happiness?

218
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,200
Now, the Second Young Master is also living

219
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,879
the life he wanted.

220
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,879
Those who are alive aren't necessarily freer than the dead.

221
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,080
The clear-minded aren't necessarily more at ease than the mad.

222
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,799
You really do see things clearly.

223
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,519
I've always been a flawed person.

224
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,120
I've come to terms with some things long ago.

225
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,679
Heaven and earth were never perfect to begin with.

226
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,639
How could people be any different?

227
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,159
I used to underestimate you.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,600
It's not too late to think highly of you now.

229
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,320
Congratulations, Master.

230
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,159
Fishing on dry land

231
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,320
Climbing a tree to catch a fish

232
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,559
What you want

233
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,960
is ultimately an illusion

234
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,360
Father

235
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,840
You are the son I am most proud of

236
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,720
This position will be yours sooner or later

237
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,279
Why are you in such a hurry?

238
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,759
Impossible

239
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,639
You are already dead

240
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,000
I saw it with my own eyes

241
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,120
You can't fool me

242
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,440
Brother

243
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,919
Brother

244
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,919
Did he change your blood again?

245
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,639
Brother, you don't recognize me anymore

246
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,039
It's me, Xiaoying

247
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,799
Xiaoying

248
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,360
You're still alive

249
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,159
Brother

250
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,240
What's wrong with you?

251
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,039
Did you lose too much blood?

252
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,879
Xiaoying

253
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,600
I really missed you

254
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,039
Back then, when you entered the palace in Qingxuan's place

255
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,679
I was strongly against it

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,240
This isn't your fault

257
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,599
It's just that I have bad luck

258
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,720
Now I call the shots at Peach Blossom Manor

259
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Don't go back

260
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,240
Stay by my side

261
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,319
I have a way

262
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,559
It's too late

263
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,920
It's not too late

264
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,160
I have a way

265
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,599
Stay with me

266
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,960
But I'm already dead

267
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,759
Xiaoying

268
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,640
Xiaoying

269
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,960
Stop joking with me.

270
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,200
Xiaoying

271
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,319
Wake up.

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,160
It's all fake.

273
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,319
Xiaoying, wake up!

274
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,759
Fake.

275
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,599
It's all fake.

276
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,160
What are you looking at?

277
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,440
Look again and I'll gouge out your eyes.

278
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,440
Say another word and I'll cut out your tongue.

279
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,759
Who are you?

280
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm the master of Peach Blossom Manor.

281
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,720
Believe it or not, I'll kill you.

282
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,839
Go away.

283
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,279
Go away.

284
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,119
Big brother

285
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,559
Big brother

286
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,720
You don't love me at all.

287
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,440
I'm doing this for your own good.

288
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,119
Why can't you understand?

289
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,559
Then why did you take my Hongxiu away?

290
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm doing this for your own good.

291
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,440
Go to hell.

292
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,039
I'm doing it for your own good.

293
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,640
Sir

294
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,039
There's no breath.
