1
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,719
After the young lady left the alchemy room,

2
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,159
what happened?

3
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,799
After the young lady left,

4
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,840
Yunsu took the pill

5
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,719
right there

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,760
and shed his mortal body

7
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,000
to ascend to immortality.

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
You just watched the whole process like that?

9
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,599
I don't remember what medicine he gave me.

10
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,280
I was conscious,

11
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,120
but couldn't move.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,079
Young lady,

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,959
have you seen the protruding core in Hongxiu's abdomen?

14
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,239
I've seen it before.

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,159
There was indeed something in her abdomen,

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
but whether it was a core,

17
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,799
The so-called core

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,599
has already been swallowed by Yunsu.

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,599
It's impossible to tell if the core is poisonous.

21
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,719
If the core is poisonous,

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,079
why am I unharmed?

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,560
Where did you go after you left?

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,519
I returned to my own courtyard.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Is there anyone who can vouch for you?

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,439
Young hero Yan can vouch for me.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Yes.

28
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,360
Young hero Yan,

29
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,560
young lady,

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,319
you have a heart and lung condition,

31
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,439
so you shouldn't drink alcohol.

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,560
My junior brother just told me the same thing.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,280
Come with me.

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,919
Where to?

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,120
To treat your illness.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,439
Since you are well-versed in pharmacology,

37
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,719
could you tell us

38
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,360
whether this so-called inner elixir

39
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,039
could be fatal to someone?

40
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,120
If the inner elixir is poisonous,

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,479
the first person to be poisoned

42
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,960
would be the one who carries it.

43
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,360
I saw my sister-in-law last night.

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,120
She was drenched in cold sweat.

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,840
She couldn't move at all.

46
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,599
Those are indeed signs of poisoning.

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
But whether it's caused by the inner elixir

48
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,520
or, as she said,

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Father gave her something else to eat,

50
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,879
I can't be sure.

51
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,520
Sir,

52
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,400
my sister-in-law is very weak right now.

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,599
Since you've finished your questions,

54
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,680
may I take her away?

55
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,439
Go ahead.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,840
Let's go.

57
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,319
Slow down.

58
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,960
And what about you?

59
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,639
Where were you at the time of the incident?

60
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,639
We are the master's servants.

61
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,000
Of course, we follow the master's orders.

62
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,000
The master ordered me to keep a close watch on the young mistress.

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,960
At night, I took the young mistress

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,840
to the entrance of the alchemy room and handed her over to Uncle He.

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,599
Then I left.

66
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,319
Yes, yes, that's right.

67
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:58,879
As for me,

68
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,000
I brought the young mistress here

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,479
and then I left.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,919
Last night was an important matter for the master.

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,759
As mere servants,

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,680
we wouldn't dare disturb them.

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,159
After that,

74
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,520
Uncle He and I went to the garden to play chess.

75
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,000
We stayed there until the incident happened.

76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,800
Sir,

77
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,800
if you don't believe us,

78
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,800
you can ask around along the way.

79
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,279
The guards and sentries in our manor

80
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,480
all saw the two of us.

81
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,720
Where is the young master?

82
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,279
Where were you at the time of the incident?

83
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,759
I was in the pharmacy.

84
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,800
The maid in the pharmacy can vouch for me.

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,360
Alright.

86
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
I will question the pharmacy maid in detail myself.

87
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,879
Until the truth is uncovered,

88
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,519
each of you is a suspect.

89
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,879
The one who killed the imperial consort

90
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,680
and the one who killed Yun Su

91
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,639
should be the same person.

92
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,160
The imperial consort is dead,

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,959
and you still haven't found the killer.

94
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,160
Now my father has been murdered as well.

95
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,519
What have you been busy with lately?

96
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,399
Busy catching up with old friends.

97
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,519
Young master,

98
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,839
you must be joking.

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,800
In your Peach Blossom Manor,

100
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,079
there are many hidden talents.

101
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Who knows what secrets

102
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,199
each of you is hiding?

103
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,439
You have three days left.

104
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,959
If you can't find the killer,

105
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,399
Lord Han Dao,

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,079
you can expect to lose your head.

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,199
Guards!

108
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,600
Take care of the master's body.

109
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,399
Father!

110
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Father!

111
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,079
No!

112
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,800
My father still needs to refine elixirs here.

113
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,839
He won't die.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
None of you can take him away.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,720
Second young master,

116
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,240
the master has passed away.

117
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,399
My condolences.

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,399
Father...

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,199
He will become immortal.

120
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,240
The two of them strangled each other to death.

121
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
Could it be that they were like Yun Su,

122
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
and lost their minds?

123
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,680
Earlier, you sought Yun Qingxuan for treatment.

124
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,600
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
She offered me the steam therapy herself.

126
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,720
You were having steam therapy when the incident happened.

127
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,360
Don't you think that's quite a coincidence?

128
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,720
You're suspecting me again.

129
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,839
Hongxiu.

130
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,240
Big Brother.

131
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
Hongxiu is already very weak.

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,839
Can you let her rest first?

133
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,959
Hongxiu.

134
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,959
Get up.

135
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,000
Go to the bed.

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,360
Come.

137
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,199
Hongxiu

138
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,360
We, the father and son of the Yun family,

139
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
either treated her as a tool to escape reality

140
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,879
or as a plaything.

141
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,879
But we all forgot

142
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,480
that she is also a living, breathing woman.

143
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,759
Big Brother,

144
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,240
Big Brother,

145
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,079
you've protected me since I was little.

146
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,639
I've respected and feared you since childhood.

147
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,160
I've always looked up to you in everything.

148
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,079
I always remember

149
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,839
that you are truly like a second parent to me.

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,959
So, whatever you want,

151
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,560
I can't fight you for it.

152
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
That includes Hongxiu.

153
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,079
Big Brother,

154
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,959
do you still remember

155
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,079
the first day Hongxiu came to Peach Blossom Manor?

156
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:45,920
Come.

157
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,759
This is our family's pavilion.

158
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,839
I usually read here in this pavilion.

159
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,360
Yun Ming,

160
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,560
is this where you grew up?

161
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,199
It's much bigger than our Peach Blossom Village.

162
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,160
Peach Blossom Manor is my home.

163
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,680
You can live here too in the future.

164
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,399
I don't want to come here.

165
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm just from a humble family.

166
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,639
How could I ever be worthy of the second young master of Peach Blossom Manor?

167
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,959
Then I'll go with you to Peach Blossom Village.

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,000
We'll farm and weave together.

169
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,160
And have a bunch of kids.

170
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm not going to have kids for you.

171
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,680
You think Peach Blossom Manor is great,

172
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,800
but I don't even like it.

173
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,639
I have my own place I want to go.

174
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,720
Where do you want to go?

175
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,120
I want to go to the capital.

176
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,559
The capital?

177
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,360
Yeah.

178
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,519
The capital is way bigger than your Peach Blossom Manor.

179
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,799
That's where I really want to go.

180
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,960
I want to open a shop in the capital.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
Will your father let you go?

182
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,879
My father?

183
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,639
He doesn't care about me.

184
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
All he cares about is money.

185
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,360
Then...

186
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,679
Then I'll go with you.

187
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,879
Will your father and your older brother agree?

188
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,600
When I grow up, they won't be able to control me.

189
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,919
People...

190
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,039
always grow up eventually.

191
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,879
Really.

192
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,519
Really.

193
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,919
You said it yourself.

194
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,679
What if you lie to me?

195
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,200
If I can't do it,

196
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,519
then I deserve a bad end.

197
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,440
Don't say that!

198
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,480
This is the woman I have chosen to be your wife.

199
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,120
Father.

200
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,559
Does it have to be her?

201
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,159
Her fate and birth chart

202
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,399
are the most suitable.

203
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,679
There is no other candidate.

204
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,320
But my younger brother will be heartbroken.

205
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,679
A member of the Yun family

206
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,519
should not be troubled by mortal emotions and desires.

207
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,600
Do not forget

208
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,519
what we must do.

209
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,000
Ascend to immortality.

210
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,759
As long as you remember.

211
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,360
My blood runs in your veins.

212
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,720
Our Yun family is far above ordinary people.

213
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,879
But how am I supposed to tell my brother?

214
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,840
I will tell him.

215
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,159
He has no choice.

216
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,799
But I never expected

217
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,799
the woman I love would become my sister-in-law.

218
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,000
It's one thing for her to become my sister-in-law,

219
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,799
but Father treated Hongxiu

220
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,440
as nothing more than a tool for alchemy.

221
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,039
If it weren't for Qingxuan,

222
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,559
she probably would have died long ago.

223
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,440
But this is her fate.

224
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Why?

225
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,519
Why does she have to suffer such a fate?

226
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,559
Does our Yun family really see ourselves as immortals?

227
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
Father exhausted himself,

228
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
used every trick he could think of,

229
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,559
all to pursue immortality,

230
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,879
to ascend and become an immortal.

231
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,960
But in the end,

232
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,720
didn't he just turn himself into an elixir,

233
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,879
and die in the alchemy furnace?

234
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,200
Didn't he always say the mortal body is weak?

235
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,159
Now that he's abandoned his body,

236
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,679
has he ascended?

237
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,559
Has he become immortal?

238
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,000
Father,

239
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,679
have you become immortal?

240
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,240
If you have, then show me and explain it to me.

241
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:25,879
Did you see it?

242
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Did you see it?

243
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,720
No one is responding.

244
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,639
There are no immortals.

245
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,879
There is no fairyland.

246
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,879
It's all fake.

247
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,320
The Yun family are just ordinary people.

248
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,000
Do you still remember

249
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,559
the stories Father used to tell us?

250
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,720
He said our Yun family ancestor went into the mountains

251
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,159
and met an immortal.

252
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,080
The immortal gave him a pill.

253
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
After he took it,

254
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,879
he became as light as a swallow

255
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
and lived a long life.

256
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,879
He lived until he was two hundred and twenty before passing away.

257
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,360
After he turned one hundred,

258
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,919
he tried everything he could

259
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,600
to recreate the immortal's elixir.

260
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,600
He ordered his descendants to remember

261
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
that the Yun family had seen an immortal,

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
and that the Yun family almost became immortals themselves.

263
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,639
So the Yun family must become immortals.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,759
I think it's all fake.

265
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,559
It's all a lie.

266
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,240
No one can live to two hundred.

267
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,200
What do you think, big brother?

268
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,679
You—

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,039
You also think it's all fake,

270
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,879
right, big brother?

271
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,799
You also think it's all fake.

272
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,360
You've been waiting all this time.

273
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
You're waiting for a chance.

274
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,240
Now you've got it.

275
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Is that right, big brother?

276
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,879
You killed Father.

277
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,000
What do you think?

278
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,519
I don't know.

279
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,519
I can't see through you.

280
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,559
I couldn't see through Father either.

281
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,120
I can't even see through Hongxiu.

282
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,519
I can't see through any of you.

283
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,960
Brother.

284
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,600
Now that Father is dead,

285
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,919
if you like Hongxiu,

286
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,799
after some time has passed,

287
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,519
I'll divorce her.

288
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,440
I'll let you two be together.

289
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,120
It's too late.

290
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,519
It's not too late.

291
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,639
You're my brother.

292
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,679
Everything I have is yours.

293
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,919
I don't want anything.

294
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,080
I just want her to be safe.

295
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,039
Stay with her tonight.

296
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,159
Hongxiu.

297
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,480
Hongxiu.

298
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,200
Hongxiu.

299
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,799
When Yun Su died, it was just like the imperial consort.

300
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,279
There wasn't a single wound.

301
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,200
Yun Su was poisoned too.

302
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,080
It seems that what Yun Su and the imperial consort

303
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,559
and Yu Niang were poisoned with is the same toxin.

304
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,399
The poison causes hallucinations.

305
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,000
The question now is, who poisoned Yun Su?

306
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,919
The most likely suspect right now

307
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,919
is the inner elixir inside Hongxiu.

308
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,200
Inner elixir?

309
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,120
But if the inner elixir is poisonous,

310
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,320
why is Hongxiu unharmed?

311
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,200
Could it be the tattoos?

312
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,159
I heard Yun Ming say

313
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,480
that eldest brother often gave sister-in-law tattoos.

314
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,039
Tattoos?

315
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,799
Tattoos are actually a form of branding punishment.

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Could this poison have entered through the skin?

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,159
Seeped into the body?

318
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,000
What about you?

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,480
You also had the chance to poison Yun Su.

320
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,799
Lord Han Dao is right.

321
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Father's death—

322
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,759
Everyone in Peach Blossom Manor is a suspect.

323
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,000
But—

324
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,759
The drug that causes hallucinations

325
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,080
is only in eldest brother's possession.

326
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,320
What are you laughing at?

327
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,200
I'm laughing at how you two keep going back and forth.

328
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,440
Now everyone is a suspect.

329
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,200
I think

330
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,000
we should just go check Hong Xiu's tattoo directly.

331
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,720
Wouldn't that settle it?
