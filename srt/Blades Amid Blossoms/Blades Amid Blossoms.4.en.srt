1
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,119
Peach blossom

2
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,759
Apricot blossom

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Peony

4
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,600
Every inch of my skin

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,759
bears his tattoos

6
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,560
I don't know how much longer I can endure

7
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,280
This is a private matter between you and my elder brother as husband and wife

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,039
When I was in bed

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,520
why didn't you treat me as your sister-in-law?

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,960
This is a bruise-relief pill

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,120
I must leave Peach Blossom Manor

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,599
and go somewhere no one knows us

13
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,920
to start over

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,239
You promised me before

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,439
I grew up in Peach Blossom Manor

16
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,719
My mother died young

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,840
My father wandered the world

18
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,239
It was my elder brother who raised me

19
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,719
To make me betray my brother and leave the manor

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,159
I really can't do it

21
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,200
Then you shouldn't have been with me from the start

22
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,359
You know better than anyone how your brother and father treated me

23
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,480
You know it better than anyone

24
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,519
I must leave Peach Blossom Manor

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,239
I can't rely on anyone

26
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,000
I can only do things my own way

27
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,400
Don't do anything reckless

28
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,519
In this Peach Blossom Manor

29
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,879
I'm not the only one acting recklessly here

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,759
Sir

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,960
Why are you only just getting back?

32
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,520
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

33
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,960
The young lady of Peach Blossom Manor

34
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,439
What brings you to a guard’s room so late at night?

35
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,719
Sir, you really like to joke.

36
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,319
Of course, I’m here to ask you for a favor.

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,759
A favor from me?

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,719
Is it related to the case?

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,599
It is.

40
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,719
But also not.

41
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,719
My lady, are you playing riddles with me?

42
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,520
How about I tell you a story?

43
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,039
Do you have to be this close to tell a story?

44
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,000
Being close

45
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,599
makes it easier to hear.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,439
I love listening to stories.

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,800
Please, my lady, go ahead.

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,199
Once upon a time,

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,680
there was a frail young woman.

50
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,240
Her parents had both passed away.

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,319
She had no one to rely on.

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,319
She could only make a living in a brothel.

53
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,960
Until she met

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,479
a wealthy young lord.

55
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,039
He promised to buy her freedom.

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,639
The young woman thought

57
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,639
she had found someone she could trust her life to.

58
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,680
But she never expected

59
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,080
that beneath the lord’s fine clothes

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,840
was a beast in disguise.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,800
The young woman couldn’t take it anymore.

62
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,800
She had to find her own way

63
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,479
to leave this beast.

64
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,680
She wanted a peaceful life.

65
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
One day,

66
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,039
a great hero

67
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,639
descended from the sky.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,480
The young woman saw hope.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,160
As long as I can leave this place,

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,560
a weak woman would agree to anything.

71
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,879
Young Madam,

72
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,480
I

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,319
am not some great hero.

74
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,399
But I think you,

75
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,279
Young Madam, don't seem like a weak woman either.

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,279
I came to Peach Blossom Manor only to investigate the case.

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Other matters have nothing to do with me.

78
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,680
What if I have information about the night the imperial consort was killed—

79
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,759
an important clue?

80
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,560
That would depend on what kind of clue it is.

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I can tell you.

82
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,920
But then you’ll owe me a favor.

83
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
If you don’t repay it,

84
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
I’ll be very upset.

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,319
I’m all ears.

86
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,240
On the night the imperial consort was killed,

87
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,480
someone came to my room.

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,560
Master of the manor,

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
it’s already late.

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,879
Let me escort you back to your room.

91
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:48,959
No need.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
The moonlight is beautiful tonight.

93
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,439
I’ll take a walk in the bamboo grove.

94
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,879
Yun Su is the Empress's father.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,519
The entire Peach Blossom Manor

96
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,319
relies on the Empress's protection.

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,399
Why would Yun Su want to kill the Empress?

98
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,879
I never said Yun Su killed the Empress.

99
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,560
The clues in this case

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,279
still need to be investigated by you personally.

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,519
Just don't forget my contribution in offering advice.

102
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,639
Of course.

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,519
And you?

104
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,160
What about me?

105
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,720
Why is one of your pendants missing here?

106
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,920
I've worn this thing for many years.

107
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,680
Who knows where I lost it?

108
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,120
Then take better care of it next time.

109
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,199
Sir,

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,480
your heart is beating so fast.

111
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,600
It seems

112
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,800
you're not as calm as you appear.

113
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,680
Madam, you've misunderstood.

114
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,079
My heartbeat has always been faster than most people's.

115
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,079
It's nothing to be ashamed of if you feel something for me.

116
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Besides,

117
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,800
you have a beauty in your arms.

118
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:18,959
Come back.

119
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,360
Amitabha.

120
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,079
Amitabha.

121
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,120
Well then,

122
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,040
I won't disturb you two discussing the case late at night.

123
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,319
I hope you find the culprit soon.

124
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,839
And bring justice for the Empress.

125
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,959
Young Hero Yan,

126
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,439
it's been quite some time

127
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,240
since you last drank with me.

128
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,920
Yes,

129
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,279
it's been a long time since we drank together.

130
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,560
Let's do it another day for sure.

131
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,160
Then wait for me.

132
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,600
Don't make me wait too long.

133
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,639
Are you very close with Hong Xiu?

134
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,560
I'm not as close as you guys are.

135
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,240
Get up.

136
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,240
Alright.

137
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,120
Let's talk business.

138
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,800
This—

139
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,720
These were found in Yu Niang's luggage.

140
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,040
How could a maid have so much gold and silver?

141
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,160
Someone must have given it to her.

142
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,720
What use could a maid possibly have?

143
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,000
Unless she's someone else's eyes and ears.

144
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,759
Junior brother, oh junior brother.

145
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,679
See?

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
We're still so in sync.

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,720
You and I are no longer fellow disciples.

148
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,919
Whatever we are, it's fine.

149
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,840
At least for now,

150
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,639
we can still work together on the same thing.

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,080
No need for reminiscing.

152
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,919
Hongxiu just told me

153
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,200
that on the night the imperial consort was killed,

154
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,559
Yunsu went to the bamboo forest.

155
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,559
And there was a white hair in the consort's mouth.

156
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,320
I also found out the owner of that pendant

157
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,600
is actually Hongxiu.

158
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,480
So it seems,

159
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,639
Hongxiu,

160
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,559
Yunyang,

161
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,080
and Yunsu are all suspects.

162
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,159
The Yun family...

163
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,039
They really are a handful.

164
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,200
How did the whole family

165
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
all end up in the forest?

166
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,639
Were they having a gathering?

167
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,600
They've taken the bait.

168
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Come on, come on.

169
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,440
What a big fish!

170
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,399
Do you know

171
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,679
why the fish from Peach Blossom Pool are so delicious?

172
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,440
I do not know, sir.

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,879
Because the water here is good.

174
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
This is living water.

175
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,320
It is also an excellent place.

176
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,799
My daughter Xiaoying died here.

177
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,879
Though it was a tragedy,

178
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,879
it was also a blessing.

179
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,799
If the master can see through this,

180
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,000
then you are truly no ordinary person.

181
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,399
Heaven and earth are a furnace.

182
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,240
You and I are merely coals within it.

183
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
Only by seeing through the mortal world

184
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,519
can one enter the realm of immortals.

185
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,879
Yes, yes, yes.

186
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,879
I am the butcher's knife.

187
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,840
Others are the fish on the chopping block.

188
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,200
Precisely because I am the knife,

189
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,200
the fish here are so delicious.

190
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,440
Master, you are truly wise.

191
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,679
Do you still remember how many people

192
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,679
have been buried in this bamboo grove?

193
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,600
I don't remember.

194
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,960
But I remember,

195
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,440
how many fish I have cooked for you, Master.

196
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,720
Now there are outsiders

197
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,759
who want to see the fish in our Peach Blossom Pool.

198
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,399
Master, please rest assured.

199
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,080
I will definitely muddy these waters for you.

200
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,960
I will make sure outsiders cannot see the fish here.
