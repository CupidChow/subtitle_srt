1
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,159
Do you know whose blood this is?

2
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,039
It's Yun Ming's.

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,880
Lick it clean.

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,479
He shed this blood for you.

5
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,040
His blood

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,640
is sweet.

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,239
Do you know

8
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,640
that I was once pregnant with your child?

9
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,879
Later,

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,159
I used a bowl of medicine

11
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,920
to get rid of it.

12
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,359
I would never let my child

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,640
be born in a place like a cage

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,239
or a tomb.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,239
See,

16
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:32,359
how easy it is to kill someone?

17
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,920
A single bowl of medicine is enough.

18
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,159
You hurt me,

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,359
torment me,

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,280
all because you're a coward deep down.

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
You don't even dare to think of resisting.

22
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,719
You're nothing but a coward.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,640
I'm a coward.

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,079
Put away your sharp claws.

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,319
You're not even as good as a wild flower snake.

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,359
All you do is flick your tongue.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,359
Just scaring passersby.

28
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,319
When a man turns his strength into a weapon,

29
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,639
and uses it on someone too weak to fight back,

30
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,599
like venting his anger on a defenseless woman,

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,759
it means he's reached a dead end.

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,319
All his dissatisfaction with the world,

33
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,080
and his contempt for his own powerlessness,

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,560
can only be vented by bullying the weak.

35
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,479
See?

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
How pathetic.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,919
Are you done talking?

38
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:35,919
What?

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,039
Did I hit the mark?

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,039
You really are useless.

41
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,639
A true coward.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,360
Do you know why

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,639
every time you come back from Yun Ming's room,

44
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,199
I always leave a tattoo on you?

45
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,800
Because tattooing was the first of the five ancient punishments.

46
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,360
Compared to branding,

47
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,319
heart removal,

48
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,439
nose cutting and burning,

49
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,800
tattooing is the lightest.

50
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,840
But also the most terrifying.

51
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,000
I think

52
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,840
you understand this better than anyone.

53
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,800
Using a blade as a pen

54
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,919
carving wounds into the flesh

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
as time passes

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
the pain of the wounds naturally fades

57
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,719
and people eventually forget

58
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,519
That's why tattooing is the lightest punishment

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,959
but also the most terrifying

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,720
However, when ink is pressed into the wounds

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,040
causing them to change color

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
stand up

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
Unless your flesh and blood return to the earth

64
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,680
and dissolve into dust and light

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,519
otherwise

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
those dark ink marks

67
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,920
will accompany your soul for a long, long time

68
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,959
always with you

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,319
I want you

70
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,720
to remember every time you see these tattoos

71
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,360
that you are nothing but a plaything of Peach Blossom Manor

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,439
someone anyone can summon at will

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,160
and dismiss just as easily

74
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,920
The trapped dragon's predicament

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,600
will soon be broken

76
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,279
It's taken the bait.

77
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,399
Look.

78
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,720
What kind of fish is this?

79
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,839
A fish that walked right into the net.

80
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,720
In your opinion,

81
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
will they make a move?

82
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,360
They will.

83
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,319
It's the master.

84
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,199
If they really take action,

85
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,199
will you be upset?

86
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,680
I don't care about those rules of loyalty and filial piety.

87
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,319
On the contrary, I'd feel gratified.

88
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,079
To fight and compete—

89
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,079
that's what it means to be part of the Yun family.

90
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,319
Only then are they worthy to be my sons.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,079
I have to let them do it on their own.

92
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,399
Only then will they truly understand

93
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,399
who

94
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,439
is the true master of Peach Blossom Manor.

95
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,120
Don't ask.

96
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,079
Come with me.

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,360
But I have somewhere else to go.

98
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,600
I don't think you need to go.

99
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,839
You know where I'm going?

100
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,839
You're going to find the second young master, aren't you?

101
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,879
The second young master and the young master are very close.

102
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,959
Do you think the young master will let you go?

103
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
Do you think the second young master

104
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,879
would abandon his elder brother for you?

105
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,600
If you don't leave now, it'll be too late.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,680
There's no time to lose.

107
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,480
Come with me.

108
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,040
Thank you for helping me.

109
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,079
It's too soon to say.

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,120
Sometimes,

111
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,800
you're still too naive.

112
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,639
Many things

113
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,920
aren't as simple as you think.

114
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,279
Just do as I say.

115
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,439
When I arrive in the capital,

116
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
you'll have a share in my business.

117
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,639
Young Madam,

118
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,519
where are you going so late?

119
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,759
Today is an important day for you to deliver the medicine.

120
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,920
Don't forget,

121
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,160
in this Peach Blossom Manor,

122
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,120
who

123
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,839
is the real master here.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,079
It's definitely not you.

125
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,000
You're just

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,920
a dog barking for your master.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
You're absolutely right.

128
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,000
I am indeed the master's dog.

129
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,200
So there's no need for you to be angry with me, Young Madam.

130
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,639
The master asked me to invite you.

131
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,120
Let's go.

132
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,879
Let go of me!

133
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,919
Take her away.

134
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,240
Let go!

135
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:54,960
Second Young Master

136
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,399
I have something I'd like to ask you.

137
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,240
Not now.

138
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
It's about the death of the Imperial Consort.

139
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,080
Please cooperate, Second Young Master.

140
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,120
I said, not now.

141
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,720
The matter of you and your brother giving Yun Su a blood transfusion—

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
Is it true or not?

143
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,120
That's a family matter.

144
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,320
It has nothing to do with outsiders.

145
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,080
A family matter?

146
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,879
So the Imperial Consort's death is also a family matter?

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,000
What do you mean by that?

148
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,679
I suspect Yun Su is involved in the Imperial Consort's death.

149
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,240
No.

150
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,240
It wasn't Father.

151
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,600
Then who was it?

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,120
Yun Yang.

153
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't make baseless accusations.

154
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,600
Xiao Ying is our younger sister.

155
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,759
We would never harm her.

156
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,440
Are you involved in the Peach Blossom Calamity?

157
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,799
It has nothing to do with me.

158
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
Then who is involved?

159
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,799
I don't know.

160
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,960
Don't stop me, I have things to do.

161
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,879
Yunming

162
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,240
What does "coming-of-age" mean?

163
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
It means it's time for you to tie up your hair

164
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,879
and use a hairpin to fasten it.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,759
This ceremony is called the coming-of-age ritual.

166
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,120
Usually,

167
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,360
an elder

168
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,840
or a family member will help you pin up your hair.

169
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,000
My mother passed away early.

170
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
My father doesn't treat me well.

171
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,759
I have no family left.

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,399
I'll protect you.

173
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
I'll be your family.

174
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,840
Really?

175
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,120
Really.

176
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,879
Look.

177
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,960
Does it look good?

178
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,840
It looks good.

179
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,600
Heaven and earth are the chopping board,

180
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,679
and we are both the fish upon it.

181
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,559
Don't worry.

182
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,960
I won't let you get hurt.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,360
Life is like a game of chess.

184
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
We shouldn't just be chess pieces.

185
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,360
What's wrong with stepping into the game ourselves?

186
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,840
On this chessboard,

187
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,399
we are both pieces,

188
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,399
but also the players.

189
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,720
Then in your opinion,

190
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,600
how will tonight's game

191
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,320
turn out?

192
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,559
The outcome is still undecided.

193
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Everyone is eager to make a move.

194
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,559
Soldiers are arrayed for battle,

195
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,000
all lined up at the front.

196
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,840
The spells scatter in all directions,

197
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,480
and all evil is driven away.

198
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,279
Father

199
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,519
Qingxuan requests an audience

200
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,000
Come in

201
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:45,679
What is it?

202
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,360
I beg you to spare my sister-in-law's life

203
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,080
This is none of your business

204
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,960
Remove the inner elixir

205
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
If she is not treated

206
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
My sister-in-law's vital energy will be depleted

207
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,600
She will surely die

208
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,480
I have a way

209
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,559
Perhaps it can be tried

210
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,159
You really have a way?

211
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,519
Thank you, Father

212
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,080
Father

213
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,240
My sister-in-law is extremely weak right now

214
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,919
May I help her back to her room to rest?

215
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,080
No

216
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,559
She must stay

217
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,080
To serve as a witness

218
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,919
Yes

219
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,600
You still want to become immortal so badly.

220
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,840
Xian'er.

221
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,679
You're still alive.

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,039
It's been many years since we parted.

223
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,759
Why haven't you come to find me all this time?

224
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,039
Could it be that you've forgotten me?

225
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,200
No.

226
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,720
Absolutely not.

227
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,039
I've always been thinking about you.

228
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,799
You're lying.

229
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,919
You were with me

230
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,639
just for the three thousand prescriptions of the Qingshan Sect.

231
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:55,639
No.

232
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,279
The prescriptions never belonged to the Qingshan Sect.

233
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,720
Nor do they belong to you.

234
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,519
The prescriptions are a heavenly secret.

235
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,200
Anyone who unravels this secret

236
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,200
can attain enlightenment.

237
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,879
After attaining enlightenment,

238
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
one can become immortal.

239
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,159
I've done all of this

240
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,039
just to wait for this day.

241
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,039
For your own delusional goals,

242
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,039
you've harmed countless people.

243
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:21,759
But in the end, harming others only harms yourself.

244
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,480
You also hurt me.

245
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,600
I owe you an apology.

246
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,720
But I did nothing wrong.

247
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,679
I was never an ordinary person.

248
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,440
I want to shed this mortal body.

249
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,120
I want to abandon my human flesh.

250
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,960
I want to ascend and become immortal.

251
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,480
No one can stop me from becoming immortal.

252
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,279
Since you want to become immortal so much,

253
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,120
then I'll help you achieve it.

254
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,519
Come with me.

255
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,440
Father

256
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,799
Xiaoying

257
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,559
All these years

258
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,960
Have you ever, even for a day

259
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,639
treated us as your daughters?

260
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,879
What are you saying?

261
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,559
If it weren't for me

262
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,240
how could you have become the imperial consort?

263
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,000
We are all just

264
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,360
like fish you keep

265
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,200
Nonsense

266
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,320
Give me back my life

267
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,120
Who is it?

268
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,080
Give me back my life

269
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,399
Give me back my life

270
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,159
It’s you

271
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,960
Why am I here?

272
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,519
Someone, come!

273
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,440
Don’t you want to become immortal?

274
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,600
Yes

275
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
I want to become immortal

276
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,919
To become immortal, you must give up your mortal body

277
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,519
So why do you still struggle?

278
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,960
I understand now

279
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,120
Abandon the flesh

280
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,160
and ascend to immortality

281
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,559
Father

282
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,440
Father

283
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,160
Father
