1
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,640
So you were with me

2
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,240
just for the Qingshan Sect's prescription.

3
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,719
The prescription should belong to the common people.

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,280
Your Qingshan Sect shouldn't keep it to yourselves.

5
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,439
Come back to the past with me.

6
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,079
Weren't our days together good?

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,759
Come back with me.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,600
This is my home.

9
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,719
My wife and child are here.

10
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,119
Where would I go back to?

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,960
If you don't come with me,

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,159
I'll die here.

13
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,200
Then do as you wish.

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,400
They say it's both real and illusory.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,760
With these medicines,

16
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,840
we can definitely return to the past.

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,719
We definitely can.

18
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,040
Yunlang.

19
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,359
Yunlang, you’re here.

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,680
Yunlang.

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,959
I miss you so much.

22
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,439
Yesterday, I clearly took these same medicines.

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
I definitely saw Yunlang.

24
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,159
Why can't I see him today?

25
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,879
Master, it's dangerous!

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,840
Master!

27
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,360
Master!

28
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,759
Master, what's wrong?

29
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,240
Master!

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,840
Master!

31
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,520
Yunlang!

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,360
Yunlang, you came.

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,520
No, Master.

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,680
You finally decided to come.

35
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,080
Master!

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
I am Handao.

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,280
Master!

38
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,319
Master!

39
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,199
Handao!

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,240
Shiyi!

41
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,680
What's happening to me?

42
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,360
You've taken too much medicine.

43
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,919
You absolutely must not take any more.

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,800
The letter mentioned many times

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,159
that she was troubled by love and wanted to create

46
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,560
a medicine that only lets you remember beautiful feelings,

47
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,120
so that after taking it, one could immerse themselves every day

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,879
in the pleasures of emotions and desires,

49
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,960
until death.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,319
I really didn't expect this.

51
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,439
The leader of the Qingshan Sect

52
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,319
for the sake of the master of Peach Blossom Manor

53
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,240
could humble himself and go mad to such an extent.

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,800
This Peach Blossom Powder

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,919
was made to let people immerse themselves in illusions.

56
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,280
If you can't escape,

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,840
you will carry these feelings forever

58
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,960
until the end of your life.

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,159
How do I know this letter

60
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,560
wasn't forged by you?

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
Is the truth

62
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,840
really that hard for you to accept?

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,039
Yan Shiyi came to Peach Blossom Manor

64
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,039
to seek revenge on my father.

65
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,000
He believes your master

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,360
lost control because of my father.

67
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,960
So he killed the imperial consort first

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
in order to destroy my father’s

69
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,360
pride, status, and support all at once.

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,319
Then he planned to kill my father

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,600
to avenge your master.

72
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,839
Yan Shiyi is the murderer.

73
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,279
Not just him.

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,480
You’re also a suspect.

75
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,199
You and your senior came here to avenge your master

76
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,839
using the imperial consort’s visit as a pretext.

77
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,959
Your goal was to harm my father.

78
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,120
Doesn’t that make sense?

79
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,560
Young Master,

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,279
are you investigating this case based on pure speculation?

81
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,519
Other than this letter,

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,079
do you have any other evidence?

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,639
Yes.

84
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,759
Lord Han, please look here.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is the evidence.

86
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,560
Yan Shiyi’s wine gourd.

87
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,279
Why did it appear in my father’s alchemy room?

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,240
Yan Shiyi was at the scene when the crime happened.

89
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,000
A wine gourd?

90
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,680
How do I know

91
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,800
you didn’t steal it from Yan Shiyi?

92
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,079
Are you trying to cover for the suspect?

93
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,839
You said yourself he’s only a suspect.

94
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,240
In my view,

95
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,720
he’s not the only suspect.

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,680
You’re a suspect too.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,720
Me?

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,560
The tattoo on Hongxiu's body is poisonous.

99
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,399
You wanted to poison Hongxiu to harm the manor master.

100
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,639
And take his place.

101
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,040
Doesn't that sound quite reasonable?

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
Sir, you can

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,480
go search my room right now.

104
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
If the ink is poisonous,

105
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,360
then why isn't Hongxiu dead?

106
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,000
How do I know you didn't tamper with the ink

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
in some way?

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Sir,

109
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,600
you are an official appointed by the court.

110
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,319
I'm sure you wouldn't cover up for a suspect.

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,199
How about

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,399
we stop pretending?

113
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,040
Hand Yan Shiyi over to me.

114
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,120
I've fought with Yan Shiyi before.

115
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,160
He escaped from me.

116
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,639
Is that so?

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,800
You must have investigated

118
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,120
and naturally know that Yan Shiyi and I are enemies.

119
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,959
I've been hunting him for three years.

120
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,600
Hunting him?

121
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,040
You two are together every day.

122
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
Do you take me for a blind man?

123
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,000
You're just trying to protect a murderer.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,040
Yan Shiyi.

125
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,600
Young master.

126
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Who the murderer is

127
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,800
is not for you to decide.

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,839
Seven days.

129
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,160
Only four days have passed.

130
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,519
Why are you in such a hurry?

131
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,560
Then I'll give you three more days.

132
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
I'm going to open your acupoints.

133
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,720
Let the medicinal steam enter your body.

134
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,879
This process will be extremely painful.

135
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,240
Try to endure it.

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,079
Thank you, young hero.

137
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,480
Kid.

138
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,920
You're pretty strong.

139
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,759
Didn't expect there to be so many rules.

140
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,240
I'm hungry.

141
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,000
Take one.

142
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,839
Tasty, isn't it?

143
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,480
These are Wang Ji's steamed buns.

144
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,360
Here.

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,480
You hold this.

146
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,160
I'll help you push the cart.

147
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,959
Do you know what this bamboo is good for?

148
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,120
I don't know.

149
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,800
It clears heat and relieves summer heat.

150
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,200
Doctor.

151
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,320
What's wrong with that person?

152
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,679
His name is Yan Shiyi.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,639
He's always stood up for others since he was a child.

154
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,679
Last night,

155
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,799
he saw injustice again and drew his sword to help.

156
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,840
But he couldn't save the person.

157
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,039
He ended up getting beaten half to death.

158
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,200
If you ask me,

159
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,519
he doesn't have long to live.

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,799
Please, save him.

161
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,720
Han Dao, do you really want to save him?

162
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,759
Let's go take a look.

163
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,320
How is he?

164
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,080
Him...

165
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,519
He can't be saved.

166
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Doctor, please, save him!

167
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,919
I'll find a way to earn money for the medicine.

168
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,840
Handao, people die in this city every day.

169
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,559
If you have a heart of compassion,

170
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,759
how many could you really save?

171
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Life and death are up to fate.

172
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,200
Let his fate decide. Let's go.

173
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,879
Doctor, please, save him!

174
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,679
Is there any other way?

175
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,639
Do you see that tall mountain ahead?

176
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,240
The Qingshan Sect is on that mountain.

177
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,000
The Qingshan Sect has three thousand remedies.

178
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
They can cure all kinds of illnesses.

179
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,440
If you can take him there now,

180
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,559
there might still be a sliver of hope.

181
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,360
Please, save my brother!

182
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,799
Our Qingshan Sect saves so many people every day.

183
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,159
How could we possibly save everyone?

184
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,480
Young master, please go back.

185
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,799
My brother is gravely ill.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,159
He doesn't have much time left.

187
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,679
If we go up and down the mountain again,

188
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,039
I'm afraid his life will be in danger.

189
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,039
Please, save my brother!

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,879
If you won't save him,

191
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,960
I won't leave.

192
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,679
Let them in.

193
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,360
Yes.

194
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,200
This is...

195
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,600
This is cinnabar soaked in medicine.

196
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,879
The method to extend your life is a dangerous one.

197
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,360
But it will only last for five days.

198
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,480
You shouldn't overthink during these days.

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,960
And you shouldn't use your inner strength.

200
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
You must always watch this red thread.

201
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,360
When the red thread disappears,

202
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,000
that will be the moment your life runs out.

203
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,279
Thank you very much.

204
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,600
You don't have to look at me like that.

205
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,120
You don't want to marry me.

206
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,159
The person I want to marry isn't you, either.

207
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,799
So you don't need to

208
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,879
put on such a cold, indifferent expression.

209
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,879
Since you're here,

210
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,240
there must be a reason you can't leave.

211
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,679
Likewise,

212
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,799
so do I.

213
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,919
The auspicious time has arrived.

214
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,240
The auspicious time has arrived.

215
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,039
The auspicious time has arrived.

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,679
Yun Ming

217
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,960
Why are you acting crazy in the middle of the night?

218
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,480
Big Brother

219
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,639
I'm getting married!

220
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,960
Getting married?

221
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,240
Marrying who?

222
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,039
Her.

223
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:06,919
Hong Xiu

224
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,360
Why are you standing here?

225
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,320
Come, come, come.

226
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,080
Come.

227
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,799
Come with me to greet Big Brother.

228
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
This is my Big Brother.

229
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,960
We grew up together.

230
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,519
He helps me with everything.

231
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,600
Don't worry.

232
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,840
Even if Father doesn't agree to our marriage,

233
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,840
Big Brother will speak up for me.

234
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,000
Isn't that right, Big Brother?

235
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
Yun Ming...

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,919
Hurry and bow to Big Brother.

237
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
Hong Xiu, bow to Big Brother.

238
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,159
Come.

239
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:37,799
Bow.

240
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,799
Please, Big Brother, help us.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,600
Convince Father to let Hong Xiu marry me.

242
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,519
Yun Ming

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,279
Big Brother, do you also

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,759
look down on Hong Xiu's background like Father does?

245
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,120
Yun Ming

246
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,120
Your Big Brother has already married me on your behalf.

247
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,399
Did you forget?

248
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,360
Nonsense!

249
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
If you don't believe me, ask your Big Brother.

250
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,720
Big Brother

251
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,679
Is what she said true?

252
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,240
Yun Ming

253
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,200
What's wrong, Yun Ming?

254
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,399
Yun Ming

255
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,159
I remember now.

256
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,960
It was Father who had my elder brother marry Hong Xiu in my place.

257
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,039
But it's okay.

258
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,679
It's really okay.

259
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,200
Big Brother

260
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,320
It's fine.

261
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,399
Get a hold of yourself.

262
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,440
Yun Ming

263
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,080
Big Brother

264
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,399
It's fine even if you're already married.

265
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,879
I've already thought it through.

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,519
You just need to write a divorce letter.

267
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
I'll take care of the rest.

268
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,879
You divorce Hongxiu,

269
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,120
and I'll marry Hongxiu.

270
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,559
That way, everyone gets what they want.

271
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,159
Big Brother, you can be my witness.

272
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,200
Yunming

273
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,000
Yunming

274
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,039
Look at me, Yunming.

275
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,159
Get a hold of yourself.

276
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,320
Big Brother

277
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,759
Didn't you say you wanted to help me and Hongxiu be together?

278
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,200
Then write the divorce letter.

279
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,759
Write it now.

280
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,039
Get a hold of yourself.

281
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,960
Yunming

282
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,840
Yunming

283
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,240
Yunming

284
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,559
I understand.

285
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,159
Big Brother

286
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,320
There's no pen or paper.

287
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,840
It's okay, I have them.

288
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,279
I have them.

289
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,240
I have them.

290
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,320
Big Brother

291
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,799
Write the divorce letter.

292
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,279
Write the divorce letter.

293
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,440
Write the divorce letter.

294
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,399
Big Brother

295
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,879
Yunming

296
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,399
Get a hold of yourself.

297
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,960
Father has just passed away.

298
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,200
How could I divorce my wife at a time like this?

299
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,639
And let you marry your sister-in-law?

300
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,919
Why not?

301
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,320
Hongxiu was always meant to be my wife.

302
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,639
I was always meant to be Hongxiu's husband.

303
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,639
I understand.

304
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,559
Brother.

305
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,720
I was bitten by a snake.

306
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,559
Let's go.

307
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:30,639
Let's go home.

308
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,159
Father has three thousand remedies.

309
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,559
He'll definitely be able to save you.

310
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,240
Brother.

311
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,759
My life

312
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,720
was given by you.

313
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,399
My life was saved by my eldest brother.

314
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,240
Yunming.

315
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,000
Yunming.

316
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,200
What exactly do you want?

317
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,000
That year by the mountain stream, my eldest brother saved my life.

318
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,559
Now I'm giving it back to you.

319
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,759
In the past, my eldest brother often gave blood for Father in my place.

320
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,919
I'm giving my blood back to you as well.

321
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
Yunming.

322
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
What is it that you really want?

323
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,039
Write the divorce letter right now.

324
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,480
Write it now.

325
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,440
Give Hongxiu back to me.

326
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,079
Yunming.

327
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,279
Fine.

328
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,519
I'll grant your wish.

329
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,720
All causes for becoming husband and wife

330
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,279
are formed by bonds from three past lives.

331
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,640
Only then are they matched as spouses in this life.

332
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,799
If the bond is not harmonious,

333
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,759
they become adversaries.

334
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,480
Thus, they meet face to face.

335
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,640
Since their hearts are not united,

336
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,640
each returns to their own path.

337
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,400
She combs her hair anew,

338
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,799
and beautifies her brows.

339
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,359
She skillfully displays her graceful figure.

340
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,920
Resentments are resolved and knots untied.

341
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,279
They part ways, each finding freedom.

342
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,480
Each finds their own happiness.

343
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:02,759
Go.
