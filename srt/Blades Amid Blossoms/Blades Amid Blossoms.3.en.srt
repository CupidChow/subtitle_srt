1
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,880
Take it off.

2
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,200
No way, junior brother.

3
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,840
You don't really think

4
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,960
I have an affair with the imperial consort, do you?

5
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,399
Weren't you the one who taught me?

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
To be skeptical of everything.

7
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,679
Take a good look.

8
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,280
Go on.

9
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000
Now you're going too far.

10
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,159
You're clearly taking advantage of your position.

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,840
To take advantage of me.

12
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,159
Are you taking it off or not?

13
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll take it off, I'll take it off!

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,159
How could I not?

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,319
It's not like you haven't seen it before.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,879
What?

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,000
Are you scared?

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Who's scared?

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,439
People are born naked.

20
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,359
What is there to be afraid of?

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,359
I...

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,599
Turn around.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,519
Look carefully, junior brother.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,120
Come.

25
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:36,959
Look.

26
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,439
Do you need me to take off my shoes too?

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
Take a good look.

28
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,879
Are you done looking?

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,319
Aren't you making your judgment a bit too hastily?

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,879
So now you can be sure I'm not the murderer?

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,560
Junior brother.

32
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,120
Sometimes, you know,

33
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,000
what you see with your eyes isn't always true.

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,319
What are you trying to say?

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
I've told you before,

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,039
seeing isn't always believing.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,199
And hearing isn't always the truth.

38
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,639
You have to use this to feel.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,759
And to think.

40
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,479
You're crazy.

41
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,759
You're the crazy one.

42
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,319
Junior brother.

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,919
What do you want?

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,960
Shut up.

45
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,840
What illness do I have?

46
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,960
Your heart and lungs are so badly damaged.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Why don't you get treatment?

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Life and death are up to fate.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,759
I've long since stopped caring.

50
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,439
Fate.

51
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,840
I don't believe in fate.

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,039
Junior brother.

53
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,919
You really haven't changed at all.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,479
People who don't change in this world

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,639
are rare.

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,080
I came to this Peach Blossom Manor before you.

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,479
Every blade of grass and tree here,

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,039
every mountain and stone,

59
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,159
even the people here,

60
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,879
I'm more familiar with them than you are.

61
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,960
I can help you.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,080
How about it?

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,639
You only have seven days left.

64
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,080
And one day is almost over already.

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,800
If you don't say anything, I'll take it as a yes.

66
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,080
Then we brothers

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,159
can happily investigate cases together again.

68
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,680
But before we start investigating,

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
we should have a drink together.

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,199
You haven't really changed either.

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,120
You only care about the present.

72
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
You haven't changed.

73
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't dare to change.

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,319
Open it.

75
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,959
These chains can't hold you, can they?

76
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,399
Sir

77
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,879
Everyone in the manor has been checked.

78
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,879
No one has any scratch marks.

79
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,040
But there are a few people who are difficult to check.

80
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,560
I'll find a way to check the rest.

81
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,720
Why is it this pavilion again?

82
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,639
Kan represents water.

83
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,800
We need to head west.

84
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
That's right.

85
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,680
Miss

86
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,720
Young Master Yan did find the correct direction.

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,680
However,

88
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,319
he didn't notice the formation in this bamboo forest.

89
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,600
As I suspected.

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,079
This bamboo forest

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,720
is rather strange.

92
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,199
Every bamboo stalk in this forest

93
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,759
is planted according to the positions of Qimen Dunjia.

94
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
If you don't know the method,

95
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,360
you'll get trapped inside.

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,439
And the only ones who can break the formation

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
are the Yun family from Peach Blossom Manor.

98
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,600
So, in that case,

99
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,680
Miss, are you planning to take me inside?

100
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,480
Yes.

101
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,720
Then, the reason you came here...

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,040
I suppose that's true.

103
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,000
You're here to investigate the death of the imperial consort, aren't you?

104
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,800
I won't let my sister die in vain.

105
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,360
I have to do something.

106
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,439
But as for you, Young Master Yan,

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,279
you were clearly already detained,

108
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,160
yet here you are now.

109
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,959
It seems Young Master Yan and Lord Han Dao

110
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,560
are quite close.

111
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,879
Lord Han Dao is my junior fellow disciple.

112
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,759
Except for the fact that he's always trying to kill me,

113
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,639
we are indeed quite close.

114
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,879
The grudge between you two

115
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,720
has nothing to do with me.

116
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,560
Since our goals are the same,

117
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,839
come with me.

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
I was just heading this way.

119
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,040
Young Master Yan, keep up.

120
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,959
Xiao Ying was killed right here.

121
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,160
She’s been afraid of this Peach Blossom Pond since she was a child.

122
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,480
So why did she end up in the water?

123
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,279
Unless someone forced her.

124
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,040
There were no wounds on her body.

125
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,600
And look here,

126
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,600
there are no signs of a struggle either.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,920
As for being forced,

128
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,959
there’s more than one way to do it.

129
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,199
What do you mean?

130
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,560
Think about it.

131
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
Is there any way

132
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,720
to make her lose her fear of this pond?

133
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,319
Dreaming.

134
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,600
Or perhaps,

135
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,600
poisoning.

136
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,920
Yu Niang also hanged herself.

137
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:49,920
I think

138
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,040
she must have been poisoned with something that causes hallucinations.

139
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,519
But...

140
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,800
Miss, let me think for a moment.

141
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,160
The culprit poisoned someone.

142
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,199
The empress's medicine took effect.

143
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,360
She scratched the culprit while struggling.

144
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,240
Young Master Yan has an illness in his heart and lungs.

145
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,240
It seems his condition is quite serious.

146
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,759
Miss, your medical skills are impressive.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,320
I didn't expect that just by looking,

148
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,840
you could do as much as our junior did after checking the pulse for a long time.

149
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,799
Young Master Yan.

150
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,440
Young Master Yan.

151
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
Young Master Yan, are you all right?

152
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,919
Young Master Yan, did you find anything?

153
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:03,879
No.

154
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,639
There was nothing under the water except for aquatic plants and fish.

155
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,639
Nothing else at all.

156
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,480
Aren't you afraid of the peach blossom calamity?

157
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,039
Will it really come true?

158
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,039
It's all nonsense.

159
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,159
How could a few dead people's nonsense

160
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,440
possibly determine the fate of the living?

161
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,039
This place is my domain.

162
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,519
You have nothing to fear.

163
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:25,240
How can this tiny Peach Blossom Manor be called a domain?

164
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,879
I didn't expect your vision to be so narrow.

165
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,840
Why did you come to my room?

166
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,799
Are you here to

167
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,039
investigate the case or just play in the water?

168
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,399
Of course I went

169
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,200
to play in the water.

170
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:57,759
You—

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,240
You sure have time to spare.

172
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,960
I found an important clue

173
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,639
at the bottom of Peach Blossom Pool.

174
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,879
Want to know what it is?

175
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,600
What clue?

176
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
Bring me some clean clothes.

177
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,759
Okay.

178
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,279
Junior brother,

179
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,600
you're so obedient.

180
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,720
There are scratch marks on Yun Yang's back.

181
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,080
Then he's a suspect.

182
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,519
It's just scratch marks.

183
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,759
That's not solid evidence.

184
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,080
He could easily say Hong Xiu scratched him.

185
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,519
I found this at the bottom of Peach Blossom Pool.

186
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,879
Not sure if it's a pendant

187
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,120
or just an ornament.

188
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,360
It looks like something a woman would own.

189
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,159
I went through a lot to get this clue,

190
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,080
and you just take it away like that?

191
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,960
Are you giving it back or not?

192
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,440
Call me "senior brother" and let me hear it.

193
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,759
Don't push me, or I'll kill you right now.

194
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,080
Boring.

195
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,639
You were more fun when you were little.

196
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,399
So dull.

197
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,480
Here.

198
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,440
What is this?

199
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,000
Medicine to protect your heart and lungs.

200
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,080
Then

201
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,519
You didn't secretly poison me, did you?

202
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,960
If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn't need to use poison.

203
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,240
Don't worry.

204
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,759
Once this matter is resolved,

205
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,200
we'll settle things between us.

206
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,080
Alright.

207
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,039
Then go ahead and tell me.

208
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,679
What have you found out?

209
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,120
During the autopsy,

210
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,240
this was found in the consort's mouth.

211
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,519
A white hair.

212
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,240
It's Yun Su's.

213
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,279
So,

214
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,399
Yun Yang isn't the only suspect.

215
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,200
There's also Yun Su and the owner of this pendant.

216
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,120
It seems that on the night before the consort died,

217
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,240
Yun Yang wasn't the only one who saw her.
