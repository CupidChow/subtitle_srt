1
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,079
Before the case is fully investigated,

2
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,240
everyone in Peach Blossom Manor is a suspect.

3
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,000
That includes you, Miss.

4
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,920
Up until today,

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,039
I have only now come to believe

6
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,119
that you have the ability to find out

7
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,560
who killed my sister.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,679
Only by not being deceived by appearances

9
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,960
can one truly see through Peach Blossom Manor.

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,600
And everyone in this manor

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,920
is not as simple as they seem.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,640
That includes Young Hero Yan.

13
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,879
If you know anything, Miss,

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
you might as well say it directly.

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,560
That day, Yan Shiyi and I

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,719
reconstructed the case at Peach Blossom Pool.

17
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,760
I discovered at his Wan Gu acupoint

18
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,280
there were traces of poisoning.

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,200
And this kind of poison

20
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,200
many years ago,

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,640
I once saw on someone else.

22
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,879
You said the moonlight is so beautiful tonight.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,599
Why are you still carrying a lantern?

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,319
There are fireflies.

25
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sending them home.

26
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,400
They're all fireflies.

27
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,560
Do you still need to carry a lantern?

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,400
Rotten grass falls and turns to mud.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,519
It transforms and flutters as fireflies.

30
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,719
So the rotten grass isn't wasted.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,439
It makes one last contribution.

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,080
To be honest,

33
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,439
the people from your Peach Blossom Manor are really strange.

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,240
Everyone's been speaking in riddles to me today.

35
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,360
Young Hero Yan,

36
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,039
I have another riddle for you.

37
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,639
I'm sure you want to solve it.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,599
Sure.

39
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,639
Go ahead.

40
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,400
On the night the imperial consort was killed,

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,159
I went to the bamboo forest.

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,759
This is an elixir personally refined by the emperor's alchemist.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,199
It's extremely rare.

44
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,960
I have stolen this one now.

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,319
If this gets discovered,

46
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,800
I don't know how I would explain it.

47
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,000
You are a noble imperial consort.

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,879
Even if it is discovered,

49
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,560
His Majesty would not blame you.

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,319
Xiaoying,

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
don't forget,

52
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,159
if it weren't for me,

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,599
you would probably have died seven years ago.

54
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,759
Being able to live until today,

55
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,719
and even rise to become a phoenix in one leap,

56
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,319
isn't that the blessing I gave you?

57
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,159
One must not forget their roots.

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,680
I wouldn't dare forget.

59
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,879
As long as you know.

60
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,560
It's just that—

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,479
No "just that."

62
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,280
Don't forget,

63
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,000
your sister is still at Peach Blossom Manor.

64
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,360
Many years ago

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,439
It happened to be the time when the palace was selecting maidens

66
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,360
The one chosen was the eldest young lady, Yun Qingxuan

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,120
But at that time, the young lady already had someone she loved

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That person was the manor lord

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,120
The tutor hired for the two young ladies, Gu Hongyi

70
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,800
The young lady and Gu Hongyi were in love with each other

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,919
They secretly communicated their feelings

72
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,719
After the manor lord found out

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,000
He was furious

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,360
He locked Gu Hongyi up

75
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,319
The young master tortured Gu Hongyi in every possible way

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,360
The young lady threatened to kill herself

77
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,199
She refused to enter the palace

78
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,160
But at that time, Gu Hongyi

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,240
was not as strong-willed as the young lady

80
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,879
He failed to hold on to their love

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,759
Later, I went to the dungeon of Peach Blossom Manor

82
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,079
But he

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Sir

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,600
Sir

85
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,079
Eat

86
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,560
Are you saying

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,920
this kind of poison can control a person's mind?

88
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,639
That's right

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,319
And this poison

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
was developed by my elder brother

91
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,120
I don't know why Young Hero Yan

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,759
was poisoned by this

93
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,519
nor do I know if it has anything to do with my brother

94
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,439
But what I can be sure of is

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,240
anyone poisoned by this

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,800
their actions and consciousness

97
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,120
will no longer be under their own control

98
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,439
If that's really the case

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Yan Shi will definitely die by my blade

100
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,560
Farewell

101
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,759
The eldest lady was heartbroken when she found out.

102
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,160
She wanted to take her own life.

103
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,959
At that moment, the second lady came to see her.

104
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,959
She said she was willing to enter the palace in her sister's place.

105
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,439
So,

106
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,360
when Yun Su learned of their deep sisterly bond,

107
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,600
he threatened them with Yun Qingxuan's life.

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
He forced the imperial consort to steal elixirs from the palace

109
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,920
for his own use.

110
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,319
After the imperial consort and Yun Su

111
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,319
met, they both died at Peach Blossom Pool.

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,480
There must be something suspicious about this.

113
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,920
But there's one thing I don't understand.

114
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,360
Yun Su is your master.

115
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,600
Why did you betray him?

116
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,000
The imperial consort treated me well back then.

117
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,079
I didn't want her to die in vain.

118
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,519
Then why

119
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,439
didn't you tell Han Dao these clues directly?

120
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,040
I don't trust him.

121
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,439
So you trust me, then?

122
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,319
I trust you.

123
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,120
Why?

124
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
Because you are a dying man.

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,399
When a person is about to die,

126
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,759
their words are sincere,

127
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,160
and their actions are kind.

128
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,319
Junior brother,

129
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,680
are you here to spar with me in swordsmanship,

130
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,839
or to take my life?

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,120
I want to know how much of the swordsmanship Master taught you

132
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,519
you still remember.

133
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,639
What Master taught me,

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,160
I naturally remember it all.

135
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,959
Then I won't hold back.

136
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,919
You really have a death wish.

137
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,399
I told you before.

138
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,600
My life has always belonged to you.

139
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,840
But it seems you're too impatient.

140
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,639
You can't wait for the truth to come out.

141
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,080
Why don't you use this sword

142
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,120
to cut out my heart and see for yourself

143
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,120
whether it's real or fake?

144
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,480
Your words—

145
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,080
can I still trust them?

146
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
I've said it many times.

147
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,960
What you see with your eyes

148
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,519
and hear with your ears

149
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,799
isn't necessarily the truth.

150
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,559
Only what you feel here

151
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,519
can't deceive you.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,679
I bet deep down, you still trust me.

153
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,919
You—

154
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,200
your biggest problem is being self-righteous.

155
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,679
You never make yourself clear in what you say or do.

156
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,559
Little junior brother,

157
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
in this world of martial arts,

158
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,879
among all these people,

159
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
there are many things that can't be explained clearly.

160
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,320
If you want to talk,

161
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,960
what could possibly take three years and still not be clear?

162
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,279
But you don't believe me.

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
So what's the point of saying anything?

164
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,840
If I didn't trust you,

165
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,320
I wouldn't have kept this all along.

166
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,039
Hand over the Qingshan Sect's prescription.

167
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,399
We'll let you live.

168
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,200
The things of our Qingshan Sect

169
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,919
will never be given to the likes of you.

170
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,879
Still so stubborn.

171
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,759
Then don't blame us for being ruthless.

172
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,080
Get them!

173
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,440
Little junior brother!

174
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,879
Little junior brother! Little junior brother!

175
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,919
Wake up.

176
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,679
You must not fall asleep.

177
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,240
It won't hurt in a moment.

178
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,240
You'll be fine soon.

179
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,440
Senior Brother.

180
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,360
Senior Brother.

181
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,120
It's cold.

182
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,440
Senior Brother.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,759
Will I die here?

184
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,679
You won't.

185
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
You won't.

186
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,639
Trust me.

187
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Even if I die,

188
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,360
I won't let you die here.

189
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,120
Then we might as well die together.

190
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,639
Junior Brother.

191
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,879
Don't talk.

192
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,200
Dying

193
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,200
isn't that easy.

194
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,639
Junior Brother.

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,679
Junior Brother.

196
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,159
It's okay.

197
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,840
It's okay.

198
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,360
It's okay.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,279
I just want to ask you one thing.

200
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,240
Did you kill Master?

201
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,039
Yes.

202
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,759
Master wanted to kill you.

203
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,039
If I hadn't acted,

204
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,279
you would have died.

205
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,919
Junior Brother.

206
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,039
This is the last time I'll say this to you.

207
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,159
If you still don't believe me,

208
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,000
I have nothing more to say to you.

209
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,879
You,

210
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,720
just need to understand one thing.

211
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,679
I

212
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,679
would never hurt you.

213
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,279
Come on,

214
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,200
put this away safely.

215
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,320
The walls have ears.

216
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,519
Let's talk somewhere else.
