1
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,120
Why are you sneaking around?

2
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,879
You startled me.

3
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,640
Junior brother,

4
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,040
Are you also suspicious of Yun Qingxuan?

5
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,200
Yes.

6
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,280
But also no.

7
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,280
In the whole Peach Blossom Manor,

8
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,640
only Yun Qingxuan is close to us.

9
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,840
And she's been helping us investigate the case.

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,239
How could she possibly be the culprit?

11
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,120
Isn't that exactly the problem?

12
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,959
From the very beginning,

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,560
including the autopsy,

14
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,879
to providing clues,

15
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,599
and even helping us deduce the case,

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,879
she's always been involved.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,079
Especially today,

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,280
when we went to the pharmacy.

19
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,040
What if she prepared the Peach Blossom Powder in advance?

20
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,200
But the people in Peach Blossom Manor

21
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,400
are almost all dead.

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,719
She's the only one left.

23
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,120
Why would she do that?

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,000
What if I told you Yun Qingxuan isn't a member of the Yun family?

25
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,719
I just checked the accounts office.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,159
Yun Qingxuan and Yun Xiaoying

27
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,080
were most likely bought and brought to Peach Blossom Manor.

28
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:25,919
When?

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,159
Seven years ago.

30
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,479
Seven years ago.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,439
The Peach Blossom Calamity.

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,360
Could it be that among the four women sacrificed that year,

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
there were survivors?

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,159
What if it wasn't four,

35
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,360
but six?

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,919
In an old ledger from seven years ago,

37
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,919
I saw a column written very clearly.

38
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,759
Six live sacrifices.

39
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,280
Twelve hundred taels of silver.

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,840
What kind of live sacrifices could be worth so much?

41
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,199
If two of these six people survived,

42
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,039
they would be Yun Xiaoying and Yun Qingxuan.

43
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,520
But Yun Xiaoying is dead.

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,000
Could Yun Qingxuan not have a motive for murder?

45
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,919
If that's the case,

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,919
the Peach Blossom Manor tragedy

47
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,120
was a carefully planned act of revenge.

48
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,680
Young Miss.

49
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,159
Young Miss.

50
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,599
Young Miss.

51
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,000
It's the Peach Blossom Powder.

52
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,360
And again, it's the Peach Blossom Calamity.

53
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,959
The old man told us about the Peach Blossom Calamity.

54
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,199
He mentioned the four women sacrificed alive.

55
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,759
But he deliberately concealed Yun Qingxuan and Yun Xiaoying.

56
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,839
Sir, Uncle He requests an audience.

57
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,279
He accused you of killing Yun Su.

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,720
He accused me of killing Yun Yang.

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,639
Why is he here?

60
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,639
This man is extremely cunning.

61
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,399
Let's meet him.

62
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:54,959
Let him in.

63
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,439
Yes.

64
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,240
Young hero.

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,079
Congratulations to Hero Yan for clearing your name.

66
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,959
Let me ask you.

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,839
Did you steal my wine gourd?

68
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,600
It was actually the young master who asked me to steal it before he died.

69
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,920
So you finally admit it.

70
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,319
Now that the master is dead,

71
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
I have no reason to risk my life for him anymore.

72
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,079
Why did you accuse me of killing Yun Yang?

73
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,160
Sir, that's not quite right.

74
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,759
The young master was dead.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,759
When I arrived at the scene,

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,959
you were the only one standing there.

77
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,920
Naturally, I thought you were a suspect.

78
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,959
That's a reasonable suspicion.

79
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,560
How is that slander?

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,959
You are quite sharp-tongued.

81
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,759
Speak.

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,120
What do you want?

83
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,120
I came here specifically to

84
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,199
apologize to you and Hero Yan.

85
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,759
You have a grudge against Yun Su.

86
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,920
I can understand you turning against Yun Yang.

87
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,439
But the masters of Peach Blossom Manor

88
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,120
have all died, one after another.

89
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,399
Only you are left.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,279
What do you want to do now?

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,879
Sir,

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
what you’re saying sounds a bit strange.

93
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,079
The masters died one by one,

94
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,920
what does that have to do with us servants?

95
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,920
If you really have to make a connection,

96
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,360
then I can only say I, Old He, was not meant to die yet.

97
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,360
I survived by luck.

98
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,000
But I think the fact that you survived

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,839
is suspicious in itself.

100
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,160
For me, Old He, to have survived until now

101
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,240
is simply because I know how to adapt.

102
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,720
That doesn’t mean I’m a bad person.

103
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:46,959
Then tell me,

104
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,120
who do you think killed the imperial concubine and the young lady?

105
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,720
How would I know?

106
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Sir, to be honest,

107
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,000
there’s something I’ve never understood.

108
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,800
Look at Hong Xiu,

109
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,920
she was clearly together with Yun Ming.

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,279
Why would she want to kill Yun Yang?

111
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,160
When our young master was alive,

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,120
he was a bit hot-tempered,

113
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,360
but in my heart,

114
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,000
he was truly a good person.

115
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,879
You actually see Yun Yang as a good person?

116
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,439
You didn’t come here just to tell us

117
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,959
that Yun Yang is a good person in your eyes, did you?

118
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,639
This time, I came

119
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,399
to give you a clue, sir.

120
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,839
These two people

121
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,519
are actually the same person.

122
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,160
Sir

123
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,160
There really is something suspicious about Gu Weng.

124
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,319
These are the estate accounts personally managed by Gu Weng.

125
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,879
Gu Weng came to the estate three years ago.

126
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,600
He started as the accountant and kept getting promoted.

127
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,199
He only became the steward this year.

128
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,279
Three years ago?

129
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,720
Exactly when?

130
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,759
Spring.

131
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,160
Is there a problem?

132
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,480
Check it.

133
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Was it before or after the imperial consort entered the palace?

134
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,480
It was after the imperial consort entered the palace.

135
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,839
He came almost a year later.

136
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,240
I remember Gu Weng told me,

137
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,879
the imperial consort treated me well back then.

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,160
I don't want her to die in vain.

139
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,040
But if he only came after she entered the palace,

140
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,279
and the consort hasn't returned these past years,

141
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,759
how could she have treated him well?

142
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,960
Unless Gu Weng had already come to Peach Blossom Estate three years ago,

143
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,360
then everything recorded here is fake.

144
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,360
Or maybe Gu Weng himself—

145
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,919
his entire identity is fabricated.

146
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,480
Xuanwu.

147
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,399
What was Gu Weng's real name?

148
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,360
Jiang Ji.

149
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,360
Jiang Ji is actually Gu Hongyi!

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,879
That's right.

151
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,000
How do you know?

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,399
Look,

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,960
in the name Gu Hongyi,

154
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,480
the character "Hong" means deep and wide water,

155
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,360
which matches the character "Jiang" (river).

156
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,320
And "Ji" can be split into "Gu" and "Yi".

157
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,559
So,

158
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,919
Jiang Ji is Gu Hongyi.

159
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,639
Why did you kill Yun Qingxuan?

160
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,639
The sacrificial ceremony is over.

161
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,639
You are safe now.

162
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,120
The palace has allocated a spot for Taohua Manor in the selection of court ladies.

163
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,600
Don't worry.

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,799
The manor master has agreed to raise you.

165
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,799
In three years, you will be sent to participate in the selection.

166
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,159
That means you will be safe for the next few years.

167
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,000
Who are you?

168
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,759
I am the teacher here at the manor.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,360
I will also teach you music, chess, calligraphy, and painting in the future.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,600
Remember this.

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Endure and protect your life.

172
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,679
Wait for the right time.

173
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,120
Endure and protect your life.

174
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,519
Wait for the right time.

175
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,279
You've studied since childhood.

176
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,759
Why do you still make mistakes when writing?

177
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,240
Making mistakes

178
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,279
is the only way to be punished by the teacher alone.

179
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,440
Flowers fall on their own, water flows on its own.

180
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,759
A kind of longing.

181
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,120
Two places, idle sorrow.

182
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
This feeling cannot be dispelled.

183
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,120
Just left my brows,

184
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,159
but rises to my heart.

185
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,519
Which line does teacher like the most?

186
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,360
There is one line.

187
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,919
Eight characters.

188
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,240
It expresses all the joy of regaining what was lost in this world.

189
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,919
Although I haven't fully experienced it,

190
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,600
I feel

191
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,639
this must be the most beautiful bond in the world.

192
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
Then, teacher, please teach me to write it.

193
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,759
Such beautiful handwriting.

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,799
When the wild geese return,

195
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,799
the moon fills the western tower.

196
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,480
These words should be written on a lantern.

197
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,159
Carry it every day.

198
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,159
Waiting for the moon to fill the western tower.

199
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,399
Alright.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,080
Then I'll make one for you.

201
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,919
Thank you, sir.

202
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,360
Sir, why don't you dare look at me?

203
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,240
Young lady,

204
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
your status is very noble now.

205
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,039
In the future, you'll enter the palace and become a consort.

206
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,039
I'm just a teacher.

207
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,320
I wouldn't dare be disrespectful to you.

208
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,360
I don't want to enter the palace.

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,480
I just want to...

210
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,600
Tonight, when the moon rises above the treetops,

211
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,399
I'll wait for you here.

212
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,039
If you don't come, I'll keep waiting.

213
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,639
Where did sir go?

214
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,159
Sister,

215
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,559
what did you say you were waiting for just now?

216
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,440
I said...

217
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,320
I said I was waiting for you to wake up.

218
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,159
It's all because of you.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,240
You made sir leave.
