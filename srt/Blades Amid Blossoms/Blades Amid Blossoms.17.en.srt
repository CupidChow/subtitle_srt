1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,600
Big Brother

2
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,520
Big Brother

3
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,240
No one is allowed near the crime scene.

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,359
W-What happened here?

5
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,399
So it was you, Han Dao!

6
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,960
You’re protecting this suspect

7
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,960
Yan Shiyi

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,399
You—you killed the manor master!

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,039
You broke the law despite knowing it.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,399
That makes your crime even worse.

11
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,079
The official is an imperial appointee.

12
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,520
Framing an imperial official

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,799
is a capital offense.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,920
I’m just like all of you.

15
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,079
I saw the young master’s body as soon as I entered.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,719
After my examination,

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,959
Yun Yang has been dead for over an hour.

18
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,000
And half an hour ago,

19
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,319
I was still questioning Yan Shiyi in the cell.

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,200
If you don’t believe me,

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,840
the servants over there can vouch for me.

22
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,000
Why should we believe you?

23
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,079
You’re the one who killed my brother!

24
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,239
If you still don’t believe me,

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,159
the young lady can examine the body herself.

26
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,799
Sister

27
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,439
Take a look.

28
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,959
Look carefully.

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,560
Lord Handao is right.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,560
Elder brother's body has lost all warmth.

31
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,599
The time of death has indeed exceeded one hour.

32
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,159
Sir, my younger sister, and my father

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,159
as well as my brother's death, all seem suspicious.

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,359
I hope you can bring them justice.

35
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,680
The manor lord also said

36
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,200
that in two days

37
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,599
a fast horse will be dispatched

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,159
to quickly report to the capital.

39
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,800
There's no need to wait two days.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,560
The real culprit will soon be revealed.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,080
Baihu, Xuanwu.

42
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,680
Here.

43
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,360
Everyone, leave the crime scene.

44
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,560
Prepare the body.

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,080
Until the truth is found.

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,639
Yes.

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,400
Manor lord.

48
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,280
Brother, manor lord.

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,080
Manor lord.

50
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,560
Brother.

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,080
Manor lord, let's go, let's go.

52
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,360
Brother.

53
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,199
Young Master Yan

54
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,680
The official requests your presence.

55
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,680
Me?

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,840
Aren't I still a suspect?

57
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm under orders to bring the suspect to the crime scene.

58
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,479
Please.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,919
Sir

60
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,360
Please sit down

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,039
Yes

62
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,159
You

63
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,360
Are you feeling any better?

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,439
It's just a superficial wound

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,879
Don't worry about me

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
We just found out Yun Yang was a suspect

67
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,759
And then he was killed

68
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm afraid the real killer is someone else

69
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,240
And they're always one step ahead of us

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,160
It's as if he knows our every move

71
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,079
He wants to take the chance to frame me

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,959
Both Yun Su and Yun Yang have been killed

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,759
In this Peach Blossom Manor

74
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,079
How many more villains are there?

75
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,759
The killer

76
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,120
Is not necessarily a villain

77
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,399
I actually think it's a good person

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,800
Who was forced to become a villain

79
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,879
We must have overlooked something

80
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
I've been thinking about one question these past two days

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
The killer

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,000
How exactly did they poison the victims?

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
The Peach Blossom Powder Yun Yang gave me

84
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,160
I always took it myself

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,439
It's true

86
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,319
It can cause hallucinations

87
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,319
But it isn't fatal

88
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,439
So

89
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,680
How exactly

90
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,839
Did they poison people without anyone noticing?

91
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,279
Unless

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,560
It was inhaled

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,040
How could it be inhaled?

94
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,959
If this Peach Blossom Powder

95
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,240
Was always present

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,279
In the air we breathe?

97
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,439
It really is the scent of Peach Blossom Powder

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,639
So the Peach Blossom Powder was hidden in the red candles all along

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,800
You bought these red candles, right?

100
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,360
Yes, I did.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,879
Then do you know

102
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,560
that these red candles have Peach Blossom Powder hidden inside?

103
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,959
What Peach Blossom Powder?

104
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,639
I don't know.

105
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,399
You bought them.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,879
How could you not know?

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,279
These red candles

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,439
were all purchased by the young madam

109
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,439
from the shop she runs outside the manor.

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,839
Hongxiu.

111
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,079
That's right.

112
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,079
Before the young master was killed,

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,879
didn't Hongxiu come to see you?

114
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,680
That's right.

115
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,360
These are all my jewelry.

116
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,839
No matter what,

117
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,040
you have to help me.

118
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,360
You're still leaving.

119
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,759
I have to go.

120
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
But I'm not going alone.

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,759
Who else?

122
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
You don't need to ask.

123
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:01,920
Big brother.

124
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm also someone who deserves punishment.

125
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,519
I was involved in what happened back then too.

126
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,439
Big brother, wait for me.

127
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,759
Wait until I finish what I need to do.

128
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,480
Then I'll come find you.

129
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,560
We'll go together.

130
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,600
We'll atone together.

131
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,040
Yunming.

132
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,120
What are you packing?

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,680
Let's go.

134
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,399
You agreed to leave with me.

135
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,959
Let's go.

136
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,199
You two.

137
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:52,959
This way.

138
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,480
This way.

139
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,279
Yun Ming

140
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,159
Yun Ming

141
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,559
Master

142
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,720
Master, stop the carriage

143
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,840
Where is Yun Ming?

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,159
Where is Yun Ming?

145
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,600
Second Young Master

146
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,039
Where is Hong Xiu?

147
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,720
Why are you looking for her?

148
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,519
Hong Xiu is my wife

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,240
Tell me the same thing

150
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,720
We have evidence suspecting that Hong Xiu killed Yun Yang

151
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,879
Now Hong Xiu is a wanted criminal by the court

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,559
If you want to protect her, Second Young Master

153
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,720
You will also be held responsible

154
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,480
Second Young Master, where are you hiding Hong Xiu?

155
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,879
Since you used the word "hide"

156
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,279
Of course I won't tell you

157
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,799
Second Young Master, you’d better think carefully

158
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,639
If Hong Xiu can't be found

159
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,600
You will die too

160
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,879
She is only a suspect

161
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,039
She may not be the murderer

162
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,879
If she really is

163
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,480
The dead are already gone

164
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,159
I should also think of the living

165
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,559
If you need to report back

166
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,919
Then put all the blame for the murder on me

167
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,039
Xuanwu, Baihu

168
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:00,879
Here

169
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,639
Pass down my order

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,879
Arrest Hong Xiu

171
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,799
I’d like to see who dares to act

172
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,799
Go.

173
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,879
I said I would take all the blame myself.

174
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,279
Why won't you let it go?

175
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,399
Yunming.

176
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,840
This case involves multiple murders.

177
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,120
I'm afraid it's not something you can shoulder alone.

178
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,519
Second Young Master.

179
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,360
I have a duty to fulfill.

180
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,960
Please, Second Young Master, don't stand in the way.

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,720
Don't come any closer.

182
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,279
Or I'll die right here.

183
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,360
Lord Handao.

184
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,480
So many people have died at Peach Blossom Manor.

185
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,799
If I die as well,

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
how will Lord Handao report back to the capital?

187
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,759
Yunming.

188
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:48,960
Yunming.

189
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,840
Didn't you say it yourself?

190
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,480
She's just a suspect right now.

191
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,279
If she really runs away now,

192
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,879
wouldn't that confirm her guilt?

193
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,679
She's always wanted to escape Peach Blossom Manor.

194
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,519
To get away from here,

195
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,480
she's done a lot of foolish things.

196
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,279
While I'm still clear-headed,

197
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll help her.

198
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,279
In this lifetime,

199
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,159
shouldn't we help the ones we love?

200
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,120
Second Young Master

201
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
Why are you doing this?

202
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
There’s not much I can do.

203
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,279
Because I’m already a ruined man.

204
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,799
At first,

205
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,759
because I was pressured by my father’s authority,

206
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,879
I didn’t marry Hongxiu.

207
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,360
That was cowardice.

208
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,399
Hongxiu

209
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,639
Hongxiu married my elder brother.

210
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,600
She became my sister-in-law.

211
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,840
I had an affair with my sister-in-law.

212
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,639
That was unrighteous.

213
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,600
I didn’t protect my elder brother.

214
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,679
That was disloyal.

215
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,240
And then, those four women.

216
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,960
Even though I didn’t do it myself,

217
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,159
I didn’t stop them either.

218
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,519
The four women.

219
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,080
The Peach Blossom Calamity.

220
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,360
Explain it clearly.

221
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,320
I’m sorry.

222
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,159
The Yun family has wronged you all.

223
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,120
My father and my elder brother are both dead.

224
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,559
You could say you’ve had your revenge.

225
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,639
Yun Ming

226
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,320
Yun Ming

227
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,320
Yun Ming

228
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Let go of me.

229
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,559
Hongxiu

230
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,720
Don’t stop her.

231
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,720
Yun Ming

232
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,399
Yun Ming

233
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,480
Yunming

234
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,600
Hongxiu, Hongxiu

235
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,360
Yunming

236
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Why did you come back?

237
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,320
Why did you come back?

238
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,519
Why did you come back?

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,799
Yunming

240
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,679
You gave this to me.

241
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,039
I've kept it all this time.

242
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,919
I made this for you myself.

243
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,919
Does it look nice?

244
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,759
It looks nice.

245
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,759
Yunming

246
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,240
Thank you.

247
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,960
Then I'll help you with your coming-of-age ceremony.

248
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,679
Is that okay?

249
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,240
Coming-of-age ceremony

250
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay.

251
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,240
Yunming

252
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,759
Yunming, wake up, Yunming!

253
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,960
Yunming

254
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,240
Yunming

255
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,559
Hongxiu

256
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,399
Qingxuan

257
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,519
Qingxuan, your medical skills are exceptional.

258
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,799
Please, can you save Yunming?

259
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,480
Yunming

260
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,519
Yunming

261
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,679
Yunming will be fine.

262
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:42,799
Yunming

263
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,200
Qingxuan, help me.

264
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,759
Please save Yunming.

265
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,960
Save him.

266
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,279
Hongxiu

267
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,200
Listen to me.

268
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,440
Leave this place.

269
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,639
Stay alive.

270
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,120
Haven't you always wanted to leave?

271
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,080
I did want to leave this place.

272
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
Every day, I wanted to leave.

273
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,559
But now everything has changed.

274
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,159
Yunming, for my sake,

275
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,440
is even willing to give up his life.

276
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,080
Since I can't leave,

277
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,759
then I'll stay with him.

278
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,440
Hongxiu

279
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,919
Yunming

280
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:13,960
Yunming

281
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,480
Yunming

282
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,919
You killed Yunyang and Yunsu, didn't you?

283
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,519
Yes.

284
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,159
If it weren't for Yunsu,

285
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,480
I would have been Yunming's wife long ago.

286
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
After he forced me to marry Yunyang,

287
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,840
I had to refine inner elixirs for him every day.

288
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,879
Such a wicked man,

289
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,440
still dreams of immortality.

290
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,840
He even exchanged blood with his own son to prolong his life.

291
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,480
A person like that

292
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,679
could never become immortal.

293
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,559
It's nothing but a fool's dream.

294
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,320
How did you kill Yunsu in the alchemy room?

295
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,840
I took the antidote in advance.

296
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I just wanted to quietly watch him get poisoned.

297
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,480
To see how he would die.

298
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,759
Go in and take off your clothes.

299
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,799
Lie down.

300
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,080
Abandon your mortal body.

301
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,960
Ascend and become immortal.

302
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,360
The Peach Blossom Powder hidden inside that red candle

303
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,720
where did it come from?

304
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,000
Yunyang discovered Linjiangxian's letter.

305
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,759
I overheard it by accident.

306
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,279
Yunlang, after we parted

307
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,879
we've been far apart.

308
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,480
They say it's been three or four months,

309
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,279
but who knew it would be five or six years?

310
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,000
I have no heart to play the seven-stringed zither.

311
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,120
All I can offer is a dose of Peach Blossom Powder

312
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,000
to express my longing.

313
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,919
This Linjiangxian...

314
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,320
The prescription is as follows: one qian of danshen,

315
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
two qian of chuanxiong,

316
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,799
one liang of peach blossom,

317
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,279
two qian of fushen.

318
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,120
So the Peach Blossom Powder was made by Yunyang.

319
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,279
That's right.

320
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,320
He accidentally discovered this medicine

321
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,759
that could make him...

322
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,279
This medicine is so miraculous

323
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,039
it can make us feel as if we're floating like immortals.

324
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,840
It's far superior to my father's elixirs.

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,480
The one who originally wanted to use Peach Blossom Powder to kill Yun Su

326
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,919
was Yunyang.

327
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,359
Later, he wanted to use my master's letter

328
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,039
to frame Yan Shiyi for the murder.

329
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,319
That way,

330
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,440
Yunyang could escape blame.

331
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,880
And you can still laugh?

332
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,200
Yunyang calculated everything,

333
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,039
but he didn't expect that I would intervene.

334
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,160
I knew he would go to Jixian Hall that night,

335
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,079
so I went there ahead of time

336
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,519
and replaced the red candle on the candlestick with a poisonous one.

337
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,279
Go away.

338
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Go away.

339
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:42,839
And at this moment,

340
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,839
Go away.

341
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,440
I am entwined with Yun Ming.

342
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,200
Go away.

343
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,240
That gives me an alibi.

344
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,279
It truly is a clever tactic.

345
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,599
But my master originally created Peach Blossom Powder

346
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,480
only to ease the pain of longing.

347
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,839
Yet you used this Peach Blossom Powder

348
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,279
to kill people recklessly.

349
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,480
It was Yun Su who let Lin Jiangxian down.

350
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,440
He died because of Lin Jiangxian's Peach Blossom Powder.

351
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,519
He got what he deserved.

352
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,039
If your master knew this in the afterlife,

353
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,599
she would thank me as well.

354
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,799
Then the imperial consort, Yu Niang,

355
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
also seemed to have died from the Peach Blossom Powder.

356
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,440
Did you kill both of them too?

357
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
I only admit to the people I killed myself.

358
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,039
Those I didn't kill

359
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,160
don't pin them on me.

360
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,319
Yun Ming and I have suffered enough.

361
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,599
I know how Yuan Fu died.

362
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,839
Yuan Fu is dead.

363
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,480
It was Yun Yang who killed him.

364
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,960
But it was on the manor master's orders.

365
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,799
Who... who are you?

366
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,839
Let me tell you,

367
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,680
I am an official of the imperial court.

368
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:39,960
So,

369
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,440
it was because Yuanfu wanted to return to the capital to report,

370
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,039
that Yunsu killed him first.

371
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,119
If you didn't kill Lady Yu or the imperial consort,

372
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,160
then it could only have been Yunyang.

373
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,200
After all, only the two of you had the Peach Blossom Powder.

374
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,240
Where did you hide the Peach Blossom Powder?

375
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,240
In the seven-star medicine cabinet in the pharmacy.

376
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,240
That's where you'll find what you're looking for.

377
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,319
The seven-star medicine cabinet...

378
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:11,960
Yunming.

379
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,160
Everything from before is already over.

380
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll stay with you.

381
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,960
Stop! Don't!

382
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,440
Hongxiu!

383
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,079
Yunming!

384
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,319
The world always tries to keep us apart.

385
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,319
But I refuse to accept that.

386
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,559
I want to be with you forever.

387
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,960
Today is a good day.

388
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,799
We haven't held our wedding ceremony yet.

389
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,000
Why don't we perform the ceremony right here?

390
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,000
What do you think?

391
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,160
Yunming.
