1
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,640
Yan Shiyi

2
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,560
You work for Yun Yang.

3
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,759
What did Yun Yang give you?

4
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,119
I can't see you clearly anymore.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,759
Tell me,

6
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,560
who are you, really?

7
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,959
It's you.

8
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,799
Your master and I were in love with each other.

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,040
I treated you like my own disciple.

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,640
Stay here.

11
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,040
I can help cure your illness.

12
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,519
If you hadn't killed my master,

13
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,799
she wouldn't have died.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,799
My dear nephew,

15
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,079
you killed your own master with your own hands.

16
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,719
Have you forgotten?

17
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,719
It was me.

18
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,760
I killed my master with my own hands.

19
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,079
I killed my master.

20
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,799
You really are my good disciple.

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,159
Master.

22
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,360
Master, I'm sorry.

23
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,319
Master.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,560
That's right.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,560
You killed the master.

26
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,479
You betrayed your master and ancestors.

27
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,319
You are a traitor to the Qingshan Sect.

28
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,199
You're also Yun Yang's lackey.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,800
In the end, you still deceived me.

30
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,360
I'll kill you today.

31
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,840
In my whole life,

32
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,639
what I hate most is being wronged.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,919
Today, you'll die by my blade.

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,800
I'll still call you "senior brother" one last time.

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,199
I won't die today.

36
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,759
Sir! Sir!

37
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,560
Sir!

38
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,519
Help him!

39
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,519
Hurry, help him!

40
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,279
Cold Blade

41
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
Are you feeling better?

42
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,360
Sir! Sir! Sir!

43
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,319
Sir.

44
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:44,879
It's me.

45
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,560
Sir, wake up.

46
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,160
Sir.

47
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,759
He is White Tiger.

48
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,279
Sir.

49
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,639
Sir.

50
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,160
Sir, are you alright?

51
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Where is Yan Shiyi?

52
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,439
It was Young Hero Yan who injured you.

53
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,879
Yan Shiyi is now a prime suspect.

54
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,399
Pass on my order.

55
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,199
Arrest Yan Shiyi.

56
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,560
Do you want him captured alive?

57
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,279
Dead or alive.

58
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,959
Yes.

59
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,240
You saved me.

60
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,160
But I can only save you for a while.

61
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Life and death are determined by fate.

62
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,879
If I could die by junior disciple's blade because of this,

63
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,480
that would be fine too.

64
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
But when I checked your pulse just now,

65
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,480
it was clear you still have the will to live.

66
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,920
You just have unresolved matters on your mind.

67
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,079
So, your concerns,

68
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
must naturally be related to Lord Han Dao.

69
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,480
The truth is still unclear.

70
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,439
I can't die yet.

71
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,199
But, Miss,

72
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,279
what is it that you want?

73
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
I can't see it clearly.

74
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,120
What I want is the same as you.

75
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,120
I also want the truth.

76
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,879
I want to know who killed my sister.

77
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,800
And I want to know about you and my brother—

78
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,120
what exactly is your relationship?

79
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,480
So, have you figured it out?

80
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,559
No.

81
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,120
That's why today I brought your junior disciple

82
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,200
to see together.

83
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,679
My brother has always been skilled at manipulating people.

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
I've been secretly investigating you

85
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,039
because I want to know

86
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,840
whether you are really his lackey.

87
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,240
Since you think I'm Yun Yang's person,

88
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
why did you save me?

89
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,440
What I can't understand is,

90
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,399
as someone who is dying,

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,120
why would you do this?

92
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,080
Maybe you have your own reasons.

93
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,639
Because I want to live.

94
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,480
At the beginning,

95
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,080
Master Yun tried every possible way

96
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
but still couldn't save me.

97
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,759
Later, Yun Yang wanted to control me.

98
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,480
He wanted me to become Master Yun's enemy.

99
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,840
He told me he had a kind of medicine

100
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,759
that could cure my failing organs.

101
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:31,879
Do you know

102
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,559
what kind of medicine he gave you?

103
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,159
I tried taking one dose.

104
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,039
At first, my condition improved.

105
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,440
But later, I started having hallucinations.

106
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,120
I don't know if it was because of my body

107
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,159
or because of the medicine.

108
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,639
So I asked for more medicine.

109
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,159
I think the deaths of these people

110
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,000
are related to Yun Yang's medicine.

111
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,000
So you tested the medicine on yourself.

112
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,120
Anyway,

113
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm already a dying person.

114
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,120
But after I took the medicine,

115
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,080
I'm certain

116
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,399
this medicine causes hallucinations.

117
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,399
I even almost killed Han Dao because of it.

118
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,759
So next,

119
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:29,919
what do you plan to do?

120
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
I must tell all the truth to Little Junior Brother.

121
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,039
Now that things have come to this,

122
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,720
do you think he'll still believe you?

123
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,559
Believe me?

124
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,399
He won't believe me.

125
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,679
But he'll believe you.

126
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,120
Me?

127
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:57,879
Please come in.

128
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,279
Miss.

129
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,720
Lord Han Dao.

130
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,399
Do you need me to examine you, my lord?

131
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,279
No need.

132
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,559
It's not fatal.

133
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,639
Just now,

134
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,879
when you were fighting Yan Shiyi,

135
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,240
did you notice anything suspicious?

136
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
He seemed to fall into some kind of hallucination.

137
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,759
He was poisoned.

138
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,120
Poisoned?

139
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,360
Yun Yang poisoned him.

140
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,919
To be precise,

141
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,200
he poisoned himself.

142
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,480
Did he tell you all this?

143
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,360
The poison Yan Shiyi took

144
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,639
is the same as my sister, Yu Niang's,

145
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,639
and it seems to be the same as my father's.

146
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,080
But maybe he took too small a dose,

147
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,200
so it's not enough to be fatal.

148
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:52,960
My lord.

149
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,480
Why would Yan Shiyi do this?

150
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,080
And for whom?

151
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Maybe you should think about it carefully.

152
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,759
You saved him.

153
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,159
I've delivered the message.

154
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,799
As for what to do next,

155
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,480
that's up to you, my lord.

156
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,480
Young Master Yan.

157
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,960
Are you alright?

158
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,559
What did he say?

159
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,080
I told him everything I needed to.

160
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,960
But whether he believes it or not

161
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,159
is up to him.

162
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,399
Alright.

163
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't worry, sit down and talk.

164
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,039
Thank you.

165
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Miss.

166
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:48,879
Eat this.

167
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,639
It can ease your pain.

168
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,279
At least you'll feel a bit better.

169
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Actually,

170
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,519
death

171
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,919
might not be the worst ending.

172
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,360
It could even be a kind of release.

173
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,159
On the other hand, for some people, being alive

174
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,960
is a form of punishment.

175
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,279
Many years ago

176
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,279
someone once told me

177
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,799
to endure and accept fate

178
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,879
and wait for what is to come

179
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,919
But after all these years

180
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,759
I've come to understand something different

181
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,840
It's like this feeling

182
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,639
that one day, the person you hate

183
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,600
might not even make it to the future

184
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,279
and could die before you do

185
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,799
without you having to do anything

186
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,080
And the things you pursue and long for

187
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,200
even those you'd give your life for

188
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,639
might all change

189
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,159
Life...

190
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,000
The most important thing

191
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,840
isn't fighting against fate

192
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,879
but knowing what you truly want

193
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,679
Young Master Yan risks his own life

194
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,600
but what is it that he really wants

195
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,000
I...

196
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,159
I want to beg the King of Hell for my life

197
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,720
I want to live a little longer

198
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:31,879
No

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,159
even just a few more days would do

200
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,360
Young Master Yan keeps saying he wants to live

201
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,759
but does things that risk his life

202
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,159
and still wants to bargain with the King of Hell

203
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,679
Now

204
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,440
even if an immortal came

205
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,320
they couldn't save you

206
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,320
But Miss

207
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,159
you must have a way

208
00:14:59,399 --> 00:14:59,960
right

209
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,240
There is one way

210
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
that can let you live three or five more days

211
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,960
but the process is extremely painful

212
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,360
I don't care

213
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,879
Please, Miss

214
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:17,919
save me

215
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,000
Lord Han

216
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,840
What are you doing?

217
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,399
It's necessary for the investigation.

218
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,919
I hope you'll cooperate.

219
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,159
What if I don't cooperate?

220
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,360
Then don't blame me for being rude.

221
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,799
Lord Han Dao

222
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,840
Why are you in such a hurry?

223
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,159
I know what you're looking for.

224
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,559
You must recognize the handwriting on this.

225
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,759
Lin Jiangxian is the master of both you and Yan Shiyi.

226
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,600
Yes, he is our respected master.

227
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,039
This is Lin Jiangxian.

228
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,440
The correspondence between him and my father.

229
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,120
It mentions the Peach Blossom Powder that can bewilder the mind.

230
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
It was personally concocted by your master, Lin Jiangxian.

231
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,799
Young Master.

232
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,039
You must not make false accusations.

233
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,879
Yan Shiyi falsely accused my father of killing Lin Jiangxian.

234
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,559
That's why he came to Peach Blossom Manor to avenge his master.

235
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,679
How did he seek revenge?

236
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,960
By using Lin Jiangxian's unique hallucinogenic poison.

237
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Peach Blossom Powder.

238
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,320
First, he killed my younger sister.

239
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,480
Then, he killed my father.

240
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,559
It was clearly you who poisoned Yan Shiyi.

241
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,480
You're wrong.

242
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,519
What I gave him

243
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,519
was a famous medicine from Peach Blossom Manor.

244
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,120
It was to prolong his dying life.

245
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,240
Yan Shiyi is like a dog to me.

246
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,960
I've always treated my dogs well.

247
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,000
But he turned around and bit me.

248
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,159
Now he wants to secretly take the Peach Blossom Powder.

249
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,080
And frame me for it.

250
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Lord Han Dao.

251
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,120
Haven't you figured it out yet?

252
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,240
The murderer you've been investigating all along

253
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,720
is your senior brother.

254
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,200
Yan Shiyi.

255
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,160
I want to see

256
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,319
if you can truly handle this impartially.

257
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,480
If Yan Shiyi is truly the murderer,

258
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,960
I will not protect him.

259
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,160
But if someone is trying to frame a loyal man,

260
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,640
I won't allow it either.

261
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,240
Very well.

262
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,279
Let's wait and see.

263
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,720
I think in this letter

264
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,359
you'll find the answers you seek.
