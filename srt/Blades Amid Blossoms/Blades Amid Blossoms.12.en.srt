1
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,640
Wife

2
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm going to lift the bridal veil now.

3
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,920
Yun Ming

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,719
Now you should start calling me husband.

5
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,480
Husband

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,760
Why is it you?

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
Why can't it be me?

8
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
It should be Yun Ming.

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
You are the young mistress of Peach Blossom Manor.

10
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,719
You are my wife, Yun Yang's wife.

11
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,599
I'm not.

12
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,519
Look at me.

13
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,159
I'm your husband.

14
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,719
You're not.

15
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,480
Yun Ming, Yun Ming, save me!

16
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,159
Qing Xuan.

17
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm so scared.

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,479
You survived a near-death experience.

19
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,120
You've already died once.

20
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,000
There's nothing left to fear.

21
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:15,960
Besides,

22
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,120
Lord Han Dao and Young Hero Yan

23
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,639
will stand up for you.

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,120
What is it?

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,960
Do you still have questions for me?

26
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Young mistress.

27
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,439
We didn't mean to disturb your rest.

28
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,680
It's just that

29
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,879
we need to check your tattoo.

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
Isn't that a bit too rude?

31
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,360
Rude?

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,240
It is indeed rude.

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
This junior insists on seeing it.

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,439
He says it's for the investigation.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
We have to set aside propriety for now.

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
How do you want to check?

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,240
One at a time,

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,319
or all together?

39
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,719
You'll have to ask Lord Han Dao about that.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,360
I...

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll still check.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,479
Whenever it's convenient for the young mistress.

43
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,919
The tattoo here is an old wound.

44
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,599
Are there any others elsewhere?

45
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a bit hard to see.

46
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,159
This looks like

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
an injury caused by some kind of carving tool.

48
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,079
Young Madam

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,399
Why did the Young Master hurt you like this?

50
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,600
Why?

51
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,519
When I walked out of Yun Su's room,

52
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,319
when I didn't say what he wanted to hear,

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,600
when I looked at Yun Ming one more time,

54
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,879
What other reason could there be?

55
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,879
Maybe he was in a bad mood today.

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,399
Or maybe he just found a random reason.

57
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,839
To throw a tantrum.

58
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,879
Or maybe

59
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,720
he just wanted to torment someone for fun today.

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,560
Anyway, he always has his reasons.

61
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,639
He can do whatever he wants.

62
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,120
Otherwise, sir,

63
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,639
what other reason do you think there could be?

64
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,160
When you were tattooing,

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,720
did you notice

66
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,920
anything strange?

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,319
The tattoo on the Young Madam's calf is old.

68
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,439
It's clearer to see.

69
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,319
But the color seems off.

70
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:27,920
Yes.

71
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,199
Normally, when ink touches the skin,

72
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,759
it should appear bluish.

73
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,600
But the tattoo on the Young Madam's back

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
looks a bit pale.

75
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,600
This is...

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,079
It's Momantuo.

77
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,319
Momantuo has a whitening effect.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,920
In the ink,

79
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,639
Momantuo must have been added.

80
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,879
And I've heard people say

81
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,199
that if this substance

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,519
is introduced into the body in small amounts over time,

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,600
the person won't die immediately.

84
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,759
Instead, they'll be slowly poisoned.

85
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,199
Then if this person's blood

86
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,040
is mixed into someone else's food or drink,

87
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,560
would that person be poisoned after consuming it?

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,959
Someone is using people to poison others.

89
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,720
That's right.

90
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,120
Using people as the medium for poisoning.

91
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,720
So the young madam was poisoned.

92
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,279
Then the inner core in his body would also be poisoned.

93
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,800
The tattoo on Hongxiu's body

94
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,399
can't be used as direct evidence against Yunyang.

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,240
Think about it.

96
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,959
If I were Yunyang,

97
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,920
this is what I would say.

98
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,439
Look,

99
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,720
she also has a tattoo.

100
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,600
Why isn't she dead?

101
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,160
It must be Yunyang.

102
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,519
The mastermind behind the so-called Peach Blossom Calamity

103
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,839
I think it's him.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,720
No, that's not right.

105
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,959
Junior brother,

106
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,040
I think we still need to discuss this carefully.

107
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,399
But I think

108
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,920
Yun Qingxuan is a bit strange.

109
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,639
Strange how?

110
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,079
Think about it.

111
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,800
On the night Yun Su was killed,

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,279
besides Hongxiu, who else entered his room?

113
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,759
Who else?

114
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,800
Yun Qingxuan.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,959
If, when I met Yun Qingxuan,

116
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,680
Yun Su was already dead,

117
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,360
then things would have turned out like this.

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,839
Everything would go according to plan.

119
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,879
If that's the case,

120
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,800
Yun Qingxuan must want us to fall out with Yun Yang.

121
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,399
Because that way, she would be safe.

122
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,639
That's right.

123
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,079
The entire Yun family,

124
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,879
there isn't a single good person among them.

125
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,519
Unfortunately, this is just our speculation.

126
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,800
We have no evidence.

127
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,160
Everything leaves a trace.

128
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,959
As long as they did it,

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,480
we'll be able to find evidence.

130
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,679
But why would Yun Qingxuan

131
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,759
take such a big risk to help Hong Xiu?

132
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,519
I've looked into Hong Xiu.

133
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,960
Hong Xiu has business in the capital.

134
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,879
I think

135
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,279
she probably wants to escape from Peach Blossom Manor.

136
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,519
As for Yun Qingxuan,

137
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,720
she probably wants to escape too.

138
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,919
Think about it—

139
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,639
what if the two of them are working together?

140
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,960
They both want to get away from Peach Blossom Manor.

141
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,799
If that's all there is to it,

142
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,440
then neither of them has really done anything wrong.

143
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,519
If I didn't have my official duties,

144
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,759
I wouldn't care if that old scoundrel Yun Su died.

145
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,120
I'd just consider it as them avenging our master.

146
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,879
At least half of our master's revenge would be fulfilled.

147
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,320
You didn't get to kill Yun Su yourself.

148
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,480
That's a pity, isn't it?

149
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,960
We don't know about our master

150
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,399
and Yun Su's past grudges.

151
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,600
Right now, the most urgent thing is to catch the killer.

152
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,919
Maybe after we find the killer,

153
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,360
the truth will come to light.

154
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,840
And after that,

155
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,360
it'll be the matter between you and me.

156
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,519
Little junior brother,

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm really scared.

158
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,480
Before the truth comes out,

159
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,519
I might die.

160
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,399
I won't let you die.

161
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,840
At least not from illness.

162
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,279
Your life

163
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,440
belongs to me.

164
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,080
Brother Gu,

165
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,840
Playing chess against yourself

166
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,399
isn't any fun, is it?

167
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,679
Let me play with you.

168
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,000
Chess is only interesting with a worthy opponent.

169
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,000
Did you come to see me for something?

170
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,399
Now that the old manor lord is gone,

171
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,320
we don't have any other options.

172
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,960
But I remember

173
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,919
you wanted to choose Yun Yang before.

174
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,200
Having a choice is always better than none.

175
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,320
But now, he's the only one left.

176
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,080
What else can we do?

177
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,960
Actually, I think

178
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,360
this might not be a good thing.

179
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,039
I'd like to hear more.

180
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,159
Yun Yang is naturally bloodthirsty.

181
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,240
He's not a good leader.

182
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,720
I remember you once said,

183
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,840
"A wise bird chooses a good tree to nest in."

184
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,120
So I think the two of us

185
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,799
should start thinking about the future.

186
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
So what do you want to do?

187
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,240
Actually, I'd like to know

188
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,240
what you want to do.

189
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,279
Father,

190
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,279
your body is now as weak as clay,

191
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,759
but your soul has ascended to the immortal realm.

192
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,240
You shouldn't have treated me and my elder brother like this.

193
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,919
Even more so, you shouldn't have treated Hongxiu this way.

194
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,759
Darn it, you truly deserve this.

195
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,559
For as long as I can remember,

196
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,960
I knew you loved Qimen Dunjia,

197
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,200
and loved Feng Shui and the Eight Trigrams.

198
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,960
You tasted all kinds of herbs,

199
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,559
refined elixirs,

200
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,519
and built altars.

201
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,720
You fancied different women in the world,

202
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,919
but it was all just to fight against fate,

203
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,679
to gain more years of life.

204
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,039
When I was young,

205
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,759
I didn't understand anything.

206
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,600
Whatever you said,

207
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,399
I treated it as absolute truth.

208
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,879
But now, it's different.

209
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,360
I understand everything now.

210
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,720
You are an utterly selfish person.

211
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,840
We were all just

212
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,399
stepping stones on your path to immortality.

213
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,960
You took advantage of our love and trust for you,

214
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
and turned your sword against us.

215
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
You wished you could cut out our hearts and livers,

216
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,679
and suck our blood for your own use.

217
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,559
But even that wasn't enough.

218
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,960
You even wanted to take away everything we wished for,

219
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,039
everything we desired.

220
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,279
You made each of us lose what we loved most.

221
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,759
Yet in the mess you created,

222
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,679
you still dared to chase some dream of becoming immortal.

223
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
It's just a pity

224
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,200
No matter how hard you tried later in life

225
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,720
No matter how much you wished to become immortal

226
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,519
and live forever

227
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,919
in the end

228
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,120
you were just an old man who couldn't defy fate

229
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,200
We were father and son

230
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,399
Now we're separated by life and death

231
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,879
I really want to ask you

232
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,080
At the moment of your passing

233
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,320
Did you see paradise

234
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,759
or did you realize that the path to immortality

235
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,480
was nothing but an illusion in the end

236
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,960
Now that you're dead, you finally got your wish

237
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,559
The dead are gone

238
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,919
and will never grow old

239
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,120
Bones buried in the earth

240
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,960
are truly everlasting

241
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,120
But what about the living

242
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,320
I've figured it out

243
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,480
I can't live like I used to

244
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,759
I want to live for myself for once

245
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,519
To live for us

246
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,399
Yun Ming

247
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,279
You

248
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't speak

249
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,320
Your elder brother will be back soon

250
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
What's really going on

251
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,759
You're not my brother's wife

252
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,600
You're Hong Xiu

253
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,600
You're mine
