1
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,000
Respectfully welcome the imperial consort.

2
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,519
Junior disciple

3
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
I hope you've been well since we last met.

4
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,439
Your illness

5
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,400
has not responded to any medicine.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,079
I'm afraid you won't live past this year.

7
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,280
It's all right.

8
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,599
This time has been enough for me.

9
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,519
That Cold Blade must be your junior disciple, right?

10
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,120
Yes.

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,719
I recognized him as soon as he entered the manor.

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,520
If you ask me,

13
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,560
him bringing Xiao Ying to visit relatives is just a pretense.

14
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,159
He wants to kill me

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
and that's probably the real reason.

16
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,960
Master, you know as well,

17
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,360
that Master treated him like her own child.

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,759
He also wants to find out the truth.

19
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,759
He wants to uncover the truth behind Master's descent into madness.

20
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,159
Open it and see.

21
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,240
Master raised us with her own hands.

22
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
But I killed her.

23
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Your master lost control

24
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
but you can't blame yourself.

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,680
Let me ask you,

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
my master lost control—

27
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,120
was it really related to you?

28
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,360
Xian'er and I truly loved each other.

29
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,120
I would never harm her.

30
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,080
But you don't believe that.

31
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,680
And neither will your junior disciple.

32
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,960
I know.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
You and your junior brother came to my Peach Blossom Manor

34
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,599
though you took different paths,

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,199
but for the same purpose.

36
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,439
I can easily deduce

37
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,840
that you two worked together to kill the imperial consort

38
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,439
and want to frame me.

39
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,000
You want to kill with a borrowed knife.

40
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,400
All I need is to send a message by carrier pigeon

41
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,879
to inform the capital

42
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,560
that you and your junior brother killed the imperial consort together.

43
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,039
You won't even last seven days.

44
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,400
You will surely die.

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
Unless you do as I say.

46
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,560
You don't have long to live.

47
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,159
But your junior brother still has a bright future ahead.

48
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
I think

49
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,959
you must care about your junior brother's life or death.

50
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,600
Leech.

51
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,920
Do you know why Yun Su has silver hair and a youthful face?

52
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,560
Because to stay young forever,

53
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,839
he uses this to exchange blood with his two sons.

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,079
And the leech

55
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,600
is the medium for the blood.

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,920
Such a private matter—

57
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,199
how do you know about it?

58
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,519
You suspect me?

59
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,519
Because he threatened me with your life,

60
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,439
forcing me to be his blood vessel.

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,759
You don't believe me?

62
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,360
Then maybe he admired my swordsmanship

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,839
and made me his watchdog.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,759
Do you believe that?

65
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,079
Believe whatever you want.

66
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,800
Even if I tell the truth,

67
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,319
you probably won't believe me.

68
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,600
Bark.

69
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,480
Louder.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,680
Get down.

71
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,959
Little sister

72
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,439
How do you think I’ve trained your beloved pet?

73
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,560
Sir

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,759
Too dirty

75
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,120
Big brother

76
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,519
I’m begging you

77
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,839
Please let him go

78
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,240
No rush

79
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,120
Do you still love her?

80
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,279
This dog says he doesn’t love you anymore

81
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,199
What do dogs usually like to eat?

82
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,120
Bones

83
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,480
But there’s something he loves to eat even more

84
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,720
Come

85
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,759
No

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,879
Eat it

87
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,519
And I’ll let you go

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,560
Sir

89
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,920
Don’t eat it

90
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,199
At worst, we’ll die together

91
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,279
You

92
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,879
Just forget about me

93
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,399
No

94
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,839
You’ll still come here often

95
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,040
Whenever I feel soft-hearted

96
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,639
I’ll come here to take a look

97
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,759
And think about what happened here back then

98
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,360
Then my heart hardens again

99
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,959
It’s not like I don’t know what’s on your mind

100
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,480
Back then, your beloved could at least ask for a quick end

101
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,720
And be done with it all

102
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,560
But I

103
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,279
I’m afraid I won’t even get the chance to die cleanly

104
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,240
My time is almost up.

105
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,279
What did he give you to eat?

106
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,240
The inner core inside your body is coming out.

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,480
I'm afraid I really won't survive.

108
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,080
I'll go beg him again.

109
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,399
It's useless.

110
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,919
He went to great lengths.

111
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,039
He won't listen to anyone.

112
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,600
Don't be afraid.

113
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll find a way.

114
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,039
I won't let you die.

115
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,720
Even Yunyang and Yunming can't stop him.

116
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,039
Can you?

117
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,200
If it really comes to that,

118
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,120
I'll find a way to get you out.

119
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,519
Why are you helping me?

120
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,639
If you can make it out alive,

121
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,399
I'll be happy for you.

122
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
What are you doing here?

123
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,799
What?

124
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,799
Not welcoming me?

125
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,639
I'm here

126
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,240
just to remind you of something.

127
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,000
Being a dog,

128
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,320
means you have to act like one.

129
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,720
Don't easily

130
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,000
try to guess your master's intentions.

131
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,320
And you must never try to defy your master.

132
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
You and I are both dogs of this manor.

133
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,720
You're not any nobler than I am.

134
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Right now, I have

135
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,320
a chance for us to become human.

136
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,039
What do you mean by that?

137
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,080
Do you want to serve the master of the manor,

138
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,840
or the young master?

139
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,480
Big Brother,

140
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,440
Everything that happened between me and Sister-in-law is my fault.

141
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,039
Please punish me, Big Brother.

142
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,399
Punish you?

143
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
Have you thought carefully about what I told you?

144
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,399
I'm willing to do whatever you ask, Big Brother.

145
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,879
But...

146
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,759
I... I have one condition.

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,799
Go ahead.

148
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,440
I hope you will set Hongxiu free.

149
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,759
Big Brother,

150
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,159
I'm willing to stay by your side forever.

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,960
Even if I have to die for you, I would do so willingly.

152
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,080
Yun Ming,

153
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,120
Are you trying to bargain with me?

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,279
I beg you to grant my request, Big Brother.

155
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
Please punish me, Big Brother.

156
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,879
The fish-skin whip is woven from shark skin.

157
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,039
It goes through dozens of processes of polishing and drying.

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,559
It's soft yet tough.

159
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,559
It was originally used for whipping horses.

160
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,720
But if a member of the Yun family makes a mistake,

161
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
they must also endure this whipping.

162
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,679
I always carry the fish-skin whip with me

163
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,799
to remind myself

164
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,840
that I am always a member of the Yun family.

165
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,519
Which family rule did you break?

166
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,159
I...

167
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,399
I had an affair with Sister-in-law.

168
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,960
When was the first time?

169
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,519
Where did it happen?

170
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
On New Year's Eve two years ago.

171
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,200
Right here.

172
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,679
Hongxiu

173
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,440
Yunming

174
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,480
I knew you would come looking for me.

175
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,039
You promised me you would protect me.

176
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
You are my sister-in-law now.

178
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,399
So what?

179
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,360
Have you forgotten?

180
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,879
When we first met,

181
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,000
your older brother and I weren't engaged yet.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,559
But...

183
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,720
But what?

184
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,159
Yunming

185
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,960
Here in Peach Blossom Manor,

186
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,600
you're all I have.

187
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
If I must bear a child of the Yun family,

188
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,200
I want it to be yours.

189
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,559
No, you can't.

190
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,879
Absolutely not.

191
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
I can't betray my brother.

192
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
He still thinks he can control everything.

193
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
I want to show him

194
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,320
that he can never control

195
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,440
a girl's heart.

196
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,080
Which family rule did you break?

197
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:58,840
I...

198
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,480
I've let you down, big brother.

199
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm asking you.

200
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,840
What is the purpose of family discipline?

201
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,440
The ancestral family rules

202
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,480
are meant to remind us of our deep brotherhood.

203
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,519
As long as you remember, that's enough.

204
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,879
Now the manor is in grave danger.

205
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,360
You and I must join forces.

206
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,279
To fight our common enemy.

207
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,879
As for you and Hongxiu,

208
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,120
I can pretend I don't know.

209
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,440
Our brotherhood runs deep.

210
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,679
To me,

211
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,679
what does a woman matter?

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Let alone Hongxiu.

213
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,480
If things succeed,

214
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,440
I can let Hongxiu go.

215
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,600
But if, before that,

216
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,960
she dares to run away again,

217
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,200
and ruins my plans,

218
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,039
I won't let her off as easily as before.

219
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,360
I won't spare her so easily.

220
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,080
You know as well,

221
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,440
the whole Peach Blossom Manor is my eyes and ears.

222
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,639
Without my permission,

223
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,440
no one can escape.

224
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,399
Thank you, big brother, for your understanding.

225
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,600
But I still must accept the family punishment.

226
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,840
The blood I shed belongs to you, big brother.

227
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,559
My life was given by you.

228
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,159
However you punish me, I will accept it.
