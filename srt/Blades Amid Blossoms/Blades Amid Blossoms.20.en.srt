1
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,960
Father

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,640
Qingxuan

3
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,520
Heaven's will favors you

4
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,840
You have passed the selection for court ladies

5
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,560
You will enter the palace on a chosen day

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,119
To serve His Majesty

7
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,359
Father, I...

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't want to enter the palace

9
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,239
How dare you

10
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,359
I already have someone I love

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,680
I don't want to enter the palace

12
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,120
Please, Father

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,519
I won't go to the palace

14
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,920
This place is a cage

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,120
The palace is just another cage

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,079
Once inside, you'll be like a caged bird

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Trapped there for the rest of your life

18
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,680
Take me away with you

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,599
Let's go

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Where are we going?

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
I invited you here to teach

22
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,599
You set your sights on my younger sister

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,599
You have quite the nerve

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,799
I chose him myself

25
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,799
You are now a member of the Yun family

26
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,640
Even your life belongs to the Yun family

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,439
How can you choose for yourself?

28
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:58,959
Guards

29
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,400
Take him away

30
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,280
Yes

31
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,000
Let him go

32
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,760
Let me go

33
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,479
Where are you taking him?

34
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,000
Let me go

35
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,000
Go

36
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,080
Speak.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,680
How did you seduce my sister?

38
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,000
The two of us

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
have mutual feelings for each other.

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,599
Back during the Peach Blossom Pool memorial,

41
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,599
you persuaded my father to adopt my two younger sisters.

42
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,919
Were you already planning something with them back then?

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,039
Planning to seduce Qingxuan first,

44
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,080
then seduce Xiaoying?

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,840
My feelings for the eldest miss

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,400
are completely sincere.

47
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,439
Everyone says

48
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,520
that I am truly sincere.

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,520
But can your sincerity really stand the test?

50
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,759
I happen to have something

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
The origin of this item

52
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,439
is quite intriguing.

53
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,560
It was made by a heartless woman.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,080
It can be used to test

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,319
how much your sincerity is really worth.

56
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,400
Qingxuan, come down first. Don't come over here.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,560
If you don't let Mr. Gu go,

58
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,840
I'll die right here in front of you.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,439
Fine, I'll let him go.

60
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,159
Come down first.

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,879
Really?

62
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
You're not lying to me, are you?

63
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,680
You're the imperial consort now.

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,079
I have no reason to lie to you.

65
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Where is he?

66
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,399
I want to see him.

67
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,519
Little sister,

68
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,639
take a good look.

69
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,720
The one you love

70
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,439
is just a cowardly wretch afraid of death.

71
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,199
Why go against Father for someone like him?

72
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,439
Young Master,

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
didn't you promise me

74
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,839
that if I ate this, you'd let me go?

75
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,160
I did promise to let you go,

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,160
but I never said whether you'd be alive or dead.

77
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,000
Big brother,

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,560
everything you asked him to do,

79
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,079
he's done it all.

80
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,759
Please spare his life.

81
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,839
I can't do that.

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,680
You're going to be a consort.

83
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,480
I was wrong.

84
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,319
Big brother, it was my fault.

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,279
Please, big brother, let him go.

86
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,199
Big brother, I was wrong.

87
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,560
Big brother,

88
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,600
it was my fault.

89
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,199
I was wrong.

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,439
Big brother,

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
let him go.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,279
The poison in your body

93
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,240
has almost been cleared out.

94
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,800
I've read about the assassin Yu Rang from the Warring States period.

95
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
He painted his body to look like a ghost,

96
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,399
shaved off his beard and eyebrows,

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
and swallowed charcoal to make himself mute.

98
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
You are a master of medicine.

99
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,639
Can you help me change my voice

100
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,560
and alter my appearance?

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,720
He disfigured himself to change his looks,

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,519
and swallowed charcoal to change his voice.

103
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,680
It was excruciatingly painful.

104
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,800
Ordinary people couldn't endure it.

105
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
I've already died once.

106
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,199
What is there to be afraid of?

107
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,959
I want revenge.

108
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,720
Since that's the case,

109
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,600
let's give it a try.

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,959
Gu Hongyi,

111
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,839
I will avenge you.

112
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,120
So you changed your face

113
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,680
and returned to Peach Blossom Manor

114
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,639
all for the sake of revenge

115
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,560
Exactly

116
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,680
Peach Blossom Manor is full of filth and corruption

117
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,639
It's not a pure land at all

118
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,360
Then why did you help Hongxiu

119
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,079
When I returned to the manor

120
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,680
I found Hongxiu

121
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
was just like I was back then

122
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
living in misery and torment

123
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,879
I didn't want to see another woman

124
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,759
fall into ruin, treated like a plaything

125
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,959
So I wanted to help her

126
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,959
Hongxiu hates the Yun father and son to the core

127
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,199
Our goals are the same

128
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,079
So you were involved in the deaths of Yun Su and Yun Yang

129
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,919
If it weren't for those two back then

130
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
I wouldn't be living like this today

131
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,759
I wanted to kill them myself to avenge myself

132
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,879
But I didn't expect Hongxiu

133
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,440
to start making her move before I did

134
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,600
So I might as well reap the benefits

135
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,279
and let someone else do the dirty work

136
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,840
So the Peach Blossom Powder they were poisoned with

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,879
was all administered by you for Hongxiu

138
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,679
That's right

139
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,000
Back then, Yun Yang used Peach Blossom Powder to destroy my mind

140
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,000
I wanted him to taste that suffering too

141
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,879
Then the death of the imperial consort

142
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
was your doing as well

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,080
Yun Xiaoying's life was always mine to begin with.

144
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,879
If it hadn't been for me back then,

145
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
she would have been pushed into the Peach Blossom Pool as a living sacrifice long ago.

146
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
She wouldn't have survived until the time she entered the palace.

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,039
If I don't kill her,

148
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,600
how could I throw Peach Blossom Manor into chaos?

149
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,799
And how could I use the Peach Blossom Calamity

150
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,120
to kill Yun Su and Yun Yang?

151
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,279
You told me that on the night the imperial consort was killed,

152
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,639
you saw with your own eyes

153
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,399
Yun Su and the imperial consort arguing.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,240
The person the imperial consort wanted to see that night was me.

155
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,279
I came to see you all.

156
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,440
Xiaoying.

157
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,159
How are your studies going?

158
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
You are...

159
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,639
Important people really are forgetful.

160
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,159
Have you forgotten

161
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,840
to humble yourself and guard your fate,

162
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,159
waiting for the right time?

163
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,440
You are Mr. Gu.

164
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,519
I've been waiting for you here for a long time.

165
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,440
You finally came back.

166
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,279
Wait for me.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,720
Have you forgotten

168
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,600
you owe me a life?

169
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,600
Today,

170
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,519
you should return it to me.

171
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,559
So Yuniang was also killed by you.

172
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,519
Then you had her accuse Yan Shiyi.

173
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,919
To confuse everyone.

174
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,159
You are truly wise, my lord.

175
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,279
The young master has given an order.

176
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,960
He commands you to identify Yan Shiyi. Did you hear that?

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,480
Yes.

178
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,000
After Lady Yu identifies Young Hero Yan,

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,399
she will no longer be of any use.

180
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,679
Keeping her around would be a disadvantage to me.

181
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,519
So she must die.

182
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,120
Besides, this person will do anything for money.

183
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,879
She is both Master Yun's spy

184
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,600
and Yun Yang's pawn.

185
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,240
Someone like her cannot be kept alive.
