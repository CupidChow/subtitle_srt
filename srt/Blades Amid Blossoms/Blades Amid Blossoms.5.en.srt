1
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Master, it's getting late.

2
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,600
Let me escort you back to your room to rest.

3
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,679
That won't be necessary.

4
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,399
The moonlight is so beautiful tonight.

5
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,119
I'll take a walk in the bamboo grove.

6
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,039
Rest early.

7
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,760
Why are you so jumpy?

8
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,280
It was at this moment

9
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
that you realized Yuniang, like you,

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
was unfamiliar with the terrain here.

11
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,439
She was lost.

12
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,280
That's right.

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,560
But there's something I've never understood.

14
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,319
With such a large bamboo forest,

15
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,680
why must it be planted according to the Bagua directions

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,480
to arrange it?

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,960
And then?

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,439
Did you hear anything?

19
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,400
I think, deep in the bamboo forest,

20
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,639
I heard the imperial consort arguing with someone.

21
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,240
Was the person arguing with the consort Yun Su?

22
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,479
I'm not sure about that.

23
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,000
I originally wanted to get closer,

24
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,560
but unexpectedly, at that moment, Yuniang

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,280
walked toward me.

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,039
I had no choice.

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,479
I could only jump like this.

28
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,159
Who are you?

29
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,439
And who are you?

30
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,159
Me?

31
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,360
I, I, I...

32
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,639
Come on.

33
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,199
Want a drink?

34
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,439
No.

35
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,919
Then I'll drink by myself.

36
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,879
You drunkard.

37
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,120
I am a drunkard by nature.

38
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,240
Why are you following Yun Su?

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,439
Why are you only telling me now?

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,599
What exactly are you trying to hide?

41
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,000
Then I have to confirm something first.

42
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,879
Your attitude toward the past.

43
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,319
Junior brother,

44
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,879
do you still remember

45
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,680
that every year, for a few days,

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,599
Master would go traveling?

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,840
Every year when she traveled,

48
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,000
the peach blossoms were in full bloom.

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
Just like now.

50
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,960
And I also found out

51
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,560
that she always went to the same place.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,759
Peach Blossom Manor.

53
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,479
So this time,

54
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,000
when you escorted the imperial consort to visit her family,

55
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,719
you came to Peach Blossom Manor.

56
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,039
I was convinced

57
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,000
that you and I came here for the same reason.

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
To find out what happened

59
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,439
between Yun Su and Master back then.

60
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,680
Yun Su is now our common goal.

61
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,120
Master's unresolved issue is with Yun Su.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,639
You really are Master's good disciple.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,279
What are they doing?

64
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,879
Be patient.

65
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,079
Just watch for now.

66
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,839
Don't be anxious.

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,920
Washing the face like a lotus blossom.

68
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,279
All makeup washed away, revealing fragrant, snowy cheeks.

69
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,800
Second, wash the veil on your shoulders

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,399
The smooth hot spring water cleanses your delicate skin

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,480
Go, go, go

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,240
Third, wash your plain clothes

73
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,079
With jade-like bones and icy skin, present yourself to the lord

74
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,759
Go down

75
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,600
Go down, go down

76
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,240
What exactly are they doing?

77
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,560
What do you think?

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,480
These women are being given to Yun Su

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,639
That's right

80
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,639
They are all medicine testers for Yun Su

81
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,000
Alright, alright

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,240
It's her

83
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:00,839
It's her

84
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,879
Go

85
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,560
As for this Yun Su

86
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,959
He wants to live forever

87
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,120
So he's obsessed with alchemy

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,279
But these pills are often poisonous

89
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,240
So every time

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,480
A medicine tester has to try the pills for him

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,079
What happens to these testers after they take the medicine?

92
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,000
If they're lucky

93
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,519
They survive

94
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,120
And receive a reward

95
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,720
If they're unlucky

96
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,879
They die from the poison

97
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,720
And are buried in the bamboo forest

98
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,720
How do you know all this?

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,120
Are you close with Yun Su?

100
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,079
I'm here to investigate why my master went astray

101
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,199
Of course I have to blend in with the enemy

102
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,600
Isn't that just going along with the bad guys?

103
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Junior brother

104
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,120
If the water is too clear, there will be no fish

105
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,000
If the water is clear, no one can fish in troubled waters

106
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,920
Is my father still in good health?

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Young Master

108
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,959
Do you hope that the old master stays healthy,

109
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,240
or that he doesn't?

110
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Of course I hope he lives a long life.

111
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,279
No matter how long the master lives,

112
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,360
he will grow old one day.

113
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,680
If you can't wait any longer,

114
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,120
now is the perfect time, with the manor in chaos.

115
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,040
This might be a good chance to take his place.

116
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,519
How would I take his place?

117
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,480
One word:

118
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,040
Wait.

119
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,560
Wait for what?

120
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,360
Of course, wait for our Peach Blossom Calamity

121
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,279
to happen again.

122
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,639
So, in other words,

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,319
you also believe the Peach Blossom Calamity is real.

124
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,920
The secret of the Peach Blossom Calamity

125
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,600
might only be known to your Yun family.

126
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,959
Could it be

127
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,759
you don't consider yourself part of the Yun family?

128
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,000
No, no, I wouldn't dare.

129
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,240
Everyone in Peach Blossom Manor knows

130
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,160
that you, Uncle He,

131
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,240
are like half a son to the master.

132
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,040
Young Master, you must be joking.

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,319
I'm just a servant.

134
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,920
How could I be worthy of that?

135
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,720
A servant needs a master.

136
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,039
And the master must be the strongest one.

137
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,879
What do you think?

138
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,639
From the way things look right now,

139
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,799
Yunyang is the most suspicious.

140
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,919
Think about it.

141
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,440
The imperial consort is dead.

142
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,480
Yunsu has lost his backing.

143
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,519
And Yunyang wants to replace Yunsu.

144
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,919
With the consort's death,

145
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,360
the biggest beneficiary is Yunyang.

146
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,879
But the evidence we have right now

147
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,120
isn't enough to prove that the person we suspect

148
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
is actually the killer.

149
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Uncle He just said something.

150
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,080
Wait for the Peach Blossom Calamity to happen again.

151
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
Could it be that someone else will be harmed?

152
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,320
The killer leaves messages after killing.

153
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,200
It's a deliberate attempt to confuse us.

154
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,879
I'm afraid the killer wants to murder more than just one or two people.

155
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,639
Who will be the next victim?

156
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,440
Then who do you think

157
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,600
poses the biggest threat to Yunyang?

158
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,960
Yunsu.

159
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
If Yunsu is going to die,

160
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,480
will you stop it

161
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,840
or not?

162
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,320
Of course I'll stop it.

163
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,960
Once we find the real killer,

164
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,000
Yunsu will definitely die by my hand.

165
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,320
Alright.

166
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,600
Since you've made up your mind,

167
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,559
let's go.

168
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,120
Let's go investigate Yunyang right now.

169
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,919
How do we investigate?

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,919
How?

171
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,360
Naturally, we go see him.

172
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,879
Just go and confront him directly.

173
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,320
Let's do that.

174
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,320
Lord Han Dao

175
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,360
Is something the matter?

176
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,360
Young Master

177
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,480
I want to ask

178
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,480
What are you doing?

179
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,360
Yan Shiyi

180
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,480
If you want to inspect the Young Master,

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,440
why not just say so directly?

182
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,879
Would the Young Master refuse?

183
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,360
Why resort to such sneaky actions?

184
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,200
I was just worried he might refuse.

185
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,080
I know what you’re looking for.

186
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,360
If you want to see,

187
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,360
I’ll show you.

188
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,720
It’s not necessary to look.

189
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,720
My wife and I are affectionate.

190
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,759
When passion arises,

191
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,200
it’s inevitable that things might get a little out of hand.

192
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,919
What?

193
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,360
Haven’t you heard of bedroom arts and their pleasures, my lord?

194
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,799
May I leave now?

195
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,159
Coming.

196
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,200
Young Madam

197
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,360
I went to the pharmacy early this morning.

198
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,000
I picked up some medicine for you while I was there.

199
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,200
Thank you, Young Madam.

200
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,200
Let’s talk inside.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,080
Young Madam, you came today

202
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,919
not just to bring me medicine, right?

203
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,399
I just found an excuse

204
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,519
to come by and visit.

205
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,000
I really envy you.

206
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,440
You have a place that’s all your own.

207
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,120
How could a person's heart ever be confined by a single place?

208
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,080
By the way,

209
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
how is my business in the capital going?

210
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,559
The pharmacy business is, of course, doing well.

211
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,039
That's more than just a pharmacy.

212
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,080
That's my backup plan.

213
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,120
I heard that women in the capital can ride horses.

214
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,840
Not only can they ride horses,

215
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,559
they can also wear men's Hu-style clothing.

216
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,440
Practice martial arts,

217
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,039
and train with swords.

218
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,080
Why do they wear men's Hu-style clothing?

219
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,919
They're not imitating men.

220
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
It's about freedom.

221
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,360
Freedom—

222
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,399
the freedom to wear whatever they want,

223
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,639
and to do whatever they wish.

224
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,879
If they want to,

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
they can not only go out to ride horses and practice swordsmanship,

226
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,720
but also become officials,

227
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,519
or run businesses.

228
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,639
I'm afraid you're just making this up to amuse me.

229
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
These are fanciful stories you've invented.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,720
How could there be such a wonderful place in this world?

231
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,000
When you see it for yourself one day,

232
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
you'll know whether I'm making it up.

233
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,120
I hope that day will come.

234
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,440
Where there's a will, there's a way.

235
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,039
Young Madam,

236
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,240
the Young Master is looking for you everywhere.

237
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
He asks you to come over.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,480
Alright.

239
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,559
I'll go right away.

240
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,120
See?

241
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:38,679
With him around,

242
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
I can't even get through the door.

243
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,000
Unless—

244
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,360
unless the Peach Blossom Calamity is real.

245
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,840
Young Master

246
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,039
Without the master's orders

247
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,519
no one is allowed to enter.

248
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
This is Peach Blossom Manor.

249
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,000
I want to pay my respects to my sister.

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why not?

251
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,639
But Young Master, please do not touch the body.

252
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,159
Xiao Ying

253
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,240
It's been many years since we parted.

254
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,200
I never thought that when we met again

255
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,480
it would be separated by life and death.
