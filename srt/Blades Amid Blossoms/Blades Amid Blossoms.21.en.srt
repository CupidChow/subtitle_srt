1
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,399
The lonely old man

2
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,200
goes beneath the peach blossom tree.

3
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,719
So you took the initiative to give us clues

4
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,319
and even told us the origin of the Peach Blossom Tragedy

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
all to mislead us

6
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,760
even going so far as to accuse Uncle He later on

7
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,120
that was also to confuse us, wasn't it

8
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,239
The Peach Blossom Tragedy was a massacre at the manor

9
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,359
Letting more people know about it

10
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,640
was to seek justice for the women who died

11
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,000
What I want you to know is

12
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,560
villains like Yun Yang and Yun Su

13
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,359
deserve no pity in death

14
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,640
Deserve no pity in death, indeed

15
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,519
What about Hongxiu

16
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,599
Why did you use her

17
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,000
Hongxiu is a pitiful person

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,000
but she got what she wished for

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,200
She always wanted to kill

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
the Yun father and son who abused her

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,159
She got her wish

22
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,599
She wanted to be with the one she loved

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,039
They became husband and wife before she died

24
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,000
Isn't that a kind of fulfillment

25
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,680
You and I may not be better off than her

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,319
You've been at Peach Blossom Manor for so long

27
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,800
Did the young lady never recognize you

28
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,000
The young lady is very perceptive

29
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,599
I'm not sure if she recognized me

30
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,319
Young lady

31
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,879
I always feel like I've seen your figure somewhere before

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
You must have mistaken me for someone else

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,599
I've never been here before

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
I must have been mistaken

35
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,599
That person died a long time ago

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,639
How could he possibly appear again

37
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,680
He was an old acquaintance of the young lady

38
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,919
He was my teacher

39
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,960
and also the one I loved

40
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,199
The young lady still remembers him

41
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,879
I believe he would be content

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
He once taught me

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,199
that a gentleman can be killed but not humiliated.

44
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,520
But he couldn't live up to that himself.

45
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,800
He filled his mind with the teachings of sages,

46
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
yet he was a coward.

47
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,360
Someone like that

48
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
maybe should have been forgotten long ago.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,360
Yes.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,080
It's just as well to forget someone like that.

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,080
But if I could see him again,

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,159
I would like to ask him

53
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,560
if he were given another chance,

54
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,720
what would he choose?

55
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,720
Would he die with me,

56
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,600
or survive alone in disgrace?

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,319
Miss, you must be joking.

58
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,519
Things in this world

59
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,079
cannot be done over.

60
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,519
For you to think this way, Miss,

61
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,680
is nothing but wishful thinking.

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,560
He once wrote on a lantern

63
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,879
"When the wild geese return,"

64
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,800
"the moon fills the western tower."

65
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,360
Even wild geese leave and return.

66
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,600
If I could truly see him again,

67
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,120
I would want to tell him

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,519
that I regret it.

69
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,800
He doesn't deserve it.

70
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,079
That year, I changed my face and returned to the manor.

71
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,680
It was for revenge.

72
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,439
And also to see her one more time.

73
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,959
But she told me

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
that she regretted it.

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,879
She blamed everything on me.

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,759
But what did I do wrong?

77
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,959
It was the Yun father and son who were at fault.

78
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,360
Back then, I was just a frail scholar.

79
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,160
How could I possibly fight against the ruthless

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,360
Yun Su and Yun Yang?

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,240
And also,

82
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,360
if it hadn't been for me back then,

83
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,439
Yun Qingxuan wouldn't be here today.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,319
She would have ended up like Yun Xiaoying

85
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,360
pushed into the Peach Blossom Pool.

86
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
She owes me her life.

87
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,319
If you need anything, come to me.

88
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
I want to take you to meet someone.

89
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,279
Gu Hongyi died here all those years ago.

90
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,879
Darn it, he deserved it.

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,720
But he wasn't the only one who deserved it.

92
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
Who are you, really?

93
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:44,839
Qingxuan.

94
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,399
It's me, I've come back.

95
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,160
Gu Hongyi.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,040
But your face...

97
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,560
There's no such person as Gu Hongyi in this world anymore.

98
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,920
My great revenge is complete.

99
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,360
I should have gone to my death in peace.

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,399
But there's one wish left unfulfilled.

101
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,399
Xiaoying.

102
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,199
Big Brother.

103
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,079
And Father.

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
It was all your doing.

105
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,600
That's right, it was me.

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,839
I've taken my revenge.

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,800
But this one unfulfilled wish...

108
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,360
It was a promise Gu Hongyi made to you back then.

109
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
To stay by your side, in life and death.

110
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm here to fulfill that promise for him.

111
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,279
Didn't you say you wanted to become a firefly after you died?

112
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
Fireflies rise from decaying grass.

113
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,360
Isn't it nice to die here?

114
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
You go on ahead.

115
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,959
I'll follow right after.

116
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,279
Together in life and death

117
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,000
I finally did it

118
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,680
Gu Hongyi

119
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,519
Gu Hongyi

120
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,360
I haven't used that name in a long time

121
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,040
You could even kill the one you love

122
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,240
And you call it "together in life and death"

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,560
If you ask me

124
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,399
It's just for your own selfish desires

125
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,600
There's no real justice in this world

126
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,040
So what if I act for my own desires?

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
If you truly cared about someone

128
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
How could you bear to let her die in front of you?

129
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,159
At least now, no one can separate us anymore

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,320
Before I face justice

131
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,759
I want to show you something

132
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,080
Sir

133
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
Before I return to the capital with you

134
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,080
I want to fill all these lanterns with words

135
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,039
It's my last wish

136
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,879
Is that alright?

137
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,200
Speak.

138
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
You brought us here.

139
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,559
What exactly do you want us to see?

140
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,960
I've said everything I needed to say.

141
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,080
I killed them.

142
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,039
But I won't plead guilty.

143
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,919
Everyone in this Peach Blossom Manor deserves to die.

144
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,279
They got what they deserved.

145
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,080
Their deaths are nothing to be pitied.

146
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,200
So I won't go with you.

147
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,960
I won't.

148
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,320
Never.

149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,840
Peach blossoms scatter.

150
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,639
Hold your breath.

151
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:50,759
Let's go.

152
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,039
You are Gu Hongyi.

153
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,360
That's right.

154
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,120
You can take this and expose me.

155
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,960
That's what I want to do most.

156
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,200
I'm a bit confused.

157
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,960
I once foolishly hoped

158
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,399
to spend this whole life with her.

159
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:06,159
But it turned out to be nothing but a fleeting dream.

160
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,559
In this life, I can't be with her.

161
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,120
But now,

162
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,399
I can stay by her side forever.

163
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:16,679
By the way,

164
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,840
after the young lady died,

165
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,039
the Yun family was wiped out.

166
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,759
This manor now belongs to you.

167
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,679
But have you really thought it through?

168
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,320
For the rest of your life,

169
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,759
will you just guard these broken ruins?

170
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,919
Most good things don't last.

171
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,159
Colorful clouds scatter easily, and glass is fragile.

172
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,639
Many years ago, when I was in the capital,

173
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,480
I met a passionate young scholar.

174
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
He recited this poem while drinking.

175
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,200
But when I saw him again years later,

176
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,720
he didn't remember at all

177
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,440
the poem he once recited.

178
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,840
The life he experienced

179
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,679
was spent wallowing in self-pity in this small place.

180
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,840
Young Master He,

181
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,799
what is it that makes you unwilling to leave?

182
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,840
I remember that in this Peach Blossom Manor before,

183
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,600
I never talked about the past with Gu Hongyi.

184
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,279
You—

185
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,519
How did you know my surname is He?

186
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,879
Could it be that from the capital—

187
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,000
we've met before?

188
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,240
Brother He,

189
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,799
I don't have much time left.

190
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,600
Since we have met in this life,

191
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,159
I entrust this matter to you.
