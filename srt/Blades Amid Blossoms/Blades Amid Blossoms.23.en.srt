1
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,840
Sister

2
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:44,920
Sister

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,320
Sister, does it hurt?

4
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,520
It doesn't hurt.

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,240
How could it not hurt?

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,759
Look at you.

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,880
You were taken to test the pills again today, weren't you?

8
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,000
After taking that medicine,

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,719
at first, your whole body just aches.

10
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,759
After a few days, you'll be like me.

11
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,719
The poison will come to the surface.

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,239
It's even more painful than scraping the bone.

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,439
Compared to you all,

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
I was only beaten up.

15
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,079
I just took a few lashes.

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,879
That's actually lighter.

17
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,439
What did we do wrong?

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
To deserve such harm?

19
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,760
We did nothing wrong.

20
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,680
The ones at fault are the people in this manor.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,480
Just accept your fate.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,439
I won't accept it.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,079
What if we can make it out alive?

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,760
At least we should think about it.

25
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,799
If we really do escape,

26
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,159
what do you want to do?

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,719
I want to have a good meal first.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,239
I want to

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,239
go find my family.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
I

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,680
I want to see what the capital looks like.

32
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,200
I

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,079
I want to see my brother.

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,920
See if he's recovered from his illness.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,000
Sister

36
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:02,840
What about you?

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,480
I

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,919
I used to want to be like my family,

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,800
become a doctor who helps the world.

40
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,759
But now...

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,199
If I can make it out alive,

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
I will destroy this place.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,759
A doctor cannot heal the heart.

44
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,919
The people in this manor have no heart.

45
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,439
If I can make it out alive,

46
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,240
I swear,

47
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,439
I definitely

48
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,879
will kill them.

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
These evil people must pay the price.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
They won't die a good death.

52
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,479
Today,

53
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,840
Xiaoying and I went to give the old master a blood transfusion.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,919
We tried several times, but it didn't work.

55
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,120
Then we were thrown outside the alchemy room.

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,919
We also heard the fake alchemist say

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,120
they want the master

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,680
to choose a young girl as a living sacrifice for Peach Blossom Pool.

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,199
And they'll pick from among us.

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,159
When?

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Today at Shen hour. (3-5 PM)

62
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,800
What should we do?

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,240
Don't grab me! Don't grab me!

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
Come here! Let go of me!

65
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,479
Don't come closer! Let me go!

66
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,400
Sister!

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,879
Let me go!

68
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,439
Let me go!

69
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,120
Xiaoying!

70
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,280
Let me go! Go!

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,439
Sister!

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,639
Behave yourself.

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Qingxuan!

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Let me go!

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,719
Wait!

76
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,280
Qingxuan!

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,919
I'm begging you, go!

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Wake up, Qingxuan!

79
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,600
Pick another one.

80
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,160
Yes.

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,079
Sister

82
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,839
Don't come over here

83
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,439
Sister

84
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,800
Go

85
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,800
Let me go

86
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,040
I'm begging you

87
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,720
Please, let me go

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm begging you

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,519
Sister

90
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,759
Sister

91
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,519
I remember each of their faces.

92
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,199
Later, Gu Hongyi told me

93
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,279
when they were sunk into Peach Blossom Lake,

94
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,800
they were surrounded by

95
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
callous murderers and indifferent onlookers.

96
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,560
Four lives,

97
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,160
were treated as less than ants or mayflies.

98
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,279
They never even saw

99
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,160
the most beautiful side of this world.

100
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,680
And just like that, they vanished from the world.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,279
This is said to be

102
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,279
the most beautiful Peach Blossom Manor in the martial world,

103
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,639
but in my heart, it's a graveyard of murder and devoured corpses.

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Since then,

105
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,720
not a day has passed without me thinking of avenging them.

106
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,399
Later,

107
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
I finally got my chance.

108
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,560
I decided to kill these murderers

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,839
and the indifferent onlookers, one by one.

110
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,560
Bodhisattvas fear the cause,

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,079
while mortals fear the consequence.

112
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,720
They really are darn it.

113
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,399
But what about the imperial consort?

114
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,560
Why did you kill her?

115
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,120
Wasn't she a victim just like you?

116
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,360
I remember you told me many times

117
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,160
that you and the imperial consort were as close as sisters.

118
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,680
So,

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,519
why did you kill her?

120
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,079
Where did you hide her body?

121
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,680
It's because after she entered the palace and became the imperial consort,

122
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,680
she forgot the promise we made together back then

123
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,639
to avenge our sisters.

124
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,560
The past is best left unspoken.

125
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,360
You came.

126
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,920
Sister

127
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm no longer your sister.

128
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,079
Why do you say that?

129
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,560
Haven't we long been as close as sisters?

130
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,879
But you've forgotten.

131
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,519
You've forgotten the promise we made.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,959
I haven't forgotten.

133
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,399
I've come to see them.

134
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
I remember each one of them.

135
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Every face.

136
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,959
Then why won't you take revenge with me?

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,120
Only if we fulfill our promise to them

138
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,680
can they rest in peace.

139
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,959
My status is different now.

140
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
In this deep palace,

141
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,560
I have to deal with the scheming of the concubines every day.

142
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm really tired.

143
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,439
I just want a few peaceful days.

144
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,360
Your peaceful days were bought with their lives.

145
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,560
Sister.

146
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,279
Maybe they also want us to let go of hatred.

147
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,040
And live well.

148
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,480
After all,

149
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,439
the dead are gone.

150
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,839
You can let go,

151
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,000
but I can't.

152
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,279
Every time I close my eyes,

153
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,720
I see them watching me.

154
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
Since you don't want revenge,

155
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,160
I'll do it myself.

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,040
Sister.

157
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,800
I advise you not to act rashly.

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,639
If you are exposed,

159
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,079
you will definitely implicate me.

160
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,920
I am now a royal consort.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,319
I can't have any stain on my name.

162
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,800
You've changed.

163
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,079
I just want to cherish the present.

164
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,120
So when you kept saying it was for my own good back then,

165
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,480
and entered the palace in my place,

166
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,360
it was just because you craved wealth and status,

167
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,120
wasn't it?

168
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,000
I've truly suffered for far too long.

169
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,879
It wasn't easy for me to get the identity of Yun Xiaoying,

170
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,079
so I could enter the palace as a consort,

171
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,040
and receive the emperor's favor.

172
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,600
Sister,

173
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,399
let's let it go.

174
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,000
Alright?

175
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,679
Sister,

176
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,679
let it go.

177
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,399
So,

178
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,799
she deserved to die.

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,639
Since she forgot her sisters,

180
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,399
she should join them.

181
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,480
I truly thank both of you as well

182
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,240
for helping me return my sisters' bodies

183
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,639
to their hometown for burial,

184
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,720
so their souls can rest in their homeland.

185
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,879
Your kindness is immeasurable.

186
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,320
Young Master Yan,

187
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,399
I used acupuncture to save you

188
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,960
out of genuine sincerity as well.

189
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,320
But your illness is already beyond cure,

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and no medicine can save you.

191
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,759
I know.

192
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,600
I schemed as much as I could.

193
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,480
Sooner or later, you would have found out.

194
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,000
Fortunately, what I needed to do is already done.

195
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,919
We just want the truth.

196
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,559
I'm willing to return to the capital with you and face justice.

197
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,440
So,

198
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,759
you really intend to surrender without resistance?

199
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,000
There's still one thing I don't understand.

200
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,559
What about the consort's body?

201
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,840
I sent her body back to her hometown as well.

202
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
She should return to her homeland, just like her sisters.

203
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,000
From now on, she will no longer be Yun Xiaoying.

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,559
Nor will she be the consort anymore.

205
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,799
She has her own name, too.

206
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,519
If Yun Qingxuan hadn't mentioned your illness,

207
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,440
how much longer did you plan to keep it from me?

208
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,679
It's not too late to know now.

209
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,679
Who told you to come back?

210
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,799
You already left.

211
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,759
Who told you to come back?

212
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,480
Guard Han Dao.

213
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,440
Why aren't you kneeling before the Imperial Consort?

214
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,519
Greetings, Your Highness.

216
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Who told you to come back?

217
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,759
Didn't I tell you to leave?

218
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,720
I already left, sister.

219
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,480
Why did you come back?

220
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,639
You've always been obedient since you were little.

221
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,200
Why aren't you listening this time?

222
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,399
Sister.

223
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,879
Didn't we agree?

224
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,799
The two of us,

225
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,320
share one life.

226
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,679
Your Highness.

227
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:14,919
Young Lady.

228
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,279
It seems you had planned this since the Imperial Consort's visit home.

229
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,039
On the very first night at Peach Blossom Manor.

230
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,960
You had it all planned out.

231
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,159
It started from the very first day we survived.

232
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,720
Gusu Liu Huier.

233
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,360
Guangxi He Yingzi.

234
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,000
Jinling Zhang Pan.

235
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,799
Hunan Su Jiuniang.

236
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,279
Four sisters.

237
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,559
We will remember your names.

238
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,600
We survived.

239
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,840
We live on for you.

240
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,080
But we will never forget your kindness.

241
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,799
We will wait for the right moment.

242
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,720
Once the time is right,

243
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,639
we will avenge you.

244
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,480
We will never regret it, even unto death.

245
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,080
Please wait for us.

246
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,480
I've come to see you.

247
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,639
You're here.

248
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,519
Sister.

249
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,360
The time has come.

250
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Let's begin.

251
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,600
He's here.

252
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,879
Xiaoying.

253
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,600
Brother.

254
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,759
I thought I'd never see you again in this life.

255
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,600
But here I am, back.

256
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,519
Yunyang.

257
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
Watch your status.

258
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm the imperial consort now.

259
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,919
What did you just call me?

260
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,240
What?

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,399
Now that you're the imperial consort,

262
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,879
does that mean I can't even touch you?

263
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,639
If you keep treating me like this,

264
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,840
I won't be so polite.

265
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,159
Sister.

266
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,000
We can start now.

267
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,320
To the four sisters,

268
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,840
we can finally avenge you.

269
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,039
Guards! Here!

270
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,919
I never should have come back.

271
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,360
Let me bear all of this alone.

272
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,639
This is for the best.

273
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,639
No!

274
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,320
Sister.

275
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,120
You are, in this world,

276
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,919
my only family left.

277
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,080
If I lose even you,

278
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,519
what meaning would my life have?

279
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,559
Silly.

280
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,720
Sister.

281
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,759
Maybe this is the best ending for us.

282
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,799
Lord Han Dao

283
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,640
Young Hero Yan

284
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,640
The two of us sisters

285
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
did not mean to involve you

286
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,160
Visiting our family was our only chance

287
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,759
We truly apologize

288
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,880
It seems the imperial consort has gone from victim to culprit

289
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,119
I’ll have to rewrite my case report again

290
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,960
My lord

291
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,039
My sister and I are willing to

292
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,920
return to the capital with you and face execution

293
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,279
But before we leave

294
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,559
I’d like to tidy up my sister’s appearance

295
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,440
Women care about their looks

296
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,279
I don’t want to see my sister like this

297
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,039
My lord

298
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,799
May I have the chance

299
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,680
Xuanwu, Baihu

300
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,000
Prepare things for them

301
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,559
Yes
