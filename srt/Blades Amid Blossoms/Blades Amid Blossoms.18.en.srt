1
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,920
Junior brother,

2
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,479
do you still remember?

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,240
This Seven-Star Medicine Cabinet,

4
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,159
Master told us about it before.

5
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,079
There are particular rules for arranging the medicine drawers.

6
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,240
Back then, I kept dozing off.

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,159
The Seven-Star Cabinet has seven rows of drawers, up, down, left, and right.

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,320
You should raise your hand to take, bow your head to pick.

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,920
With just half a step, you can see all the medicine boxes.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
The arrangement of medicines inside the Seven-Star Cabinet

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,400
is determined according to the cabinet chart.

12
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,519
Every doctor has different habits,

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,120
so the order of the medicines will also differ.

14
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:15,040
But commonly used medicines should be placed together.

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,239
That's right.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,120
Look here.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,280
Take this Four Gentlemen Decoction, for example.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,400
Atractylodes,

19
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,079
Codonopsis,

20
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,959
Licorice and Poria.

21
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,439
Logically, they should be stored together.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,359
This is unusual.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,439
Look at the second drawer.

24
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:30,879
Gastrodia,

25
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,040
Honey-fried Ephedra,

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,840
Ephedra Root,

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Why is there a Poria placed here?

28
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,319
Four Gentlemen Decoction.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
This isn't careful at all.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,439
This is...

31
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,159
The three thousand prescriptions Master compiled over his lifetime.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,719
Actually, Yun Su and Master were in love back then.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,120
It was all for these prescriptions.

34
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,800
Back then, Master spared no effort,

35
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,159
using Peach Blossom Powder to numb himself.

36
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,560
In the end, he lost control and went astray.

37
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,360
Senior brother,

38
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,919
I wrongly blamed you.

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,599
I hated the wrong person.

40
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,960
All these years, I suppose...

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
You must be in even more pain than I am.

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,639
If it were you,

43
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,479
what would you do?

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,319
I mean, on the day Master lost control.

45
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,960
If the sword were pointed at my chest,

46
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,759
what would you do?

47
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,639
I would do the same as you.

48
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,680
A sword is meant to protect the weak,

49
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,000
to punish evil and uphold good,

50
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,879
not to help the wicked do evil,

51
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,800
or to bully the weak with strength.

52
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,599
Since that's the case,

53
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,159
let's both let go.

54
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,000
Young Lady

55
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,240
Young Hero Yan

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,719
Lord Cold Blade

57
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,840
Young Lady

58
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,479
How did you get in here?

59
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,319
My father brought me here once.

60
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,879
These are all

61
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,599
prescriptions for curing illnesses, saving lives, and driving away plagues.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,599
Many of the famous medicines from Peach Blossom Manor

63
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,800
originated from here.

64
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,520
Back then, your father went to great lengths

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,919
to please my master.

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,319
All for these prescriptions.

67
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,079
Who would have thought

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,399
my master gave her true feelings

69
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,279
only to end up with a faithless lover.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,839
I never expected

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,920
that back then, my master locked herself in her room

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
and lost all appetite for food and drink,

73
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,959
all because of someone who betrayed her.

74
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,920
My father stole these prescriptions

75
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,879
but left behind only the Peach Blossom Powder.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,199
In the end, he died because of the Peach Blossom Powder.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,360
He died as a result of his own actions.

78
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,480
Yes.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,079
Back then, my master

80
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,720
in order to escape the Peach Blossom Powder she created,

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,120
ended up avenging her instead.

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,399
Everything in this world

83
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,399
is governed by fate and consequence.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,279
Young Lady

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
Why did you come here?

86
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,439
I wanted to see for myself

87
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,120
the Peach Blossom Powder that killed my sister,

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,199
my father,

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,879
and my eldest brother.

90
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,759
I want to know what it really is.

91
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,120
Alright.

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,879
Then let's look for it together.

93
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,879
I've checked on my end too.

94
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,959
Taohuasan definitely isn't here.

95
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,879
Could it be that Hongxiu is hiding something?

96
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's go back.

97
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,600
Young Lady

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,079
If Lord Handao agrees to close the case,

99
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,120
these bodies will be collected.

100
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,959
Otherwise, the corpses will start to decompose.

101
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,399
Handle these matters as you see fit.

102
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,279
Yes.

103
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,600
I'll go report to Lord Handao right away.

104
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,639
Old Hermit

105
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,560
Young Lady

106
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,079
Do you think Hongxiu got what she wished for?

107
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,600
The young mistress only wanted to marry the second young master.

108
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,399
Now the two of them have gone to the afterlife together.

109
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Though it was tragic,

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,279
it could be considered a kind of fulfillment.

111
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,959
In this world,

112
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,240
is there truly anything perfect?

113
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,120
Very few.

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
But not none.

115
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,120
Even a broken mirror can be made whole again.

116
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,759
It all depends on human effort.

117
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,959
I can't write the closing report.

118
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,920
I still can't figure out who killed the imperial consort.

119
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,079
If the consort really wasn't killed by Hongxiu,

120
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,319
then our deductions have to go back to the beginning.

121
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,360
Yunyang would have to be the culprit.

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,920
With Hongxiu dead,

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,480
who benefits the most?

124
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,319
Old Hermit

125
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,639
That's right.

126
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,800
The reason we were able

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,519
to find Hongxiu so smoothly this time

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,279
was not just because of the peach blossom powder in the red candle,

129
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,120
but also because of the Old Hermit's testimony.

130
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,959
The Old Hermit has always been outside the manor.

131
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,519
He helped Hongxiu manage her businesses.

132
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,720
Once Hongxiu died,

133
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,920
wouldn't all these businesses naturally belong to the Old Hermit?

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,199
If the Old Hermit could help Hongxiu manage her businesses,

135
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,120
couldn't he also help her kill someone?

136
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,519
Earlier, Hongxiu tried to bribe the Old Hermit.

137
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,439
But unexpectedly, the Old Hermit was one step ahead.

138
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,279
After Hongxiu's death, he shifted all the blame

139
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,120
entirely onto Hongxiu alone.

140
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,160
In this way,

141
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,399
he completely cleared himself of any involvement.

142
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,759
Didn't Uncle He also tell us before

143
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,839
that the Old Hermit and Hongxiu had a secret relationship?

144
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,240
If that's true,

145
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,879
then the Old Hermit is highly suspicious.

146
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,559
Senior Brother,

147
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,600
do you remember what was said when Yu Niang died?

148
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,799
"Seven years have passed,"

149
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,000
"the Peach Blossom Calamity arrives."

150
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,039
We still haven't figured out

151
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,879
what exactly this so-called Peach Blossom Calamity is.

152
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,799
Sir,

153
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,879
the Old Hermit requests an audience.

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,600
Sir

155
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,320
I am acting on the young lady's orders

156
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,080
and have come to report

157
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,720
If you have no objections to this case

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,240
I will order someone

159
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,600
to place the bodies from the ice cellar into coffins one by one

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,399
to prevent decomposition

161
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,879
I have already sent people to examine the bodies

162
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,600
There are no signs of decay

163
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,120
Besides, the case still needs to be investigated

164
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,919
There are still suspicious points

165
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,480
You had business dealings with Hongxiu

166
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
Now Hongxiu is dead

167
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,159
You are also a suspect

168
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,240
The question is whether you can withstand an investigation

169
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,279
Sir

170
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,480
I have told you everything I know

171
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,480
I have nothing to hide

172
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,240
Is that so?

173
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,399
The Peach Blossom Calamity seven years ago

174
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,039
What exactly was the Peach Blossom Calamity?

175
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,919
Now Yunyang, Yunsu, and the imperial consort are all dead

176
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,960
Do you want to see more people die because of the Peach Blossom Calamity?

177
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,759
What is the connection between Hongxiu and the Peach Blossom Calamity?

178
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,840
This Peach Blossom Calamity

179
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,559
was indeed a tragedy in the manor

180
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,039
Seven years ago, the old manor lord fell seriously ill

181
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,600
Many doctors were invited, but none could cure him

182
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,919
But the old manor lord refused to accept his fate

183
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,039
He said the Yun family had always enjoyed long lives

184
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
Even if they fell ill

185
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,120
there would still be a way to resolve it

186
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,399
So he invited a Taoist named Jia

187
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,360
Taoist Jia

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,720
What do you think?

189
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,720
Master, there is still a slim chance of survival to the northwest

190
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,000
Please take me there

191
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,039
Master, the life gate is right here.

192
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,559
I'd like to hear the details.

193
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,399
This method is dangerous.

194
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,399
I wonder if the master is willing to give it a try.

195
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,279
As long as I can open the life gate,

196
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,879
I'm willing to try anything.

197
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,440
The live sacrifice begins.

198
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,559
Master of the manor.

199
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,639
Heaven and Earth.

200
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,600
Today, the virtuous man Yun Su,

201
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,039
with his young son Yun Yang,

202
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,559
and Yun Ming,

203
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,799
stand before the Peach Blossom Pool,

204
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,360
arrange the Peach Blossom Formation,

205
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,679
and set up the Peach Blossom Altar.

206
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,000
This young woman

207
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,480
is offered as a live sacrifice to Heaven and Earth,

208
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,840
to help the virtuous Yun Su borrow life and gain longevity.

209
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
You two, go.

210
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,240
Ming'er.

211
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,159
You have been timid since childhood.

212
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,120
How can you be my son?

213
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,399
Go quickly.

214
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,879
Useless thing.

215
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Father, please calm your anger.

216
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,240
Let me do it instead.

217
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,480
Now that's my good son.

218
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,879
Heaven is watching.

219
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
In the name of Heaven,

220
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,720
I curse everyone in Peach Blossom Manor

221
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,919
who has participated in the altar ritual.

222
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,519
Seven years from now, on the day the peach blossoms bloom,

223
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,080
they will surely die from the Peach Blossom Calamity.

224
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,080
Fine.

225
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,279
I'll be waiting for you.

226
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,759
Whether the Peach Blossom Calamity came true that year

227
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,519
no one knows.

228
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,240
But the young mistress

229
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,279
must have used the rumors of the Peach Blossom Calamity

230
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,039
to plunge the manor into this panic.

231
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,960
She also attributed the deaths of the old and young manor lords

232
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,799
to the Peach Blossom Calamity.

233
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,720
You knew all this long ago.

234
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,759
Why are you only telling us now?

235
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,960
I did not experience this myself.

236
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,159
Besides, the Peach Blossom Calamity is a secret within the manor.

237
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,600
How could I dare to spread it around?

238
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,200
Now that both the old and young manor lords are dead,

239
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,519
and the young lady is a kind person,

240
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,480
I finally dared to speak of this.

241
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,799
As for your suspicions of me,

242
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,639
then please investigate thoroughly.

243
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,279
I am at your disposal.

244
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
After the case is closed,

245
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,039
I will naturally inform you to bury the deceased.

246
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,960
Thank you, sir.

247
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,519
Junior brother,

248
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
I'm going to check on something.

249
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,559
Wait for me.
