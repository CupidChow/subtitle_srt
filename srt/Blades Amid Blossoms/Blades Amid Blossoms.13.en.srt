1
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,880
Big Brother

2
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Younger Brother

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,240
From now on, Peach Blossom Manor

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,359
belongs to the two of us brothers.

5
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,040
Big Brother

6
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,840
There's something I've always wanted to ask you.

7
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:09,719
Go ahead.

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,760
You say, in a person's lifetime,

9
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,879
what is it that we truly seek?

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,400
Of course, it's to get what we desire.

11
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,239
I don't see it that way.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
To me, desire is just an illusion.

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,840
In this life,

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,280
shouldn't we just live happily and freely?

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,799
The world is so vast,

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,799
how could this tiny Peach Blossom Manor compare?

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,519
With no desires, there are no wants.

18
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,159
Without worries, there is nothing to fear.

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,719
Big Brother

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,280
I've suddenly realized

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,640
the things I feared are no longer scary.

22
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,439
Big Brother

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,719
Let me give you one more piece of advice.

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,560
Why must you spend your whole life

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,319
trapped in this tiny Peach Blossom Manor,

26
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,760
drawing boundaries as your own prison?

27
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,199
Father is dead.

28
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,520
You're safe now.

29
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,759
I'm afraid it's even more dangerous now.

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,159
As long as you behave,

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll keep you safe.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,879
And your occasional

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,080
little quirks.

34
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,280
You really are a good big brother.

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,479
In the past,

36
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,879
you were also a good son.

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,280
As long as it's for the Yun family,

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,680
making some sacrifices now and then

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,159
isn't a big deal.

40
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,199
But let me give you a piece of advice:

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,439
you'd better give up on the idea of escaping as soon as possible.

42
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,719
You and Yun Ming

43
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,639
will stay here forever and ever.

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,240
Stay by my side.

45
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,439
You think you can kill me?

46
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,319
You're not capable of that yet.

47
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,159
At least I tried.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,199
It was worth a try.

49
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,159
Sometimes,

50
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,319
I really admire your courage.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,479
And your persistence.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,360
But it's a pity—

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
it's all in vain.

54
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,000
Pick it up.

55
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
Wipe it here.

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,319
With one move, I could die right in front of you.

57
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,719
Pick it up.

58
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,360
I told you to pick it up.

59
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,960
Haven't you always wanted to escape from here?

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,039
And take Yun Ming with you?

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,279
I told you before,

62
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,680
even if you die,

63
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,240
you must die at Peach Blossom Manor.

64
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,199
I won't let you get your way.

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,879
A woman of mine, Yun Yang,

66
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,720
no matter what she's been through,

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,160
still possesses unmatched beauty.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,920
Just looking at her,

69
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,279
one can't help but feel protective.

70
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,319
Shiyi.

71
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,160
Shiyi.

72
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:18,959
Senior Brother.

73
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,199
What did you just call me?

74
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,560
It's nothing.

75
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,879
Look at your expression.

76
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,319
If someone didn't know,

77
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,759
they'd think I was about to die.

78
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,279
Shut up.

79
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,879
Drink your medicine.

80
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Your way of giving medicine is quite unique.

81
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,240
Finish it.

82
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,480
Junior brother, how do I remember

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,600
that after I drank the tea you gave me outside,

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,040
I passed out?

85
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,120
You didn't poison me, did you?

86
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:09,959
That's right.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
I was the one who poisoned you.

88
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,800
I should have taken the chance when you fainted

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
to kill you with one strike.

90
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,519
Then why didn't you do it?

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,720
Why did you carry me in here instead?

92
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,480
Did you feel sorry for me?

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,879
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

94
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,879
Can you tell me now

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,720
what's really going on with your illness?

96
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,639
Don't bring it up.

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
Let's just leave it to fate.

98
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,720
Right now, Yun Yang is making trouble for us.

99
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,560
If we don't find out the truth soon,

100
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,040
both you and I will be finished.

101
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,360
Unfortunately, all we have are guesses.

102
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,319
To me, Peach Blossom Manor is like a thick fog.

103
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,839
Everyone seems like a suspect.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,439
Sir.

105
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,439
The person has been brought.

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,839
Lord Han.

107
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,639
Is this how you invite me here?

108
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,279
Yun Su

109
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,279
Did you kill him?

110
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,959
Sir, I wouldn't dare say such things carelessly.

111
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,160
Solving a case isn't just about that.

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
You need evidence, too.

113
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,879
Th-this, this...

114
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,959
All these people who died at the manor,

115
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,600
they're clearly victims of the Peach Blossom Calamity.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
Right now, we should unite inside and out.

117
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,319
Stand together against outsiders.

118
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,839
Only then can we find the real culprit behind

119
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,560
the Peach Blossom Calamity.

120
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,800
The culprit?

121
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,759
You look like the culprit to me.

122
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:45,800
Speak.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,319
The night Yun Su was killed,

124
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,800
where exactly were you?

125
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,040
What were you doing?

126
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,319
Sir, you...

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I've got it, I've got it!

128
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,399
Take a look.

129
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
The account book.

130
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,959
It records in detail

131
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,160
the properties Old Gu owns in the capital with the Young Madam.

132
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,839
Old Gu and the Young Madam are having an affair!

133
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,639
The night our master was killed,

134
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,399
the Young Madam tried to run away.

135
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,720
Old Gu stopped her.

136
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,360
It looked like they ran into me by chance,

137
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,240
but actually, they had planned it together all along.

138
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,039
Are you ready?

139
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm ready.

140
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
Tonight will decide life or death, success or failure.

141
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,679
I'm looking forward to it.

142
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,519
We'll meet in the capital.

143
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,039
We will.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
The alchemy room is just ahead.

145
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,919
You must protect yourself.

146
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,720
Don't worry.

147
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,080
I've been waiting for this day.

148
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,080
Young Madam

149
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,679
Today is your big day.

150
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
Please, go ahead.

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,000
Uncle He

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,080
You startled me.

153
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,679
Why are you here?

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,480
The Master doesn't allow anyone to enter.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,840
How about we play a game of chess?

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,600
Sure.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,480
Please.

158
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,480
Please.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,720
In your opinion,

160
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,600
this game tonight,

161
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,000
how do you think it will end?

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,720
The outcome is still uncertain.

163
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
Everyone is eager to make a move.

164
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,519
Eager to act.

165
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,879
So you're saying

166
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,360
the old man drugged you,

167
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,240
and then entered the alchemy room?

168
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,799
Lord Han

169
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,600
How wise.

170
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,360
So,

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
among those who entered the alchemy room that day,

172
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,080
the old man was one of them.

173
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,320
I think this matter

174
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,759
should be like this.

175
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,919
I have business with the Master.

176
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,159
It's fine if I don't see him.

177
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,639
Abandon the physical body

178
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,279
Ascend to immortality

179
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,600
Fell asleep

180
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,320
How long have I been sleeping here?

181
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,559
Just dozed off for a bit

182
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,480
Come

183
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,320
Let's continue the game

184
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,960
Come on, come on

185
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,879
You mean

186
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,960
That day, the old man drugged you

187
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,240
And created an alibi

188
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,159
Lord Han

189
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
You are indeed wise

190
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,039
So

191
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,559
The person brought here

192
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,440
Should be the old man

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,039
It shouldn't be me

194
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,960
I'm not the culprit yet, am I?

195
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,879
At least a suspect

196
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,600
Whether or not you're a suspect

197
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,799
It's too early to make that conclusion, my lord

198
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,240
In your opinion, in this world

199
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,159
What kind of hatred counts as a deep-seated vendetta?

200
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,200
Killing one's parents

201
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,799
Violating someone's wife or daughter

202
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,320
That's right

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
But there's another kind of deep hatred in this world

204
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,799
It's turning someone into neither human nor ghost

205
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,840
When I heard something happened to your family

206
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,480
I immediately sent someone to look for you

207
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,480
From now on

208
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,759
Consider Peach Blossom Manor your home

209
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,080
You are very much like your father

210
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,000
Too much alike

211
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,879
But this resemblance

212
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,480
Will only bring you harm

213
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,279
Now you are the child of a criminal

214
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,679
Staying at Peach Blossom Manor

215
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,120
You need a new identity

216
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,879
To avoid suspicion

217
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,240
It is precisely because people have desires

218
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,519
that they become worldly.

219
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,799
If you want to transcend the ordinary,

220
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,000
you must be free of desire.

221
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,600
No, no.

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,200
No, no.

223
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
Actually, on the night the master had his accident,

224
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,240
the person who truly disappeared

225
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,720
was Uncle He.

226
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,919
Did I fall asleep?

227
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,480
How long was I asleep?

228
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,879
Just a little while.

229
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,559
Alright.

230
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,279
It's your turn, right?

231
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,039
Uncle He was grateful to the master for saving his life,

232
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,919
but also resented him for making him a eunuch.

233
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,600
So he had both the opportunity and the motive.

234
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,960
The person you really need to investigate is Uncle He.

235
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,360
Sir.

236
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,240
May I leave now?

237
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,080
Go ahead.

238
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,039
Sir.

239
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,519
Someone just delivered this.

240
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,480
You are respectfully invited for a meeting.

241
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Why is the young lady looking for me in the middle of the night?

242
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,799
I want to take you to see someone's true face.

243
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,440
Who?

244
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,919
If I told you some things directly,

245
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,639
not only would you not believe me,

246
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,720
you would even suspect me.

247
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,639
Only if you see it with your own eyes

248
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,679
can you truly see what someone is really like.

249
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,639
Or rather, their true heart.

250
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,119
Young Master

251
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,480
We agreed on this

252
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,839
You would give me my medicine on time

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,720
Young Master

254
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,480
I'm begging you

255
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,119
Did you take care of what I asked you to do?

256
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:35,680
It's done

257
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,640
Please, I'm begging you

258
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,799
Everything is done
