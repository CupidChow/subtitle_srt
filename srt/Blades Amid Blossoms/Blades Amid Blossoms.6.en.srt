1
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,359
Back then, I wanted you to stay at Peach Blossom Manor.

2
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,359
But you just wouldn't listen.

3
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,280
I told you,

4
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,560
I'm the only one in this world who truly cares about you.

5
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,480
You never should have left me.

6
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,719
Staying at Peach Blossom Manor

7
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,879
is it better than the palace?

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,719
What's wrong with Peach Blossom Manor?

9
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,439
To you,

10
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,760
Peach Blossom Manor is your whole world.

11
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,359
But for us women,

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,519
it's a cage.

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,640
Look at her.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,400
She left Peach Blossom Manor,

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,359
but then what happened?

16
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,239
She died.

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,439
Lying alone in this cold, lonely place.

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
In a few days,

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,239
her body will start to rot.

20
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:47,920
She left,

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,000
but what difference did it make?

22
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,879
You can't escape this fate either.

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,239
But I do have something

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,280
that can let you leave Peach Blossom Manor for a while.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,000
It'll let you go wherever you want.

26
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,039
It'll make you feel like you're floating on air.

27
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,080
What did you give me to eat?

28
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,400
What do you think?

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,280
You said Yunyang gave Hongxiu

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,759
what kind of medicine exactly?

31
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,439
It should be something like Hehuan Powder.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
This is the medicine bottle I found at the scene.

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,719
It's Hehuan Powder.

34
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,639
I couldn't believe my own eyes.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,280
The two of them, right in front of the imperial consort's body...

36
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,840
Why would Yunyang do this?

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,479
I can't figure it out either.

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,080
Before he went in, I repeatedly warned him

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,080
and told him not to touch the imperial consort's body.

40
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,479
He didn't touch it,

41
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,280
but his emotions

42
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,560
seemed like he was deeply shocked.

43
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,560
He was very upset.

44
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,319
Upset.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,360
Yunyang's reaction is a bit strange.

46
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,599
Second Young Master,

47
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,639
are you alright?

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,039
Look.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,199
Big Brother, Young Master.

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,360
The Master means

51
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,479
that the Second Young Master should be given

52
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,759
some blood-replenishing medicine in time.

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,280
Here.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,599
Let me carry him.

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,639
Let me do it.

56
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,360
Big Brother

57
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,400
You're awake.

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,439
Where am I?

59
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,079
You fainted yesterday.

60
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,319
I brought you back.

61
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you, Big Brother.

62
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,079
There's no need for that between us.

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,279
Have you been taking your medicine on time lately?

64
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,120
Taking medicine or not

65
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,399
is the same to me.

66
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,720
If you don't take your medicine on time,

67
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,199
I'm afraid your body won't be able to handle it.

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,240
I know.

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,160
Father's life is tied to ours.

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,199
Father?

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,879
When has he ever treated us as his sons?

72
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,600
Since we were young, he's treated us like livestock.

73
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
Raising us with the whip.

74
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,560
When we grew up, he used us as his medicine jars.

75
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,079
Now we've finally got a chance.

76
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Xiaoying's death

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,120
left Father without protection.

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,480
We have nothing to worry about anymore.

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,279
But he...

80
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,839
After all, he raised us as our father.

81
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,720
But what if he's not our real father?

82
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,360
Big Brother, what are you saying?

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,600
Do I need to remind you how he treated us?

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,399
Do I need to say it again?

85
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:30,959
Big Brother...

86
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,680
What are you planning to do?

87
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,680
You don't think I want to kill Father, do you?

88
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,560
I don't know.

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,199
Between Father and me, you can only choose one.

90
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,680
Who will you choose?

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,600
Of course, it's you, Big Brother.

92
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,680
Big Brother...

93
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,879
Did Xiaoying really die because of the Peach Blossom Calamity?

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,399
The dead are already gone.

95
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,480
Those who are alive should live well.

96
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,319
Don't you agree?

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,040
Get some rest.

98
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,199
Didn't I already say that?

99
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,680
Don't follow me.

100
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,160
If you take one more step after me,

101
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,800
you'll be punished with thirty strokes.

102
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,319
Sister-in-law.

103
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,720
You know as well.

104
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,519
It's wrong for my brother to treat you like this.

105
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,279
You can't resist him.

106
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,519
But you shouldn't join him either.

107
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,639
And become someone as violent as he is.

108
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,000
You're not like that.

109
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,079
Then what should I do?

110
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,720
Leave this place.

111
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,199
That's impossible.

112
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,199
No woman

113
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,399
can openly leave Peach Blossom Manor.

114
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,600
Then run away.

115
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,279
Why force yourself to become like him?

116
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,879
Young Master Yan, may I have a word with you?

117
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,360
Lead the way.

118
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
Please.

119
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,199
Today,

120
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,920
the Master asked me to get some medicine for you, Young Master Yan.

121
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,000
As for me,

122
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,360
I came along to do a small favor.

123
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,680
A favor?

124
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,319
Let me hear it.

125
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,440
Ever since the Imperial Consort entered the palace,

126
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,639
our Master has had to bow to her.

127
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,480
The Imperial Consort was always a kind and charitable person.

128
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,799
Everyone in the manor liked her very much.

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,399
Except for one person.

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Who?

131
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,559
Hongxiu.

132
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,279
After the Imperial Consort was killed,

133
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,679
our Master

134
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,840
could hardly escape blame.

135
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,720
Hongxiu's husband,

136
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,840
who is also our Young Master Yunyang,

137
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,960
naturally took over the manor.

138
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,639
So Hongxiu became

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,039
the highest-ranking woman in our manor.

140
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,639
Just based on this alone,

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,039
to assume Hongxiu is the murderer

142
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,519
would be too hasty.

143
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,159
Of course, that's not enough.

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,679
On the day the Imperial Consort was killed,

145
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,919
my informant told me

146
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,120
that Hongxiu met with the Imperial Consort.

147
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,440
I finally waited for you to come back.

148
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,519
He still treats you like this.

149
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,000
You promised me.

150
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
That you would take me to the capital.

151
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,919
I've been waiting for you all this time.

152
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,960
Why did you lie to me?

153
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,720
I've been living deep within the palace.

154
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,879
I haven't received the emperor's favor.

155
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
There's really nothing I can do to help you.

156
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,120
I was afraid you had forgotten me.

157
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,039
You've gotten used to wealth and luxury.

158
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,600
How could you still remember our promise?

159
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,519
Don't worry.

160
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,399
I remember all the promises between us.

161
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,879
Now that I'm back this time,

162
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
I will definitely beg my father and elder brother

163
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,039
to let them take you away from the manor.

164
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,240
If they let me leave,

165
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,799
If they had let me leave,

166
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,960
would I still be waiting until now?

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,240
You remember this.

168
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,799
You owe me.

169
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,879
I never had much to begin with.

170
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,320
I won't let anyone owe me again.

171
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,240
The consort's movements

172
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,240
must be reported to me promptly.

173
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,840
Yes.

174
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,080
Go.

175
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,039
According to what you said,

176
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,919
this Yuniang is your person?

177
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,919
Her death has nothing to do with me.

178
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,919
So you're saying Hongxiu was jealous of the consort

179
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,159
and developed murderous intent?

180
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,639
Young hero,

181
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,279
you must not forget

182
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,799
the scratch marks on Yunyang's back.

183
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,759
Those were most likely left by Hongxiu on purpose.

184
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,759
As for her,

185
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,559
she's wanted to leave here for a long time.

186
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,519
Then let me ask you,

187
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
in this Peach Blossom Manor,

188
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,559
who else is working for you?

189
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,879
You can ask me,

190
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,279
but as for me,

191
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,679
I may choose not to answer.

192
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,320
I just want to remind you, young hero,

193
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,240
when you and Lord Han Dao were discussing the scratch marks,

194
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,759
did you not consider that walls have ears?

195
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,000
So, walls have ears, huh?

196
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,320
Then is it reasonable for me to suspect

197
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
that you are the one who killed the imperial consort?

198
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,240
You must be joking.

199
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,399
If I had killed the imperial consort,

200
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,399
it would bring me no benefit at all.

201
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,519
If there's no gain in it,

202
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,080
I, He Bo, would never do it.

203
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,879
Then let me ask out of pure curiosity,

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,679
whose side are you on?

205
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,879
I can be on anyone's side,

206
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,399
or I can just be myself.

207
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,159
Young hero,

208
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,039
I invited you here today

209
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,759
because I wanted to make a good friend.

210
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,679
Since we're friends,

211
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,000
I can't let you leave empty-handed.

212
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,879
Alright.

213
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,519
Then let me give you another charm for your safety.

214
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
Let's hear it.

215
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,639
Before you entered the manor master's room,

216
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,240
you had a tail following you.

217
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,519
That junior of yours

218
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,639
doesn't trust you that much.

219
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,159
It's late.

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,720
I'll take my leave.

221
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,559
Lord Han Dao

222
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,759
My lord, what brings you here so late at night?

223
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,279
It's about the death of the imperial consort.

224
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,759
I still have a few doubts.

225
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,840
I'd like to ask you, Miss.

226
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
Please have a seat, my lord.

227
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,000
Miss

228
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,559
How long has Yan Shiyi been at Peach Blossom Manor?

229
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,440
Young Hero Yan

230
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,840
He has been here for several months.

231
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,200
He was ill when he arrived.

232
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,159
He was on the verge of death.

233
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,440
My father personally prescribed medicine for him.

234
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,120
That's how he gradually recovered.

235
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,679
So, in that case,

236
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,039
Yan Shiyi must be quite close to the manor master.

237
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,519
All I know is

238
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,759
my father greatly admires Young Hero Yan's swordsmanship.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
And Young Hero Yan's illness

240
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,279
also requires my father's prescriptions.

241
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,600
My lord, why not ask Young Hero Yan these questions directly?

242
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,080
Strictly speaking,

243
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,799
Yan Shiyi is also a key suspect at the moment.

244
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,080
So,

245
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,480
you don't fully trust Yan Shiyi either.

246
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,840
Of course.

247
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,600
Until the case is fully investigated,

248
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,799
everyone in Peach Blossom Manor is a suspect.

249
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,799
That includes you, Miss.
