1
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,560
The imperial consort was killed while visiting her family.

2
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,719
The body must be escorted to the capital.

3
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
The other bodies are to be buried on the spot.

4
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,479
Upon investigation,

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,920
the murderer was identified as the steward of Peach Blossom Manor.

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,280
He was Gu Hongyi, who used the alias "Old Hermit."

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,719
Gu Hongyi was originally a teacher at Peach Blossom Manor.

8
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,719
He secretly developed feelings for his adopted daughter, Yun Qingxuan.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,359
He was harmed by the manor lord Yun Su and the young master Yun Yang.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,560
Gu Hongyi survived by chance.

11
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,879
He hid in Peach Blossom Manor under the name "Old Hermit."

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,239
He conspired with the young lady, Hong Xiu.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,760
They used the poison "Peach Blossom Powder" to harm many people.

14
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,079
During this time,

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,959
the culprit Hong Xiu died for love.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,159
Gu Hongyi took poison and committed suicide.

17
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,879
It was also discovered

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,560
that Yun Su and his sons, Yun Yang and Yun Ming,

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
in pursuit of immortality,

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,920
harmed many innocent lives.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,040
They drowned innocent women in the pond.

22
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,200
and buried their bones there.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,840
After verifying the number and identities,

24
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,840
their places of origin were traced.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,319
They were sent back to their hometowns for burial.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,920
Come, come, come.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,400
Turn this a bit forward.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,959
Yes.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,120
That's right, that's right.

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,000
Turn it more, turn it more.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
A bit more.

32
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,560
Alright, alright.

33
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,239
I didn't expect this.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,159
Peach Blossom Manor is almost wiped out.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,520
From now on,

36
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,439
the name Peach Blossom Manor will no longer exist in this world.

37
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,439
You two don't need to be so sentimental.

38
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,240
Peach Blossom Manor never truly had a lineage.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,879
Now that it's disbanded, it's actually a good thing.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,840
No lineage.

41
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,680
The master always claimed to outsiders

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
that he had four children.

43
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,759
But none of them were his own.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,039
So it's true.

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
If they were truly his own,

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,039
how could he bear to swap their blood and elixirs?

47
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,039
Yun Yang probably knew this all along.

48
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,599
Otherwise, he wouldn't have poisoned Yun Su.

49
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,159
After the master died,

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,599
all of us actually felt much more at ease.

51
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,479
Uncle He,

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,759
what do you plan to do next?

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Let Peach Blossom Manor

54
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,919
disappear from this world.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,560
Farewell.

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,960
Farewell.

57
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,960
Set out for the capital.

58
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,560
Junior brother

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,840
I feel like you still don't completely trust me

60
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,560
Ever since we were young

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,759
You always have your own reasons for what you do

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,759
But you still owe me an explanation

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,159
Nonsense

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,879
Back then, you actually

65
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,560
stabbed me in the left side of my chest

66
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,000
Besides

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
It's not like you don't know

68
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,560
I hate being wrongly accused the most

69
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,240
Now I'm giving you a chance to explain

70
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,079
Go ahead, explain

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,639
At that time

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
Master was in seclusion for three whole days

73
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,040
He didn't leave his room at all

74
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,079
And you happened to have a fever

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,720
So I had to go up the mountain to gather herbs myself

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,079
When I came back

77
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,399
Junior brother

78
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,120
Yunlang

79
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,920
Why did you lie to me

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,439
If we can't share the same bed in life

81
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,480
Then let's share the same grave in death

82
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,800
Master

83
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,160
Master

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,600
Wake up

85
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,480
He's Handao

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,079
Did you hear me

87
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,079
He's Handao

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,120
Shiyi

89
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,519
Master

90
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,720
It's Master who has wronged you

91
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,839
Master

92
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,399
Master

93
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,759
You really are Master's good disciple

94
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,079
Master

95
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,240
Master

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,839
Yan Shiyi

97
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,279
You killed Master.

98
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,040
It wasn't me.

99
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,560
Why did Master lose control and go astray back then?

100
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,800
All these years,

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have been searching

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,720
for the reason why Master lost control.

103
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,879
As for me,

104
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,319
I found a medicine in Master's room.

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,519
But I had never seen it before.

106
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,800
After sneaking into Peach Blossom Manor,

107
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,839
I found in Yun Su's room

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,839
the same medicine.

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,720
So I started investigating.

110
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,160
I discovered that this medicine

111
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,079
is a kind of slow-acting poison.

112
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,800
So I concluded

113
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,959
that after Yun Su met Master,

114
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,720
he kept poisoning her.

115
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,920
That old scoundrel Yun Su

116
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,639
did all this just to get Master's three thousand prescriptions.

117
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,160
He would stoop to such despicable means.

118
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,480
Poor Master is still trapped in the past.

119
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,279
She has been taking Peach Blossom Powder for a long time.

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,720
Yes.

121
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,959
This Peach Blossom Powder is indeed very potent.

122
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,639
Luckily, I didn't use much of it.

123
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,480
Otherwise,

124
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,759
I would have been addicted and unable to escape.

125
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,879
Master's family has practiced medicine for three generations.

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,800
She has saved countless lives in her lifetime.

127
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,279
The original purpose of making Peach Blossom Powder

128
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,319
was never to harm anyone.

129
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,600
Do you remember

130
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
when we made a mistake with one of the ingredients

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,079
and Master punished us severely?

132
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,399
I remember.

133
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,240
Of course I remember.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,720
We were beaten so badly that day.

135
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,839
In that medicine,

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,079
we added extra licorice, right?

137
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,759
We said it would help the patient recover faster.

138
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,879
Master often says

139
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,199
Doctors must have a sense of reverence for medicine.

140
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,600
Reverence.

141
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
But in the formula for Peach Blossom Powder,

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,279
there is no reverence at all.

143
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,399
The rules Master taught us about using medicine

144
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,600
what were they again?

145
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,639
Principal, minister, assistant, and envoy herbs.

146
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
The principal herb is the leader among all.

147
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,039
The minister, assistant, and envoy herbs support it.

148
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,240
The principal herb in Peach Blossom Powder

149
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
if it can cause hallucinations,

150
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,519
then its minister and assistant herbs

151
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,720
and envoy herbs should definitely neutralize its effects.

152
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,840
There should never be

153
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,799
such harmful and dangerous ingredients.

154
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,679
Peach Blossom Powder causes severe hallucinations.

155
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,679
It can even be fatal.

156
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,720
It definitely wasn't made by Master.

157
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,120
The Peach Blossom Powder in Peach Blossom Manor

158
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,440
must have been tampered with.

159
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,120
Maybe we've been misled.

160
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,639
Yun Yang shouldn't be skilled with medicine.

161
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,759
Yun Qingxuan.

162
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,200
Open the coffin.

163
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,279
Why is it Hong Xiu?

164
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,799
Where is the imperial consort's body?

165
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,960
Yun Qingxuan is still alive.

166
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's go.

167
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,679
Go back.

168
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
Move faster, all of you.

169
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,200
No one move! The corpse is already rotting.

170
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,840
Lord Han Dao.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
Why have you returned?

172
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,679
Xuanwu, Baihu.

173
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,440
Here.

174
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,799
Open the coffin and examine the body immediately.

175
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,399
Yes.

176
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,320
All of you, go after them!

177
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,519
Yes, pursue them!

178
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,960
I think this is the character "Li".

179
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,440
The character "Li" represents fire.

180
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
It means the south.

181
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,080
Don't move.

182
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,279
If you want to live,

183
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,399
keep moving forward.

184
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,480
Sir.

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,399
We didn't find it.

186
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,799
Keep searching.

187
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,039
Follow me.

188
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,720
Miss.

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,720
Stop pretending to be mysterious with me.

190
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,480
In your last dozen or so hours,

191
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,879
don't you want to spend them peacefully

192
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,360
with your junior disciple?

193
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,120
Of course I do.

194
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,240
But only after the truth comes out.

195
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,000
Is the so-called truth really that important?

196
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
The matters of this world

197
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,600
can't be explained by just calling them true or false.

198
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,519
But only those who do evil fear the truth.

199
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,440
You, someone about to die,

200
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,639
should think carefully about

201
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,759
what you most want to do before you die.

202
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,320
Yun Qingxuan.

203
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Then let me ask you,

204
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,600
what are you really doing all this for?

205
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,679
How did you know I wasn't dead?

206
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,960
The formula for Peach Blossom Powder was tampered with.

207
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,559
The old man took all the blame for someone else.

208
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,639
But it was Hongxiu lying in the imperial consort's coffin.

209
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,720
That only proves the real culprit is someone else.

210
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
How can you be sure it was me?

211
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,039
Because you, Miss, are skilled in medicine.

212
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,720
Miss.

213
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,639
The old man has always felt indebted to you.

214
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,200
If anyone wanted to avenge Hongxiu,

215
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,879
it could only be you.

216
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,519
Junior disciple.

217
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,480
You didn't lose a single one of the coins I dropped, did you?

218
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,440
Confiscated.

219
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,919
You two really are in sync.

220
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,799
Miss.

221
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,360
You can tell the truth now, can't you?

222
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,360
The old man always said

223
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,200
he owed me a life.

224
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:54,840
Qingxuan.

225
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,720
Back then, I let you down.

226
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,159
The reason I struggled to return to Peach Blossom Manor

227
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,200
was just to see you one more time.

228
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,879
You've already done enough for me.

229
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,759
The grievances between us

230
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,320
were settled long ago.

231
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,120
I was the one who broke my promise.

232
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,919
I owe you for a lifetime.

233
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,639
I've already done everything I wanted to do.

234
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,720
Even with all our precautions, we made a mistake.

235
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,960
Someone has to take responsibility for all this.

236
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,720
Let me take it.

237
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,039
No need.

238
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,519
You've done enough too.

239
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,159
Your mission is complete as well.

240
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,000
You...

241
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,879
Come.

242
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:43,960
Eat this.

243
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,559
This is Yangzu Powder.

244
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,960
After six hours of tortoise breathing,

245
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,440
you will wake up on your own.

246
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,200
When Handao and Yan Shiyi see you dead,

247
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,639
they will trace it back to me.

248
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,519
I will take responsibility for all of this.

249
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Rotten grass turns into mud,

250
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
and rises again as fireflies.

251
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,440
Even rotten grass makes its final contribution.

252
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,000
If you see fireflies flying by in the future,

253
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,960
it means I’ve come to see you.

254
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,840
Peach Blossom Powder.

255
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,799
You modified my master’s prescription

256
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,039
to create it.

257
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,840
Mossy branches adorned with jade,

258
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,159
plants and trees possess spiritual power.

259
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,000
Linjiangxian has long been known as the Medicine Immortal.

260
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,519
Peach Blossom Powder is an even more brilliant creation.

261
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,159
With a little modification,

262
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,480
it gains extraordinary power.

263
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,679
It’s perfect for punishing evil and promoting good.

264
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:55,600
I think

265
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,080
this is something Linjiangxian would be happy to see.

266
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
What are you talking about?

267
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,120
My master has always healed and saved people.

268
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,600
How could she want to see her own prescription

269
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
used to kill and harm others?

270
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,080
Linjiangxian has a compassionate heart,

271
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,559
but lacks a firm hand.

272
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,559
What about the empress?

273
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,279
I killed her.
