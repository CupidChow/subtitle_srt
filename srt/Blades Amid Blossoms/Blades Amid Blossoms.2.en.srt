1
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,359
Sir

2
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,000
I heard you detained my guest.

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,280
You must be referring to the suspect.

4
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,359
If this person is truly the one who killed my daughter,

5
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,000
I will tear him to pieces.

6
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,359
My poor child...

7
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:02,920
Master

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,519
The imperial consort was killed here at Peach Blossom Manor.

9
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,480
Besides the suspect we've already caught,

10
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
do you suspect anyone else, Master?

11
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,919
Sir

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,919
What do you mean by that?

13
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,199
Everyone at Peach Blossom Manor is family to the consort.

14
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
Even the servants

15
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,960
many of them watched her grow up.

16
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,479
How could they possibly harm her?

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm just asking.

18
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,080
Sir

19
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,280
Let me give you a kind reminder.

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,560
Don't become paranoid just to shirk responsibility.

21
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,080
And don't frame the loyal and good.

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
In seven days,

23
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,520
the consort is scheduled to return.

24
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,400
You have only seven days to find the real culprit.

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,479
Maybe I won't need all seven days.

26
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,000
Kneel!

27
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:04,879
Sir

28
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,439
Bring in the suspect, Yan Shiyi.

29
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,439
Yuniang

30
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,800
Step forward and identify him.

31
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,680
Was he the one who appeared in the bamboo forest last night?

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,520
Who are you?

33
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:40,919
Come

34
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,800
Have a drink.

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,919
I won't drink.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,080
I'll drink by myself.

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,919
You filthy drunk.

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,000
It's him.

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,719
That's the one.

40
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,439
Get down there.

41
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,560
Come with me.

42
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,960
Why did you show up at Peach Blossom Manor?

43
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,879
Master Yun especially admires

44
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,399
the swordsmanship of our Qingshan Sect.

45
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,680
He specifically asked me to accompany the young master for sword practice.

46
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,040
Then why were you in the bamboo forest last night?

47
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,279
I drank too much.

48
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,160
When I drink too much, I just wander around.

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,519
Who knows where I ended up?

50
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,120
Why did you want to kill the imperial consort?

51
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,120
The imperial consort?

52
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,759
Shouldn't the imperial consort be in the palace?

53
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,680
Why would I kill her?

54
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,439
Junior brother.

55
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,879
Shouldn't you be in the palace too?

56
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,040
It's been three years since we last met.

57
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,759
I hope you've been well.

58
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,319
It's been years since we last saw each other.

59
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,600
You've gotten weaker.

60
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,360
It's been years since we last met.

61
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,759
You've gained weight, junior brother.

62
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Stop calling me junior brother.

63
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,560
You and I are enemies now.

64
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,360
When enemies meet, their eyes burn with hatred.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,319
But your eyes aren't red at all.

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Your face is pretty red though.

67
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,920
I've been looking for you for three years.

68
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,000
I never thought you'd be hiding here.

69
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,040
Looking?

70
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,439
You've been hunting me for three years.

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,680
But I don't blame you.

72
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,000
After all, I'm someone who betrayed my master and ancestors,

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,439
a jerk that everyone in the martial world wants to kill.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,560
But I came to Peach Blossom Manor

75
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,000
just to find some peace—is that too much to ask?

76
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
Hero Yan has always used a sword to kill.

77
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,920
A Qingshan sword.

78
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,079
Phoenix Three Nods technique.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,240
There were no external wounds on the imperial consort.

80
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,800
So you didn't kill the imperial consort.

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,319
Junior disciple

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,639
You know me so well

83
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,480
I believe you

84
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,040
But others may not believe it

85
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,720
That's true

86
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,600
How about this instead

87
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,800
You can frame me as the murderer

88
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,279
That way

89
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,600
You can execute me on the spot

90
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,000
And you can report back

91
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,519
Wouldn't that make everyone happy

92
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,720
You think I wouldn't dare

93
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,600
I've dreamed of dying by your blade

94
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,079
Go ahead

95
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,360
Let's see if my neck is tougher

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,319
Or your blade is sharper

97
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,560
I have countless reasons to kill you

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,160
But I won't wrong you

99
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,560
Haven't you ever wronged me

100
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,639
Your Highness

101
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,800
Go ahead

102
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,079
I'll wait for you by the peach blossom tree

103
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,879
Sir

104
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,439
Bring the note here

105
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
The killer left a note after the murder

106
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,439
That's so brazen

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,000
The killer left a note after killing

108
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,360
It's obvious they're trying to mislead us

109
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,480
Someone deliberately strangled Yu Niang

110
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,279
Then hung the body on this tree

111
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
And even left a note on purpose

112
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,360
Yu Niang hanged herself

113
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,879
Hanged herself

114
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,000
How can you tell

115
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,399
Yu Niang took care of the consort's daily life

116
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,440
She knew how to tie knots

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,639
The knot on this rope and the one on her belt

118
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,679
Are the same as the one on her sachet

119
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,360
It should be her usual style

120
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,559
A person's hands have memory.

121
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,399
That's right.

122
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,120
If someone had hanged her,

123
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,080
there would be no need to tie such a knot.

124
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,080
And here,

125
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,440
there's mud on Yuniang's shoe soles.

126
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,799
She must have walked on a muddy path before she died.

127
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,440
And here,

128
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,440
there are women's shoe prints on the railing.

129
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,679
Yuniang probably climbed onto the railing herself before she died.

130
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,480
Then she put her head into the red silk.

131
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,039
And with a swing,

132
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,399
she hanged herself.

133
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,679
But there's still something I don't understand.

134
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,879
If Yuniang hanged herself,

135
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,799
why was this note left behind?

136
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,759
Someone else must have left the note after Yuniang died.

137
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,200
It was someone from Peach Blossom Manor.

138
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,159
Sir

139
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,600
Miss Yun Qingxuan of Peach Blossom Manor

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,919
wants to examine the imperial consort's body

141
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:42,919
but we stopped her

142
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,440
However

143
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
she said she knows the art of autopsy

144
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,759
and wants to help investigate the case

145
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,879
Could this be a trick?

146
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,440
This place is shrouded in mist

147
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,080
Since we can't see clearly from the outside

148
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,679
why not borrow another pair of eyes

149
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,559
You two, secure the body

150
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,639
Stay alert

151
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,919
This place is extremely dangerous

152
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,639
The killer left the message "Seven years have passed"

153
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,639
"The Peach Blossom Calamity arrives"

154
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,039
I'm afraid it's meant for us to hear

155
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,919
Yes

156
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,399
I've heard that Miss is well-versed in autopsy

157
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,200
May I trouble you, Miss

158
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,919
to help examine the imperial consort's body

159
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,320
Her Highness holds a noble status

160
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,720
We dared not be too presumptuous during the autopsy

161
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,200
The water in Peach Blossom Pool is murky

162
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,320
with tangled algae and weeds

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,399
If Xiaoying drowned

164
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,960
there would surely be some

165
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,919
algae residue in her mouth and nose

166
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,440
But there are no impurities in her mouth or nose

167
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,039
If she drowned

168
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,480
her arms would show the washerwoman's sign

169
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,799
with pale skin

170
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,639
wrinkled and swollen

171
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,960
But the imperial consort's arms are smooth

172
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,879
which also proves she did not drown

173
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,799
Sir, you are indeed knowledgeable in this field

174
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,960
Sir

175
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,840
Look here

176
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,960
Skin fragments

177
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,720
Miss, you truly have a keen eye

178
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,320
Sir, you had already discovered it.

179
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,159
A corpse can speak.

180
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,399
So when Xiao Ying was murdered,

181
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,840
she scratched the killer.

182
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,639
The scratch naturally hasn't healed yet.

183
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,559
By the Emperor's gracious command,

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,960
we were ordered to escort Her Highness the Consort to visit her family.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
Who would have thought that after Her Highness entered Peach Blossom Manor,

186
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
in less than a day,

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
she would die under mysterious circumstances.

188
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
There are many suspicious points in this case.

189
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,440
It has not yet been thoroughly investigated.

190
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Her Highness's personal maid, Yu Niang,

191
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,399
was also found hanged here.

192
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,639
I have come here under orders.

193
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,720
It is my duty and responsibility.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,679
I must immediately report everything to His Majesty.

195
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
This trip back to the capital

196
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,639
will take seven days round trip.

197
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,399
The duration matches the time allotted for Her Highness's family visit.

198
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,919
Within seven days,

199
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Peach Blossom Manor must provide an explanation.

200
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,399
Otherwise,

201
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,320
everyone present

202
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,399
will soon meet the same fate as the deceased.

203
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,240
Your Excellency's words are absolutely right.

204
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,799
Within seven days,

205
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,440
I must find the murderer.

206
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,039
and bring them to justice.

207
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Lord Han Dao,

208
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,720
Sir

209
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,200
You only have seven days.

210
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,120
I advise you to make the most of your time.

211
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,600
If you can't solve this case within seven days,

212
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,000
then both you and I will be the ones to die.

213
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,039
I'm not very capable,

214
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,799
but I might still be able to distance myself a little.

215
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,200
But as for you, sir,

216
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,279
Eunuch

217
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,080
This matter is of great importance.

218
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,799
Please stay and serve as a witness, Eunuch.

219
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
It's precisely because this matter is so important

220
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,600
that it's not something you or I can handle alone.

221
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,559
That's why I must return to the capital immediately to report.

222
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,120
Lord Han Dao is all alone in this.

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,759
Losing his head is just a scar the size of a bowl.

224
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,639
It's nothing to him.

225
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,720
But you have to think about those behind you—

226
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,559
your brothers and subordinates.

227
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,000
They all have complete families.

228
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,200
Sir, take care of yourself.

229
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,399
Enter.

230
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,159
Next.

231
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:45,799
Uncle He

232
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,960
Since you're already here,

233
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,480
why not stay?

234
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,559
What are you all doing here?

235
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,600
The imperial consort is dead, and you're not investigating the murderer.

236
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,600
You're examining bodies in our manor.

237
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,720
What kind of behavior is this?

238
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,840
If you refuse to cooperate with our investigation,

239
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,399
do you have something to hide?

240
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,240
Nonsense.

241
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,519
Or are you the murderer?

242
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,559
Who are you calling the murderer?

243
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,200
Stop making baseless accusations.

244
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,639
Then please.

245
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,240
Please what?

246
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,320
Do you think you can just examine me as you please?

247
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,720
Lord Han Dao has given the order.

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,559
Everyone in the manor must be examined.

249
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,879
No exceptions.

250
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,480
Lord Han Dao's orders.

251
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,919
You must be mistaken.

252
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,759
This is Peach Blossom Manor.

253
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm in charge here.

254
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,960
What now?

255
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,320
Fine, fine, fine.

256
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,440
Calm down, calm down.

257
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,320
Please, my lord, calm down.

258
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,840
This is just to facilitate the investigation.

259
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,919
Even for an investigation, this isn't acceptable.

260
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,720
Fine, fine.

261
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,639
No, no, no.

262
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,840
The manor master has spoken.

263
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,440
Everyone in the manor must cooperate.

264
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:45,600
Go, go, go.

265
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,240
Go ahead.

266
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
We'll go first, we'll go first.

267
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,000
We're going first.

268
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,080
Let's go, let's go.

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,720
Please.

270
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,600
Let me tell you,

271
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,039
I'm only doing this out of respect for Lord Han Dao.

272
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,120
Let's go.

273
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:57,960
Sir

274
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,440
Please don't be offended, please don't be offended.

275
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,279
Take it off.

276
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
No way, junior brother.

277
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,039
You don't really think

278
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,879
that I have an affair with the imperial consort, do you?
