00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Jiang Zhiyuan,

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
demons are always in danger.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You'd rather commit suicide

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
than stay by my side.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you really hate me that much?

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Master Cang Yun has already been out of the Demon Citadel.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Your old friend is here.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Jiang Jinghuai,

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
do you feel comfortable sitting here?

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm here to greet you, Master Cang Yun.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You were my master in Cang Yun.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Today, I'm here to invite you to a wedding.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Greetings, Madam.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Jiang Zhiyuan

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Jiang Zhiyuan

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My dear,

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you really don't know etiquette.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You even call me your name.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Madam, don't worry.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's how she is.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Besides,

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
she wanted to marry you.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Dear,

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm deeply in love with you now.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't be jealous.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Of course.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A day is a poem,

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
a lifetime is a book.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
My wedding

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
has my good disciple.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're here.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Good.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're really a firefly.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Jiang Jinghuai,

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
you're so sharp.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I heard you've been looking for me.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're not still thinking about me, are you?

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I wish I could kill you myself.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Good disciple,

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
you're so close to your wife.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not appropriate.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You think I can kill you?

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Let's go.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,680
You're killing the Demon King?

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
You...

50
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,120
The Puppet Festival has started.

51
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,480
Life after life,

52
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,600
it's never-ending.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,480
As long as you love it,

54
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,200
you'll die.

55
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,440
Why is the spirit energy suddenly scattered?

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,840
The Puppet Elixir will hurt people and people.

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm afraid that after it wakes up,

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,560
it will be damaged by memory.

59
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,960
It's meaningless to be entangled with it

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
for life after life.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The Puppet Festival

62
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,720
Congratulations, Master.

63
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,120
You've achieved your dream.

64
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,960
You can only survive on your own.

65
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Yeah.

66
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,720
Let them love each other and kill each other.

67
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,400
Now I have to gather the spirit energy

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
and unite the three realms.

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,400
Brother,

70
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
that woman treats you like that.

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,120
Why do you want to keep her in the Demon Citadel?

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,160
Why don't you just kill her?

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,400
Don't bother about

74
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,200
what happened between me and her.

75
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,520
Jiang Jinghuai?

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,760
Jiang Jinghuai?

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,280
Jiang Jinghuai?

78
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,040
Brother.

79
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,640
You...

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,360
Who are you?

81
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Jiang Jinghuai.

82
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,640
You're Jiang Jinghuai.

83
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,840
Why do I only remember this name

84
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,840
and forget everything?

85
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,240
Then who am I?

86
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
You're Jiang Zhiyun.

87
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,440
You're my wife.

88
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Jiang Zhiyun.

89
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Jiang Zhiyun.

90
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,640
You're really my husband.

91
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,640
Sorry for what?

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
I forgot you.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
You had expressed your feelings to me earlier

96
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,480
because you wanted to keep q either me or two generations.

97
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,560
Zhiyun,

98
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,400
you're right.

99
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,640
No one can stop me.

100
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
You're still my husband.

101
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,600
What's wrong with you?

102
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:32,060
We hope Xinyao could find the true treasure and return it back.

103
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,960
If her father would help her,

104
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,640
then I can't let that happen.

105
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,500
Now,

106
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,980
could we solve this problem now?

107
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,400
Why didn't you talk to me?

108
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,400
Did I do something wrong?

109
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,920
My dear husband.

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,160
Jiang Jinghuai.

111
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,240
Jiang Jinghuai.

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,520
Jiang Jinghuai.

113
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,560
What's wrong with you?

114
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,000
I told you

115
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
not to leave me.

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
I didn't.

117
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,320
I just went around.

118
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,040
Jiang Zhiyun.

119
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
Have you really forgotten

120
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,720
our relationship?

121
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,160
I don't remember.

122
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
But I remember

123
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,040
your name is

124
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,200
Jiang Jing...

125
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Jinghuai.

126
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,440
You're my husband.

127
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,560
It's strange.

128
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
My heart

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
hurt like a needle.

130
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,640
But when I saw you,

131
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
it stopped hurting.

132
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Jiang Zhiyun.

133
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,600
Are you really

134
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,280
the one?

135
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,440
Maybe

136
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,640
you're sad because you didn't have enough rest.

137
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,880
I'll ask Mo Yi to come and see you tomorrow.

138
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,800
Where do you want to go?

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,920
Tell me first.

140
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,040
I'll go with you.

141
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,080
You don't know I've never been so quiet.

142
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,880
The moon is full of surprises.

143
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Only once in a lifetime.

144
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Time is like time.

145
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,400
nonesence

146
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
Are you sure

147
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,280
you want to go with me?

148
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,040
Unf dok

149
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,360
Absolutely.

150
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,680
I'm scared

151
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,000
of money.

152
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,300
Best

153
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,200
is dead.

154
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,160
The moon is full of surprises.

155
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,280
but you can't stand

156
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,120
Okay?

157
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
Wen Some!

158
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,440
Only for this time

159
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,200
The time is like the world

160
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,840
Has stopped

161
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,840
I have my own way to get closer to you

162
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,920
I am a fox in the forest

163
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,520
You are the wind and the sun

164
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,680
You are the road ahead of the stars

165
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,240
Even if the truth stops

166
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,520
How can I only see you

167
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,240
I am content

168
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,600
I am a fox in the forest

169
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,240
You are the wind and the sun

170
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,280
You are the road ahead of the stars

171
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,240
I go to the mountains with you

172
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:14,680
I am a fox in the forest

173
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,320
I am a fox in the forest

174
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,880
You are the wind and the sun

175
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,000
You are the road ahead of the stars

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,600
Even if the truth stops

177
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,760
How can I only see you

178
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,280
I am content

179
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,880
I am a fox in the forest

180
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,480
You are the wind and the sun

181
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,280
If you know everything

182
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,760
I am happy

183
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,720
I go to the mountains with you

184
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,600
I am a fox in the forest

185
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,040
I am a fox in the forest
