00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sister

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm fine

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ying

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank god you're here

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now I only have you to keep me in this heaven

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Master

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That day I stepped into the heaven

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I saw someone who looked exactly like you

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you calling me?

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Close the door

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't let anyone in

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Sister

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sister

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where is the Goddess?

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She has gone to bed

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm afraid it's not appropriate to disturb her at night

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Nonsense

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You broke into the Goddess's house at night

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Even if you are the one who has the master's side

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You should be ashamed

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are so sneaky

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What do you want?

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Master asked me to practice magic

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I can sleep well

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How to practice?

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Jiang Zhiyu

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Before our wedding

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't leave this room

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Practice here

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't play tricks with me

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Ying

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sister

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you want?

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The less you know, the better

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You are so clumsy

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Where are you going?

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How dare you

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to kill you

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm going to kill you

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to kill you

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm going to kill you

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Where are you going?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How dare you

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When will you ask about my whereabouts?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My brother has been badly injured by Nan Gongxiao

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Please help me

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Forget about my brother

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
For the sake of the Li family

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For the sake of Cang Yun

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't bother him anymore, okay?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have my own arrangement

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Next

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Nan Gongxiao

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You don't deserve to have spirit

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let alone the three realms

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's go

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Ah Jiu

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why are you here?

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you feeling better?

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't worry

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
My practice magic

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can make me recover

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's too dangerous

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yun

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I won't let you

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Take the risk alone

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You can't beat Nan Gongxiao

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The spirit stone is locked with the lock

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can't open it

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Go

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let me help you

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ah Jiu

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yun

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We finally found ourselves

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What kind of spell are you practicing?

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You can actually use the lock

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The lock

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm practicing

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The lock is being used

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They will find out sooner or later

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's go

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's go

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's go

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's go

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's go

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's go

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's go

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's go

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's go

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I wanted to become a bird

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
To fly with you

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I also wanted to become a fish

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
To be with you

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Master

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The spirit stone was stolen

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't know how they used it

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
To open the lock

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Jiang Zhiyu

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You really betrayed me

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Jiang Zhiyu and that Li person

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Have been mixed for a hundred years

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now the spirit stone has been stolen

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Cang Yun has always been careful

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm afraid someone secretly stole it

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You people from the Li clan are really stubborn

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't think that you can get rid of the dirt

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
On your people

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
By stepping on the Cang Yun

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm a man of the Cang Yun

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How dare I lie to you

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Go and find your brother

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Who is the next left

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The spirit stone was stolen

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The Goddess escaped

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What a big show

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They also came to us

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They also came to us

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
They also came to us

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They also came to us

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They should have been chased

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's take a break here

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it is good

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ayu

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We have now obtained the spirit stone of Cang Yun

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you are taking the spirit stone of the demon clan

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Plus my spirit stone

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We have three spirit stones

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
By then

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can protect my people

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Protect the people

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Correct

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
By then the world is peaceful

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We can be together

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ayu

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You give up the Cang Yun

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Give up the Goddess of Light

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But I'm a lower-ranked Li person

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Have you really thought about it

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The Li people are all lower-ranked

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why come to our Cang Yun

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let go of him

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If I'm bullied

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You want to call me

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What's your name

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't have a name

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't have a name

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't have a name

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What's your name

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I am the spirit clan's fairy Jiang Zhiyu

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then these

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I never forget your name

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So you are that young man from the Li clan

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A Jiu

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I never felt that

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
People have a high and low status

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You don't have to look at yourself

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have been subverted by these rules for a hundred years

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want freedom

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So I thought about it a long time ago

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't talk about the mystery

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you turn your stubbornness into heaven

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You told me when you were a kid

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You don't have a name

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll give you a name, okay?

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Jiang Jinghuai

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Jiang Jinghuai

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The view is pure sunshine

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The sea is clear water

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Just like you

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Jiang Zhiyu

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Jiang Jinghuai

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I have a new name

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I am very happy

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This place is not suitable for long

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's go first

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Go to the forest

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Where are you

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The flower is covered with the wind

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The cloud is rough

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't talk about the mystery

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you turn your stubbornness into heaven

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Just put it in your dream

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You and I look at the Milky Way

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Like using that sunglasses
