1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,040
Time to knit

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,560
of love

3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,160
Episode 2

4
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,920
Why the wind suddenly blew?

5
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,080
Lost seed inside my brain.

6
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,200
Looks like there's a cold inside.

7
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,760
We will forget about it later.

8
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,760
It's alright, ah huan.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
The secret of the tribe.

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,440
There's still the fourth spirit stone in this world.

11
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
It can use the power of the third spirit stone.

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,520
It's good that we can find the fourth spirit stone.

13
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,520
Nangong Xiao has absorbed the power of the spirit stone.

14
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,240
He and Aoheng are in harmony.

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,000
We must find a way to deal with it.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ayou.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're still alive.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not Luo Ying.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm the God of War.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No wonder I didn't find Luo Ying's treasure.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Luo Ying is my master's first follower.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My master's grace has all the memories of Luo Ying.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The world is cruel.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's just a love story.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But it's okay.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're still alive.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I know what you want to say.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No matter what,

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
we'll be sisters forever.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The God of War is back.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We'll fight together.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We'll definitely get rid of Aoheng.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm awake,

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but I haven't recovered my power.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm afraid it's hard to fight.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's okay.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Since I can sense the existence of the third spirit stone,

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I believe I can also sense the fourth spirit stone.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This time,

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we'll protect the world together.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The God of War

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What do you want to say?

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Please.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is it dangerous for Ayou to find the spirit stone?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If he can sense the spirit stone,

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
it means that the spirit stone is his master.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He needs to be with the spirit stone to defeat Aoheng.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What if he can't find it?

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The God of War is the existence of the fourth spirit stone.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Only if Ayou sacrifices,

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the spirit stone will be destroyed.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Aoheng's power will be destroyed.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You want him to be the one to fight?

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't want to do that.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But this is a dead end.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If the fourth spirit stone is already in control,

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
then this kind of thing

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
will also be with Aoheng.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Will Ayou be fine?

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But the rumor says

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that the master of the fourth spirit stone is his master.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This person is very...

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's me.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've searched for Ayou's whereabouts.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've made a deal with Sunsheng.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll kill him.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How could you live in the world without a heart?

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll give you the perfect one

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to replace your heart.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll kill you.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's it.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I've got the fourth spirit stone.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The spirit stone is my only one.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll take it back.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Since that's the case,

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I, Xiao Mei Aoheng,

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
will also be destroyed by the Heaven and Earth.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's also a natural thing.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You must sacrifice yourself to protect the Heaven and Earth.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll take back this life.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll only take back the soul.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Please keep this secret for me.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't let it get to him.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But you've been away for a long time.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You've been together for a few days.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Since I've left,

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to stay with him.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A'Yu.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't force yourself to die.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Huai.

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't even feel the fourth spirit stone.

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Has it become a dead end?

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't worry.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll still be there for you.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll take care of it.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll take care of it.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll take care of it.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll take care of it.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll take care of it.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll take care of it.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't worry.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not the best time to go to the deep water.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We still have time to think about it.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I still can't let go of my heart.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Or A'Yu will come over soon.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Where's Qingwei?

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Where's Qingwei?

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll ask him if there's a way to awaken the spirit stone.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've already asked him for you.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He said that

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the spirit stone is hard to touch.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's just fate.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He also said that

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
as long as we work together,

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
even if we can't eliminate A'Yu,

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
we can fight with each other.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But what I want is

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the sea star river banquet

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and the peace of the world.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you know

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
what I want?

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The three realms of the one and one.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do I look like a devil in your heart?

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're originally a devil.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But I think

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
even if you're a three realms of the one and one,

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you won't hurt or hurt people.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's not the same.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I still have to go.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What I want is

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you to be open to me.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can be happy

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and happy every day.

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You can live a happy life.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Me too.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's work together.

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm so old.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What if one day

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm gone

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and you're not going to give me a good life?

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're so beautiful.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll live a better life.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You can be the one who's waiting for me

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
for a hundred years.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's enough.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't regret it.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Of course.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll be the one who's waiting for you.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Of course.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Husband.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Husband.

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What's wrong?

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Nothing.

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Nothing.

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Nothing.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I just want

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
to be with you forever.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Really?

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I want to do anything with you.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
As long as you're my friend,

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I promise you.

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll think about it.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm so old.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll be the one who's waiting for you.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll live a better life.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You can be happy every day.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You can be happy every day.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can be happy every day.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll live a better life.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can be happy every day.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can be happy every day.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll live a better life.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You can be happy every day.

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll live a better life.

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You can be happy every day.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll live a better life.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You can be happy every day.

181
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You can be happy every day.

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can be happy every day.

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll live a better life.

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You can be happy every day.

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You can be happy every day.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can be happy every day.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
