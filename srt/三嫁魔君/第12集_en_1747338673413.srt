00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,540
moon and the moon and the moon

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,980
Master, the day will come that my brother will have happy birthday.

5
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,380
And also the day that i'll have snacks.

6
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,600
You always teach me that

7
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,100
I should have eyes for my friends.

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,660
But for you

9
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,260
to be that heartless person.

10
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,820
When you wake up,

11
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,900
I'll give you a grand wedding.

12
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,120
Your Excellency,

13
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
from the very beginning,

14
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,380
the Great Sage was really a good helper.

15
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,420
She was the one who asked for moderator.

16
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,020
She's really girlish.

17
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,140
When I gather the Peak Spiritual Mistress,

18
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,460
I hope that all the three Realms

19
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,660
will Проof Engrave you back!

20
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,980
Gu Brood clarifying.

21
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,820
I'm sorry.

22
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,220
Why isn't it time yet?

23
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,260
Is it urgent?

24
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,740
Marrying Ah Yu

25
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,980
is the most important thing I want to do in the past century.

26
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,300
Do you think it's urgent?

27
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Brother,

28
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,620
you finally got what you wanted.

29
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
Congratulations.

30
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,340
But you've been by my side for so many years.

31
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,140
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,020
The past is in the past.

33
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,020
Today is a happy day.

34
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,900
We should be happy.

35
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Oh, right.

36
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,220
Normally,

37
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,260
you have no right

38
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,420
to get him.

39
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
When did you learn

40
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,780
how to give technical training?

41
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,260
It's another custom of us people from Li State

42
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,300
to lead our marriage.

43
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,900
To see

44
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,340
whether your marriage stealing

45
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,100
is going to be recorded

46
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,420
as both forthcoming marriage men.

47
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,100
Hold on.

48
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,620
Are you good at that?

49
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,140
There is still the blood I drank.

50
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,920
Go then.

51
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,700
Number 10

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,580
Why did you take off your boundary?

53
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,980
When you returned,

54
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,740
was I your bride again?

55
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,680
Why do you care about theärtical

56
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,380
Do you love me?

57
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,900
Don't ask

58
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,780
Now that Master has left the Cloud,

59
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,980
the three realms are fighting for the spiritual sense.

60
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,460
Why don't you

61
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,460
give me the spirit sense in your hand?

62
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,740
Okay?

63
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,620
Didn't you just say you would never leave me?

64
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,780
You're being so late.

65
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,980
I'll give you whatever you want.

66
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,060
Master.

67
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,380
Master.

68
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,260
Master.

69
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,380
The spirit sense.

70
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,620
Brother.

71
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,820
Don't give it to him.

72
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,580
It's all because of the spirit sense.

73
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,660
Excuse me.

74
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,940
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,660
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,220
Continue.

77
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,740
Stand up.

78
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,780
Demon girl.

79
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,780
The D Turkey Master

80
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,820
You know?

81
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,140
You've been my benefactor for half a year.

82
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,660
It's all fake.

83
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,340
You're a bitch.

84
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,020
You even want to get the love of our God Clan.

85
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,820
It's ridiculous.

86
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,180
It's mine soon.

87
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,060
You're a bitch.

88
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,500
Brother.

89
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,740
I've been lying to you all the time.

90
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,020
But it's just for the sake of the spirit.

91
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,780
Let go of me.

92
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,820
igh

93
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,100
Uncle.

94
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,820
Why do you do this?

95
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,700
Mom!

96
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,940
I look for you in the vast sky

97
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,940
Where are you?

98
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,940
I draw a line of wind to find the path

99
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,420
I continue to look for the path

100
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,420
I put your loneliness in the sky

101
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,420
I can only put it in your dream

102
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,940
You and I look at the Milky Way

103
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,940
Like using that sunglasses

104
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,940
If I had a gorgeous voice for a lifetime

105
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,940
The power of love that comes from the sky

106
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,940
The Milky Way is endless

107
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Waiting for your memories in the silence

108
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,940
