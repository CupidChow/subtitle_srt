00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You look at the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,840
moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and the moon and

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,040
the moon

4
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,800
Yu

5
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,840
Where do you want to take me

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,560
You guess

7
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,880
This is what you said

8
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,280
Do whatever you want with me

9
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,000
No eye repayment

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,800
This is where you want to go the most

11
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,840
What's wrong with you

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,320
You Solidly open your eyes

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
Open your eyes

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,720
Let's make it clear.

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,880
I didn't steal the money.

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,160
It's just that

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,200
this is the way

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
to the Cloud Recesses.

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,240
I used to

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,640
wander around here.

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
I wanted to see you,

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
but I couldn't.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
I've been

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,120
familiar with the grass and the wood here

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,440
and the air here.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
I haven't asked you

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,000
why you want to come here.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
we have memories here.

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Do you remember?

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,040
Of course.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,560
The place where you are

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,360
is my best memory.

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,440
Look.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,880
It's a firefly.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,080
I'll go get some for you.

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,720
You're the Demon Lord.

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,920
Why do you want to catch a firefly?

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,200
So what?

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,400
I'll catch one for you

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,480
as long as you like it.

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,640
The leaves of the sunset

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,120
scatter the light of the week.

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,880
The stars and the moon in the sky

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,800
light up the window of the west window.

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Huan,

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
don't miss the next day.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,320
If I die of hatred,

49
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,720
don't miss me.

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,320
You must be as happy

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,120
as you are now.

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
The leaves of the sunset

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,120
scatter the light of the week.

54
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,720
Look.

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,320
The flowers and the leaves

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
still sigh in the empty window.

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
The sky is full of sadness.

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,240
The moon and the moon

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,720
still sigh in the empty window.

60
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,920
It's so beautiful.

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,720
The stars and the moon in the sky

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,920
light up the window of the west window.

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,720
Yes.

64
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,520
It's so beautiful.

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
The fireflies light up the window.

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,120
The flesh is silent.

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,120
The green city is red.

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,720
The sky is full of sadness.

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,320
I wish to die without regret.

70
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,520
I won't let you down.

71
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,920
I'll miss you forever.

72
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,160
Long A говорит event

73
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,720
Ayu.

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,320
I want to compare my practice to yours,

75
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
and bring us even.

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,720
Okay.

77
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,360
Thank you once again

78
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,640
I am getting married with A'Yu today

79
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,600
Jiang Zhiyu NOT a Demon Emperor

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
He could have Empried the Demon clan

81
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,400
He would shield them for ten thousand years

82
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
I want to see her.

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,280
Do you think

84
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,320
I'm also a hypocrite?

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,120
My emergence from dynasty of Yizhou

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,320
shows my inherent heart

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
which is not that guarded,

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,040
I wouldn't dare to say OK to you.

89
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,760
Father,

90
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,400
is it up to me

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
to decide the Demon Citadel today?

92
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,160
Of course.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
Then,

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,160
call me Your Grace.

95
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,360
Yes, Your Grace.

96
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,200
Congratulations on your marriage!

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,120
Congratulations on your marriage!

98
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,440
Congratulations on your marriage!

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
Huai, it's Luo Ying.

100
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm so happy to see you.

101
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
I'm so happy to see you.

103
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm so happy to see you.

104
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm so happy to see you.

105
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
I'm so happy to see you.

106
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm so happy to see you.

107
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
I'm so happy to see you.

108
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
I'm so happy to see you.

109
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
I'm so happy to see you.

110
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
I'm so happy to see you.

111
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
I'm so happy to see you.

112
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm so happy to see you.

113
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
I'm so happy to see you.

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,980
I'm so happy to see you.

115
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Look at me!

116
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,360
You just like to see me like this.

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,560
I just can't stop looking at you.

118
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,220
I'll help you.

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,080
Yu,

121
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,600
we're a family.

122
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,480
You can regret it.

123
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,600
Never.

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
If there's a next life,

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,040
I'll marry you.

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,880
Correct.

127
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,160
Iron JA avoidance

128
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,720
The rain suddenly falls and the forest is itself

129
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,520
The clouds and birds know how to get up

130
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,920
It doesn't matter if you're avoiding it on purpose

131
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,240
The vast sky continues to look for you

132
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,400
Where will you be

133
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,360
Draw a bunch of wind to find the path

134
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I continue to watch the path and don't say the rice field

135
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,360
If you go back to the sky

136
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,360
I can only put it in your dream

137
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,360
You and I look at the Milky Way

138
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Like a pair of sunglasses

139
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,360
If I have a gorgeous rain in my life

140
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,360
The power of love that falls in the air

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,360
The galaxy is endless

142
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Waiting for your memories in the life of the ink
