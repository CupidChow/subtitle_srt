8
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's go.

9
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ayu, don't worry.

10
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We'll go find the Demon Clan Spirit Stone now.

11
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Madam.

12
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Sister.

13
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Madam.

14
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You let me find it.

15
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Honorable God.

16
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Luo Ying is an official this time.

17
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have to reward her well.

18
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sister, I didn't.

19
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Nangong Xiao.

20
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You threatened Luo Ying to lure out the Golden Butterfly

21
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and seduced me to show up.

22
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You are despicable.

23
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't worry.

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I will never treat those who follow me well.

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But those who betray me,

26
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I will never let go.

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Give me the Spirit Stone.

28
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sister.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Huai.

30
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Huai.

31
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How dare you?

32
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Huai.

33
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How dare you?

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You deceived the Goddess,

35
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
stole the Spirit Stone,

36
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
betrayed the Demon Clan,

37
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and betrayed the Cloud.

38
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She didn't.

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She didn't.

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I've already verified

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the rules of the Cloud.

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Even if I have to

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
miss the meeting today,

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will be punished.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't come for this woman.

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come for me.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Honorable God.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Li Ren is so arrogant.

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
She should be executed immediately.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But...

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It has nothing to do with Huai.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's me.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm willing to do it.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Nonsense.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You were clearly

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
seduced by Li Ren.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You are the Goddess of the Cloud Clan.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are Nangong Xiao's wife.

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She is my woman.

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Goddess.

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Goddess.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Did you hear that?

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Who are you?

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I only love Zhang Jinghuai.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Honorable God.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Li Ren

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
wants to steal the Goddess from you.

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You are all heartless.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'd rather die than be separated from you.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Honorable God.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They are really in love.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Really?

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you think we should do?

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why don't we

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
torture this Li Ren

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
who has been lost for thousands of years

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and let him enjoy

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the grace of the Honorable God?

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
As for the Goddess,

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
let the ice knife cut off the love thread.

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let the knife cut the love thread.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let the knife cut the love thread.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let the knife cut the love thread.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then she will be

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the Goddess of the Cloud Clan forever.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What is the ice knife?

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You can't bear it.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anhui, go.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll do anything

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
for you.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
A love-sucking case.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A painful yearning.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want you to be in the ice of this valley

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and watch the one you love

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
fall in love with you.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Anhui.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Love thread for hundreds of years

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
will be cut off with a knife.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Anhui.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
She will love you.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But you will

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
forget her name forever.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Her appearance

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
will be forgotten.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Her appearance.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Brother.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Anhui.

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Anhui.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Anhui.

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Anhui.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Anhui.

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Anhui.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are not worthy.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Anhui.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Anhui.

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Anhui.

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Anhui.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Anhui.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Anhui.

125
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Anhui.

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Anhui.

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Anhui.

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Anhui, wake up.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Anhui.

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll save you.

131
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Anhui.

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Anhui.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Anhui, wake up.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Anhui.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Anhui.

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Anhui.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Kill me.

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Brother.

139
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Anhui.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Brother.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Anhui.

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Anhui.

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's not easy to

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
love someone.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The wind blows away the gray mark.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Suddenly the rain falls on itself.

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The clouds and birds know how to get up.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No light deliberately escapes.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The vast sky continues to look for you.

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where will you be?

151
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The wind blows away the gray mark.

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I continue to look for the path.

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If I can return to the sky

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
with your breath,

155
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can only put it in your dream.

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You and I look at the Milky Way.

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We are like the mirror.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If only I could have the beautiful meaning of life.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The sky is full of the power of human love.

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The Milky Way is endless.

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I wait for your memory in silence.
