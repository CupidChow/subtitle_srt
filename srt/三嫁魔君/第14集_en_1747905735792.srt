Episode 16

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Love by Hypnotic

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Your Excellency, you are in charge of the three realms,

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and you are doing your best to escape from the heaven.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I have been waiting for a long time.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The Love by Hypnotic

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Your Excellency, you don't have to be polite.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We have something to say.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I heard that you are looking for someone.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That person is also with you.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why do you have to bother?

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You will become a mortal when you enter the reincarnation.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You will die and go to heaven.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have to remind you that

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
you are not a mortal.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then what do you need to exchange?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I am willing to give you my heart.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Good.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That mortal has been in the human world for 20 years.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't expect that the new demon lord

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
is actually a love-hate relationship.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You will regret it.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Love by Hypnotic

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Your Excellency,

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the spy reported that

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Jiang Zhiyu was erased from his memory and entered the reincarnation.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Jiang Jinghuai found his news.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm afraid I will go to the human world to find him.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
As long as you can exchange the memories of Jiang Zhiyu and hatred,

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
they will kill each other.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ayu,

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
are you willing to marry me?

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ayu,

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I will love you until I die.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are just a substitute in the human world.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Even if you have the same face as me,

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
you don't deserve to marry her.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't want to marry her.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Even if you have the same face as me,

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you don't deserve to marry her.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Ayu,

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
don't forget.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No matter where you are,

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
you and I will live forever.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The auspicious time has come.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Who am I?

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
My husband,

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A'Jiu.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A'Jiu,

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
you are my husband.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ayu,

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
let's forget hatred

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and forget worries.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's good to be a normal couple.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Husband,

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
can you love me?

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't be afraid.

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He is not your husband.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He is fake.

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He is not your husband.

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He is not your husband.

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He is not your husband.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He is fake.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He is not your husband.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He is fake.

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He is not your husband.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He is not your husband.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He is not your husband.

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,820
Two people you and me knew each other at first sight!

74
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,340
Why are you in my dream?

75
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,600
Telling my husband that he is fake!

76
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,840
Who are you?

77
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
The evil spirit kills your husband

78
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,760
Cashns him to Advisor

79
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,580
Your husband is in the Sakata cliche feels

80
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,140
I求我, 你去救他

81
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,720
I did not expect

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,960
that all that money

83
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,300
has gone to waste

84
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,260
The watched values

85
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
in such a human body

86
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:13,840
that veya

87
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,340
my husband

88
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,660
排 completely

89
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,160
Seel

90
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,720
Well

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,440
You're so stupid.

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,480
A Jiu is pure and kind.

93
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,560
Now,

94
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,800
how about the evil thing that wants to marry you?

95
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,240
A Jiu.

96
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,320
Where did you get this?

97
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,800
I got it from the temple.

98
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,560
It's said that if you take this sword home,

99
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,840
you can remove the evil and avoid evil.

100
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,600
I'll take it.

101
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,800
Why?

102
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,800
I'll take it to the evil.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,160
Don't let anything in the temple go to hell.

104
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,160
Don't forget that we'll get married tomorrow.

105
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,520
A Jiu, tomorrow is the 72nd day of the lunar month.

106
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,520
They said that the wedding day was not in time.

107
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,920
Can we...

108
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
I lost.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,960
Tomorrow,

110
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,560
you'll be my wife.

111
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,000
He is future baritone favor,

112
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,000
not future baritone favor.

113
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
Go and tell him to come back tomorrow to talk to me.

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
Where is that asked?

115
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,200
If he wasn't my husband,

116
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,400
who would he be?

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,960
Are you a jilted woman?

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The scar on her chest

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
must be the hole

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
where you sewed her skin.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't touch it.

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you don't believe me,

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
stick this hairpin

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
into her chest.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Your husband will be alive.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't dare.

127
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I can't stick it out.

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
She's here.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The wind blows away the traces of gray.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Suddenly the rain falls on her.

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The clouds and birds know how to get up.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It doesn't matter if you're avoiding it.

133
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The vast sky continues to look for you.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Where will you be?

135
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The wind blows away the traces of gray.

136
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I continue to protect the trace.

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't talk about the distance.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you're lonely,

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
go back to the sky.

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm willing to put it in your heart.

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You and I look at the Milky Way.

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We look at the Milky Way.

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We're so close.

144
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If I can only hear the sound of rain.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm afraid to fall for the power of love.

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The Milky Way is endless.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm waiting for your memory.

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm waiting for your memory.

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm waiting for your memory.

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm waiting for your memory.

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm waiting for your memory.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm waiting for your memory.

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm waiting for your memory.

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm waiting for your memory.
