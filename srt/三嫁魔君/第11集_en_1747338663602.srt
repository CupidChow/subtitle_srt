00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My Girlfriend II

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Ying.

4
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,800
Sister.

5
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,680
I was just about to look for you.

6
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,200
Yan Luo said

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,560
Jiang Jinghuai's rest technique

8
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,800
is about to be used.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,320
Do you know about it?

10
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,320
I'll ask him

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,920
about it.

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,480
But how can a righteous person

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,840
practice the evil technique?

14
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,840
You haven't seen him for a long time.

15
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,400
Maybe he has changed.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,040
Ying.

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,720
I know you're worried about me.

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,400
But I know he's not a bad person.

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,680
But you...

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,040
Are you really going to be with Yan Luo?

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,320
Are you two really in love?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
Unconsciously falling in love

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
is love.

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,360
But you don't know Yueyu.

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
He treats you like this.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,920
Don't you think it's weird?

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
Sister.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,760
Why are you biased against him?

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,720
I have nothing.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,760
What can he ask me for?

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,080
I think

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,240
Jiang Jinghuai is more reasonable

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,320
to approach you.

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,080
Luo Ying.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,240
Yan Luo is suspicious of the spiritual sense.

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,080
I've already noticed it.

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,720
I don't believe it.

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
If he's suspicious,

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
why not approach you

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,200
instead of me?

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,160
Besides,

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,000
why doesn't he ask for Jiang Jinghuai?

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,160
I think Jiang Jinghuai

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,240
is more lucky.

45
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,640
He wants to use you

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,720
to get the spiritual sense

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,040
and become the next Nan Gongxiao.

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,080
Ying.

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,200
Ying.

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,960
Ying.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,200
Ying, stop.

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,640
Why?

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,920
Why can you be with Jiang Jinghuai

54
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,280
but stop my feelings?

55
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,920
You want him to leave me so badly.

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,680
Ying.

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,040
You misunderstood me.

58
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,080
I'm afraid you'll be cheated and let down.

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,600
You don't know him at all.

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,040
He's nice to me.

61
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,680
He won't let me down

62
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,760
or bully me.

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,720
Yan Luo is full of mystery.

64
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,360
Take me to find out the truth.

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,240
I know.

66
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,040
I know you care about me.

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,640
I'm moved.

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,440
Now that I think about it,

69
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,040
the first time we met,

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm already moved.

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,520
You're not moved.

72
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm afraid it's a trap he designed.

73
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,040
Besides,

74
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,360
I've told him

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,720
not to come to you for now.

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
Why should you go to him?

77
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,320
Who do you think you are?

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,320
You only care about Jiang Jinghuai now.

79
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm not in your heart.

80
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Ying.

81
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Yan Luo is not a simple person.

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,200
Enough. Stop talking.

83
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,120
Don't interfere with my life in the future.

84
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,960
Ying.

85
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,880
Yan Luo.

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,960
Let's leave.

87
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,720
We can only live our own lives.

88
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,800
I'm a lowly man.

89
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,880
I can't protect you.

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
I don't need your protection.

91
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
I just want to see you every day.

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,200
I just want to be with you every day.

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
That's enough.

94
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
Yan Luo, what's wrong with you?

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,400
You don't want to be with me?

96
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,040
Luo Ying.

97
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,280
What your sister said is right.

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
Let's stop here.

99
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,840
Why?

100
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
There's no reason.

101
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,880
Why?

102
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,360
Because you're his substitute.

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,480
His shadow.

104
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
I'll miss him when I see you.

105
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,080
My master.

106
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,600
I'll feel sad and guilty.

107
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,800
And...

108
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,520
You look exactly like him.

109
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
I don't care.

110
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,120
I can be his substitute.

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,520
I can be his shadow.

112
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,920
I...

113
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,120
But I don't love you.

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,960
I'm the fox in the forest.

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,560
I'm the rain in the wind.

116
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,280
I'll travel a thousand miles to find you.

117
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,960
Just because of this face?

118
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Yan Luo.

119
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,160
Why?

120
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,320
I loved you.

121
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
But I never regret it.

122
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,040
My sister used to say love is hard to understand.

123
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,480
Now I'm gone.

124
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,600
If you're at the end of the road, I'll follow you.

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,400
I'll follow you to the mountains and forests.

126
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
Take care of yourself.

127
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,960
I'll be with you forever.

128
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Sister.

129
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,760
I was wrong.

130
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,740
The

131
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,240
Master of Nangong.

132
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,600
Do you really keep your promise?

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
What?

134
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,640
You figured it out?

135
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,480
Yes.

136
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,360
I figured it out.

137
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,960
We can cooperate.

138
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,280
But you're Jiang Jinghuai's good brother.

139
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,240
How can I trust you?

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
He...

141
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,520
He's just my master.

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,120
How dare you?

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,040
Cooperation is difficult.

144
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,360
They're getting married soon.

145
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,680
Get ready.

146
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
Get ready to be a goddess.

147
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
Let them turn the tree into a bug.

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
So they can take the spiritual stone.

149
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,520
But I'm afraid it's hard to bear

150
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,240
the power of my own.

151
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,800
Don't worry.

152
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,080
I'll help you.

153
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Yun.

154
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Yun.

155
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Ahuai.

156
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Why are you here?

157
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not a good idea to meet before the wedding.

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Go back.

159
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,400
I don't care about these old habits.

160
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I just want to see you.

161
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,200
If you're so stubborn,

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
I won't marry you.

163
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
No.

164
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
You have to call me husband.

165
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,040
You're so shameless.

166
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,600
I haven't married you yet.

167
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800
You just let me call you husband.

168
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,120
Then you call me Tian.

169
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,640
Just call me.

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,800
Husband.

171
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
It's too quiet.

172
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
I can't hear you.

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Husband.

174
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Enough.

175
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Go back.

176
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
People will see us.

177
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,080
Then kiss me.

178
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
I'll go.

179
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
No way.

180
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Just kiss me.

181
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Just once.

182
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Just once.

183
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Close your eyes.

184
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Okay.

185
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Go back.

186
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,360
No light, I'm avoiding you.

187
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm looking for you in the vast sky.

188
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Where are you?

189
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,360
I'm looking for you in the wind.

190
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm looking for you everywhere.

191
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
I'm not talking about the distance.

192
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
If I leave you alone,

193
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,360
I'll be alone in the vast sky.

194
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,360
I can only put you in my dream.

195
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,360
You and I look at the galaxy.

196
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,360
It's so close to each other.

197
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:11,360
If I can have a gorgeous shadow for a lifetime.

198
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,360
The power of love that comes from the sky.

199
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I can't remember the memory of waiting for you in the silence.
