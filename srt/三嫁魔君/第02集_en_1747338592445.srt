00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,960
Uncle

9
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,200
Why are you

10
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
into buttonless

11
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,980
nest again and again yesterday?

12
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,600
Because I can't forget you

13
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,940
and us as a couple.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,440
While the star wench Wei Webb still doesn't have father

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:59,800
and can't get out of the

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Try it.

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,400
You taught me to drink.

18
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
Let me teach you a poem.

19
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,000
I wish my heart is pure gold.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My heart is pure gold.

21
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,000
I will never let go of my love.

22
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,400
Alright.

23
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Keep going.

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,200
You'll reach the end of the Li clan.

25
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,800
Time flies.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
The Goddess is coming.

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Really?

28
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I think time flies too.

29
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm leaving.

30
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,800
The autumn water in my eyes has flown by.

31
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,600
I only know to return after the spring has gone.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
The moon is low but the night is full of beautiful flowers.

33
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I drink a cup of wine. No one is left behind.

34
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,200
I wish my heart is pure gold.

35
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
It's so beautiful.

36
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,600
The moon is big but the sky is full of pink.

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,400
I don't have to love for the flowers.

38
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
It's so beautiful.

39
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,600
The water in my eyes has flown by.

40
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
You like it?

41
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,800
I'm afraid time flies.

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
I'll go get the plate of paper.

43
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
I'll get you some dishes.

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
The moon is low but the sky is full of beautiful flowers.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,200
I drink a cup of wine. No one is left behind.

46
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm afraid time flies.

47
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,800
It's so beautiful.

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,720
We can't stop this time

49
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,880
Let's drink pegade

50
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,000
Transition between us

51
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,080
I bet

52
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,280
As a drinks

53
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
It's so beautiful.

54
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
This is called the firefly.

55
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Do you have it in the sky?

56
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
No.

57
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I've never seen this in the sky.

58
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
It's like a lantern.

59
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,800
It's so beautiful.

60
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I'll kill all those snakes and insects to send you.

61
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
They will be as beautiful as the stars.

62
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Come with me.

63
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Jiang Zhiyu.

64
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I like you.

65
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Sister.

66
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Sister.

67
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Help.

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Help.

69
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Help.

70
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Master.

71
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Why are you here?

72
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Come with me.

73
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
We Li people only plant flowers for our beloved girls.

74
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
The flowers of Jin clan are beautiful.

75
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm willing to try them.

76
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I'll plant flowers for you.

77
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Are you willing?

78
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Where are you from, Yang?

79
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Is...

80
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Is it you?

81
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
What do you mean by that?

82
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
You've got the wrong person.

83
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
You haven't answered my question.

84
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
I'm sorry, miss.

85
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I'm Yan Luo.

86
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,800
I've offended all the beasts in the forest.

87
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
I'm lucky to have you help me.

88
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
I haven't asked for your name.

89
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
You're so lucky.

90
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
I have Luo, too.

91
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
My name is Luo Yin.

92
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
I can't let you recover immediately.

93
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
If my sister were here,

94
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
she would be able to recover.

95
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Your sister...

96
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Goddess Cang Yun, Jiang Zhiyu.

97
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Master,

98
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
there's a ghost.

99
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
The goddess went to the Li Ren Temple with that person.

100
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
She's not here.

101
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
She's not here.

102
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
She's not here.

103
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
She's not here.

104
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
The goddess went to the Li Ren Temple with that person.

105
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Find her.

106
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
It's not my fault.

107
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I didn't mean to run away.

108
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm looking for you in the vast sky.

109
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Where are you?

110
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm looking for you in the vast sky.

111
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm looking for you in the vast sky.

112
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
If I leave your loneliness in the sky,

113
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I can only put it in your dream.

114
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,800
You and I look at the galaxy.

115
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
We are so close.

116
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,800
If I can have a beautiful voice for the rest of my life,

117
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I can feel the power of love in the air.

118
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
The galaxy is endless.

119
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I'm waiting for your memory in my life.
