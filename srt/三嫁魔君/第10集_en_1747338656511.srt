4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I guessed right.

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You really have other purpose.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You investigate me?

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You don't talk about the secret.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If you want to use the spirit stone to save people,

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can help you.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How about we cooperate?

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't understand what you are talking about.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I didn't expect that my humble apprentice

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
is so stupid.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Even if you investigate me clearly,

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will never cooperate with you.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because they are my friends.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Friends?

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Friends?

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you think Jiang Zhiyu knows that you have other purpose,

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Jiang Jinghuai and Luo Ying

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
will still treat you as friends?

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know how they will treat me in the end.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I know

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
if you cooperate with the chief,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
there will never be any good end.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You help me get the spirit stone,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I help you save your master.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can think about it slowly.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But I am your only chance.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why are you looking at me?

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Jiang Zhiyu,

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
when will you marry me?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You like me so much.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But I haven't decided yet.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you have time, you should read more books.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's so late. Stop reading.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It hurts my eyes.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Come on, let me tell you a joke.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In the past,

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
there was a pair of brothers.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
At night,

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the younger brother was stared by the mosquitoes and couldn't sleep.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He told his brother

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
that there were too many mosquitoes tonight.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then the brother told him

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that he had turned off the light.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The mosquitoes couldn't see him.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The younger brother was very obedient

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
to turn off the light.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But then,

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
a firefly flew over.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Guess what the younger brother said.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The younger brother said,

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Brother,

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
mosquitoes had turned off the light.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Jiang Jinghuai,

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you have said this joke

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
a hundred times.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let me tell you the rest.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The younger brother

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
was so annoyed that he couldn't sleep.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Then he asked the younger brother,

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
do you know what a mirror

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
will say when it falls from a height?

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What will it say?

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It will say,

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
it's late.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because I'm drunk.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I just thought that

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
it's not easy

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
for us to get here.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But being with you,

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I feel so happy.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Jiang Jinghuai,

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I love you.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Jiang Zhiyun,

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I love you too.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's been 300 years.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It turns out

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I've loved you for so long.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to find a way

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to protect you from the evil spirit.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I just hope that one day,

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
you can wake up

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and come back to me.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
When I collect the spiritual keys,

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you can wake up.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Then,

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you will love me.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Master,

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will never betray you.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I will love you only.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
From the moment you

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
took me in 300 years ago,

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it's destined to be like this.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I only

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
care about

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Luoying.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm just using it.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes,

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm just using it.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Now I've got the trust

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
of the Goddess.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm about to get the spiritual keys.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Master, you will

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
wake up soon.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I will allow you

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to dress up

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and have fun.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay?

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I will be back

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to Yan Luo soon.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I will be back soon.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is a good one.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's very good.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will give you more.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I hope these blessings

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
can keep you safe and sound.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But,

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Jiang Jinghuai's cultivation skill...

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, right.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What skill did he use?

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He defeated Nan Gongxiao.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He learned the skill

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and got the spiritual keys.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The skill?

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm afraid he will hurt you

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
if he uses the evil spirit.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have to tell him.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yan Luo.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yan Luo?

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I've investigated

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and I still don't know his real identity.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He's acting so strange today.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm afraid he doesn't really love Luo Ying.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yan Luo.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Where are you going?

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to find Luo Ying.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Where is she?

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Luo Ying's room

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is over there.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Thank you, Goddess.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yan Luo.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You just

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
came from the Spirit-waking Room.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I just got into the Cloud.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a short time.

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I might just pass by.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The Spirit-waking Room is hidden from the world.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Even the disciples of the Cloud

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
can't escape it.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Moreover,

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
you just got into the Cloud

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and you're so familiar with the world.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're lying.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What's wrong with you?

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are you afraid

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll miss the Spirit-waking Room?

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You said so yourself.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Who in the world

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
doesn't like the spirit-waking room?

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's better if I've misunderstood.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If you don't,

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm telling you,

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
no matter what your plan is,

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Luo Ying is my sister.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can't hurt her.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She's loyal to you.

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If you really like her,

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
treat her well.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you dare to use her,

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll never let you off.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The Spirit-waking Room

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The Spirit-waking Room

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You and I look at the Milky Way

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We're so close

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If I can have a beautiful voice

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll chase after the right to love

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The Milky Way is endless

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll wait for your memory for a lifetime
