4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You actually gave me a spirit ball.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Jiang Jinghuai, are you laughing?

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Sha Luoying, the spirit stone, you still have a dream about me.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You never forget.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I never dare to forget.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It hurts, but your pain today is not as bad as the day you betrayed me.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How does it feel to know the heart of the devil?

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't worry, I'll send you to death.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You witch, you really have a heart of gold.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I saw through you earlier, and I'll teach you a good lesson today.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're so lucky.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Come on, beat her to death.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Jiang Jinghuai, I'll kill you.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Brother.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Master, I've been using my spirit power for a hundred years.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The spirit stone will be ready soon.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The spirit stone is still not ready.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You'll wake up soon, master.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
She can't live.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She's not worth it.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She's not worth it.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She's not worth it.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She's not worth it.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She's not worth it.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She's not worth it.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She's not worth it.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She's not worth it.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You promised me that you would save my master.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I said I would save him, but I didn't say I would save her.

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Master, I've been using my spirit power for a hundred years.

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've been with my brothers, and I've killed Luo Ying.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now I'm being used by Nan Gongxiao.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm stupid.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I must have you alive.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Master, no matter what, you have to wake up.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yan Luo?

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Who hurt you?

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's all my fault.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Get up and talk.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I framed Yu up that day.

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Everything at the wedding was done by me.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry for my master.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry for my three-way spirit.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can only ask for help from Nan Gongxiao.

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let them do what they want.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Say it again.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I deserve it.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But Nan Gongxiao framed my three-way spirit.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
My master is in danger.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Please save him.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Please kill me.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't want to live even if my master dies.

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll kill you.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who will forgive you?

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who will forgive you?

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What are you trying to do?

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Say it.

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's all my fault.

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I've caused you a misunderstanding.

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I just hope that the truth is not too late.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's all because I wronged Nan Gongxiao.

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I made a big mistake.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I killed Luo Ying.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I killed Wu.

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Great.

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Great.

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's the use?

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's the use?

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,200
I really didn't expect that this half was really my destiny

82
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,120
I need to let Yuxi know

83
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
I am also ready

84
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,280
If you need help

85
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,300
that

86
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,140
I can godsend

87
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,540
as

88
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
I planned

89
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,940
No

90
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,540
I am still correct

91
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,900
I really feeS you

92
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,200
Wh instead of

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Where will you be?

98
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,200
The wind and the flowers are rubbing against the clouds.

99
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm afraid that the trail of the snow is not clear.

100
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm afraid that your loneliness will go to the sky.

101
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I can only put it in your dream.

102
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,200
You and I look at the Milky Way.

103
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
We are so close.

104
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,200
If I can give you a beautiful meaning in my life.

105
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,200
The power of love is so strong.

106
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
The Milky Way is so powerful.

107
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm waiting for your memory.

108
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,200
You and I look at the Milky Way.

109
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
We are so close.

110
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,200
If I can give you a beautiful meaning in my life.

The power of love is so strong.

112
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
The Milky Way is so powerful.

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,200
I'm waiting for your memory.
