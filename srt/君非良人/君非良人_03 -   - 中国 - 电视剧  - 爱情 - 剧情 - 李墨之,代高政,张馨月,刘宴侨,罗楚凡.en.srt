00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,712
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,830
Ye Nanzhao, you...

4
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,670
I'm your stepmother.

5
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,310
I was just being polite out of courtesy.

6
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,950
Yet you made up a story
to get close to me.

7
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,870
Have you no sense
of decorum or propriety?

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,630
Second Madam, you are right to scold me.

9
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,110
I overstepped.

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,910
It won't happen again.

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,630
(Lin Chishu)

12
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,719
(After everything... You still have the nerve
to use Nannan to threaten me.)

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,270
(I'll make sure
you lose everything you care about.)

14
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,750
Bai Shuangshuang,

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,950
what did a poor scholar do
to provoke you?

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,040
My matters have nothing
to do with you, Young Master.

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,510
What's this?

18
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,870
Bai Shuangshuang,

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,030
even you think
you can kill like others do?

20
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,599
Let me tell you,

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,550
I came back this time because of you.

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,190
Don't get yourself killed.

23
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,519
Even if you die,
it'll only be by my hand.

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,550
Understand?

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,310
Wait.

26
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,670
What do I still owe you?

27
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,750
Whatever I owe you,

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,990
I'll pay it back.

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,710
Pay it back?

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,230
All right.

31
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,790
Then start by returning these.

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,950
Fine.

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,990
I'll return them.

34
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,110
I'll give it all back to you today.

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,879
Don't think that by acting pitiful

36
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,150
I'll let you off.

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,070
I don't expect you to.

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,510
I just believe

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,679
a person should pay the price

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,750
for their mistakes.

41
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,590
Young Master.

42
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,559
We

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,710
should go.

44
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,230
A'wen.

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,510
Looks like we'll be returning
to the Lu Residence more often.

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,350
Things have gotten
a lot more interesting here.

47
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,830
(This Lu Zhuo is insane.)

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,470
(But staying in the Lu Residence
is the only way to get close to Lin Chishu.)

49
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,790
(Looks like I'll need
to speed things up.)

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,239
You wretched maid.

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,430
Are you blind?

52
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,359
You can't even hold a bowl
of bird's nest soup.

53
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,879
Let's see how Second Madam punishes you.

54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,119
I knows my mistake.

55
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,279
Please, Steward Li,
give me another chance.

56
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,510
I promise I'll be more careful.

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,199
Then I'll give you one more chance.

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,630
You carry the incense burner.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,350
With your bare hands.

60
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,199
Please spare me, Steward Li.

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,159
Pick up the coals.

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,310
What's going on?

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,479
Second Madam, Hong Dou spilled
your bird's nest soup again.

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,159
Second Madam,

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
I didn't do it on purpose.

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,350
Please spare me.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,239
It's just a bowl of bird's nest soup.
Is that necessary?

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,150
Second Madam, what's gotten into you?

69
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,639
In the past,

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,830
you used to enjoy watching me
discipline the maids.

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,999
Last time, you even said

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,359
if it happened again,

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,750
she should be flogged
a hundred times until death.

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,479
You were being merciful last time.

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,839
You only pulled her fingernails out.

76
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,790
That's why she didn't learn her lesson.

77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,719
This time,

78
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,079
you mustn't go easy on her again.

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,079
Second Madam,
it was Steward Li who bumped into me.

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,990
That's why...

81
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,710
Still making excuses?

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,079
This slap

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,039
was from me as the kitchen steward

84
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,239
on behalf of Second Madam.

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,359
As for the second slap

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,190
from me...

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,950
Steward Li,

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,110
lately I've come
to understand something.

89
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,759
As a servant, if one keeps
making mistakes, and never learns,

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,879
ultimately,

91
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,910
it's the fault of poor supervision.

92
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,150
A hundred floggings are due,

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,870
but we'll start with you.

94
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,790
Second Madam...

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,510
Second Madam...

96
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,710
I can't survive a hundred floggings!

97
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,950
Second Madam,

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,119
I'll make sure
to discipline them strictly from now on.

99
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,739
Please give me another chance.

100
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,219
I won't make things difficult for you.

101
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,840
Clean up the heater properly,
and we'll put this matter to rest.

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,590
Didn't you just say

103
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,670
with your hands?

104
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,950
Come with me.

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,839
Second Madam.

106
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,990
I was wrong.

107
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,470
Please forgive me.

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,670
Get up first.

109
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,799
Stand up.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,830
No need to kneel.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,590
Have your fingernails healed?

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,350
I just happen to have
a special remedy for burns.

113
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,190
You need to...

114
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,199
You're not Second Madam.

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,559
Who are you really?

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,839
I know her too well.

117
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,790
She'd never save me.

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,439
Don't...

119
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,510
Don't come near me.

120
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,759
Haven't you been by my side all along?

121
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,190
How do you not recognise me?

122
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,879
You're right.

123
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,470
I'm not Bai Shuangshuang.

124
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,910
But I look exactly like her.

125
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,950
You say you know her well,

126
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,470
if you're willing to help me,

127
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,390
then I can become Bai Shuangshuang.

128
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,990
In the Lu Residence,

129
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,759
with her identity,

130
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,310
I can help you escape this misery.

131
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,350
I'll keep my word.

132
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,390
I'm willing.

133
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,390
Good.

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,790
Then I'll tell you everything about me.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,510
But before that,

136
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,270
you need to tell me

137
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,510
everything you know about

138
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,150
the Lu Residence.

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,910
That's Lu Songyan,
head of the Lu family.

140
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,670
And the First Madam, Yan Tinglan.

141
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,679
Master Lu has tuberculosis.

142
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,279
His health has long deteriorated.

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,950
But he's still the most powerful voice
in the Lu household.

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,439
He neglects the First Madam and lavishes
all his affection on Bai Shuangshuang.

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,879
Mm.

146
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,839
That's right. Master Lu dotes solely
on Second Madam Bai Shuangshuang.

147
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,919
That is, on you.

148
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,039
As long as you keep him happy

149
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,519
and say kind words to him,

150
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,199
his favour will be your
greatest shield in this house.

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,230
No wonder

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,430
Master Lu sided with me today.

153
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,750
With such a foolish father,

154
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,430
I imagine his relationships
with his children

155
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,710
must be poor.

156
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,239
Just as you guessed.

157
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,839
The Lu family's eldest son, Lu Zhuo,

158
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,479
and the eldest daughter, Lu Wenyin,

159
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,310
are both on bad terms with him.

160
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,159
Lu Zhuo and Lu Wenyin are full siblings?

161
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,430
Born of different mothers.

162
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,159
The Young Master's mother

163
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,079
was the former First Madam
of the Lu Residence.

164
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,199
After she passed away,

165
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,310
Master Lu officially married
the current one.

166
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,719
That was likely

167
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,230
the beginning of the rift
between father and son.

168
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,119
The Young Master holds a grudge
against the Lu family.

169
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,679
But the reason stems from you,

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,190
that is, Bai Shuangshuang.

171
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,559
Three years ago,

172
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,359
Bai Shuangshuang complained
to Master Lu,

173
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,199
saying the Young Master tried to
force himself on her out of lust.

174
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,040
Master Lu was furious.

175
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,900
He expelled the Young Master
from the Lu Residence.

176
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,919
But I know

177
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,759
that wasn't the truth.

178
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,270
Bai Shuangshuang
saw Master Lu's health declining

179
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,319
and tried to seduce the Young Master,
to keep him as her backup plan.

180
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,759
The Young Master refused her.

181
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,559
So Bai Shuangshuang
framed him instead.

182
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,079
Where did Lu Zhuo go after that?

183
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,390
Qinglong Society.

184
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,759
No one knows
what the Young Master went through

185
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,639
after leaving the Lu family.

186
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,479
The next time we heard of him,

187
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,870
he was already Second-in-Command
of the Qinglong Society.

188
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,519
No wonder he keeps targeting me.

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,159
Madam,

190
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,959
if you're not Bai Shuangshuang,

191
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,439
why are you staying

192
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,950
in the Lu Residence?

193
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,510
It's because of the Lu family's
future son-in-law,

194
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,230
Lin Chishu.

195
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,470
Chishu.

196
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,870
Why did you stop?

197
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,950
I ran into an old acquaintance today.

198
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,630
I'm thinking of what gift to give her.

199
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,230
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,799
Shall we

201
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,110
leave it for next time?

202
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,190
It's all right.

203
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,030
Then let's change to another poem.

204
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,350
All right.

205
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,830
Let's go with one I wrote last year.

206
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,710
The girls at school

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,630
especially liked this one.

208
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,950
I am a little river.

209
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,150
Unintentionally, I flowed past you.

210
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,710
Without meaning to,

211
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,430
I captured your rosy reflection

212
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,310
and carried it along
with my gentle waves.

213
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,590
Is Master Lu all right?

214
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,470
Shall we call the physician?

215
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,590
Master.

216
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,199
You all go on and eat.

217
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,039
Eat up.

218
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,239
Here.

219
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,559
Eat.

220
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,350
Go ahead.

221
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,510
Father.

222
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,999
I made a special trip to Fushou Temple
to request this vegetarian meal.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,110
Just a little token.

224
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,720
Wishing you good health, Father.

225
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,500
And longevity as great
as the southern mountains.

226
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,199
Chishu.

227
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,919
At least you're thoughtful.

228
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,590
Ah.

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,359
Sit and eat.

230
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,999
Shumai.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,679
Aiya, very good.

232
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,279
Hurry up.

233
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,039
Come, come.

234
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,279
You all have a taste.

235
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,719
Yes.

236
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,559
You try some too.

237
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,470
Shuangshuang.

238
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,999
Here, I will pick the first one for you.

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,190
Thank you, Master.

240
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,190
Go on, eat.

241
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,870
You all eat too.

242
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,630
Come, have some more.

243
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,550
This one's shrimp filling.

244
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,950
I heard from Wenyin

245
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,630
that Second Madam loves shrimp the most.

246
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,599
Mother,

247
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,030
have some shrimp.

248
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,679
Good girl, Nannan.

249
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,990
Mother can't eat shrimp.

250
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,159
Nannan,
your mother's allergic to shrimp.

251
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,639
What if Mother accidentally eats shrimp?

252
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,999
She'll get all itchy.

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,070
If she doesn't take medicine
within a minute,

254
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,839
she won't be able to breathe.

255
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,950
It's very dangerous.

256
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,430
Second Madam,

257
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,270
the Taoist priest said

258
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,639
this blessing meal

259
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,559
must be shared among the whole family.

260
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,990
The more people who eat it,

261
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,350
the more luck it brings
to the host family.

262
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,030
That's true.

263
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,039
This vegetarian meal

264
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,670
was specially requested for Master.

265
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,559
If it's disrupted in any way,

266
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,950
that would be a grave offense.

267
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,519
I've seen you eat plenty
of shrimp dishes before.

268
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,359
But today,

269
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,239
when it's a blessing for Father,

270
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,999
you're suddenly making excuses,

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,550
pretending and putting on a show.

272
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,399
If you ask me,

273
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,150
you don't want Father
to get better at all.

274
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,519
All of you,

275
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,310
say no more.

276
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,190
Shuangshuang,

277
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,870
eat it.

278
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,550
All right.
