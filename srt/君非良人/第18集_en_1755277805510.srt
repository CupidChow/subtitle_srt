00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,712
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,650
Well,

4
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,110
I've learned photography.

5
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,079
A wedding photo

6
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,719
makes the best wedding gift.

7
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,999
It's my first time seeing

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,270
someone give a wedding photo as a gift.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,910
Your gift is certainly interesting.

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,239
Jinxing.

11
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,439
You have no idea

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,910
how much I love taking photos.

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,159
In one's life,

14
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,110
happy moments are short.

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,430
And photography

16
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,550
is the only way to capture them.

17
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,079
I once took a photo

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,550
with the one I loved most.

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,670
Miss Ye,

20
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,110
what do you think?

21
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,630
Thank you for the kind thought.

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,470
Let's get started.

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,390
No rush.

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,590
Since it's a wedding photo,

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,230
it's improper to do
without a wedding gown.

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,310
That won't do.

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,319
As it happens,

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,030
our new wedding gown has arrived.

29
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,710
We can shoot with it.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,950
Zhuo.

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,990
What do you think?

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,919
Of course.

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,790
Miss Ye will look even more beautiful

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,190
in a wedding gown.

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,070
Next time we take photos,

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,830
put on a wedding gown, okay?

37
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,630
Ready?

38
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,990
Wait.

39
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,630
Can we start now?

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,030
When the photo is developed,

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,479
I'll have it framed and sent to you.

42
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,870
How thoughtful of you.

43
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,230
Well,

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,030
I'll definitely hang this photo
by our bed.

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,799
That's

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,910
even better.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,670
Congratulations to you both.

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,630
A'wen.

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,110
Let's go.

50
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,190
Governor Yan.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,110
We've found the one
you asked us to investigate.

52
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,230
You mean

53
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,030
she's left the country?

54
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,630
She left three months ago.

55
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,339
It was arranged by Tie Shanhu
before he died.

56
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,710
Lu Zhuo never married her.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,230
Then who exactly did Lu Zhuo marry?

58
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,719
Some say

59
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,550
he married someone who has passed away.

60
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,390
So he really hasn't
forgotten Ye Nanzhao.

61
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,310
If he can't let go,

62
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,390
then I'll help them with it.

63
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,950
Miss Ye.

64
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,519
These are congratulatory letters
for your marriage with the governor.

65
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,074
(To my husband, Lu Zhuo.
From your wife, Yanni)

66
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:30,799
(Congratulations on your marriage)

67
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,287
(To my husband, Lu Zhuo.
From your wife, Yanni)

68
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,230
(Yanni)
Slip this in and deliver it to Madam.

69
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,759
(To my husband, Lu Zhuo.
From your wife, Yanni)

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,990
Not this one.

71
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,359
Take it to Young Master Lu.

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,039
Sorry, Miss Ye. I'll see to it now.

73
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,910
Mm.

74
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,070
(Happiness)
Is this good?

75
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,110
A little lower.

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,150
Is that fine?

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,070
Why are you here?

78
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,270
To bring you the photo.

79
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,350
Didn't Yan Jinxing say

80
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,110
that once the photo's developed,

81
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,870
he'll hang it by the bed?

82
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,390
Well?

83
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,910
Do you like it?

84
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,110
Lu Zhuo, don't go too far.

85
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,150
Why did you say so?

86
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,910
I'm here to deliver the photo.
I never said whose photo it was.

87
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,310
Ye Nanzhao.

88
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,190
Take a good look at this photo.

89
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,590
Are you really this heartless?

90
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,830
Have you forgotten everything?

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,990
You can lie to people,

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,190
but not to your heart.

93
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,870
I can forget it.

94
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,310
I don't believe you don't remember
what we've had together.

95
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,470
I'll make you remember now.

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,630
Well?

97
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,110
Do you remember now?

98
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,310
I do.

99
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,750
I remember you've always
been this excessive.

100
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,910
What are you doing?

101
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,719
This is my memory.

102
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,439
It's mine too.

103
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,759
I don't want it anymore.

104
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,590
Besides,

105
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,830
I only love my fiancÃ© now.

106
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,870
Ye Nanzhao.

107
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,150
Ye Nanzhao, what are you doing?

108
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,599
Lu Zhuo,

109
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,590
our encounter was a mistake
from the start.

110
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,630
I used a borrowed identity to
exchange for our wrong encounter.

111
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,959
Now that fate is over,

112
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,359
our story ends here.

113
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,710
We should accept it.

114
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,790
You destroyed the photo. That's nothing.

115
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,870
If you truly don't love me,

116
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,110
go ahead.

117
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,550
Kill me.

118
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,510
Come on.

119
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,470
Here.

120
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,190
Do it!

121
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,150
Lu Zhuo.

122
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,910
We're over.

123
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,190
Just think of it as me killing you.

124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,790
Ye Nanzhao.

125
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,710
My love for you...

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,990
is over.

127
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,310
But my hatred for you...

128
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,870
has only just begun.

129
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,510
Young Lady.

130
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,190
Are you alright?

131
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,070
I'm fine.

132
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,830
Hong Dou.

133
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,999
Put it away for me.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,550
I don't want to see it again.

135
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,110
And this photo too.

136
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,079
Yes.

137
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,639
Burn it.

138
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,759
Don't let anyone see it.

139
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,430
Alright.

140
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,910
It's just a minor wound.

141
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,359
There's no need to bandage it.

142
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,790
A minor wound?

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,910
That's a wound to the heart.

144
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,540
Say that again
and I'll have to ask you to leave.

145
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,039
Young Master.

146
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,559
One more thing.

147
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,190
I think you should
explain everything to Miss Ye.

148
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,959
You even married her in a photo.

149
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,670
You're obviously sincere about her.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,990
Why not just say it?

151
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,319
I get it.

152
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,910
The scriptwriter won't allow it.

153
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,830
(It doesn't matter anymore.)

154
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,030
(She wants to get married.)

155
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,030
(She wants a happy life.)

156
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,710
(But now I hate her.)

157
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,110
(I only want her to be miserable.)

158
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,790
Everyone,

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,759
today

160
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,830
is Young Master Lu's welcome banquet.

161
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,719
I'd like to take this opportunity

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,510
to announce some good news.

163
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,590
The Cheng and Lu families

164
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,079
will join forces from now on

165
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,750
in Jiang City and Nan City.

166
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,559
Working with such a talented young man
as Young Master Lu,

167
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,839
we believe

168
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,559
the Cheng and Lu family businesses

169
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,750
will surely flourish.

170
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,350
Thank you
for your appreciation, Mr. Cheng.

171
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,110
It's my honor to be working

172
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,870
with the Cheng family.

173
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,470
You're too kind, Young Master Lu.

174
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,950
Let's drink
to the bond between our families.

175
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,140
Here, let's drink together.

176
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,719
Please, everyone, no need for formality.

177
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,830
Just relax.

178
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,079
Please enjoy yourself, Young Master Lu.
I'll excuse myself first.

179
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,950
Sure.

180
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,639
Jinxing.

181
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,150
Thank you for your hospitality.

182
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,750
This toast is to you.

183
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,470
Don't stand on ceremony, Zhuo.

184
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,670
Sorry.

185
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,990
My wine is finished.

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,399
Jinxing,

187
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,910
that's mine.

188
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,070
This toast

189
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,150
is from me and your cousin-in-law.

190
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,870
Jinxing,

191
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,350
I need you here.

192
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,030
I'll be right back.

193
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,910
Ye Nanzhao.

194
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,110
I'll be waiting for you
in the back garden.

195
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,230
If you're not there in ten minutes,

196
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,670
I can't promise what I'll do.

197
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,590
Perhaps

198
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,950
I'll kill your fiancÃ©.

199
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,630
It's up to you to decide.
