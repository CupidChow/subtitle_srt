=Episode 19=

3
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,470
What are you afraid of?

4
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,119
When you stabbed me,

5
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,070
you were just fearless.

6
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,999
Lu Zhuo.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,959
If you keep pestering me,

8
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,759
I'll call for help.

9
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,550
Go ahead.

10
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,350
That way, your fiancÃ© will find out

11
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,030
you're seducing another man.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,999
- You're humiliating me.
- Yes, I'm humiliating you.

13
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,639
I'm telling you, Ye Nanzhao.

14
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,710
I have plenty of ways
to get back at you.

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,230
Where is Miss Ye?

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,310
I'm not sure.

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,830
You may go.

18
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,470
Look into it.

19
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,359
I want to know if Ye Nanzhao

20
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,910
has actually been here.

21
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,910
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,630
Jinxing.

23
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,550
Have a drink.

24
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,850
I have something urgent to attend to.

25
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,310
What's so urgent about it?

26
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,999
I'm catching the cheater.

27
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,390
Jinxing.

28
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,790
I'll give you a hand.

29
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,430
The banquet isn't over yet,

30
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,310
but why did you get changed?

31
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,110
My outfit is now dirty.

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,910
Is that so?

33
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,590
Then why did you
change your earrings too?

34
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,710
Well...

35
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,879
This new outfit doesn't go well
with the previous earrings.

36
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,470
So I changed to another pair.

37
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,630
Oh.

38
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,070
I thought it went well with them.

39
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,950
Why don't you

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,150
show them to me?

41
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,190
Jinxing.

42
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,110
One of my earrings

43
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,950
is actually missing.

44
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,950
Is this it?

45
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,590
Nanzhao.

46
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,950
Why were you in the garden?

47
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,279
I wasn't there.

48
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,399
You were there to see Lu Zhuo,

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,150
weren't you?

50
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,879
What did you do?

51
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,270
I really wasn't in the garden.

52
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,550
If so,

53
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,550
why was your earring there?

54
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,590
Why are you lying to me?

55
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,159
Young Lady.

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,310
The earring has been found.

57
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,510
Hong Dou.

58
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,830
Where did you find it?

59
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,239
Under the dining table.

60
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,110
You probably dropped it
during the meal.

61
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,230
Jinxing.

62
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,839
The earring's been found.

63
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,030
That one you found isn't mine.

64
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,830
Nanzhao.

65
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,439
Looks like I misunderstood you.

66
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,150
How about this?

67
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,550
Go ahead and get some rest.

68
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,350
Since the banquet is almost over,

69
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,950
you may excuse yourself.

70
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,590
How did you find that earring?

71
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,510
This is bad!

72
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,550
Miss Ye.

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,359
Governor Yan said

74
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,470
you should stay in the room

75
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,470
and get some good rest.

76
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,399
Governor Yan.

77
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,279
May I have a word with this lady?

78
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,150
Go ahead.

79
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,110
Miss.

80
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,710
Is this earring yours?

81
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,390
Yes, it's mine.

82
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,870
Thank you, Governor Yan.

83
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,110
I found this earring

84
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,150
in the study.

85
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,430
May I ask,

86
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,190
have you been to the study?

87
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,310
I've only been to the garden.

88
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,070
But this should be mine.

89
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,559
Miss.

90
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,719
What's going on here?

91
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,710
It was Lu Zhuo.

92
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,150
Young Master Lu.

93
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,590
I did as you said.

94
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,630
My family's business in Jiang City...

95
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,030
As long as
the Qinglong Society is around,

96
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,670
your business will go well.

97
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,150
Thank you, Young Master Lu.

98
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,030
(Young Master Lu
has been protecting you in secret.)

99
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,159
Maybe

100
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,510
there's some misunderstanding
about his engagement.

101
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,510
Why don't you give it another try?

102
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,110
Hong Dou.

103
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,790
I've let it go.

104
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,670
If you've truly let it go,

105
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,120
why keep the hairpin he gave you
and even ask me to put it away for you?

106
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,479
You might as well throw it away.

107
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,510
Drop it, Hong Dou.

108
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,590
Tomorrow is Yan Jinxing's birthday.

109
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,550
Help me prepare a surprise for him.

110
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,670
Jinxing. Why are you here so early...

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,990
Jinxing?

112
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,270
You call his name
in such an affectionate manner.

113
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,910
Lu Zhuo.

114
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,199
This is the dining room.

115
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,230
It's a public place.

116
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,190
Mind your conduct.

117
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,630
Ye Nanzhao.

118
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,830
You've never called me
so affectionately.

119
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,359
Your name only has two characters.

120
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,630
How else should I call you?

121
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,390
Forget it.

122
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,870
You'd end up crying again.

123
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,110
These flowers

124
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,870
are my apology to you.

125
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,990
Jinxing.

126
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,830
Happy birthday.

127
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,950
Who are these roses for,

128
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,670
Zhuo?

129
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,910
Jinxing.

130
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,270
It's your birthday today.

131
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,710
Of course they're for you.

132
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,359
You're giving me roses on my birthday?

133
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,680
Do you find that inappropriate?

134
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,950
Sorry. I don't know much about flowers.

135
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,710
I only like roses.

136
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,470
Jinxing.

137
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,830
Let's eat now.

138
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,470
I made all of these for you.
We should eat them before they get cold.

139
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,670
Sure.

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,990
Zhuo.

141
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,559
I won't keep you today.

142
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,390
Your cousin-in-law
made a special meal for my birthday.

143
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,590
I don't want you here.

144
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,430
It's fine.

145
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,790
My cousin-in-law and I

146
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,710
have a long journey ahead.

147
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,510
I'll leave you two to it.

148
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,470
Young Master.

149
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,839
Why are you so angry today?

150
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,110
Weren't you delivering flowers?
Miss Ye didn't like them?

151
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,350
By the way, Young Master, Miss Ye has never
celebrated your birthday, no?

152
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,110
Yang A'wen.

153
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,470
Can you shut up?

154
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,870
What I'm trying to say

155
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,999
is, if it doesn't work out,

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,839
just let it go.

157
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,510
Both of them have been
childhood sweethearts since young.

158
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,390
Jinxing.

159
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,750
Happy birthday.

160
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,319
I have some work to attend to,

161
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,190
so I'll be going.

162
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,110
Jinxing.

163
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,110
I've got you a gift.

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,670
Hong Dou.

165
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:21,875
(Happy Birthday)

166
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,470
Happy birthday.

167
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,070
Make a wish.

168
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,110
(I wish that
if Ye Nanzhao is lying to me,)

169
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,030
(no matter the reason,)

170
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,150
(may she die a horrible death.)

171
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:58,400
(Happy Birthday)

172
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,070
What wish did you make?

173
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,710
If I say it, it won't come true.

174
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,870
By the way, Nanzhao,

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,430
the new socialite Mr. Jia from Nan City
is hosting a charity auction tomorrow.

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,150
All guests need
to bring something for auction.

177
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,119
All proceeds will go to the military.

178
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,270
You should come with me.

179
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,159
But

180
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,070
I don't have anything valuable.

181
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,030
I remember

182
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,110
you used to wear a rose hairpin.

183
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,830
You haven't been using it lately.

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,030
Since you've grown tired of it,
why don't you just auction it?

185
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,350
Are you alright, Young Lady?

186
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,310
Hong Dou.

187
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,719
Put this hairpin away.

188
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,830
I don't want to see it again.

189
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,070
And this painting too.

190
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,070
Yes.

191
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,319
Put it away.

192
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,510
Don't let anyone see it.

193
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,919
However,

194
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,870
that hairpin is too plain.

195
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,470
It's not worth much.

196
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,910
You're my wife.

197
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,270
Nothing of yours is ordinary.

198
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,710
Or was it

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,950
from someone that's important to you?

200
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,310
No.

201
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,590
That's not the case.

202
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,510
If you think that'll work,

203
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,790
then let's auction it.
