(Jiang City Hospital)

4
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,730
Hong Dou.

5
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,390
I have something to ask you.

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,550
How are your eyes?

7
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,150
Nanzhao.

8
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,630
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,110
I still can't see.

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,430
It's okay.

11
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,719
Miss Ye.

12
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,999
If there's nothing else,

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,639
Hong Dou and I will just

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,630
leave.

15
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,190
You're not allowed to go.

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,279
All of you stay.

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,359
Especially you, A'wen.

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,399
You're very useful.

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,119
Me?

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,639
What use could I possibly be?

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,679
Exactly.

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,950
What use could he be?

23
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,199
Recently,

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,550
I found a very experienced
traditional Chinese medicine doctor.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,310
I consulted him about

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,550
an acupuncture point
that's good for the eyes.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,550
You saw that?

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,590
Nanzhao,

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,670
I still can't see.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,959
Maybe this method

31
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,070
doesn't work for me.

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,270
It's okay.

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,750
I have other ways.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,710
Young Master.

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,399
The doctor said

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,160
if you're on medication,
you can't do acupuncture.

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,150
A'wen.

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,879
As long as I can regain my eyesight,

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,279
I'll try anything Nanzhao suggests,

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,070
I'm willing to try it all.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,230
It's just

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,190
I'm afraid if I still can't see,

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,639
Nanzhao will be sad.

44
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,710
As long as your eyes can recover,

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,790
I won't be sad.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,430
Let me ask you again.

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,030
Can you really not see?

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,479
In front of my eyes,

49
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,990
there are some shadows of light,

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,750
but I still can't see.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,390
Let's proceed with the acupuncture.

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,959
A'wen,

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,039
if your boss can't handle the pain,

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,110
you better hold him down.

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,230
Young Master.

56
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,587
(Quiet Please)

57
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,479
What's that noise?

58
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,790
What's going on?

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,120
Why are you yelling
when I'm needling him?

60
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,230
Well?

61
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,590
Did it work?

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,790
I really do hope you recover soon.

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,559
Ever since your eye problem,

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,559
I've been so worried
about you every day.

65
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,030
I feel really guilty.

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,199
If you have
any honest feelings right now,

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,999
I hope you'll tell me the truth.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,230
I hope we can be honest with each other.

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,390
Nanzhao.

70
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,150
I still can't see anything.

71
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,679
But the doctor also said

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,270
it takes time to recover.

73
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,270
Maybe it'll get better in a while.

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,319
Fine.

75
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,119
Since Young Master Lu won't be honest,

76
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,710
then I have no reason to stay.

77
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,439
Hong Dou, let's go.
We're leaving Jiang City tonight.

78
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,590
Nanzhao.

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,950
Nanzhao, don't go.

80
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,710
Now you're willing to see?

81
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,750
I can see.

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,310
Ah!

83
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,470
You...

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,750
You actually cured Young Master
with acupuncture?

85
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,719
You...

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,470
You're amazing!

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,399
Alright, A'wen.

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,319
Let's go.

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,630
Okay.

90
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,750
So you could see all along.

91
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,519
Not all along.

92
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,950
You still lied to me?

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,710
Is it that hard
to just tell me the truth?

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,950
Nanzhao,

95
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,950
I just didn't want you to leave me.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,390
Still making excuses?

97
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,430
Lu Zhuo.

98
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,830
You know my past,

99
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,070
what I fear most is being lied to.

100
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,590
Nanzhao.

101
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,510
Come on, let's get the medicine.

102
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,830
Nanzhao.

103
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,230
Can you come out first?

104
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,679
Let me explain to you.

105
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,630
I didn't mean to lie to you.

106
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,550
Nanzhao, you know

107
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,159
ever since I realized
you weren't Bai Shuangshuang,

108
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,239
I've regretted every day

109
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,510
all the times I hurt you before.

110
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,190
You're resilient and kind.

111
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,590
You'd rather hurt yourself
than drag others down with you.

112
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,670
You have so many beautiful qualities,

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,430
so many that I unknowingly
fell in love with you,

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,830
so deeply in love I can't help myself.

115
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,359
Please forgive me, Nanzhao.

116
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,270
I really don't want to lose you.

117
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,630
Nanzhao.

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,879
Young Master Lu.

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,879
Miss said

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,519
she doesn't want to see you right now.

121
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,639
She asked you not to knock,

122
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,590
and not to disturb other patients.

123
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,830
Miss,

124
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,999
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,830
I shouldn't have agreed
to lie to you with them.

126
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,239
From the beginning,

127
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,359
I knew this was wrong,

128
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,399
but Young Master Lu treats you so well,
I've always seen it in his eyes.

129
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,030
I truly hoped you'd give him a chance.

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,159
Hong Dou,

131
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,790
I understand how you feel.

132
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,350
I won't blame you.

133
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,319
What about him?

134
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,190
Will you forgive the Young Master?

135
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,310
Actually, I'm not angry anymore.

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,719
I understand he used this desperate move

137
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,390
because he feared I'd leave.

138
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,790
But Hong Dou,

139
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,830
I have to teach him a lesson

140
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,510
to make him understand

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,350
that he can't use lies
to achieve anything in a relationship.

142
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,759
Young Master.

143
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,710
I...

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,350
Mother, just let me die!

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,599
Just let me die!

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,879
Wenyin.

147
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,590
Miss.

148
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,079
Wenyin!

149
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,199
Leave me alone!

150
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,550
Calm down a bit!

151
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,679
Listen to me.

152
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,359
This isn't over yet,

153
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,350
our reinforcements are almost here.

154
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,559
Once we have his backing,

155
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,679
Lu Zhuo

156
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,199
and Ye Nanzhao

157
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,079
will be

158
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,950
nothing.

159
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:19,125
(Yan Jinxing,
Governor General of Nan City)

160
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,070
What pleasant breeze

161
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,230
brings Governor Yan
to the Qinglong Society?

162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,590
I came to Jiang City looking
for a woman.

163
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,599
I was worried if I made too much noise,

164
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,190
it would disturb Lord Tiger's peace.

165
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,270
So I came to apologize in advance.

166
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,439
To avoid being called

167
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,750
disrespectful of etiquette.

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,630
You're too polite, Governor.

169
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,350
Though Qinglong Society
holds some sway in Jiang City,

170
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,319
I, Tie Shanhu,

171
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,110
always speak plainly.

172
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,519
I sincerely hope

173
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,919
that the Yan and Tie families

174
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,199
can coexist peacefully.

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,479
Lord Tiger, your magnanimity

176
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,999
has always impressed me.

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,519
Since you also favor peace,

178
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,150
then that's best.

179
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,719
I heard the person I'm looking for

180
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,430
has been with your Second-in-Command.

181
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,390
Lord Tiger, do you know

182
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,710
where she is now?

183
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,470
Where is Ye Nanzhao?

184
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,039
Sir.

185
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,479
Who?

186
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,639
Can't you understand me?
I asked you where Ye Nanzhao is?

187
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,270
I... I'll check right away.

188
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,950
She's in Ward 5.

189
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,110
Let's go!

190
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:46,999
(Ward 5)

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,039
Wait!

192
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,239
Gentlemen, please do me a favor.

193
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,999
Try not to disturb the other patients.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,150
Get lost!

195
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,639
Where did all these soldiers come from?

196
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,039
Isn't that Yan Jinxing from
the Yan family here in Jiang City?

197
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,710
I heard he's looking for someone.

198
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,470
Young Master,

199
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,950
could he be here to help Lu Wenyin?

200
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,399
A'wen,

201
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,070
turn around and head
to the hospital, now.

202
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,830
Hurry, go!

203
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,439
You guys!

204
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,630
Go check over there!

205
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,390
What's your name?

206
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,279
Stop searching!

207
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,119
Yell again and I'll shoot you.
What's your name?

208
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,759
Faster!

209
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,030
Yes, Second-in-Command.
