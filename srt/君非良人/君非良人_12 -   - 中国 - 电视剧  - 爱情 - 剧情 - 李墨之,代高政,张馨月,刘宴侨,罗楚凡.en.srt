3
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,860
Doctor,

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,119
someone's after me!

5
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,870
Help me!

6
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,959
Keep up!

7
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,839
She must be inside.

8
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,070
We can't let her get away!

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,230
She's not in this room.
Let's check upstairs.

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,390
You can come out.

11
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,630
They're gone.

12
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,959
Thank you.

13
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,159
I owe you one.

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,990
You haven't changed a bit.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,350
Ye Nanzhao.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,679
When I first heard your name,

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,950
I thought it was just a coincidence.
I didn't expect it to actually be you.

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,870
Don't you remember me?

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,190
Guess I've changed a lot.

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,479
Or are you just pretending

21
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,990
you don't know me?

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,590
Did you hurt yourself, Nanzhao?

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,070
Let me rub it for you.

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,390
Come here.

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,710
Thank you, Young Master Yan.

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,199
Are...

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,510
Are you

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,190
Young Master Yan?

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,550
You finally remembered.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,230
I always wondered,

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,870
if fate gave us a second chance to meet,

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,750
could we go back to how things were
when we were young?

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,670
(Nanzhao,)

34
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,199
(I promise)

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,950
(I'll marry you when we grow up.)

36
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,159
(Okay.)

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,879
(Let's grow up fast then.)

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,750
(Mm.)

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,750
(Let's grow up together.)

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,879
Director Wu said

41
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,030
an important guest was at the hospital.

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,070
So it's you, Governor Yan.

43
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,310
It's been a long time,

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,510
cousin.

45
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,190
Given that we're distant relatives
with no blood relation,

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,150
there's no need to act like family.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,479
Lu Zhuo,

48
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,310
calm down.

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,750
Young Master Yan,

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,390
since we know each other,

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,590
there's no need for this.

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,750
You're right.

53
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,479
We're family after all.

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,110
No need to take it this far.

55
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,590
I bet you're not even close to her,

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,270
cousin.

57
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,110
Why did you hold me back?

58
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,270
Let's go.

59
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,590
What's your relationship with him?

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,990
He's just someone I used to know.

61
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,990
Jinxing didn't bring that woman here?

62
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,030
Why not?

63
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,879
Miss Lu,

64
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,710
I...

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,390
I don't know.

66
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,679
I just overheard

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,910
First Madam talking
to someone Governor Yan sent.

68
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,119
It sounded like...

69
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,910
like...

70
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,319
like

71
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,710
Governor Yan used to know Second Madam.

72
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,239
Jinxing!

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,079
You can't go in.

74
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,990
Move aside!

75
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,239
Inform the Lu family's First Madam
that Wenyin needs her medicine.

76
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,990
Yes, sir.

77
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,270
Where's Ye Nanzhao?

78
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,550
Where is she?

79
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,190
I want her dead!

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,679
Wenyin,

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,150
concentrate on getting better.

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,679
I'll handle this.

83
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,399
But you promised me.

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,910
You promised.

85
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,550
You said you'd help me get rid of her.

86
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,310
Don't tell me you've fallen for her?

87
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,510
Why?

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,990
Why is it that all of you
are so smitten with her?

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,030
She's a wicked woman!

90
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,950
She climbs her way up
over others' corpses!

91
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,710
First

92
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,550
it was my Chishu,

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,150
then my father,

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,230
and next...

95
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,559
next it will be you!

96
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,279
Or me...

97
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,350
Wenyin,

98
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,519
you're not well.

99
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,950
I'm not sick!

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,559
You are!

101
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,670
All of you are!

102
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,550
Jinxing,

103
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,430
I just want to end it all.

104
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,990
I don't know what I did wrong.

105
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,039
Chishu loved me,

106
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,359
I know that.

107
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,279
I don't get

108
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,910
why this is happening...

109
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,990
Are you going to help me?

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,950
If you have the guts
to pull the trigger today,

111
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,430
I'll avenge you.

112
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,670
Wenyin...

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,750
Miss Lu.

114
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,159
Miss Lu.

115
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,710
Get Miss Lu home quickly.

116
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,519
Come.

117
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,430
Miss Lu,

118
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,590
slow down.

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,870
Jinxing,

120
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,599
I'm begging you.

121
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,350
Help Wenyin, please.

122
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,550
When your mother was gravely ill,

123
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,630
I watched over her day and night
for more than half a year.

124
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,270
I even took care of her funeral.

125
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,550
I'm only asking

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,999
for this.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,639
I only hope, for our sake,

128
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,990
you'll help Wenyin.

129
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,790
Help me.

130
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,750
Aunt,

131
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,670
I promise

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,470
I'll take Ye Nanzhao far away
from Nan City.

133
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,159
I guarantee

134
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,590
she'll never cross paths
with Wenyin again.

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,359
Lu Zhuo,

136
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,150
why'd you bring me here?

137
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,879
Why was Yan Jinxing trying to arrest me?

138
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,079
Do you know what's going on?

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,430
We'll talk about that later.

140
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,439
Yan Jinxing's a threat to me.

141
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,039
I figured out
how to settle this for good.

142
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,999
Young Master.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,070
Father.

144
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,999
I want to get married.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,070
Married?

146
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,870
Lu Zhuo, have you lost your mind?

147
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,630
Father,

148
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,150
please hurry up.

149
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,279
Sir,

150
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,279
do you take

151
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,519
this kind and beautiful woman
to be your wife,

152
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,399
in good times and bad,

153
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,679
for richer or poorer?

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,830
I do.

155
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,159
Miss,

156
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,950
do you take this gentleman
to be your husband?

157
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,830
I don't.

158
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,799
I won't let you turn me down.

159
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,430
Unless you honestly don't feel the same.

160
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,070
You can fake it,

161
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,150
but your heart won't.

162
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,070
Did you know?

163
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,119
When you kiss someone you love,

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,430
your heart beats faster.

165
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,830
You lost.

166
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,710
You do like me.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,150
Yes.

168
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,270
I do like you.

169
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,790
Sorry,

170
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,110
Lu Zhuo.

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,990
I just can't believe
in marriage anymore.

172
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,710
You still don't believe me, do you?

173
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,679
If I gave you my life,

174
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,110
would you believe me then?

175
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,950
I'll prove it to you right now.
