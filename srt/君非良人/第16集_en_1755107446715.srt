3
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,940
Will you marry me?

4
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,990
Hong Dou!

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,479
Come on! We'll take my car!

6
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,390
A'Wen?

7
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,359
Lu Zhuo, untie me!

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,199
You're hurting me.

9
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,070
Is that so?

10
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,270
That's how I feel every day,

11
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,270
like I'm constricted
by a thousand ropes.

12
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,990
Whenever I think about you
dying because of me,

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,359
those ropes just tighten even more.

14
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,670
Tighter and tighter, with no end.

15
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,110
It feels like
they're cutting into my insides,

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,230
crushing me so I can't even breathe.

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,710
Let me go.

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,230
I don't owe you anything.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,670
You don't.

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,590
You owe Yan Jinxing, don't you?

21
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,510
That's right.

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,990
I owe him.

23
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,870
That's why I'm going to marry him.

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,510
Besides,

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,270
you owe me.

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,630
Fine.

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,510
Then I'll pay you back right now.

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,270
(Ye Nanzhao,)

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,439
(you said)

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,150
(you couldn't believe
in marriage anymore.)

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,470
(So why would you marry Yan Jinxing?)

32
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,430
Bite harder.

33
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,030
You can do better than that.

34
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,239
Lu Zhuo, you're married!

35
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,630
I'm about to be too!

36
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,310
We can't betray our partners.

37
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,270
Ye Nanzhao,

38
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,390
is this your first day knowing me?

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,470
I've always been stubborn.

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,270
I'm not a good person.

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,710
Lu Zhuo,

42
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,590
let me go.

43
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,590
We already missed our chance.

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,190
I don't think so.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,190
You're married.

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,199
So am I.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,039
We make

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,630
the perfect partners in crime,

49
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,630
don't we?

50
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,310
What are you trying to do?

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,439
Lu Zhuo, have you lost it?

52
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,710
I have.

53
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,599
Governor Yan,

54
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,910
we still haven't found her.

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,039
We've checked

56
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,559
all the outsiders, just as you ordered.

57
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,470
There are a few from Jiang City.

58
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,610
A few days ago, some folks from the Jiang City
Chamber of Commerce came to Nan City.

59
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,679
Other than that,

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,910
nothing unusual.

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,910
Where are they?

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,879
Get the car ready.

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,750
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,750
Ye Nanzhao,

65
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,590
I spoiled you.

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,390
From now on,

67
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,479
I don't care about your feelings.

68
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,830
I'll do whatever

69
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,510
I want to do.

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,159
Right now,

71
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,630
I want to love you.

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,110
Lu Zhuo, don't do this!

73
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,079
Do you feel the same

74
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,430
when you kiss Yan Jinxing?

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,710
What's wrong with you?

76
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,279
You want to hit me?

77
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,150
Go ahead.

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,030
I'll untie you

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,470
so you can hit me properly.

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,670
Come on. Keep going.

81
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,630
Done?

82
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,279
Now

83
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,910
it's my turn.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,870
Governor Yan,

85
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,110
what are you doing here?

86
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,879
I know Lu Zhuo is in Nan City.

87
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,470
Tell him to come out.

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,919
Governor Yan, today really isn't a good time.

89
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,350
The young master's busy.

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,550
Please leave.

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,590
No...

92
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,550
What are you doing in Nan City?

93
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,750
I don't recall

94
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,790
having to report to you.

95
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,110
Who do you have back there?

96
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,310
What's it to you?

97
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,390
Curious,

98
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,710
cousin?

99
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,950
Governor Yan!

100
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,439
You like spying

101
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,310
on guys when they bathe or something?

102
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,119
You're quite the player,

103
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,070
cousin.

104
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,879
Lu Zhuo,

105
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,199
let me go.

106
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,479
If you were going to leave,

107
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,670
why didn't you go
with Yan Jinxing just now?

108
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,759
I didn't want him to see me like this.

109
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,870
Ye Nanzhao,

110
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,679
have you really fallen for Yan Jinxing?

111
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,999
I'm his fiancÃ©e.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,870
What do you think?

113
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,230
Young Master!

114
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,910
Young Master.

115
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,150
We need to speak with you.

116
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,510
Ye Nanzhao,

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,070
I'm telling you,

118
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,590
as long as I live,

119
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,790
I'll never let you marry Yan Jinxing.

120
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,310
A whole night without a single update.

121
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,639
What are you people even doing?

122
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,759
Keep looking for her!

123
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,470
I'm sorry, Governor Yan.
We'll find Miss Ye as soon as possible.

124
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,230
Governor Yan,

125
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,430
Miss Ye is back.

126
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,710
Nanzhao,

127
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,159
where did you go?

128
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,430
I was so worried about you.

129
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,559
I got hurt last night by accident

130
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,230
and passed out while getting an IV.

131
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,950
I only woke up this morning.

132
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,719
I'm sorry

133
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,990
for worrying you.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,070
Where's Hong Dou?

135
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,550
Wasn't she with you?

136
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,670
She went to Jiang City
to pick something up for me.

137
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,190
She'll be back tonight.

138
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,510
I'm just glad you're back.

139
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,719
I thought

140
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,230
you'd left me behind.

141
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,950
I'm in your debt.

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,510
I'd never abandon you.

143
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,790
Nanzhao,

144
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,670
you still haven't answered me.

145
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,390
Will you marry me?

146
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,150
As you wish.

147
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,350
That's wonderful.

148
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,590
Go get some rest.

149
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,839
Tell the kitchen

150
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,479
to make some nourishing tonics

151
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,879
and call the doctor.

152
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,590
Yes, sir.

153
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,519
Miss Ye,

154
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,230
this way.

155
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,310
Go on.

156
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,550
Verify if she was at the hospital.

157
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,470
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,110
Governor Yan,

159
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,239
we checked.

160
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,110
Miss Ye did go to the hospital.

161
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,639
Check on Hong Dou's whereabouts too.

162
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,390
Yes, sir.

163
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,510
Nanzhao,

164
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,390
I want to take you
to meet my godfather.

165
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,279
(Cheng Qingping,
the richest man in Nan City)

166
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,270
Godfather.

167
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,630
You're here.

168
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,910
This is Ye Nanzhao,

169
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,079
the one I told you about.

170
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,079
It's nice to meet you,

171
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,350
Master Cheng.

172
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,630
Here's a gift I brought you.

173
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,999
I heard from Jinxing

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,070
you used to visit the water town
when you were young.

175
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,239
Their palmiers are famous,

176
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,479
so I had someone bring some for you.

177
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,239
Thank you.

178
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,270
That's very thoughtful.

179
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,279
My late wife was from the water town.

180
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,799
When she was alive,

181
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,479
she often bought me those pastries.

182
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,879
I haven't had them

183
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,910
in years.

184
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,239
I'm sorry

185
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,879
for bringing up painful memories.

186
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,830
Not at all.

187
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,759
Thank you

188
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,590
for reminding me of those days.

189
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,150
They were wonderful memories.

190
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,839
For some reason,

191
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,790
I feel an instant connection with you.

192
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
And since you're the one Jinxing loves,

193
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,710
no need to call me Master Cheng.

194
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,990
That's too formal.

195
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,479
Nanzhao,

196
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,630
call him godfather.

197
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,750
Godfather.

198
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,030
Mm.

199
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,159
Jinxing,

200
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,990
we have guests today.

201
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,990
Go check if everything's ready.

202
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,390
Who is it, godfather?

203
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,919
A very important guest.

204
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,950
That's awfully mysterious.

205
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,870
Nanzhao,

206
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,639
wait for me in the garden.

207
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,870
I'll come find you soon.

208
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,230
I have a surprise for you.

209
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,639
Jinxing,

210
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,350
you...

211
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,550
What?

212
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,310
Disappointed that I'm not Yan Jinxing?

213
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,399
Why are you here?

214
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,119
I came for you.

215
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,039
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,150
I made this decision on my own.

217
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,270
Why did you chase me all the way here?

218
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,030
Because I want you.

219
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,270
Listen to me, Ye Nanzhao.

220
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,070
Married or not,

221
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,150
I'm taking you back.

222
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,790
Lu Zhuo!
