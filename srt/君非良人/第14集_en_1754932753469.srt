=Episode 14=

3
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,220
I am a small river.

4
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,870
Without meaning to, I pass by you.

5
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,799
You too, without meaning to,
cast your rosy shadow

6
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,630
into the gentle waves of my waters.

7
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,870
How fortunate

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,430
to brush past you among millions.

9
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,830
I met you,

10
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,790
as if I fell into fate

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,919
and tumbled into spring.

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,190
Lu Wenyin.

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
Ye Nanzhao.

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,190
Long time no see.

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,470
Tomorrow is the seventh day
since my husband's death.

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,870
I want to burn some poetry for him.

17
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,390
Still treasuring such a worthless man?

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,559
How devoted of you.

19
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,750
Shut up!

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,830
He was such a talented man.

21
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,039
It's a pity he met you first.

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,910
If he had met me instead,

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,430
how happy we could've been.

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,039
Look how much he loved me.

25
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,759
He wrote me so many poems.

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,550
So many of them!

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,070
Poems?

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,799
You love him

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,830
just because
of the poems he wrote for you?

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,950
Ridiculous.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,919
How pathetic.

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,110
What are you laughing at?

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,199
You've already caused
my husband's death.

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,510
And you're still laughing?

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,030
I'm laughing because those poems

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,030
were written by me.

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,079
What nonsense are you spouting?

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,439
I said I wrote those poems.

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,550
Don't you get it?

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,230
(All these years, Lin Chishu)

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,310
(had been publishing the poems
I wrote for him)

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,190
(in newspapers.)

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,030
(I never exposed him
as he was my husband.)

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,710
(Yet unexpectedly,
he captured your heart.)

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,590
I wrote

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,790
these love poems for Lin Chishu.

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,030
Every single poem he published was mine.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,070
You're lying to me.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,750
I am a small river.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,630
Without meaning to, I pass by you.

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,230
You too, without meaning to,
cast your rosy shadow

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,839
into the gentle waves of my waters.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,039
Stop reciting it.

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,870
Even if I knew a moth
would perish in the flame,

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,639
I would still leap into the fire.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,039
I'd let it burn

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,359
until the end of our love.

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,470
Shut up!

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,039
You're lying to me.

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,550
You're lying to us all!

61
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,711
(Love Goes On And On)

62
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,199
(By Liu Rushi)

63
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,623
That day, Chishu's new play

64
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:57,990
"Love Goes On And On"
was supposed to be staged.

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,470
But it turned out
to be "The Case of Chen Shimei."

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,510
You switched it, didn't you?

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,470
You went to such lengths
to get my husband killed.

68
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,119
Even now you're still unaware

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,710
what kind of man Lin Chishu really was.

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,630
(Love Goes On And On)
It was such a beautiful love story.

71
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,310
But you ruined it.

72
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,950
He told me everything.

73
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,270
It was all your lies.

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,110
Wenyin.

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,190
Wenyin.

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,910
You're the one
I love most in this world.

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,510
My love for you has always been sincere.

78
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,670
Chishu.

79
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,350
I know.

80
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,750
I'm the happiest one in the world.

81
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,550
You pushed me to this.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,159
You're trying to drive me mad.

83
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,750
But I won't let you win.

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,990
I can't let you win.

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,510
I can't let you win.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,150
Lu Wenyin.

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,830
What are you trying to do, Lu Wenyin?

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,630
The final act of "Love Goes On And On"

89
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,110
is about a wife following her husband
to reunite in love.

90
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,070
I've made up my mind.

91
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,110
I'm going to find him.

92
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,470
And you?

93
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,070
You're coming with us.

94
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,430
Nanzhao!

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,470
Young Master!

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,630
This is bad!

97
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,630
Miss Ye has been kidnapped
by Lu Wenyin!

98
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,150
Young Master.

99
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,230
Tell me.

100
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,230
Where is Ye Nanzhao?

101
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,479
Get First Madam of the Lu family here.

102
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,190
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,310
Go after her.

104
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,710
Are you alright?

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,310
Your wound's opened again.

106
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,110
I'm fine.

107
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,150
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,430
I was late.

109
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,030
I promise you.

110
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,470
From this day on,

111
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,910
I won't let you fall into danger again.

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,190
Jinxing

113
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,630
Jinxing.

114
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,070
Kill her for me.

115
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,950
Kill her for me.

116
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,870
Kill her for me!

117
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,230
Nanzhao.

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,950
You two go to the hospital.

119
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,310
As for the rest,

120
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,790
leave it to me.

121
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,479
Kill her for me.

122
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,559
Kill her for me.

123
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,679
Kill her for me.

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,270
Thank you, Jinxing.

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,630
Much appreciated.

126
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,710
Wenyin.

127
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,750
I warned you.

128
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,390
Take her to the asylum.

129
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,439
I'm not going there...

130
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,950
I don't want to go to the asylum!

131
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,879
I won't go there!

132
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,919
I'm not going there!

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,639
Jinxing!

134
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,950
Jinxing!

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,670
Jinxing, I don't want to go there!

136
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,439
Jinxing!

137
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,630
Lu Zhuo.

138
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,430
If you want to thank me,

139
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,990
then let me have your life.

140
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,430
I wonder what brings you here

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,910
at this late hour.

142
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,950
Here's a gift for you,

143
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,270
Lord Tiger.

144
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,039
I heard you like collecting firearms.

145
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,790
I picked this one especially for you.

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,670
A fine piece indeed.

147
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,390
How well-crafted.

148
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,470
You really know your stuff.

149
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,919
Naturally.

150
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,310
I have good taste

151
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,830
when it comes to guns.

152
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,230
Since you know a lot about guns,

153
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,230
that means you were committing a crime

154
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,390
by selling those counterfeit arms.

155
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,790
What do you mean, Governor Yan?

156
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,910
Two months ago,

157
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,510
the Yan family received a batch of guns.

158
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,230
They were exquisite in appearance.

159
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,590
But they couldn't be used

160
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,230
due to the faulty rifling.

161
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,470
Lord Tiger.

162
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,430
Word has it

163
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,710
that you made them.

164
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,319
Feel free to ask around.

165
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,310
The Qinglong Society has three rules.

166
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,919
No trafficking women.

167
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,359
No arms dealing.

168
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,599
No opium.

169
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,110
The Qinglong Society doesn't do that.

170
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,790
But you do.

171
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,190
Lord Tiger.

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,790
Your man already fessed up.

173
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,519
(Tie Shanhu kidnapped
my wife and daughter.)

174
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,919
The Yan family wasn't the only one

175
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,830
who bought that batch of guns.

176
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,190
If I make this testimony public,

177
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,750
you and the Qinglong Society

178
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,190
will be done for.

179
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,670
We'll be finished?

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,630
Is it possible for us
to talk things out?

181
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:18,775
(Jiang City Hospital)

182
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,425
(First Ward)

183
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,510
(Nanzhao.)

184
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,990
(I might not have made myself clear
when I proposed.)

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,830
(I...)

186
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,030
(Nanzhao.)

187
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,110
(I don't care about your past.)

188
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,750
(I only love who you are now.)

189
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,519
(No, no.)

190
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,910
(I'd better not bring up the past.)

191
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,359
Well,

192
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,430
if only A'wen were here.

193
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,110
Young Master.

194
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,430
A'wen?

195
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,950
You came just in time.

196
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,470
Young Master.

197
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,110
Lord Tiger asked for you.

198
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,910
Young Master!

199
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,959
Come on in.

200
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,110
Why knock?

201
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,790
Young Master Yan.

202
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,750
Where's Lu Zhuo?

203
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,150
He might've gone out.

204
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,439
What do you need him for?

205
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,790
I came for you.

206
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,630
Nanzhao.

207
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,310
I'm heading back to Nan City.

208
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,479
But I'm worried that once I leave,

209
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,630
no one will protect you.

210
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,590
What about Lu Zhuo?

211
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,230
He's left the Qinglong Society.

212
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,950
Eventually, they'll forget him.

213
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,679
You may not know this, Nanzhao.

214
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,670
Lu Zhuo once secretly
sold a batch of fake guns.

215
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,870
That violated Qinglong Society's rules.

216
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,310
Tie Shanhu has now issued a kill order.

217
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,110
Once Lu Zhuo is caught,

218
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,870
he will be executed.
