00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,712
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,029
Put me down, Lu Zhuo.

4
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,999
No.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,279
Unless you say yes to it.

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,550
What's it?

7
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,719
My proposal.

8
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,359
Don't you already have a fiancée?

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,839
Are you jealous?

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,390
Why would I be jealous?

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,110
- Let me go.
- No.

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,070
Let me go!

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,830
Fine.

14
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,919
Shoot.

15
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,750
Like I said, my life is yours.

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,670
It's okay if you don't know how.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,070
I'll teach you how to shoot.

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,919
Let's go now!

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,390
Someone just fired a shot!

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,550
Look.

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,270
It's not that hard to shoot.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,390
It's not hard

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,190
to be with me either.

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,110
Ye Nanzhao.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,950
I just want an answer from you.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,550
I didn't tell you before

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,230
because I didn't care about it.

28
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,230
But if you care,

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,030
well,

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,510
I'll go to my foster father

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,030
and annul the engagement now.

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,079
Foster Father.

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,750
Dad, it's her!

34
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,110
If I'd been two minutes later,

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,510
Zhuo would've succeeded in proposing.

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,639
So you're

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,959
the woman Lu Zhuo mobilized
all the Qinglong Society brothers

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,710
to search for.

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,790
Foster Father,

40
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,279
you saved my life.

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,870
I respect you deeply.

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,150
I, Lu Zhuo, humbly beg you

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,950
to officiate the marriage
between me and the one I love most.

44
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,910
Lu Zhuo.

45
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,150
I can let go of the past.

46
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,190
But today,

47
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,150
you've gone too far.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,039
You're engaged to Yanni.

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,879
She's my daughter.

50
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,959
You must honor her

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,079
and put her first.

52
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,350
Marry her first,

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,919
then we can talk about
having a second wife.

54
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,910
Foster Father,

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,150
I've always seen Yanni as my sister.

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,959
As long as I live,

57
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,799
I'll protect her with my life.

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,510
Please allow me
to break off the engagement with her.

59
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,870
In this life,

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,679
I will only marry Ye Nanzhao.

61
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,079
There's no room for negotiation!

62
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,839
What if I insist
on ending the engagement?

63
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,350
Leave the Qinglong Gang, then.

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,999
You can forget about being the boss!

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,950
Fine.

66
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,150
Someone!

67
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,839
Dad!

68
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,679
Don't!

69
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,390
Zhuo will die!

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,470
The Qinglong Gang's rule for quitting

71
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,910
requires the punishment
of three cuts and six holes.

72
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,679
Life or death is up to fate.

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,159
This rule was set
at the founding of the gang.

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,919
Not even Lu Zhuo can break it.

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,510
And neither

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,910
can I.

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,359
Lord Tiger.

78
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,350
Our gang's punishments
have always been strict.

79
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,559
The three cuts and six holes

80
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,710
have always been made
to the chest and abdomen.

81
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,590
Considering how Second-in-Command

82
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,559
has risked his life

83
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,310
countless times for the Qinglong Gang,

84
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,719
please

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,479
spare his life!

86
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,719
Please spare
Second-in-Command's life, Lord Tiger!

87
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,910
What is all this?

88
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,710
Anyone else dares to plead for him,

89
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,230
I'll kill them myself!

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,230
No need.

91
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,030
Calm down, Dad.

92
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,599
Don't worry.

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,750
I'll be fine.

94
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,590
My life already belongs to you.
Not even the King of Hell can take it.

95
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,990
First cut.

96
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,910
It's to repay
the debt of saving my life.

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,270
Second-in-Command!

98
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,950
Second cut.

99
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,230
It's to thank you for raising me.

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,670
Third cut.

101
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,750
I, Lu Zhuo,

102
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,510
hereby leave the Qinglong Gang today.

103
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,470
Lu Zhuo!

104
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,190
This happened because of me.

105
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,110
As for the third cut...

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,830
Let me take it for him.

107
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,110
Nanzhao.

108
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,750
Nanzhao!

109
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,270
Get out.

110
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,110
From this day on,

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,590
you are no longer
the Qinglong Society's second-in-command.

112
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,310
Scram!

113
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,079
Thank you, Lord Tiger!

114
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,430
Thank you, Lord Tiger!

115
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,910
Well...

116
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,110
Thank you, Foster Father.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,150
Zhuo!

118
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,630
Second-in-command!

119
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,439
Nanzhao.

120
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,310
Your wound...

121
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,830
I'm fine.

122
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,310
I've just had a scratch on my arm.

123
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,639
Lu Zhuo,

124
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,710
hang in there.

125
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,430
We're almost at the hospital.

126
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,510
Now...

127
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,990
Can you say yes to me?

128
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,319
Yes.

129
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,070
I'll say yes to anything.

130
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,630
Just hang in there.

131
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,870
Lu Zhuo!

132
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,030
Hands off him!

133
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,430
Lu Zhuo!

134
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,919
Let go of him!

135
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,999
He's injured. You're taking advantage
of the situation.

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,030
Aren't you afraid
the other gangs will mock you?

137
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,070
No more hotpot?

138
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,190
It's time we settle our scores.

139
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,959
You rat, Scar Eagle!

140
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,230
Let her go!

141
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,950
Let him go.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,790
Bullets don't have eyes.

143
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,759
You just learned to shoot, right?

144
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,799
You can't even hold the gun steady.

145
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,470
So what if I just learned?

146
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,110
One shot is enough
to blow your brains out.

147
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,390
Take us to the hospital.

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,510
Shoot me.

149
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,759
If you don't shoot me today,

150
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,310
I'm definitely taking Lu Zhuo with me.

151
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,350
Shoot.

152
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,150
Go on, shoot.

153
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,319
What are you waiting for?

154
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,430
Ye Nanzhao!

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,150
Ye Nanzhao.

156
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,110
Are you really going to kill for him?

157
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,110
What brings you here, Governor Yan?

158
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,919
I'm taking Lu Zhuo.

159
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,759
You don't have any objections, do you?

160
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,190
I don't care about Lu Zhuo.

161
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,830
But you need to leave her alone.

162
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,110
She belongs to you, huh?

163
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,839
But I saw the two of them

164
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,350
flirting with one another.

165
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,030
Governor Yan.

166
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,870
Yan Jinxing.

167
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,359
Lu Zhuo is injured.

168
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,390
Let's send him to the hospital first. Please.

169
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,910
He's not my concern.

170
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,990
I beg of you.

171
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,079
Please.

172
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,030
I owe you

173
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,950
one.

174
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,550
Nanzhao...

175
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,590
Nanzhao.

176
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,150
Remember this.

177
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,950
I saved him only because of you.

178
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,750
Lu Zhuo!

179
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,030
Lu Zhuo.

180
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,230
Lu Zhuo!

181
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,586
Lu Zhuo!

182
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:02,012
(Emergency Room)

183
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,830
Miss, your wound needs dressing.

184
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,310
Come with me.

185
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:55,299
(Emergency Room)

186
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,959
Wait here.

187
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,030
I'll get your medicine.
