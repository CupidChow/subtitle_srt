Alright.

18
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,710
Wait a second.

19
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,030
What's going on?

20
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,990
What happened?

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,079
It's the Second Madam!

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,819
Chishu!

23
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:44,519
She's been killed!

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,399
Chishu!

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,479
What are you doing?

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,239
Someone's dead!

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,199
Ungrateful wretch!

28
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,990
You actually killed your stepmother?

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,510
A so-called scholar?

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,790
(Lin Chishu)

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,190
(Your show is over.)

32
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,279
(Your reputation is ruined.)

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,679
You ungrateful beast!

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,390
(Jiang City's top scholar, huh?)

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,310
(Now you're just a joke.)

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,839
So the Lu family's son-in-law
is a murderer!

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,199
He killed someone!

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,919
That scholar title must've been fake!

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,919
- He's a killer!
- A beast in human clothes.

40
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,679
Heartless and cruel!

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,799
This kind of man dares to
call himself a scholar?

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,639
(It's all over.)

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,679
Get out of the Lu family!

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,079
(Lin Chishu, you're finished.)

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,239
Even if I die,

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,759
You're going down with me!

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,830
Stop it!

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,159
You...

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,590
You killed her!

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,790
Murder!

51
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,239
Wenyin!

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,190
Wenyin!

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,950
Wenyin!

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,359
(Madam.)

55
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,599
(Was it worth it?)

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,430
(Hong Dou.)

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,110
(If good people want
to win against evil,)

58
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,110
(they must pay a greater price.)

59
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,470
(If they refuse
to stoop to their level,)

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,870
(then they must use themselves as bait.)

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,590
(Give their lives for the cause.)

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,679
Our Madam is kind-hearted
and won't kill you.

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,799
From now on, never show
your face in Jiang City again.

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,790
Understand?

65
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,799
Hong Dou,

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,999
thank your Madam for me.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,870
Mm.

68
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,750
Madam.

69
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,839
I don't understand.

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,559
There was no Qianji poison,

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,350
why did you put on that show?

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,559
Someone like Lin Chishu

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,830
fears nothing.

74
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,670
He's not afraid of morals,
nor the law, only death.

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,350
With tonight's act,

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,710
a seed of unease is planted
in his heart.

77
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,070
Soon enough, he'll jump at shadows.

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,750
(A dose of knockout powder)

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,670
(is enough to drive him to act.)

80
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:15,750
(Offering)

81
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:27,175
(Jiang City Hospital)

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,479
The constables have concluded

83
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,630
that Lin Chishu tried to kill you first.

84
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,790
You aren't responsible for his death.

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,630
Lu Wenyin has taken
the body back for burial.

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,870
Thank you, Young Master, for saving me.

87
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,030
If I hadn't stepped in last night,

88
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,990
you'd have died on that stage.

89
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,830
Second Madam,

90
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,950
You went too far this time.

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,879
You deliberately let Lin Chishu
try to kill you.

92
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,030
Let me guess.

93
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,399
You decided to die

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,270
back at the masquerade, didn't you?

95
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,470
Since you already know everything,

96
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,110
why bother asking me?

97
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,430
Didn't I tell you?

98
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,990
If you're going to die,

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,870
it can only be by my hand.

100
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,630
Don't ever risk your life alone again.

101
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,310
Young Master,

102
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,190
is that your way of showing concern?

103
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,070
Tell me who you are.

104
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,319
What are you planning?

105
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,550
I can help you.

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,190
Lu Zhuo,

107
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,030
we're just passing strangers.

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,910
Knowing too much

109
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,750
is more of a burden than a gift.

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,390
Young Master,

111
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,350
Yang A'wen,
do you not know how to knock?

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,590
It's an emergency, Young Master!

113
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,559
Urgent telegram from
the Qinglong Society. Top-priority matter.

114
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,110
Message is confidential.
They only said you must return at once.

115
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,030
Leave us.

116
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,550
Miss,

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,030
I've already told you what I want.

118
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,750
I can give you time.

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,390
It's fine if you don't answer now.

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,070
After all,

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,430
we've got all the time in the world.

122
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,839
What's got you all flustered?

123
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,070
Second-in-Command.

124
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,839
(Liu Yanni, daughter of Tie Shanhu)

125
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,910
Brother Lu Zhuo.

126
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,830
This is your top-priority matter?

127
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,390
The young lady ordered it.
I didn't dare disobey.

128
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,670
Brother Lu Zhuo,

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,190
get in the car.

130
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,710
Yanni,

131
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,470
stop making such a scene from now on.

132
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,630
Also,

133
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,630
don't use A'wen
to send false messages again.

134
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,830
I didn't send a false message.

135
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,359
I wanted to see you.

136
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,350
How is that not a top-priority matter?

137
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,950
Yanni,

138
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,599
you're not a child anymore.

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,990
Can you stop acting up?

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,919
Alright.

141
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,390
I know I was wrong.

142
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,110
Brother Lu Zhuo, just get in the car.

143
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,519
Today is my father's birthday.

144
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,270
You're going back
to celebrate too, right?

145
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,759
Ride with me.

146
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,750
It's perfect timing.

147
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,639
A'wen,

148
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,030
say something.

149
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,350
She's right, Young Master.

150
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,030
Your car wheel

151
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,199
is broken.

152
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,999
It won't move.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,630
If there's no choice, you might as well
take the young lady's car.

154
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,679
Is that so?

155
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:50,959
It is.

156
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,830
Alright.

157
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,079
Then you can run behind the car.

158
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,599
No.

159
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,430
Young Master!

160
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,110
I...

161
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,199
Where do I go?

162
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,759
I...

163
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,710
Young Master!

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,999
No!

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,959
Young Master!

166
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,830
Young Master!

167
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,319
Second-in-Command.

168
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,270
Young Lady.

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,399
Do you have time tomorrow?
Let's have a meal together.

170
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,390
I'm not free tomorrow.

171
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,750
What about the day after?

172
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,110
Also unavailable.

173
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,870
Wait for me!

174
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,910
Godfather.

175
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,710
Father.

176
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,639
(Tie Shanhu, Leader of Qinglong Society)

177
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,839
Such a big girl already,

178
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,399
still so impulsive.

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,119
Go on.

180
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,319
Go check the kitchen.

181
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,470
See if the food's ready.

182
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,079
Father!

183
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,079
I finally got to see Brother Lu Zhuo.

184
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,590
Now you're chasing me away?

185
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,679
I have serious matters to discuss.

186
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,550
Go on now.

187
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,710
Hmph!

188
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,470
Never include me in anything.

189
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,240
Fine, I'll go!

190
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,612
(Scar Eagle, Third-in-Command
of Qinglong Society)

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,990
Look who's finally shown up?
The busy man of Qinglong Society.

192
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,270
Exactly.

193
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,030
So busy,

194
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,159
he's forgotten who his father is.

195
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,150
Exactly.

196
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,070
Godfather.

197
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,679
If you think I'm too busy,

198
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,630
I'll clear my schedule tomorrow.

199
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,270
I'll focus on playing chess with you.

200
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,750
I can play chess on my own.

201
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,519
Qinglong Society is such a big gang,

202
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,839
you want me to manage it all alone?

203
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,190
Trying to work me to death?

204
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,630
Look at how serious he is.

205
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,750
Sit.

206
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,319
Today

207
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,519
is Lord Tiger's birthday.

208
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,559
I didn't come

209
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,519
empty-handed.

210
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,519
Men!

211
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,950
Bring out the gift I've prepared
for Lord Tiger.

212
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,319
This painting,

213
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,879
"Tiger Descending the Mountain",

214
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,510
was specially commissioned
from a master artist,

215
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,119
but these so-called masters

216
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,390
just don't know how to finish the eye.

217
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,479
So,

218
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,239
we'll have to ask Lord Tiger

219
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,430
to personally

220
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,550
add the finishing touch.

221
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,230
Touching up the eyes

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,399
is a real art.

223
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,759
Indeed.

224
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,679
So today,

225
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,430
let Lord Tiger show you how it's done.

226
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,110
Prepare the ink.

227
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,719
Incredible.

228
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,190
It's come alive.

229
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,639
This

230
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,390
"Tiger Descending the Mountain"

231
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,310
now has real spirit in it.

232
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,319
Wishing Lord Tiger

233
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,719
a long life and lasting fortune.

234
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,870
The tiger's roar

235
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,479
stirs the wind.

236
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,230
Wonderful.

237
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,119
Hang it up.

238
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,990
Yes, sir.

239
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,030
Second-in-Command,

240
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,599
where's your gift?

241
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,159
Let us all

242
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,590
have a look as well.

243
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,759
He must have forgotten.

244
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,599
He is indeed busy.

245
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,830
No time to prepare.

246
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,550
Don't blame him, Lord Tiger.

247
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,470
Bring it up.

248
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,599
Lord Tiger,

249
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,430
he only prepared one thing.

250
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,119
Lu Zhuo,

251
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,039
I'll shoot you dead!

252
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,830
Wait!

253
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,470
Put the gun down.

254
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,070
This is the gift I've prepared
for my godfather.

255
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,710
Godfather,

256
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,479
(The Yi Army, Anshi, Huixian, Jewellery Shop...)
These 12 branches and 12 keys are for you.

257
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,870
Wishing my godfather rises like a dragon
and roars like a tiger. A domineering presence.

258
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,110
With these 12 branches,

259
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,479
Qinglong Society in Jiang City

260
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,990
will have no rivals.

261
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,390
Excellent.

262
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,190
Boys!

263
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,359
Time to feast!

264
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,190
Yes, sir!

265
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,310
Xiao Zhuozi,

266
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,350
you really are something.

267
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,839
Madam,

268
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,510
are you really all right
with that wound?

269
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,430
I'm fine.

270
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,750
The stab didn't hit anything vital.

271
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,559
I'll go call a car now.

272
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,359
Wait for me.

273
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,110
Mm.

274
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,510
Back already?

275
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,399
Are you insane?

276
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,310
Lu Wenyin!

277
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,070
I'm not insane.

278
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,759
I know you're Ye Nanzhao.

279
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,159
I know why you hate Lin Chishu.

280
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,359
That incident,

281
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,639
you were part of it too.

282
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,559
What else?

283
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,639
He loved me so much.

284
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,790
If I told him to kill someone, he would.

285
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,919
Not just you.

286
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,350
He was going to kill

287
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,430
your little burden too.
