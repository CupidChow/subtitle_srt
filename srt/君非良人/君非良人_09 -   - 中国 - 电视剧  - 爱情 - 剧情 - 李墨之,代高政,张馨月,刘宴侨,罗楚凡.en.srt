00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,389
Stop screaming.

4
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,230
Lu Zhuo!

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,030
Lu Zhuo!

6
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,799
Stop screaming!

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,550
Lu Zhuo!

8
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,990
It's okay.

9
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,230
It's okay.

10
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,950
(Everything's alright.)

11
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,670
Madam!

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,550
Madam!

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,119
Young Master!

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,670
Madam!

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,959
Young Master!

16
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,030
Madam!

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,830
Madam!

18
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,319
A'Wen...

19
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,439
Madam!

20
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,830
That's Young Master!

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,390
Hong Dou.

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,039
Get her home.

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,870
Mm.

24
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,710
See you tomorrow.

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,630
Kneel!

26
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,999
Young Master.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,910
We've found out

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,110
that it was the Yans' doing.

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,510
Looks like someone
leaked the news to them.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,019
There's a traitor
in the Qinglong Society.

31
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,399
Second-in-Command. Please spare me.

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,870
I'll tell you who the traitor is.

33
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,999
Second-in-Command. Please don't kill me!

34
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:14,559
I beg of you,

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,510
Second-in-Command!

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,950
I know who that is.

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,950
(Scar Eagle.)

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,430
Go ahead.

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,999
Why did you

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,350
ask me here?

41
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,990
Relax.

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,110
I just wanted to catch up with you

43
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,430
and

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,830
settle a score.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,630
We're brothers.

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,670
What score is there to settle?

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,359
Have you heard

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,510
what happened at the ballroom?

49
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,230
Do you have anything to say to me?

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,430
Well...

51
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,310
What's there to say?

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,430
I don't get

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,190
what you're trying to say here.

54
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,310
Drink it.

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,150
What is this drink

56
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,990
for?

57
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,670
I'm afraid

58
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,279
you'll be in great pain.

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,270
What?

60
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,039
Second-in-Command!

61
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,679
Wait...

62
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,430
What do you mean by this?

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,270
You've betrayed the Qinglong Society.

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,230
I've done you a favor

65
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,879
by stabbing only this hand of yours.

66
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,479
Well...

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,439
Well, there must be

68
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,630
a misunderstanding, Second-in-Command!

69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,590
I'll...

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,799
Misunderstanding?

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,759
Yes...

72
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,839
It's a misunderstanding.

73
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,630
Tell Yan Jinxing this.

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,390
Don't ever mess with me again.

75
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,190
Wenyin.

76
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,350
Father.

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,630
I knew you'd come!

78
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,479
You've suffered much.

79
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,190
I knew you'd be here.

80
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,039
I hate this,

81
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,159
Father.

82
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,590
I'll remove it for you.

83
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,270
Well,

84
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,439
you're just a young lady,

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,079
but

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,310
why are you so stubborn?

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,310
No, Father.

88
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,159
That woman isn't Bai Shuangshuang.

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,679
Okay...

90
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,839
Her name is Ye Nanzhao.

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,519
Got it...

92
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,279
She was married to Lin Chishu.

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,639
Fine.

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,919
They even had a daughter.

95
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,399
Believe me. I'm telling the truth.

96
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,279
Look into it

97
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,479
and you'll know the truth.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,150
Got it...

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,239
Don't worry.

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,030
I'll make things right for you.

101
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,990
You do believe me, Father!

102
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,319
Wenyin.

103
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,039
Here.

104
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,390
Listen up.

105
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,839
At the end

106
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,030
of the day,

107
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,279
your stepmother

108
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,950
is just an outsider.

109
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,030
Mm.

110
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,990
But have you ever considered this?

111
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,190
Your mother

112
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,399
and I

113
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,830
will leave this world

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,750
eventually.

115
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,670
Tell me.

116
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,830
What will you do when that day comes?

117
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,399
You're doing just fine.

118
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,799
Why must you bring that up?

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,759
I've made up my mind.

120
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,670
I'll take matters into my own hands

121
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,590
and find you a good husband.

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,159
We'll go talk to them

123
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,390
and lay down the terms.

124
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,310
No matter how you are,

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,479
even if you've gone mad,

126
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,959
they must ensure

127
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,350
your safety.

128
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,679
Don't you think that's fair?

129
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,239
You still don't trust me.

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,599
How could I not trust you?

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,999
You still believe her.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,119
You still believe her!

133
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,399
You do!

134
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,239
Silly girl.

135
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,359
Why don't you get it?

136
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,870
Listen to me, Wenyin.

137
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,150
Well,

138
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,510
for a woman,

139
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,630
once her man dies,

140
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,910
life only gets harder.

141
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,230
Even though they say

142
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,270
blessings and misfortunes come together,

143
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,030
maybe Heaven

144
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,830
gave you the opportunity

145
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,599
to realize

146
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,439
that man

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,190
was nothing but pure jerk.

148
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,870
But at the same time,

149
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,519
Heaven gave you a chance

150
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,519
to find a good man again

151
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,190
and marry into a better life.

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,430
I, Lu Wenyin, will marry no one

153
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,559
but Lin Chishu.

154
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
You'll marry whether you like it or not.

155
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,670
Are you going to stay a widow
your whole life for a dead man?

156
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,630
If word gets out,

157
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,790
what will become
of our family's reputation?

158
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,199
Reputation.

159
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,310
Honor.

160
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,599
I knew it.

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,030
It's all about that again!

162
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,079
That's just the way you are.

163
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,039
Since young,

164
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,759
I've done as you said.
Have you ever asked for my opinion?

165
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,190
Never!

166
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,510
I, Lu Wenyin,

167
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,670
am a mere dog in this family.

168
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,439
You're just going to give me away

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,639
to whoever you want.

170
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,999
That's not it!

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,070
I'm doing all this for your sake!

172
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,439
I didn't say no

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
to your engagement with Lin Chishu.

174
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,559
But

175
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,150
what kind of man was he?

176
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,719
If it weren't for my protection,

177
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,710
would you have led this glamorous life
as a young lady?

178
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,950
From now on, I'm no longer a young lady.

179
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,719
Just get yourself a new one.

180
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,319
I'm leaving this family!

181
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,190
You!

182
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,030
Lu Wenyin!

183
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,350
If you step out of this door,

184
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,239
don't blame me for being cruel.

185
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
I'll just disown you!

186
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,559
You've got rid

187
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,079
of your son after all.

188
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,030
My absence here
won't make much difference.

189
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,590
When this gets out,

190
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,559
you'll be called childless

191
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,759
because you've cut ties with us.

192
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,150
Let's see how you're
going to maintain your good name!

193
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,750
Wenyin!

194
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,079
Lu Wenyin!

195
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,080
How could you say those words?
How could you use that tone on me?

196
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,799
I was wrong.

197
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,039
Calm down.

198
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,919
I was wrong, Father.

199
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,070
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,839
Please calm down.

201
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,959
Are you alright? Father!

202
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,710
Are you okay?

203
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,950
Father!

204
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,990
Father!

205
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,710
Are you alright, Father?

206
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,279
Father!

207
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,519
Wake up,

208
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,039
Father!

209
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,639
Wenyin.

210
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,430
Father!

211
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,030
What's going on?

212
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,399
- Dear!
- Father!

213
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,310
Dear!

214
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,999
He's having a relapse.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,759
I'll go get help.

216
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,790
Wait here.

217
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,590
Mother!

218
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,550
Don't go.

219
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,510
What's it?

220
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,839
Dear?

221
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,950
Dear!

222
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,959
He's in danger.

223
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,910
We need to get help
or it'll be too late!

224
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,950
Wenyin...

225
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,510
Father is dying.

226
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,790
What?

227
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,919
I have an idea.

228
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,990
I have an idea.

229
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,950
Father is doing me this one last favor.

230
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,390
Get Ye Nanzhao here.

231
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,039
Dear!

232
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,270
Dear!

233
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,719
Young Master. We've been looking
for you everywhere. Master Lu...

234
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,280
- I've learned about it.
- Young Master!

235
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,430
They're going to bury Second Madam
with Master Lu's body.

236
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,630
All of you are coming with me
to the Lu Residence.

237
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,470
- Let's go.
- Yes.

238
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,025
(In Mourning)

239
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,612
(In Mourning)

240
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,599
What do you want?

241
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,159
Lu Zhuo!

242
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,879
What are you doing?

243
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,340
Have you lost your mind?
Your return isn't going to change things.

244
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,790
Father said he was disowning you
before his passing.

245
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,990
I'll make you pay
for what happened to Father.

246
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,110
Where's Bai Shuangshuang?

247
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,999
Lu Zhuo.

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,040
Stop pushing your luck!

249
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,499
You already have your eye on
your father's woman right after his departure.

250
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,240
Are you trying
to turn yourself into the laughing stock?

251
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,390
I'll ask you this
one last time, Lu Wenyin.

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,270
Where is

253
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,950
Bai Shuangshuang?

254
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,759
Lu Zhuo.

255
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,990
What are you doing?

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,519
She's your sister.

257
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,070
Don't try anything funny.

258
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,599
I haven't seen her.

259
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,110
I have no idea where she is.

260
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,670
Young Master!

261
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,470
We've found her.

262
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,670
She's at the backyard.

263
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,790
Take this woman away.

264
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,270
We're going to see
Bai Shuangshuang together.

265
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,159
What do you want?

266
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,750
I can walk myself.

267
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,159
Wenyin.

268
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,190
Wenyin.

269
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,319
What are you doing?

270
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,199
Let Wenyin go.

271
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,879
Wenyin!

272
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,512
(In Mourning)

273
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,070
Move!

274
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,230
Stop it!

275
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,870
Don't move!

276
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,070
Pry it open!

277
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,390
Do it!

278
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,630
Hong Dou!

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,030
Here.

280
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,510
A'Wen.

281
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,879
Young Master.

282
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,799
Please save my madam!

283
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,750
Come.

284
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,910
Here.

285
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,310
Where is she?

286
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,470
Now?

287
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,950
She should be dead by now.

288
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,630
Lu Zhuo.

289
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,350
She's not Bai Shuangshuang whom...

290
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,070
Lu Wenyin.

291
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,550
I'll ask you this one last time.

292
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,790
Where is Bai Shuangshuang?

293
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,990
Quick!

294
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,670
It's too late.

295
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,630
It's been some time.

296
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,070
I bet she's dead due to suffocation.

297
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,510
Yang A'Wen.

298
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,630
Bring First Madam here.

299
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,790
Yes.

300
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,079
Lu Zhuo.

301
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,270
Don't you dare hurt my mother!

302
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,790
Wenyin!

303
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,639
Wenyin! How's it, Wenyin?

304
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,710
Mother...

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,230
First Madam.

306
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,319
If you want to save your daughter,

307
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,039
tell me

308
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,630
where Bai Shuangshuang is buried.

309
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,359
Mother.

310
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,870
Don't tell him.

311
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,230
On the count of three.

312
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,830
Three.

313
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,190
Two.

314
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,390
No!

315
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,839
No!

316
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,070
He wouldn't dare to do it!

317
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,950
One.

318
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,879
No!

319
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,479
- He wouldn't dare to do so! Don't tell him.
- No!

320
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
He wouldn't dare to do it!
Don't fall for his trap, Mother!

321
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,350
Lu Zhuo! I'll fight you to the end!
