[Episode 3]

4
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,330
What special day is it today?

5
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,340
Oh no.

6
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,840
Director Tian asked me

7
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,770
to send an experimental report to him.

8
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,700
I forgot to sort it out.

9
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,789
You're heartless.

10
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,340
I only have you in my heart,

11
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,020
but you only care about reports.

12
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,250
Look at my report.

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,080
How is it?

14
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,789
It's perfect.

15
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,160
Happy birthday.

16
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,500
I knew you'd remember.

17
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,200
Let go of me!

18
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,690
You're covered with unknown bacteria

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,830
from the ER.

20
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,270
You're a wet blanket just like my husband.

21
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,400
Put it on me.

22
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,190
What do you think? Do I look good?

23
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,320
Yes.

24
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,860
Let's have a feast tonight.

25
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
I have an emergency night shift tonight.

26
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,670
I'm so stupid.

27
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,640
How would it possible that

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,240
two residents of Shengji Hospital

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,930
go out at the same time?

30
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,100
What about your husband?

31
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,550
Don't mention it.

32
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,000
There is a major surgery out of a sudden.

33
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,480
Brain tumor during pregnancy.

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,890
Shall we take a look?

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,700
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

36
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,970
This is more important than a feast. Hurry.

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,540
Could you move over a bit? Thank you.

38
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,190
Is that the famous director

39
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,590
of the Neurosurgery Department, Liu Zhenghua?

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Yes.

41
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,880
After Director Huang removes the baby,

42
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,510
he will go on to cut the brain tumor.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,860
Generally, cesarean section and brain surgery

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
should not be operated together.

45
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,430
These two surgeries

46
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,570
vary in disinfection level.

47
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,020
And they have different surgical conditions

48
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,620
and types of anesthesia.

49
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,100
The original plan was to

50
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,150
operate the cesarean section first

51
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,980
and then choose another day to cut the tumor.

52
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,720
However, the brain tumor

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,610
of this patient suddenly bled.

54
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,770
So now,

55
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,540
she has to have a cesarean section

56
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,850
and an operation on her brain immediately.

57
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,190
It's so dangerous.

58
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,230
Director Huang must be under a lot of pressure.

59
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,400
Any slight mistake during the surgery

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,320
will affect the brain.

61
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,510
Director Huang would not be stressed.

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,930
She's the Divine Hand of the Obstetrical Department.

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,240
Her breathing is normal.

64
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,400
All tests are normal.

65
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,590
The Apgar score is 9 at 1 minute.

66
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,920
Good child.

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,590
Now let's see whether your mom

68
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,550
can make it.

69
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,090
Director Liu.

70
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,790
Count on you.

71
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,210
It's said that Director Liu

72
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,330
has liver cancer.

73
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,990
He's in hospital now

74
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,050
and is waiting for a liver transplant.

75
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,760
But this patient

76
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,790
is in an emergency.

77
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,670
The brain tumor is too big

78
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,810
and the location is tricky.

79
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,850
He had no choice

80
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,940
but to come here

81
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,880
and operate on her in person.

82
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,570
Watching an expert's operation

83
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,750
is an enjoyment.

84
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,340
Sir.

85
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,450
Are you okay?

86
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,090
My liver is weak,

87
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,460
but my hands are still stable.

88
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,560
Now most of the tumor has been removed.

89
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,770
There's still a little.

90
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,970
It's close to the frontal lobe.

91
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,530
A liver cancer patient

92
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,440
is operating on a patient with brain cancer.

93
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,460
Director Liu is a hardcore figure.

94
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,660
Hello?

95
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,790
Okay, I'll be right there.

96
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,620
I've got something to do. You take your time.

97
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,470
Amazing!

98
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,580
This is the real Divine Hand.

99
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,380
How is it?

100
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,690
The cord blood

101
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,430
is a bit abnormal.

102
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,900
The baby was already out of oxygen in the womb.

103
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,820
There are two options now.

104
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,840
One is to operate cesarean section immediately

105
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,700
and terminate the pregnancy.

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,510
But since the baby is not full term yet,

107
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,260
all functions are deficient.

108
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,040
The possibility of a deformed fetus cannot be ruled out.

109
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,920
It's possible that

110
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,909
many complications may occur.

111
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,340
Long-time hospitalization may be required.

112
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:47,600
Then...

113
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,100
What about the other option?

114
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,810
Wait for the baby to grow up.

115
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,670
But it's possible that the baby may die in the womb.

116
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,700
Honey,

117
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,820
if our baby

118
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,320
is not healthy after birth,

119
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,500
will you dislike him?

120
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,110
Whether he is healthy or not,

121
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,000
it's a gift for us

122
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,070
from God.

123
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,490
As long as we're with it,

124
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,690
we will

125
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,650
make it happy.

126
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,820
I was born prematurely.

127
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,150
My family abandoned me

128
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,930
after I was born.

129
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,870
And I've been in poor health.

130
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,140
So I've been thinking

131
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,770
if the baby loses its mother

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,230
after he is born,

133
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,140
it would be pitiful.

134
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,690
No, honey.

135
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,660
This won't happen.

136
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,800
Although we don't have parents,

137
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,200
we will definitely be

138
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,220
the best parents in the world.

139
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,770
Look.

140
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,710
Look.

141
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,060
I bought the baby some diapers,

142
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,600
little clothes,

143
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,180
and a milk bottle.

144
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,460
When did you buy these?

145
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,360
Dr. Wu said

146
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,290
our baby

147
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,400
may come out anytime.

148
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,670
We must

149
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
prepare in advance.

150
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:57,510
I also bought

151
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,550
many parenting books.

152
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,670
I will definitely

153
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,940
read them carefully.

154
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,790
After the baby is born,

155
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,880
we will take good care of him together.

156
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,230
How about this?

157
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,580
For the sake of the baby,

158
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,490
hold on as long as you can.

159
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,470
I will be monitoring you at any time.

160
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,190
Once fetal distress occurs,

161
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,420
we must operate cesarean section immediately.

162
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,180
Okay.

163
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,820
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

164
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,610
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

165
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,680
Dr. Wu.

166
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,540
The competition that

167
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,320
you signed me up

168
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,150
is going be broadcast live tonight.

169
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,060
If I go,

170
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,840
-My wife might... -Don't worry.

171
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,700
Go ahead.

172
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,970
I'll call you

173
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,960
if anything happens here.

174
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,600
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

175
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:51,860
Thank you.

176
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,320
You can do it.

177
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,530
How did it go?

178
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,620
When he was cutting off

179
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
the last part of the cancer tissues,

180
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,780
there was a sudden

181
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,080
cerebral hemorrhage for unknown reason.

182
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,240
The patient's blood pressure

183
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,610
dropped significantly.

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,050
Director Liu

185
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,190
is looking for the source of the blood.

186
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,740
That's wonderful.

187
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,700
How could you stay calm

188
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,919
when watching such a difficult surgery?

189
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,290
Play games again? Why didn't you sleep?

190
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,140
Didn't I tell you

191
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,580
I don't need you to take care of me?

192
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,660
If I don't,

193
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,290
who else would take care of you?

194
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,820
Here's your meal card.

195
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,460
[Meal Card]

196
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,560
I've topped up your meal expenses for a week.

197
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,600
Take care of yourself. Don't run around.

198
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,540
I'm so useless,

199
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,500
but you still helped me.

200
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,970
I may never be able to

201
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,520
repay your kindness in this life.

202
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,950
What kindness?

203
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,120
Don't mention that.

204
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,290
I'm leaving.

205
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,630
I'm going to be hospitalized tonight.

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,460
Don't get up.

207
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,350
Why are you going to be hospitalized?

208
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,140
What's wrong with you?

209
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,480
It's none of your business.

210
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,210
Can you be discharged soon?

211
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,710
I don't know.

212
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,820
I'm off now.

213
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,170
Brother.

214
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,160
Didn't you always call yourself sister?

215
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,160
From now on,

216
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,810
if you don't mind,

217
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,170
I'll see you as my brother.

218
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,180
I'll be your sister.

219
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,610
When you are hospitalized,

220
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,780
I'll cook for you and wash your clothes.

221
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,390
I'm good at cooking.

222
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,740
I can be your brother,

223
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,070
but forget the cooking and clothes washing.

224
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,410
I'll go abroad after being discharged from the hospital.

225
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,490
Does it mean that we won't meet again?

226
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,480
Maybe.

227
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,380
Then...

228
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,550
Brother,

229
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,010
when you're discharged,

230
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,150
come with me to call the police.

231
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,950
You've thought it through?

232
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,380
Brother,

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,310
I admire people like you.

234
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,590
I want to be someone like you.

235
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,810
It's been less than a year since I graduated from high school.

236
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,530
I can still study hard and try to go to college.

237
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,730
I think

238
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,680
I was so ignorant and inexperienced.

239
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,910
That's why I was cheated.

240
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,040
I've searched online all day for information about

241
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,170
what to do after being raped.

242
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,750
I've seen many girls who

243
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,780
swallowed their pains,

244
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,430
so those rapers would

245
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,440
hurt more people.

246
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,480
I want to call the police.

247
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,160
Okay, I promise you.

248
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,910
I'll get discharged as soon as possible and call the police with you.

249
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,020
By the way,

250
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,310
I'll tell Dr. Du

251
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,360
to keep the evidence.

252
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,160
Miss,

253
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
I know I'm handsome,

254
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,390
but you can't look at me like that.

255
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,130
Miemie.

256
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,500
How do you know my nickname?

257
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,860
I was right.

258
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,420
I'm Aunt Wang Ying.

259
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,300
Aunt Ying?

260
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,090
Just call me Bai.

261
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,610
Miemie is what my mother called me

262
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,310
when I was a child.

263
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,020
Bai.

264
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,660
Here, Bai.

265
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,460
-Thanks, Aunt Ying. -Drink some water. -OK.

266
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,700
Be careful. It's hot.

267
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,380
Head Nurse Wang.

268
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,190
Who is this handsome guy?

269
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,750
Hello.

270
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,110
Bai.

271
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,220
Have you got married?

272
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,700
Not yet.

273
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,100
Good.

274
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,350
Add him on WeChat.

275
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,950
Come on, add him on WeChat.

276
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,210
These two are my soldiers.

277
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,190
They're not married yet. They're nice.

278
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Head Nurse Wang.

279
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,320
I'll pass.

280
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,240
I don't know how to talk to handsome guys.

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,790
I'm clumsy of speech.

282
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,380
Look at you.

283
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

284
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,300
I'll add you.

285
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,940
You failed at the critical moment.

286
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,970
Look at her.

287
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,100
Liu Nianbai.

288
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,070
Yes.

289
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,080
Bai

290
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,030
is my teacher's son.

291
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
His mother was the legendary nurse

292
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,320
of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Shengji Hospital.

293
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,470
When he was born,

294
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,050
I was the one who hold him.

295
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,650
You know, when he was born,

296
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,960
he was crying so loudly.

297
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,440
When I was cutting his umbilical cord,

298
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,590
his feet hit

299
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,250
right in my face.

300
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,380
My hands were shaking so terribly

301
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,020
that I almost cut his...

302
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,100
Aunt Ying, it was such an embarrassing scene.

303
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,940
Don't mention it in front of

304
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,780
the two beautiful girls.

305
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,060
Okay, you may go and do your work.

306
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,150
Bye bye.

307
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,900
Bye bye.

308
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,140
I always check your Wechat Moments.

309
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,750
You look handsome in the photos.

310
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,060
I didn't expect you are more handsome in person.

311
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,890
Of course.

312
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,380
Aunt Ying, you haven't changed at all.

313
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,220
If your mother

314
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,500
could see what you're like today,

315
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,780
she would be so happy.

316
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,650
She had a great personality,

317
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,370
and she had

318
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,530
a beautiful son like you.

319
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,730
Why did she do that?

320
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,080
Why did she commit suicide?

321
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,080
Aunt Ying, what did you say?

322
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:06,780
I'm sorry, Bai.

323
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,390
I shouldn't have brought up the past.

324
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,800
You said my mom committed suicide?

325
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,480
My dad always told me

326
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,730
she died in a car accident.

327
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,380
I have such a big mouth.

328
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,820
Do you know why she committed suicide?

329
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,790
Aunt Ying, you are my mom's student.

330
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,900
She was so nice to you.

331
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,480
You have to tell me.

332
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,230
I don't know.

333
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,450
Maybe...

334
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,180
I must have remembered wrongly.

335
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,980
All right.

336
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,380
Close the skull.

337
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,170
The operation is successful.

338
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,070
Jesus.

339
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,010
Successful.

340
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,240
Let's go celebrate your birthday.

341
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,210
We still have time to eat the cake.

342
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,060
No one bought me a cake.

343

Feng Yuanhang forgot again?

344
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,150
He forgot last year,

345
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,220
and he forgot this year?

346
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,060
Never mind.

347
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,320
A family of two doctors

348
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,950

350

This is destiny.

351
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,760
I bought a cake for you.

When did you buy it?

she died in a car accident.

367

Why didn't you tell me

368
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,810
she committed suicide?

369
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,210
What does her death have to do with you?

You cheated on her?

373
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,540
Nonsense!

374
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,790
I'm not going to talk about nonsense

375
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,200
like this in public.

376
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,060
If you don't tell me,

377
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,280
I won't give you my liver.

378

379

389
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,500
I can't

390
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,020
handle a situation like this.

391

It's okay.

392
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,960
The baby is still young.

393
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,670
When it turns seven or eight months old,

394
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,980
it would be tiring.

How should I tell her?

512
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,090
She's ready for the wedding.

513
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,730
She kept calling me and

514
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,660
texting me on WeChat.

515
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,470
What should I do?

516
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,620
That's your business.

517
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,930
You always know your own mind, right?

518
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,200
Hey, that resident.

519
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,010
I want an injection of Oxytocin.

520
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,450
I've told you.

521
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,150
The due date

522
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:05,980
is just an estimation.

523
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,510
Between 40 and 41 weeks,

524
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,340
a pregnancy is considered normal.

525
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,970
Only after 41 weeks

526
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,060
without signs of delivery

527
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,290
will you get induced.

528
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,350
And your fetus

529
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,020
is still very stable.

530
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,340
It's within 41 weeks.

531
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,310
You can't get injection of Oxytocin.

532
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,940
I don't want to waste my time in the hospital.

533
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,040
I can't afford it.

534
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,440
I want to get injection now.

535
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,130
Medical advice

536
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
will only be given according to the indications.

537
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,420
Don't be so formal.

538
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,350
I'm not an ordinary people

539
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,360
who can be fooled by you.

540
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,020
I know

541
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,340
you need to

542
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,480
increase the rate of the beds.

543
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,560
If I'm discharged,

544
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,440
other pregnant women

545
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,200
can move in.

546
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,100
As for me,

547
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,990
I need to

548
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,140
improve my work efficiency

549
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,700
and reduce the time wasting here.

550
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,380
Besides, Director Tian told me

551
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,120
I can find you

552
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,980
if I have any request

553
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,290
and you would try your best to cooperate.

554
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,070
I will try my best to cooperate.

555
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,720
But it doesn't mean I'll cooperate

556
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,510
if your request is unreasonable.

557
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,900
Madam,

558
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,890
I'm the attending physician here.

559
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,760
My name is Li Junxiao.

560
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,770
What Dr. Du said

561
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,990
is right.

562
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,010
Medical advice

563
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,890
will only be given according to the indications.

564
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,120
Giving birth

565
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,400
is a big deal.

566
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,600
There's no need to rush.

567
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,180
Well...

568
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,580
You

569
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,260
are pregnant now.

570
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,570
Because of the progesterone,

571
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,850
your emotion may be unstable.

572
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,740
Could you

573
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,180
call your husband here

574
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,270
and let us communication with him?

575
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:11,900
No need.

576
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,050
I can make my own decision.

577
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,900
I think we should call him here.

578
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,340
I hope you can make the decision

579
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,450
with your family.

580
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,990
I'm busy and he's busy.

581
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,580
And my body is mine.

582
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,640
I don't need to discuss with him.

583
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,650
Let me tell you now.

584
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,090
As your doctor,

585
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,990
I'm in charge of your body now.

586
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,960
You must discuss with me.

587
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,340
Now I disagree.

588
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,410
I don't want to waste time with you.

589
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,480
I'll go find Director Tian.

590
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,160
He won't allow you to get injection, either.

591
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,370
What are you trying to say?

592
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,070
Do you have a grievance

593
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:48,830
in your heart now?

594
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,500
Do you think

595
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,210
she was tough

596
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,410
and unreasonable?

597
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,400
Can you understand

598
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,670
how others feel

599
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,570
when being with you?

600
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,000
No.

601
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:04,940
Okay.

602
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,610
Take your time to feel it.

603
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,570
A tough lady in pursuit of her career

604
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,620
will end up like this.

605
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,570
Her husband is not around even when she's about to give birth.

606
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,580
Maybe she

607
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,300
doesn't have a husband at all.

608
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,520
It's not that she doesn't need a man.

609
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,300
It's because no man

610
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,180
is willing to

611
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,090
be responsible for a woman like her.

612
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,400
Why does a woman

613
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,300
need a man to be responsible for her?

614
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,270
A woman can be responsible for herself,

615
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,790
can't she?

616
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:25,950
Du Di.

617
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,290
Stop pretending

618
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,050
you're a tough lady.

619
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,470
You are not qualified now.

620
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,710
Given your EQ,

621
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,370
you're not able to be the chief resident.

622
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,740
Why can't I

623
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,050
talk to her nicely?

624
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,380
Hello, sister.

625
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,320
It's really alright.

626
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,500
She didn't answer your phone

627
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,930
maybe because she's in surgery.

628
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,290
Yes, I'm busy too.

629
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,910
I didn't see her.

630
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,370
Yes. Yes. Yes.

631
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,460
I know.

632
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,040
I'll take it seriously.

633
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,990
I need to go to the delivery room.

634
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,950
I'm hanging up.

635
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,490
Liu Nianbai.

636
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,530
Why are you here?

637
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,850
Miss,

638
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,510
could you help me check

639
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,700
if Head Nurse Wang Ying

640
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,360
is inside?

641
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,750
How could she be inside?

642
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,630
I saw her

643
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,300
in the Inpatient Department.

644
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,730
She was busy asking everyone

645
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,780
to go out for lunch.

646
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,750
There's a back door here.

647
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,390
I was too naive.

648
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,690
What are you doing?

649
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,020
Inducing delivery.

650
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,960
The doctor said it was used to relieve the pain

651
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,890
caused by uterine contractions.

652
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,690
You have uterine contractions now?

653
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,160
Congratulations.

654
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,720
Not yet.

655
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,950
I've asked someone to find connections.

656
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,530
They will give me an injection of Oxytocin.

657
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,660
You need to find connections for an injection of Oxytocin?

658
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,220
The hospital really has no conscience.

659
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,910
No, I wanted to get injection,

660
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,930
but they refused.

661
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,390
So I have to find connections to help me.

662
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,710
Are you in a hurry

663
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,590
to give birth?

664
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,340
Yes.

665
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,850
And it must be a natural birth.

666
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,680
Because only those who have a natural birth

667
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,070
can be discharged 24 hours after delivery.

668
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,600
If I have a C-section,

669
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,260
I have to stay in the hospital for three days.

670
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,880
So I'm definitely not going to have a C-section.

671
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,400
Are you gonna give up the postpartum confinement?

672
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,370
I'm not gonna do it.

673
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,200
Lying in bed for a month

674
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,010
after giving birth?

675
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,680
That's what a woman

676
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,180
who has nothing to do will do.

677
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,010
You...

678
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,760
You're amazing.

679
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,110
You know your own mind.

680
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,600
But I don't.

681
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,560
I have to listen to my mother-in-law

682
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,590
and my husband.

683
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,250
Especially after

684
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,770
I lost two kids,

685
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,340
they are eager to

686
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,580
to isolate me

687
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,070
and prevent me from contacting anyone.

688
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:35,910
You really don't know

689
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,630
how you lost

690
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,530
the two kids of yours?

691
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,340
I don't know.

692
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,500
When I was giving birth to

693
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,020
my first child,

694
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,910
I was in labor three days and three nights.

695
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,270
It was so painful

696
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,370
that I almost fainted.

697
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,510
That's when the baby was born.

698
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,320
I was fuzzy-headed

699
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,550
when the baby died.

700
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,850
I knew nothing.

701
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,910
It was fast

702
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,990
to give birth to my second child.

703
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,640
The baby was lying by my side

704
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,400
for several hours.

705
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,680
But I thought it was strange.

706
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,800
The baby was so quiet.

707
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,530
He didn't cry or move.

708
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,840
I got up

709
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,910
and took a closer look.

710
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,090
The baby's face has already turned purple.

711
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,450
Then we sent him

712
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,820
to the Department of Pediatrics.

713
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,010
It hadn't been long

714
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,510
before they said the baby died.

715
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,020
Later, the doctor asked us

716
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,210
to do the autopsy.

717
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,140
Actually, I wanted to do an autopsy.

718
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,090
But my mother-in-law didn't agree.

719
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,780
She even made a scene

720
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,760
and sued the hospital.

721
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,950
But she didn't win.

722
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,910
It's said that all the procedures in the hospital

723
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,220
are legal.

724
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,870
So my mother-in-law said

725
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,520
we must come to a big hospital this time.

726
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,380
And I...

727
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,880
I have to do a C-section.

728
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,010
You can't listen to her anymore.

729
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
It's not your fault.

730
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,780
Your body is yours.

731
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,780
You must be responsible for yourself.

732
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,850
Once a woman is pregnant,

733
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,910
her body will no longer belong to herself.

734
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,440
A wife is a woman.

735
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,480
The container for a baby

736
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,590
is a woman.

737
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,200
A mother is a woman.

738
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,780
A mother-in-law is a woman.

739
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,580
Who cares

740
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,850
what women are like as themselves?

741
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,250
I like this saying.

742
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,190
On ne naît pas femme:

743
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,630
on le devient!

744
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,940
What does it mean?

745
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,300
One is not born a woman,

746
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,860
but becomes one.

747
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,950
I refused to compromise.

748
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,210
So I had my first baby

749
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,070
until 40.

750
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,420
You had your first baby at 40?

751
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,700
After I graduated from university,

752
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,050
I started my career as an intern

753
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,540
and kept going up

754
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,980
until I became

755
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,020
the CEO of the company.

756
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,180
I didn't dare to relax for a second.

757
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,010
Because as long as I relax,

758
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,240
others will replace me.

759
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,660
Even when I got married,

760
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,220
I only took two days off.

761
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,050
Then I got pregnant.

762
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,390
Every week,

763
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,140
people would ask the chairman of the company:

764
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,510
How is she?

765
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,710
Does she need to ask for leave?

766
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,180
I don't give a damn.

767
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,620
I tried my best to build up my body

768
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,490
while working.

769
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,040
Fortunately, this baby did a good job.

770
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,180
When I was pregnant,

771
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:03,940
I didn't have any pregnancy reaction.

772
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,550
I insisted on working

773
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,420
until yesterday.

774
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,140
Gosh.

775
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,980
You are too harsh to yourself.

776
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,010
In the world of work,

777
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,030
if you don't be harsh to yourself today,

778
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,660
someone will be harsher to you tomorrow.

779
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,000
It's especially true for women.

780
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,830
If I'm not around for more than three days,

781
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,000
someone will replace me

782
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,080
at work.

783
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,420
I'm very capable,

784
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,280
but as long as the alternate

785
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,910
is a little better than me

786
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,870
in a certain aspect,

787
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,530
people will say

788
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,510
he does a pretty good job.

789
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,300
And then?

790
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,400
I don't have to go back to work.

791
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,180
There is only one CEO

792
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,300
in a company.

793
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,980
If I lose my position,

794
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,700
I have no choice but to be marginalized.

795
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,620
My hard work of over 20 years

796
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,620
will be a waste.

797
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,200
I really admire you.

798
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,830
You have such a good career.

799
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,040
For the past decades,

800
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,460
I've only spent time giving birth.

801
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,250
But I actually

802
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,490
like kids.

803
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,630
I always thought

804
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,100
if I have two or three kids

805
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,540
around me calling me mom

806
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,750
every day,

807
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,870
I will feel so happy.

808
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,610
I didn't expect...

809
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,750
Besides the two kids that died after birth,

810
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,260
I also lost two babies due to miscarriage.

811
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,220
And my health

812
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,350
is getting worse.

813
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,400
If this baby

814
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,560
can't survive,

815
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,950
I really don't know

816
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,020
what to do.

817
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,730
You mean

818
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,100
you've lost four babies?

819
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,570
Did you tell the doctor?

820
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,110
No.

821
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,350
My mother-in-law told me

822
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,830
not to tell anyone.

823
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,740
It's so embarrassing.

824
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,410
You can't listen to her anymore.

825
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,010
I hate

826
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,770
those doctors

827
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,260
who act like they're doing their job,

828
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,190
but you must

829
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,190
tell them

830
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,940
your real situation.

831
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,300
I dare not.

832
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,570
My mother-in-law will make a scene.

833
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,340
Are you gonna protect this baby

834
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,590
on your own

835
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,540
or watch it go wrong?

836
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,700
It's up to you.

837
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,360
Do you want some?

838
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,680
I bought two cups.

839
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,770
This one

840
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,830
is on me.

841
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,400
Forget it.

842
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,020
I don't want to drink.

843
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,460
You don't have a fever.

844
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,950
What's wrong with you today?

845
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,110
You said

846
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,640
milk tea is your blood.

847
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,950
Only when milk tea

848
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,100
is flowing in your blood vessel

849
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,710
can you think clearly.

850
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,710
From now on,

851
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,970
I quit milk tea.

852
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,130
A cup of milk tea contains

853
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,340
three times as much caffeine as a cup of coffee,

854
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,920
and ten times as much sugar as a can of Coca-Cola.

855
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,670
Don't you know

856
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,500
your situation?

857
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,360
What situation?

858
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,170
Congrui, what situation are you in?

859
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,790
What situation are you guys in?

860
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,170
Nothing.

861
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,020
There is a handsome boy today.

862
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,050
Stop talking.

863
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,540
Why didn't I see him?

864
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,400
Where is he?

865
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,460
The director is here.

866
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,800
Is this the one?

867
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,760
Stop him for me.

868
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,700
I'll buy you milk tea tomorrow.

869
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,650
Aunt Ying.

870
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,800
You can't go there.

871
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,640
You can't go.

872
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,610
-You can't go. -What are you doing?

873
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,640
Be careful.

874
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,400
What are you doing?

875
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,460
Why are you dashing around in the ward?

876
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,180
I'm sorry.

877
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,100
I'm sorry.

878
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,100
Are you okay?

879
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,010
I'm fine.

880
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,070
Lost two babies?

881
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,130
It may be the gene problem.

882
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,660
What did you say?

883
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,220
This medical record...

884
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,600
It's said that

885
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,960
the patient has lost two babies.

886
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,940
And the babies died within 12 hours.

887
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:43,980
Didn't you check

888
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,350
the genes of the couple?

889
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
40 years old.

890
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,360
If it's a genetic disease,

891
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,980
I'm afraid she has lost more than two babies.

892
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,050
It's possible that she had frequent miscarriage.

893
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,940
I've never heard that she had any miscarriage.

894
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,690
But this situation

895
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,050
is really rare.

896
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:00,990
Is it possible that

897
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,940
she has a genetic disease?

898
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,980
Genetic disease means gene problems.

899
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,910
As for what the specific

900
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,580
gene problem it is,

901
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,000
we need further tests.

902
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,840
But I suggest that

903
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,610
you should check

904
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,150
if there is a problem with the imprinted genes.

905
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,590
The characteristic of genomic imprinting disease is that

906
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,719
the genes from both the father and the mother

907
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,940
show gene overexpression

908
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,389
or gene silencing

909
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,429
at the same time.

910
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,659
It's common that the parents are normal,

911
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,790
but their babies

912
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,969
have congenital diseases.

913
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,219
The diagnosis requires

914
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,020
a whole exome sequencing

915
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,030
of both the parents

916
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,040
and the baby who is clinically abnormal.

917
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,360
-It's totally possible. -It's totally possible.

918
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:34,909
I remember

919
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,179
there's a paper about this.

920
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,870
Truncating Mutations of MAGEL2

921
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,389
Cause Prader-Willi Phenotypes and Autism.

922
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,650
It's a paper about

923
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,679
Schaaf-Yang syndrome

924
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,190
published on

925
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,320
Nature Genetics.

926
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,650
I'll go find Director Tian.

927
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,420
Slow down.

928
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,989
Du Trio Wolves,

929
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,270
if you are too anxious about me,

930
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,140
I'll be angry.

931
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,480
Du Trio Wolves?

932
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,360
A wolf?

933
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,800
None of your business.

934
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,270
To be on the safe side,

935
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,490
do a genetic testing.

936
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,210
If it's a case of imprinted gene,

937
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,630
I'm afraid

938
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,340
she can’t keep her baby.

939
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,270
Director Tian,

940
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,990
please help them

941
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,110
keep the baby.

942
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,390
It's hard to say.

943
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,670
Imprinted gene

944
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,140
is a battle between the genes

945
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:21,770
from the father and the mother.

946
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,410
If one gets the upper hand,

947
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,830
the other will be suppressed.

948
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,730
It's a competition between

949
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,470
the father's gene and the mother's gene

950
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,730
when they are passed to the next generation.

951
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,710
If the genomic imprinting

952
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,540
goes wrong,

953
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,150
many diseases will be caused.

954
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,930
This is Director Zhang's research interests.

955
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,000
Anyway,

956
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,540
let the couple

957
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,860
have a genetic testing.

958
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:44,980
Okay.

959
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,080
It's good of you to think about this.

960
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,040
Keep it up.

961
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,790
It seems that you can become

962
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
a clinical expert.

963
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,710
Am I that bad at clinical job

964
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,090
in the leader's eyes?

965
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,350
Hello.

966
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,530
I’m Congrui.

967
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,180
I’ve talked to Director Tian.

968
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,320
The reason why your baby died

969
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,200
is very likely because of

970
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,580
genetic incompatibility.

971
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,600
You need to do a genetic testing

972
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,350
as soon as possible.

973
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,360
No, that's impossible.

974
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,590
We're not close relative.

975
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,050
I didn't say you're close relative.

976
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,320
The probability of genetic incompatibility

977
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,680
is only 1 in 10,000.

978
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,060
Your wife has been pregnant three times.

979
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,190
She's 40 now.

980
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,710
If she fails this time,

981
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,020
she will be in danger.

982
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,690
Can you trust me?

983
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,830
I really want to

984
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,800
keep your child.

985
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,910
I really can't bear to see

986
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,580
a mother who

987
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,600
has been pregnant so many times

988
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,090
and lost her babies so many times.

989
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,320
I need to

990
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,870
discuss with my mom.

991
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,860
All these years,

992
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,140
she always cried all night

993
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,370
because of the death of the babies.

994
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,950
She's so worried that she has a heart problem.

995
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,820
We can only follow her

996
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,390
on some certain things.

997
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,330
I'm afraid she would become too anxious.

998
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,940
I need to take some time to

999
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,900
explain this to her.

1000
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,120
Please be quick! Be quick!

1001
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,390
Your wife is about to give birth.

1002
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,860
Okay.

1003
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,110
I've finished the examination.

1004
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,950
I'm coming back.

1005
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,350
It's his first time to hear this.

1006
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,770
So he couldn't accept it.

1007
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,870
I will persuade him.

1008
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,410
Forget it.

1009
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,940
You don't have to persuade him.

1010
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,990
He has always thought that

1011
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,270
I left him abroad

1012
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,400
because I don't love him.

1013
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,480
Even if this thing didn't happen,

1014
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,630
he wouldn't treat me well.

1015
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,970
Didn't you say

1016
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,420
he was sent abroad at such a young age?

1017
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,930
He had no family around.

1018
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,590
It's understandable that he couldn't understand you.

1019
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,670
Forget it. Say no more.

1020
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,110
I know him better than you do.

1021
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,310
In fact,

1022
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,340
he's been thinking of you.

1023
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,590
But now,

1024
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,600
he's not ready yet.

1025
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,890
A neighbor knows him better

1026
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,430
than his father.

1027
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,680
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

1028
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:58,970
Is everything good with

1029
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,840
your wife's parents?

1030
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,100
They're fine.

1031
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,150
A few days ago,

1032
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,340
my father-in-law was obsessed with photography.

1033
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,450
I just bought him

1034
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,210
a full set of camera lens.

1035
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,750
He took my mother-in-law out

1036
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,500
to take photos every day.

1037
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,710
One likes to take photos,

1038
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,680
and the other likes to be photographed.

1039
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,660
Both of them are very happy.

1040
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,240
I watched you grow up.

1041
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,620
When you played football,

1042
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,290
our windows would be in trouble.

1043
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,620
Your parents have given us

1044
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,450
numerous windows for compensation.

1045
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,990
Now you've grown into

1046
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,690
a man

1047
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,210
who has affection and faith.

1048
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:29,820
I'm far from that.

1049
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,060
I'm responsible for them.

1050
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,660
You have

1051
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,080
too many responsibilities

1052
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,210
and carry too many burdens.

1053
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,050
You're such a great doctor.

1054
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,850
But you only think about these responsibilities

1055
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,790
and don't pay much attention to your career.

1056
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,910
Don't you think it's a pity?

1057
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,730
Those doctors of your peers

1058
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,820
have become directors.

1059
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,620
But now,

1060
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,600
you're still an attending physician.

1061
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,530
If you need papers to get promotion,

1062
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,970
we can write a few articles together.

1063
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:52,770
For example,

1064
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,510
cerebral infarction during pregnancy.

1065
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,180
You'll be the first author.

1066
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,500
Don't worry about me.

1067
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,450
What's the use of a good paper?

1068
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,380
It can't save the people around you.

1069
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,830
Cherishing the people around you

1070
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,760
is the most important.

1071
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,020
If only Bai was as sensible

1072
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,850
as you.

1073
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,090
Di.

1074
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,770
You don't eat and you don't let others eat,

1075
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,280
right?

1076
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,620
Don't keep your eyes on the pot

1077
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,080
while eating from a bowl, okay?

1078
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,260
You're the boss.

1079
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,570
You must be united and friendly, understand?

1080
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:33,730
I'm talking to you, Di.

1081
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,880
Who allowed you to call him Di?

1082
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:36,920
Didn't I tell you?

1083
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,780
Don't give my name

1084
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,900
to a big male cat.

1085
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,240
Look how similar he is to you.

1086
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,130
Handsome, cool and tough.

1087
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,070
He won't allow himself to come off second best.

1088
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,150
Rui, you've gained weight again.

1089
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,710
Did you

1090
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,950
secretly feed her

1091
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,740
with extra food?

1092
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,780
Can't you tell she's pregnant?

1093
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,170
She's not fat.

1094
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,450
She's pregnant again?

1095
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,140
Let's get her sterilized after she gives birth.

1096
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,030
No.

1097
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,910
You have no right

1098
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,440
to deprive her right to give birth.

1099
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,070
To get stray cats sterilized

1100
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,820
is a kind of humanitarian concern.

1101
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,230
It's to prevent them

1102
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,020
from diseases of reproductive organ.

1103
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,910
It also avoids

1104
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,290
more wandering descendants.

1105
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,860
We can't keep

1106
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,550
all of her babies

1107
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,620
in this cage.

1108
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,670
That's what human beings think.

1109
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,070
Have you asked how the cat feels?

1110
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,430
I don't agree

1111
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,360
to get her sterilized.

1112
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,110
I'll take care of her babies.

1113
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,540
Comrades,

1114
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,490
I'm leaving.

1115
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,660
What are you saying?

1116
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,690
I quit.

1117
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,360
I can't compete with you two anyway.

1118
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,850
There's only one spot.

1119
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,110
You two can compete.

1120
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,250
You are all Challengers.

1121
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,900
I'm just a Bronze. Why do I have to compete with you?

1122
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,430
Besides,

1123
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,060
I can't stand the head nurse anymore.

1124
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,510
I'm not that capable, so what?

1125
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,020
Does she have to

1126
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,060
put on a fierce look all day long?

1127
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,750
You've been on rotation for two years.

1128
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,560
It's not easy.

1129
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,390
It's a pity

1130
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,320
to leave now.

1131
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,190
I definitely can't pass

1132
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,120
the examination of standardized training.

1133
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,310
Even if I pass it after a few years,

1134
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,190
who can stand

1135
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,260
Shengji's work pressure?

1136
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,110
Only people like you who has been

1137
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,030
in Shengji Medical College for eight years

1138
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,780
from undergraduate to PhD

1139
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,910
can adapt to this rhythm.

1140
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,370
I'll pass.

1141
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,640
Bye bye.

1142
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,870
Bed 31.

1143
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,550
I'm here to say goodbye.

1144
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,410
Goodbye?

1145
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,160
Yes.

1146
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,520
Where are you going?

1147
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,230
I never told you.

1148
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:45,920
Actually, my family

1149
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,180
runs a private hospital.

1150
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,360
My dad wanted me to enter Shengji's standardized training

1151
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,070
because he hoped

1152
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,140
I could be an attending physician.

1153
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,110
And then

1154
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,320
I would go back to our own hospital.

1155
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,220
With the title of a great doctor in Shengji Hospital,

1156
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:54,890
I'll bring honor to our own hospital.

1157
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:55,960
Now it seems

1158
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,430
I'm not that capable.

1159
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,670
I can only find him

1160
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,530
a son-in-law in Shengji.

1161
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:04,880
Then...

1162
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,710
I wish you success.

1163
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,250
Hello.

1164
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:10,900
Dr. Li.

1165
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,830
You're not here yet? Hurry up.

1166
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,200
Okay.

1167
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,500
I'll say one last thing.

1168
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:16,410
Dr. Li.

1169
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,710
Shengji Hospital suits you very well.

1170
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,980
But Du Di doesn't suit you.

1171
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,430
The door of my hospital

1172
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,220
is always open for you.

1173
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,550
Honey,

1174
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,810
I've only been pregnant for over fifty days.

1175
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,900
I'm constantly sleepy and exhausted.

1176
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,990
Those mothers

1177
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,540
have been pregnant for such a long time.

1178
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,870
How did they make it?

1179
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,630
From conception to delivery,

1180
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,720
this is only the first phase.

1181
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,580
There's still a long way to go.

1182
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:56,940
I don't want to

1183
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,070
care about other things.

1184
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,180
I just want to have

1185
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,550
my baby safely.
