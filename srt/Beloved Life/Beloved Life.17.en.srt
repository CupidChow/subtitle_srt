[Episode 17]

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,590
You two are a couple.

5
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:40,440
No.

6
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,820
Not yet.

7
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,180
Not yet?

8
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,160
Then you're moving in that direction, right?

9
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,200
I'll do my best.

10
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,500
Where is Sichen?

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,590
He got punished and is copying homework by hand.

12
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,650
The teacher told me

13
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,130
she'd give me a call after he's finished.

14
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,260
He had another fight with a classmate?

15
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,170
I'm going to the bathroom.

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
You enjoy.

17
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,510
I…

18
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,220
I'll go check out

19
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,060
how my teacher's doing.

20
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,760
Go.

21
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,920
Director Huang, your back injury…

22
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,770
Close the door.

23
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,540
Don't tell anyone.

24
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,270
Mrs. Huang, the injury

25
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,300
seems like whips.

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,650
He hit you?

27
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,540
What's happening between you two?

28
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,800
I thought you loved each other.

29
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,150
There's nothing wrong between us.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,650
It's a misunderstanding.

31
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,740
Mrs. Huang

32
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,120
if it's gotten too much for you,

33
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,610
please don't keep it to yourself.

34
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,420
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

35
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,680
I came in just now

36
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,720
and slipped on the floor.

37
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,560
I'm okay now.

38
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,540
I need to use the bathroom.

39
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,240
Please get out.

40
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,590
Out.

41
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,500
He's doing well

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,560
in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

43
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,900
It doesn't look like he's messing around.

44
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,480
The research project

45
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,260
that the hospital and his laboratory are working together on

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,130
will soon be launched.

47
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,860
And he's in love

48
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,320
with the best doctor in the department.

49
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,180
What kind of a girl

50
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:54,970
is she?

51
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,660
Stubborn and aspirational.

52
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,590
She is willing to go through many hardships

53
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,960
to achieve her goals.

54
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,830
Even the girl he likes

55
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,720
has his mother's personality.

56
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,090
Oh, right.

57
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,820
September 15 is near.

58
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,130
Shall I order flowers for you?

59
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,390
How time flies.

60
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,850
Wei,

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,910
please order

62
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,940
a bouquet for me.

63
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,080
Still peonies?

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,540
Yes.

65
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,860
Thank you for remembering that.

66
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,110
I think you and your son

67
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,090
are quite alike.

68
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,659
I suggest that you two

69
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,070
clear the air as soon as possible.

70
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
What pain would be more

71
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,230
than the loss of a loved one?

72
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,650
I've got an operation. See you.

73
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:44,990
Go ahead.

74
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,850
In the blink of an eye,

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,760
you have been gone for nearly 20 years.

76
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,800
Our son

77
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,680
sees me as an enemy.

78
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,780
I'm not sure

79
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,890
if you'd be happy about it.

80
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,870
He's now working

81
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,710
in the department you once worked in,

82
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
and has fallen in love

83
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,580
with a girl who's just like you.

84
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,680
I think it's time

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,290
to tell him what happened in the past.

86
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,390
I always treated him like a child,

87
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,310
but now,

88
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,830
he's capable of threatening me.

89
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,480
15th.

90
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,100
15th, then.

91
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll give him

92
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,070
what you left on that day.

93
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,210
From then on,

94
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,090
maybe he won't speak to me again,

95
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,250
maybe he'll hate me,

96
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,730
I'll resign myself to my fate.

97
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,940
Thank you,

98
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,700
all the O.B. experts here,

99
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,610
for introducing some cutting-edge cases

100
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,820
of the practical use of hysteroscope.

101
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,190
Well, this is the end of our session

102
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,460
in the morning.

103
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,310
Now, we'll have lunch

104
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,230
at the dining hall.

105
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,310
The meeting will begin

106
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,610
at 2 p.m. sharp.

107
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,340
Thank you, meeting adjourned.

108
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,860
Director Tian, see you.

109
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,680
See you.

110
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,690
Director Tian, Director Tian.

111
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,630
Your hospital

112
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,090
has been quiet recently.

113
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,110
In the past, you would always

114
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,280
take the stage in every academic session.

115
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,740
How come you only

116
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,010
came with one case?

117
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,930
That's not very

118
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,110
Shengji style.

119
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,940
Too many expectant mothers

120
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,240
in our hospital lately. We're up to our necks.

121
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,960
We didn't have time to make preparations.

122
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,659
Unlike your hospital,

123
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,940
you have a big crew.

124
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,520
You're doing well both

125
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,250
in academic and clinical fields.

126
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,460
No, no.

127
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,400
Only with a big shot

128
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,100
like you on board

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,460
could we

130
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,060
be called a big crew.

131
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,320
Shengji is good.

132
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,940
But due to its past burden,

133
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,620
the pressure is big while the chance is small.

134
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,680
Director Tian, you're in charge of the whole situation.

135
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,430
Have you ever considered

136
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,830
a less stressful environment?

137
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,500
I'm used to pressure.

138
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,190
In fact, if there was

139
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,620
no pressure on me,

140
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,970
I wouldn't feel right.

141
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,610
How humorous you are, Director Tian.

142
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,860
I heard Liu Zhenghua,

143
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,740
director of the Neurosurgery Department,

144
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,450
will soon be promoted to deputy dean.

145
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,550
I assume

146
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,230
there will be more pressure

147
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,100
on your department.

148
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
That's not decided yet.

149
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,470
Really?

150
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,920
The dean of Shengji

151
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,460
was here for a meeting,

152
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
and he said a lot of good words about Liu Zhenghua.

153
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,730
That's obvious, isn't it?

154
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,710
I'm on the execution level.

155
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
All our department do

156
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,030
is performing operations day in day out.

157
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,659
So I don't know much about that.

158
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,260
Anyway, my point is,

159
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,610
our hospital

160
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,160
is always open to you, Director Tian.

161
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,480
Let's go and have lunch.

162
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,120
You go ahead.

163
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,380
I'll go grab some stuff in my room.

164
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,250
-All right.
-I'll speak to you later.

165
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,180
See you later. OK.

[Director Huang]

167
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,460
Director Huang.

168
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,520
It's not as bad as you think.

169
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,650
About

170

50-50.

171
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,020
There are two

172
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,940
voices within the leadership.

173
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,340
Some of them

174
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,440
are on Liu Zhenghua's side because

175
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,590
the Neurosurgery Department has made some major achievements

176
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,340
under his leadership.

177
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,030
If he's given

178
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,960
more resources,

179
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,780
the Neurosurgery will be

180
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,940
another famous department of the hospital.

181
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,770
Also, it is said

182
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,640
that he's going to apply to be an academician next year.

183
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,650
All these above

184
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,040
shall bring huge glory

185
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,710
to Shengji.

186
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,940
The other side

187
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,040
thinks Director Zhang's will

188
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,510
has to be inherited.

189
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,380
The Obstetric and Gynecologic Department is reputable.

190
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,660
Many people have chosen us,

191
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,750
so the department needs more support.

192
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,100
The two sides haven't reached an agreement.

193
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,860
However,

194
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,510
there's one person

195
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,220
that hasn't given his opinion.

196
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,820
That's Deputy Dean Wang.

197
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,590
Mr. Wang was promoted

198
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,490
after SARS.

199
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,600
His word has clout.

200
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,910
If he's on your side,

201
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,560
all the other neutral votes

202
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,620
will follow him.

203
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,180
In a word,

204
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,030
both departments are short of beds.

205
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,090
The emergency department doesn't like either of you.

206
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,660
Now, it'll depend on

207
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,010
who is able to convince Mr. Wang.

208
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,260
Alright, then.

209
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,640
I'll treat Mr. Wang to lunch

210
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,310
and we'll have a conversation.

211
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,740
Hello, Mr. Wang. Hi.

212
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,420
I'm Tian Yunshan

213
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,120
from the O. B. department.

214
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,140
Director Tian.

215
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,570
Is there a case so complex

216
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,990
that you had to call me personally?

217
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,700
Here's the thing.

218
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,580
We're having many expectant mothers.

219
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,160
Many were received by the emergency department.

220
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,750
We don't have enough beds.

221
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,880
It has caused trouble for the emergency department.

222
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,610
So,

223
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,810
I thought I could have lunch with you,

224
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,700
and we'd talk about

225
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,880
how to work better

226
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,690
with the emergency department.

227
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,500
That's too kind of you.

228
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,970
But I'm on a business trip

229
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,940
for an academic seminar.

230
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,070
So I don't have time at the moment.

231
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,760
We'll talk when I'm back.

232
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,440
Sure. When you're back,

233
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,810
I'll buy you lunch,

234
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,700
and we'll have a good talk.

235
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,110
No problem. Bye.

236
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,040
Yeah, bye.

237
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,720
The ballot will be held in two days.

238
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,340
It'll be too late

239
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,760
when the workers' congress returns.

240
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,070
How about

241
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,990
I go talk

242
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,490
to his senior student?

243
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,340
Well, thanks.

244
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,480
Let me buy you lunch.

245
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,510
That's unnecessary.

246
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,260
You don't have to do this.

247
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,780
I'm doing this for our department,

248
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,620
not for you.

249
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,300
Everybody knows that.

250
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,010
No need to say it out loud.

251
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,660
Look at me.

252
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,850
I have been busy the whole year.

253
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,620
I've even got gray hairs.

254
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,250
I'm really stressed.

255
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,020
It can relax me a little,

256
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,600
is that okay?

257
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,780
May I have the honor?

258
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,020
Alright, alright.

259
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,180
I'm now happy

260
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,110
that I'm not

261
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,630
the head director.

262
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,400
This way, please.

263
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,820
This restaurant is right next to the hospital,

264
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,980
but I've never tried it.

265
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,310
I heard it's good, though.

266
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,560
Yes, it is,

267
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,820
but it's not a good place for talks.

268
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,950
You'll always bump into people from work

269
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,500
every time you come here.

270
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,300
You can't talk about

271
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,020
important stuff here.

272
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,070
It's okay for an office gathering.

273
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,480
It looks like someone

274
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,620
is talking about business here.

275
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,590
Who?

276
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,120
Deputy Dean Wang.

277
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,070
Didn't he say he was out on a business trip?

278
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,900
You are late.

279
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,060
I guess he only

280
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,980
wants to avoid trouble.

281
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,580
I thought

282
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,630
Liu Zhenghua

283
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,500
was a decent man.

284
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,370
It turns out otherwise.

285
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,010
He's quite a social guy.

286
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,180
All right.

287
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,480
I need to ask him about what's happening.

288
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,320
No, no, no.

289
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,760
What if things get awkward,

290
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,520
and Mr. Wang

291
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,110
won't back you up

292
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,740
on anything anymore?

293
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,060
There's no need.

294
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,460
Come on, let's eat.

295
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,810
My baby is hungry.

296
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,050
Let me figure out a way.

297
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,400
There has to be a way.

298
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,620
Nianbai, tomorrow,

299
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,720
after making rounds,

300
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,730
you come to my office.

301
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,010
OK, Director Tian.

302
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,350
Was that cool?

303
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,870
That was cool, right?

304
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,400
Her smile is so cute.

305
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,100
What does he have?

306
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,910
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

307
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,720
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

308
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,900
Not cerebral palsy?

309
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,340
Cerebral palsy

310
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,990
is a non-progressive disorder

311
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,630
in the early stage of an infant's brain development

312
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,520
caused by various reasons

313
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,720
that happens within the first month after the childbirth.

314
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,380
But what your child has

315
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,490
is a genetic disease.

316
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,370
I don't believe it.

317
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,020
How is that possible?

318
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,750
We have spent all the money

319
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,570
on treating his cerebral palsy.

320
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,220
And we borrowed

321
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,460
a lot of money

322
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,810
to pay for the bills at Shengji

323
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,730
because we didn't

324
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,590
want to have another baby with cerebral palsy.

325
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,970
If possible,

326
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,610
I suggest your entire family

327
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,920
get a genetic test.

328
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,020
It is a type of

329
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,480
congenital purine metabolism disorder

330
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,040
caused by X-linked recessive inheritance.

331
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,580
There's a kind of enzyme

332
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,130
called hypoxanthine

333
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,980
guanine

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,450
phosphoribosyl transferase.

335
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,550
When the human body lacks this enzyme,

336
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,220
nucleotides cannot

337
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,280
be synthesized by

338
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,910
guanine and hypoxanthine

339
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,660
through salvage pathway,

340
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,080
so they will be metabolized into uric acid.

341
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,630
When there's too much

342
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,470
uric acid in the child's body fluid,

343
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,930
his brain and kidneys will be damaged,

344
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,710
causing dysautonomia

345
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,220
and atelencephalia.

346
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,500
The symptoms

347
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,030
are low IQ,

348
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,420
aggressive and destructive behaviors,

349
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,640
frequently biting lips,

350
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,140
figures and toes.

351
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,500
Hence,

352
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,220
the name, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

353
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,390
X-linked recessive inheritance

354
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:24,960
means

355
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,140
the disease is only passed down to boys.

356
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,610
So you mean our second boy

357
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,500
is also likely…

358
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,790
Yes.

359
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,560
We'll have the test right away.

360
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,770
Why didn't you tell them

361
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,240
any children with this disease could barely

362
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,540
live over 20 years?

363
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
I didn't have the heart to.

364
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,540
I didn't have the heart

365
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,010
to break the hope

366
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,800
that they just had.

367
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,340
Nor did I have the heart to tell

368
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,010
a ten-year-old

369
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,090
face to face

370
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,090
that he'd only have another ten years to live.

371
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,370
Is it curable, though?

372
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,920
I don't understand why people

373
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,380
don't do tests before pregnancy.

374
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,780
Genetic test before pregnancy

375
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,810
is the best way

376
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,400
to avoid having a child

377
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,020
with genetic diseases.

378
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,820
About the ones that have already been born,

379
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,810
I need to ask my teacher

380
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,020
if there's an operable therapy

381
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,660
for genetic diseases.

382
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,200
If their second son also had it,

383
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,890
their life would be ruined.

384
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,430
Please ask your teacher

385
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,750
to help them as much as he can.

386
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,870
If they have relevant

387
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,660
experiences overseas,

388
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,460
could they include the family

389
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,730
in the experimental therapies?

390
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,380
Domestically,

391
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,630
therapies for genetic diseases

392
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,410
are not common.

393
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,940
Head nurse, I'll do my best.

394
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,010
Thank you.

395
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,020
Dr. Liu,

396
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,960
I'm off to work.

397
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,750
This is probably

398
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,990
the most unwanted heritage

399
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,320
for any men in the world.

400
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,670
I can put this

401
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,530
in my joke.

402
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,990
Human has discovered

403
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,210
more than three thousand kinds of genetic diseases.

404
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,440
250 of which

405
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,579
only happen to males.

406
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,819
Of the pairs of chromosomes that determine sex,

407
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,640
XY is a male.

408
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,290
XX is a female.

409
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,569
When there's something wrong with the X chromosome,

410
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,940
males get a disease.

411
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,930
Females' X chromosome

412
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,920
is still healthy.

413
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,839
When there's something wrong with the Y chromosome,

414
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,240
males get a disease,

415
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,750
females have no Y chromosome.

416
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,140
So, poor men.

417
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,680
You gotta be nice to me.

418
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,170
Genetic research is really

419
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,550
good for high-quality reproduction.

420
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,300
So I hope you do your best

421
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,040
to get the project launched as soon as possible.

422
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,000
But I wonder

423
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,520
why the head nurse cares so much

424
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,340
about this family?

425
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,170
You haven't got the result yet.

426
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,230
You can't leave.

427
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,360
I don't have any more money to afford staying here.

428
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,420
What's wrong?

429
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,950
The husband's family

430
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,130
is just heartless.

431
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,280
They said the disease

432
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,050
was passed down from the mother.

433
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,760
They dropped the divorce settlement paper

434
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,750
and left.

435
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,300
I told them

436
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,910
that the second boy

437
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,980
wouldn't necessarily have the disease.

438
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,310
Am I right, Nianbai?

439
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:20,840
Does he…

440
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:25,910
Yes.

441
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,050
So…

442
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,400
What now?

443
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,930
The kid is innocent.

444
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,930
Even if they are defective,

445
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,290
we shouldn't give them up.

446
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,740
I can't do this anymore.

447
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,480
In the last decade,

448
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,810
I was worried every day.

449
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,810
I'd wake up every day

450
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,780
worrying if he

451
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,560
has hurt himself.

452
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,840
He's been in pain as well. He cries every day.

453
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,220
Now that our second boy has the same disease

454
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,980
and his dad has left,

455
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,200
I really can't do it anymore.

456
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,420
I really can't.

457
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,820
I will help you.

458
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,910
So will Dr. Liu.

459
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,870
Am I right, Dr. Liu?

460
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,260
I have spoken with the laboratory.

461
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,950
They agreed to include these two boys

462
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,100
in their experimental

463
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,770
genetic therapy,

464
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,500
and it'll be free of charge.

465
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,950
However, you'll pay for the flight tickets and the hotel room.

466
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,690
I'll pay.

467
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,460
All mothers are tough.

468
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,150
Have you heard of it?

469
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,370
You are a mother.

470
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
Both your heart and your body

471
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,300
have to be iron-hard.

472
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,540
If you are gone,

473
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,200
you can't imagine

474
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,550
all the sufferings

475
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,150
that your children will have to go through.

476
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,680
As long as you're around,

477
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,500
no matter how much pain they are in,

478
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,330
they can at least get comfort from your hugs.

479
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,100
You can wipe off their tears.

480
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,820
Do you hear me?

481
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,810
You must live well.

482
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,470
Please don't cry, mom. I'll be a good boy.

483
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,300
I'm ill,

484
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,740
but I'll be cured,

485
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,060
so I can protect you.

486
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,800
You just tell me

487
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,510
how much the tickets

488
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,380
and the hotel cost.

489
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,010
I'll try to convince my friend

490
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,330
into letting them stay in their house.

491
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,810
They have many spare houses anyway.

492
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
They'll earn a good reputation for doing charity.

493
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,220
Good boy, thank you.

494
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,940
No, thank you, head nurse.

495
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,500
Today, I realized

496
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,040
a seasoned head nurse

497
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,250
can still be soft-hearted

498
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,090
after all that she experienced.

499
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,570
Enough, stop buttering me up.

500
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,370
Get back to your work.

501
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,550
What can I do to help?

502
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,910
You just be you.

503
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,620
What do you mean, I be me?

504
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,050
Will you be working in the wards

505
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,010
or go to Director Tian's office?

506
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,140
Liu Nianbai, come back.

507
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,800
What's his problem?

508
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,590
Saying something equivocal.

509
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,300
Shanshan, did you have dinner?

510
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,660
Yes.

511
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,590
I ate a lot of meat.

512
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,590
Did granny cook meat for you?

513
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,660
Mom,

514
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,580
when will you come home today?

515
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,420
I'll come home right after work.

516
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,410
Be good at home.

517
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,800
Good boy. You're the best kid.

518
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,340
I love you, mom.

519
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,970
Shanshan, Mummy knows

520
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,240
that you are

521
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,410
the best.

522
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,270
You're a caring kid.

523
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,660
You're wonderful.

524
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,210
You're the best.

525
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,530
I'm the best.

526
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,050
Shanshan is the best.

527
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,420
You want Du Di

528
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,210
on your team, right?

529
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,140
Sure, no problem.

530
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,660
I need to ask her opinions.

531
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,030
It's not because of your recommendation.

532
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,410
She's qualified, simple as that.

533
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,230
Tell her not to worry.

534
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,140
This is the copy

535
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,450
of your mother's medical record.

536
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,500
Take your time to read it.

537

If anything confuses you,

538
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,690
just give me a call.

539
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,120
Thank you, Director Tian.

Director Zhang,

541
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,000
I had no choice.

542
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,580
Sorry for my incompetence,

543
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,870
but for the O.B. department,

544
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,630
I had to do it.

547
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,120
Mom,

548
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,110
you're still awake.

549
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,750
Miemie, what woke you up?

550
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,720
I had a bad dream.

551
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,420
What bad dream?

552
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,470
Tell me about it.

553
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,200
You didn't allow me to have candy,

554
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,830
but I had to have it, so you cried.

555
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,620
You cried very hard.

556
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,420
I apologized, but you wouldn't stop crying.

557
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,900
Why would I cry?

558
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,380
Did you see me cry before?

559
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,240
No.

560
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,120
You always smile.

561
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,950
You have a sweet tooth, don't you?

562
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,190
I'd say that it wasn't my tear,

563
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,980
it was your mouth water

564
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,820
dripping on the pillow, right?

565
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,220
Come on, lie down.

566
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,300
You can have your candy tomorrow.

567
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,340
But now,

568
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,290
have a good sleep.

569
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,850
You sleep well,

570
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,800
you grow taller, right?

571
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,040
When will you go to sleep?

572
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,900
Right now. Come on.

Myoma of uterus.

575
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,260
She was transferred from another hospital, wasn't she?

576
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,790
Yeah, yeah. They told me it was fine.

577
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,170
They said the myoma

578
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,120
could co-exist with the fetus.

579
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,170
But all of a sudden,

580
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,530
the myoma grew big.

581
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,160
She threw up and had a fever.

582
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,460
My son wasn't home.

583
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,560
We didn't know

584
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,310
what to do.

585
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,090
My son suggested

586
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,450
we sent her to Shengji Hospital.

587
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,460
We are not sure if the myoma

588
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,190
is benign or malignant.

589
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,300
Dr. Du,

590
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,140
I'll take her over.

591
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,030
Dr. Wu Congrui will be your doctor from now on.

592
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,300
Director Tian just took her in.

593
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,160
He said I'd be in charge.

594
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,600
Director Tian also said

595
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,630
that treating myoma of uterus is my specialty.

596
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,810
You hand the patient's information over to Dr. Wu.

597
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,110
This is Director Huang Yunling

598
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,470
of the Obstetric

599
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,220
and Gynecologic Department.

600
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,270
Director Huang.

601
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,290
Sister, did you see Congrui walk into the ward?

602
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,780
Yeah.

603
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,140
People all say you're the best doctor

604
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,940
in Shengji's Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

605
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,820
We'll be reassured

606
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,080
with you taking care of her.

607
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,330
-Put in a good word for Congrui.
-Thanks for your trust.

608
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,510
Although the hysteromyoma

609
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,020
is growing rapidly,

610
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,320
it should

611
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,570
be benign.

612
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,820
Benign?

613
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,370
Great. Perfect.

614
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,250
We were so worried if it was malignant.

615
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,170
The chance

616
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,060
of myoma of uterus during pregnancy

617
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,980
is less than 5%.

618
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,690
But don't worry.

619
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,550
We handled

620
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,820
cases like this before.

621
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,120
Tomorrow morning,

622
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,460
we'll hold a joint consultation

623
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,280
with several departments.

624
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,180
After that,

625
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,620
we'll set an operation date,

626
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,770
and we'll get the child

627
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,690
and the myoma out together.

628
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,310
-Good. Thank you.
-Thank you.

629
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,500
The father can't be here?

630
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,900
He works at a construction site.

631
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,020
He has been super busy.

632
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,850
He couldn't make it.

633
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,760
But that won't be a problem.

634
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,670
You can just

635
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,740
tell us if you need help.

636
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,480
OK.

637
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,980
Dr. Wu,

638
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,220
please schedule the joint consultation.

639
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,800
Sure.

640
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,430
Rest well.

641
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,560
If there's any urgency,

642
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,470
Dr. Wu will be there for you.

643
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,300
Thank you.

644
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,820
Sure, thank you so much.

645
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,160
Thank you. Thank you.

646
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,610
You said

647
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,510
Director Tian was in charge.

648
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,150
Why does

649
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,300
Director Huang interfere in?

650
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,140
Don't worry about it.

651
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,250
I did my homework.

652
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,430
Director Huang is a great doctor.

653
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,390
People have to queue up

654
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,580
to see her.

655
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,530
Is that so?

656
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

657
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,530
Director Huang

658
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,510
and Dr. Wu

659
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,520
are both good doctors.

660
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,070
Also, Dr. Wu is very thoughtful.

661
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,330
She's good at empathizing with the patient's family.

662
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,550
Dr. Du is not so good in comparison.

663
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,380
She never explains what her supervisor said

664
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,500
to the patient's family properly.

665
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,980
I didn't know that.

666
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,740
She seems professional, though.

667
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,560
Yeah.

668
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Thank you.

669
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,110
I did it.

670
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,030
I gave her compliments.

671
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,450
We've got the patient.

672
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,470
But it's a complex case.

673
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,270
You'll be very careful.

674
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,100
Nothing can go wrong.

675
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,820
Thank you, Director Huang.

676
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,650
You've finally thought it through.

677
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,460
I have a mixed feeling right now.

678
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,570
If I was a good mentor,

679
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,250
you wouldn't have to work so hard.

680
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,640
It's a bad time

681
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,220
that I got pregnant.

682
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,410
Without him,

683
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,340
I would be the head director,

684
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,800
and you would easily

685
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,990
become the chief resident.

686
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,600
Don't say that.

687
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,610
The baby is a godsend

688
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,640
no matter

689
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,560
when it comes.

690
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,180
It always comes at a right time.

691
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,620
Yes, yes.

692
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,280
I nearly forgot

693
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,370
that you're Dr. Wu,

694
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,070
the Baby Protector, the Baby Lover.

695
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,230
That's a good epithet. I'll gladly take it.

696
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,060
Hello?

697
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,540
Yes.

698
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,230
I am Lu Sichen's mother.

699
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,740
What? Police station?

700
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,500
OK. I'm coming right over.

701
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
I'll go with you.

702
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,050
No, the patient comes first.

703
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,650
Yang Shu must

704
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,740
have all the checks today.

705
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,210
And you'll schedule tomorrow's joint consultation.

706
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,420
I'll be quick.

707
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,270
Where is Director Huang?

708
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,270
I confirmed

709
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,420
the time with her last night.

710
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,450
I'll give her another call.

711
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,320
She's pregnant, be easy on her.

712
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,860
Let's wait a bit longer.

713
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,670
Sorry,

714
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,790
the number you dialed

715
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,560
is powered off.

716
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,550
Sorry…

717
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,590
Powered off?

718
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,210
Director Tian,

719
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,790
I can't get hold of Director Huang.

720
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,750
A full room of doctors

721
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,140
are waiting for her.

722
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,070
She had to take

723
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,340
the patient from me.

724
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,900
Now look,

725
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,340
the doctor in charge is missing.

726
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,390
Director Tian.

727
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,830
I'm sorry, everyone.

728
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,570
I'll join you in the consultation

729
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,470
to discuss this case.

730
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:12,740
Now, Du Di.

731
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,770
Give everyone a brief introduction.

732
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,220
OK.

733
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,250
The patient is 35 years old.

734
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,180
A primipara. Transverse fetal lie.

735
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,350
A 15-meter diameter

736
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,670
giant myoma of uterus

737
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,260
is right underneath her uterus.

738
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,190
Under the myoma

739
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,460
is a large layer of sinusoids.

740
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,900
The placenta under the sinusoids

741
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,970
stretches to the anterior uterine wall

742
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,570
from the cervix.

743
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,460
Placenta, myoma, sinusoids.

744
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,720
Three risk points of massive hemorrhage

745
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,210
formed a circle

746
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,040
around the lower half of her uterus.

747
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,450
If we go with a regular incision,

748
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,970
the myoma needs to be removed first,

749
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,930
but the sinusoids will be exposed

750
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,060
and may cause acute massive hemorrhage.

751
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,870
This is a bad option.

752
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,460
But if the incision of uterus

753
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,300
is made on the top of the myoma,

754
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,440
and the baby is delivered

755
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,300
through placental puncture,

756
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,620
during the removal of placenta,

757
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,650
the lower half of uterus

758
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,850
shall bleed heavily.

759
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,020
Bad option, as well.

760
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,260
But if the incision is made on the uterus,

761
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,290
the structure of her uterus

762
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,040
will be affected,

763
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,640
which will affect her next childbirth.

764
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,490
Also, because of her giant myoma,

765
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,720
the stitching

766
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,940
will be highly difficult as well.

767
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,120
So still, bad option.

768
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,240
So I'd like to hear your thoughts.

769
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,980
The incision spot is step one.

770
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,800
Director Tian, I have an idea.

771
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,580
Please.

772
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,290
Can the incision be made

773
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,190
at the inferior margin of the myoma?

774
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,640
That way, all the risk points of massive hemorrhage

775
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,730
can be avoided.

776
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,230
Save the mother and the baby on the line.

777
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,490
That's what I thought.

778
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,680
That way,

779
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,050
the hemorrhage volume can be reduced,

780
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,360
and the second damage

781
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,990
to the patient

782
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,820
can be avoided

783
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,620
during the removal of myoma.

784
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,400
We'll cut along the abdominal aorta

785
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,430
and adopt the balloon occlusion technique.

786
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,020
It looks like

787
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,180
the safest way so far.

788
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,130
Sorry,

789
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,920
the number you dialed is powered off.

790
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,480
Still turned off.

791
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,720
Should I go to her home?

792
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,650
I tried her home number.

793
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,940
No one answered.

794
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,490
I'm afraid something might happen to her.

795
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,060
Because she normally wouldn't do this.

796
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
Or there's another possibility.

797
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,030
She was caught up in something

798
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,330
really tricky at the police station.

799
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,220
So tricky that she didn't go home

800
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,160
and had no time to charge her cell phone.

801
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:33,790
I shouldn't have taken

802
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,930
any patient from Du Di.

803
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,020
It never ends up well

804
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,500
every time I do it.

805
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,440
I encouraged you to do it.

806
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,100
That was a good plan,

807
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,810
and a good opportunity.

808
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,450
I admit that.

809
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,860
But you know what?

810
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,130
Even though

811
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,830
I worked all night,

812
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,920
Du Di's idea

813
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,190
never crossed my mind.

814
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,850
She's better than me.

815
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,360
I won't deny it.

816
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,310
Stop blaming yourself.

817
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,660
Keep trying to reach Director Huang.

818
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,870
Ask for half a day off if you have to.

819
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,740
Go check the police station

820
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,260
near her son's school.

821
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,730
When you talk

822
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,740
to the patient and her family later,

823
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,910
you must be patient.

824
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,310
You mustn't make the same mistake

825
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,570
as you did concerning Yang Zhenzhen.

826
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,760
Come in.

827
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:29,690
Doctor,

828
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,230
I don't know

829
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,620
whose files these are.

830
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,120
When the owner's back,

831
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,560
please tell him

832
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
I'm sorry that I messed up his stuff.

833
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,800
I'm not sure

834
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,900
if everything's here.

835
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,780
Please tell him to go over the pile.

836
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,090
OK. Don't worry about it.

837
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,800
Thank you.

838
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,300
Hello?

839
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,990
OK, OK. I'm on my way.

840
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,860
The joint consultation was a success this morning.

841
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,700
Director Tian and the other directors

842
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,510
have made

843
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,180
an operation plan.

844
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,040
I will now

845
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,530
explain it to you.

846
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:33,940
OK.

847
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,190
I thought Dr. Wu and Director Huang

848
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,780
were our doctors.

849
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,170
What…

850
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,910
What are you doing here?

851
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,220
They have other business to do.

852
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,490
Director Tian has put

853
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,080
me back in charge.

854
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,060
What?

855
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,470
What the heck

856
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,670
are you doing?

857
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,550
I can't believe

858
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,650
all the changes are made carelessly.

859
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,460
Don't worry.

860
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,460
Director Tian

861
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,230
will perform the operation tomorrow.

862
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,160
Calm down,

863
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,540
my dear.

864
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,550
We'll trust Director Tian.

865
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,370
Please explain.

866
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,090
This is the consent for operation.

867
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,890
The hardest part of the operation

868
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,090
is deciding where to make the incision

869
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,950
to avoid massive hemorrhage.

870
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,720
Tumor?

871
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,380
No.

872
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,340
Yang Shu

873
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,740
has a malignant tumor.

874
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,020
Honey.

875
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,910
Here.

876
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,930
Sit down. Sit down.

877
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,680
Quickly.

878
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,880
Find the instant heart polypill in that pocket.

879
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,640
Lean back.

880
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,290
Lean back.

881
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,370
Come on.

882
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,620
Take it. Quickly. Come on.

883
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,770
Take the pill.

884
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,240
Take the pill.

885
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,020
Good.

886
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,000
Calm down. Calm down.

887
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,340
Please stay calm.

888
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,310
We can't be sure

889
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,460
that the tumor is malignant at the moment.

890
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:31,850
But that's

891
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,510
what the paper says.

892
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,170
Give it to me.

893
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
Cervical cancer?

894
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,990
Didn't you say it was myoma of uterus?

895
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,130
Wait, wait.

896
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,460
The name isn't Yang Shu

897
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,850
on the paper.

898
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,540
Is it the consent for operation

899
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,700
for us?

900
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,430
Not Yang Shu?

901
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,590
I can't believe you got this wrong.

902
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,060
This is Shengji, right?

903
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,170
Isn't Shengji the best hospital?

904
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,260
How am I supposed

905
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,130
to trust you anymore?

906
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,600
Sorry.

907
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,540
I'll get hers here.

908
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,550
This is ridiculous.

909
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,420
Honey,

910
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,390
I thought

911
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,580
she had cancer for a moment.

912
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,220
If she does have cancer,

913
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,950
what are we going to say to our boy?

914
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,140
I was so scared.

915
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,410
Didn't Director Huang

916
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,120
say it was a benign one?

917
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,820
They said Dr. Du was undependable,

918
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,670
and she really is.

919
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,660
Check what's under your table.

920
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,650
The cleaner came in

921
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,290
and dropped your documents on the floor.

922
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,670
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

923
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,620
You did it on purpose.

924
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,420
You intended to see me make a mistake.

925
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:27,770
I'm sorry.

926
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,880
This is hers.

927
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,550
I'll explain the plan to you.

928
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,380
Wait a second.

929
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,400
I'm going to let my son, Yang Shu,

930
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,900
and her former doctor, Director Liu

931
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,660
listen to your explanation together.

932
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,010
It isn't appropriate

933
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,170
for a doctor from another hospital

934
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:39,910
to listen to our plan.

935
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,070
What's wrong with that?

936
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,590
At least,

937
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,150
Director Liu

938
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
wouldn't get the wrong paper.

939
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:48,770
Please explain.

940
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,020
The incision will be made

941
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,410
at the inferior margin of the myoma.

942
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,560
Send me the X-ray film.

943
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,610
Let me see the spot.

944
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,860
It was Director Tian's decision.

945
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,390
It's not his place

946
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,340
to make a judgment.

947
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,980
Please show me the X-ray film.

948
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:01,730
I need to take a picture.

949
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,840
Make it clear.

950
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,460
OK.

951
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,080
I don't see

952
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,380
an incision spot.

953
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,920
Answer me,

954
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,340
how many operations like this did you perform before?

955
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,820
I performed myoma removal

956
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,580
operations before.

957
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,440
But

958
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,760
a giant myoma

959
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,920
of uterus during pregnancy like this?

960
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,580
No.

961
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,260
Then you have no say in this.

962
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,940
The patient's family

963
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,710
insisted that I should be involved.

964
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
I can tell they don't trust you.

965
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,300
And I should be responsible

966
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,910
for my former patient.

967
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:41,800
Dr. Du,

968
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,770
please proceed.

969
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,300
Considering the possibility

970
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,490
of massive hemorrhage during the operation…

971
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,300
Have you got

972
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,990
a plan for it?

973
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,480
How much blood are you going to use?

974
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,230
We'll adopt abdominal aortic balloon occlusion.

975
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,070
Abdominal aortic balloon occlusion

976
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,210
doesn't apply to all scenarios.

977
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,420
This is what you big hospital

978
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,350
likes to use.

979
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,920
Her myoma is so big.

980
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,500
The balloon has to be placed

981
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,650
under the X-ray.

982
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,130
Have you thought

983
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,910
about the safety of the fetus?

984
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,700
Also, the complications caused by balloon occlusion.

985
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,520
Have you thought about that?

986
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,800
What have you done?

987
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,500
Why did you hang up the call?

988
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,440
He's a doctor

989
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,630
incapable of operations

990
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,270
but only questions

991
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,560
other doctors.

992
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,780
I don't have time for him.

993
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,660
If you doubt

994
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,870
the operation plan made

995
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,420
by a director in Shengji,

996
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,340
why did you choose us in the first place?

997
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,810
I didn't even want to mention it when he was on the phone.

998
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,820
I don't need to brief

999
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,820
a doctor from another hospital.

1000
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,370
We don't doubt Shengji Hospital.

1001
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,790
We just don't trust you.

1002
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,300
I didn't

1003
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:31,820
make the plan.

1004
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,260
And I won't perform the operation.

1005
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,330
My job

1006
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,300
is to explain Director Tian's

1007
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:35,910
operation plan

1008
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,860
to you.

1009
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,520
When you fully understand it,

1010
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,220
please sign the consent.

1011
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,510
Can Director Tian

1012
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,160
come to explain the plan

1013
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,270
to us personally?

1014
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,700
Yeah.

1015
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,880
Get Director Tian here.

1016
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,470
Director Tian is in a meeting downtown.

1017
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,300
And two more operations

1018
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,190
are expecting him.

1019
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,460
If you wish to wait for him,

1020
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,810
the operation won't be performed tomorrow morning.

1021
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,130
Because without your signature

1022
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,580
on the consent,

1023
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,960
the operation room can't be prepared.

1024
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,900
and workers of other departments

1025
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,620
cannot be arranged.

1026
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,710
That way,

1027
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,190
the operation

1028
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:58,860
will have to be postponed.

1029
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,100
Director Tian

1030
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:00,940
originally planned to go

1031
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,580
on a business trip tomorrow,

1032
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,560
this is the only operation he'll do.

1033
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,940
If you wish to postpone it

1034
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,900
or find someone else to do it,

1035
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,430
you can wait for Director Tian

1036
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,550
to give you the explanation in person.

1037
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,140
You…

1038
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,070
Dad.

1039
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,510
Mom.

1040
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:11,700
Easy.

1041
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,950
I feel really terrible.

1042
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,390
If it's further delayed,

1043
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,840
I'm worried it'll be bad for the baby.

1044
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,120
Just sign the paper.

1045
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,660
It's Shengji Hospital,

1046
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,180
isn't it?

1047
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,360
Alright.

1048
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,040
Dr. Du, please continue.

1049
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,200
Is the cartoon that good?

1050
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:41,800
You wouldn't even

1051
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,710
sit still for

1052
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,620
five minutes usually.

1053
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,780
Today,

1054
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,400
you have been sitting here for half an hour.

1055
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,300
Miemie,

1056
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,800
I need to go out.

1057
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,220
I'm leaving.

1058
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,760
What's the matter?

1059
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,410
Call the ambulance.

1060
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,190
Call the ambulance.

1061
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,940
Stay away from here.

1062
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,130
No. Don't go there.

1063
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,180
I'm calling the ambulance. I'm calling.

1064
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
Mom, it's sour.

1065
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:44,920
Mom?

1066
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,410
Mom, where are you?
