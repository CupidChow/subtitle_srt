[Episode 22]

4
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,729
Mom and Dad are gone.

5
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,220
You're the only family I have.

6
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,940
I wanted you to wait until I was settled down

7
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:42,970
so I could bring you to the city.

8
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,630
Then I'd help you

9
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,009
find a man with skills

10
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,830
who could give you

11
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,300
a happy life.

12
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,210
You're already in the city now.

13
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,660
Together we can

14
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,780
work hard for several years.

15
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,020
Don't rush to any decisions, OK?

16
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,190
Now tell me, what's superior

17
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,490
and what's inferior?

18
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,620
I don't think there's anything wrong with being a courier.

19
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,710
They earn their money

20
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,220
by working hard.

21
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,510
You're just being vain now.

22
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,420
You know what?

23
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,970
You'll sooner or later regret it.

24
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,590
There must be something wrong with the medicine you gave me.

25
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,290
I'm telling you.

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,780
The coloclysis was not thorough.

27
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,420
You didn't clean out anything.

28
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,910
We couldn't possibly give you the wrong medicine.

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,590
Nothing was cleaned out

30
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,540
perhaps because you barely

31
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,650
ate anything in the last few days.

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,840
Do you think I have no idea

33
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,040
of how much I ate?

34
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,410
Go check it now!

35
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,690
Check your inventory.

36
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,930
Go check now

37
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,910
if you have one extra

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,750
pack of coloclyster.

39
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,170
Go!

40
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,220
I'm amazed

41
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,380
you can even find a problem with the coloclyster.

42
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,260
Let me remind you.

43
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,420
Before the operation,

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,680
you'll have 5, 6 more tests to do.

45
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,060
Ultrasound

46
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,420
and CT scan

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,220
might also be mistaken.

48
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,880
The blood sample  might be contaminated.

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,780
During the operation,

50
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,630
the incision

51
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,640
might be too large or too small.

52
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,910
If you keep doing this,

53
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,760
don't take the operation.

54
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,410
You can go.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
I won't go.

56
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,030
I will find out

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,370
all your problems.

58
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,500
I will save

59
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,980
those uninformed patients.

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,070
I will make sure when you give a medicine

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,540
or an injection to a patient,

62
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,680
you're as wary as a serpent.

63
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,350
Du Di, Du Di, calm down.

64
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,630
Talk, do not yell.

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,890
What else do you want to say?

66
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,420
Let's hear it.

67
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,310
I'm not afraid

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,320
even if you guys take turns scolding me.

69
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,060
What are you doing?

70
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Saying goodbye to a body?

71
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,180
Are you cursing me?

72
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,620
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:00,620
What are you playing at?

74
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,500
10 years ago,

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,960
a medical mistake took your healthy ovary.

76
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,120
You thought

77
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
when the one with a cyst was removed,

78
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,740
you could get pregnant.

79
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,260
But the doctor took the wrong ovary.

80
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,630
The operation

81
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,089
was not performed in our hospital

82
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,820
and the doctor who operated on you

83
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,450
didn't work in our hospital.

84
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,279
But I still want to

85
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,630
apologize to you

86
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,820
on behalf of

87
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,820
that careless doctor.

88
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,000
He did owe me an apology,

89
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,780
but

90
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,370
it was not just an ovary.

91
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,050
It was a marriage,

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
a family,

93
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,970
and a woman who went from hope

94
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,850
to despair.

95
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,260
Theoretically,

96
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,750
it's not necessary

97
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,760
to remove the whole ovary for a cyst.

98
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,400
So from the beginning,

99
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,590
he just wanted to make things easier.

100
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,640
I can't imagine what you've been through

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,970
in the last 10 years.

102
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,910
What I can do now,

103
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
apart from saying sorry to you

104
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,660
on behalf of that doctor,

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
is to do

106
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,820
what I can

107
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,820
in the upcoming operation

108
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,770
and do it perfectly.

109
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,630
I would like you to be our supervisor,

110
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,660
but I hope

111
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,380
you can supervise in a good mood.

112
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,470
Don't always scold people and get angry.

113
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,210
This negative mood

114
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,220
is really bad for your health.

115
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
It's not gonna work.

116
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,070
Don't try to

117
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,090
play nice with me.

118
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,400
You should go.

119
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,730
Get out.

120
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,510
I, Yao Yao,

121
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,860
will not

122
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,740
let these quacks go.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,740
Get out.

124
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,210
Cold, it's cold.

125
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,780
The right ovary was abnormal

126
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,220
and the left one was good.

127
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,700
One could tell them simply

128
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,430
by feeling them with her hand.

129
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,110
What was that doctor thinking

130
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,400
during the operation?

131
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,420
Did he drink alcohol?

132
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,380
He must have been drunk.

133
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,390
Given her mentality,

134
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,800
she needs counseling.

135
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,690
I think in such a state,

136
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,800
someone should talk to her every day.

137
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,150
Or even if

138
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,140
the operation is successful,

139
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,620
I don't think she'll survive for long.

140
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,090
For a person whose heart

141
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,430
is filled with hatred,

142
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,980
do you think a talk is gonna work?

143
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,390
Those doctors and nurses

144
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,310
she drove out

145
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:30,900
all tried to

146
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,120
talk sense into her, didn't they?

147
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,040
But in her eyes,

148
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,190
we're not on her side.

149
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,860
She can hardly listen to our advice.

150
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,570
In my opinion,

151
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,270
when the tumor is removed

152
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,350
and her condition improves,

153
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,590
she'll be in a much better mood.

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,720
What you're trying now

155
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,810
is just a waste of your time.

156
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,590
I don't want to see you in the operation room.

157
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,180
Get out of here.

158
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,980
Stop yelling.

159
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,150
Don't you feel bad?

160
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,940
Why do you come to the hospital

161
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,740
for chemotherapy and operation?

162
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,140
To survive, isn't it?

163
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,370
If you want to live,

164
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,720
why are you doing things that go against it?

165
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,720
If you don't want treatment,

166
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,820
you can leave

167
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,900
the operating room now.

168
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:06,980
Then why did you

169
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,790
cooperate with us

170
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,090
in all the pre-op preparations?

171
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,860
You tell me now.

172
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,700
Do you want to live or not?

173
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,580
I...

174
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,310
I want to live.

175
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,090
Put her under anesthesia.

176
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,440
OK.

177
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,170
Today's operation

178
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,270
is a very difficult one.

179
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,220
Tumor cytoreductive operation

180
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,440
of advanced ovarian cancer.

181
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,909
As you know,

182
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,940
ovarian cancer cytoreductive operation

183
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,710
is not simply the cleanout

184
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,020
of uterus, double attachments, omentum majus, appendix,

185
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,710
pelvic and abdominal lymph nodes,

186
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,980
but to make every effort

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,470
to remove all

188
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,700
lesions that are visible to the naked eye,

189
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,740
including metastases

190
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,020
and reduce tumor load.

191
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,310
We also have to consider if the patient

192
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,900
has other humane needs.

193
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,090
This patient

194
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,830
is the victim of a medical incident 10 years ago

195
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,690
when she lost the left ovary.

196
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,950
She believes that was the start

197
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,210
of all her tragedies.

198
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,450
So she hopes

199
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,610
to save the other one.

200
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,590
Our chief doctor today

201
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,150
is Professor Lu,

202
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,970
the authority of gynecologic oncology in our hospital.

203
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,690
-Hello, Professor Lu.
-Hello, everyone!

204
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,400
Professor Lu is doing it!

205
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,470
This is an once-in-a-lifetime operation.

206
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,460
Is this Professor Lu great?

207
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,950
I say you should

208
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,290
go back abroad.

209
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,470
Professor Lu is

210
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,430
one of the obstetric and gynecologic greats

211
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,110
in China.

212
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,990
You don't know him?

213
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,230
He's known for

214
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,260
the "rolling carpet" operation.

215
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,520
Thank you for the information.

216
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,500
Can we start now?

217
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,240
Vital signs stable.

218
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,140
Time of operation,

219
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,559
9:15 a.m.

220
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,240
Mrs. Huang,

221
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,960
it's been a long time since you stood on the left side, right?

222
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,530
It was a great honor

223
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,060
to have worked with you in one operation.

224
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,630
It's been a long time.

225
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,230
I feel like I'm

226
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,210
10 years younger

227
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,930
and back to the old days.

228
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,200
Left or right,

229
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,100
what's the difference?

230
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,160
A major operation

231
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,150
like the "rolling carpet" of ovarian cancer

232
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,510
requires two surgeons

233
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,940
to lead in precise cooperation.

234
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,060
Usually, the superior surgeon stands on the right side.

235
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,440
Dr. Huang has been great since she was young.

236
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,350
It's been a long time

237
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,180
since she stood on the left side of the patient.

238
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,290
The abdominal cavity is open.

239
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,340
First, extract the ascites.

240
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,520
The first step of cytoreduction of a malignant tumor

241
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,090
is to perform a thorough examination

242
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,910
and assess the extent of the lesion.

243
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,960
Let me quiz the young girls with you.

244
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,250
Now that the abdominal cavity is open,

245
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,020
why can't we see the greater omentum?

246
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,990
The metastasis

247
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,690
has caused the contracture of the greater omentum.

248
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,740
That's right.

249
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,230
The metastasized ovarian cancer

250
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,210
is like a handful of rice

251
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,150
scattered in the abdominal cavity.

252
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,140
They're everywhere.

253
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,600
The objective of cytoreduction operation

254
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,030
is to remove as best as we can

255
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,710
all tumors

256
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,380
that can be seen with the naked eye.

257
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,020
Sometimes,

258
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,580
there could be up to hundreds of them

259
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,620
of different sizes

260
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,380
spreading all over from the stomach

261
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,610
down to the intestines.

262
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,120
This requires medical skills of a doctor,

263
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:53,860
and also

264
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,260
perseverance.

265
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,020
What's more, the doctor must also

266
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,380
have a heart for the patient.

267
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
OK, rinse my hands.

268
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Moving on.

269
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,790
There's a mass

270
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,950
on the right ovary

271
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,620
with severe adhesions around.

272
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,060
The rectal fossae of the bladder and uterus

273
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,320
are both impacted.

274
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,970
Feel around the liver.

275
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,050
There is a mass.

276
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,830
The next step is the diaphragm.

277
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,520
The diaphragm is densely packed.

278
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,260
It feels like touching a toad's skin.

279
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,000
Not surprised.

280
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,930
The diaphragm is prone to metastasis.

281
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,380
Let me check the small intestines.

282
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,850
Look carefully one section at a time.

283
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,820
Let's start with the omentum.

284
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,270
The tumors near the omentum cake

285
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,650
have a net of blood vessels.

286
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,680
We must stop bleeding while removing them.

287
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,670
We must stop bleeding

288
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,850
for the removal of each small tumor.

289
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,330
Let's do this well and save a second operation.

290
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,910
You two tell us,

291
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,100
why is strict hemostasis necessary?

292
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,340
Ovarian cancer cytoreductive operation

293
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,060
involves a large incision and a long duration.

294
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,350
The patient is deeply anesthetized

295
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,260
and the blood pressure is low.

296
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,660
So the microscopic blood vessels

297
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,420
will not bleed.

298
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,220
But when the patient wakes up from anesthesia,

299
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,010
the blood pressure will rise

300
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,640
and the microscopic blood vessels will bleed.

301
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,150
We invited Professor Lu to perform this operation

302
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,310
because it

303
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,500
requires teamwork.

304
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,980
I clamp the blood vessel,

305
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,380
and Professor Lu

306
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,180
will tie it

307
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,070
so that we can ensure

308
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,860
not a single one is missed out.

309
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,100
You girl holding the omentum back,

310
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,050
it's gonna be hard for you.

311
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,390
Because you have to keep pulling on

312
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,470
to guarantee a good vision.

313
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,450
Keep up the good work.

314
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,370
Why are you pulling so hard?

315
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,780
You could have pulled the veins apart.

316
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,100
For young doctors,

317
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,050
holding the retractor

318
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,470
is a critical test.

319
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,380
You can't pull it too hard

320
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,740
or too gently.

321
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,690
You're lucky now

322
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,920
to have this ultrasonic aspirator

323
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,550
which dissects the tumor

324
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,200
and sucks it out.

325
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,270
In the past, when my mentor

326
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,340
performed this operation,

327
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,800
he had to remove it manually.

328
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,450
OK, increase the exposure.

329
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,730
I'll clean out the omentum.

330
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,450
For the patient to live a few more years,

331
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,710
they just remove

332
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,980
one bit at a time.

333
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,100
And this patient's offensive words

334
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,080
hurt a dozen of doctors and nurses.

335
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,360
She should really

336
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,720
watch the operation.

337
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:10,970
Let me ask you.

338
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,730
How much

339
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,340
does such an operation cost abroad?

340
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,140
No idea.

341
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,860
I never had ovarian cancer,

342
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,170
or this operation.

343
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,470
Here comes the hard nut.

344
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,280
Removal of the omentum near the splenic hilum.

345
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,360
The omentum is attached to the spleen.

346
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,770
It takes extra caution to separate them.

347
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,870
No tearing of the veins.

348
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,010
This is where we use the ultrasonic aspirator.

349
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,970
The patient worries about

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,800
complications during the operation.

351
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,340
It's useless to be afraid.

352
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,690
It's not rare that

353
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,980
in ovarian cancer operation,

354
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,600
the whole spleen has to be removed

355
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,470
due to the tearing.

356
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,260
Young doctor,

357
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,510
did you promise the patient anything

358
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,710
before the operation?

359
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,750
Or are you also worried?

360
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,340
I didn't.

361
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,140
You did.

362
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,750
We need a bigger incision.

363
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,430
There's a small tumor

364
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,420
close to the cardia.

365
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,060
The next part is the stomach.

366
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,420
Should I call the surgeon?

367
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,580
Yes, if I were doing it alone.

368
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,580
But not when we have Professor Lu.

369
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,980
Amazing.

370
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,750
You bet.

371
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,840
Du Di, I heard

372
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,460
you wanted to be a gynecologic oncologist.

373
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,180
Then you should

374
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,640
make Professor Lu your "destination".

375
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,510
I'm just a "signpost"

376
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,450
on your way to it.

377
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,470
You're too modest.

378
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,580
Young doctor,

379
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,180
if you're willing to learn from me,

380
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,830
feel free to ask me when you have questions.

381
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,660
Thank you, Professor Lu.

382
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,940
Connection formed

383
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,330
with a leading medical authority

384
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,310
in one operation.

385
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,110
I've been with Du Di for so long,

386
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,410
yet I didn't know she was so good at it.

387
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,780
Well, you're so blind.

388
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,390
You don't even know that her excellence

389
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,700
is the result of her efforts

390
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,860
and competence.

391
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,820
Those around the stomach and spleen have been cleaned out.

392
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,250
We're starting to roll the carpet.

393
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,430
We're going to roll the peritoneum with tumors

394
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,490
like a carpet?

395
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,430
Professor Lu and Dr. Huang work so well

396
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,420
like a duet.

397
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,740
Harmonious,

398
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,760
neat,

399
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,050
and smooth.

400
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,770
I have no problem with that.

401
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,980
No bladder damage.

402
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,730
We're done.

403
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,270
The whole peritoneum has been cut off.

404
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,910
It's too early to relax.

405
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,300
It's bleeding.

406
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,490
The vein is broken.

407
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,660
Don't panic.

408
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,100
Give me a piece of the 5-0

409
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,770
vascular suture.

410
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,450
The thinnest kind.

411
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,460
Reveal, clamp and stitch?

412
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:48,920
Yes.

413
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,580
Give me the long, sharp forceps.

414
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,010
Press it down with the pointed forceps.

415
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,220
Rinse it.

416
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,790
Stitch it.

417
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,930
See?

418
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,820
This is the 5-0 suture.

419
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,860
You all wish to

420
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,740
be a doctor who can perform an operation.

421
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,380
Can you stitch the vein?

422
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,060
It's done.

423
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,280
Keep cleaning up.

424
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,460
All done.

425
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,700
Next, we shall have a surgeon

426
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,620
to resect the rectum.

427
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,300
Our job is done.

428
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,500
Huang, let's go.

429
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,370
Right away.

430
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,500
Congrui,

431
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,060
come here.

432
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,360
Give me a hand.

433
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,940
I can't move my legs.

434
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,090
Promising young doctors!

435
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,130
Are you scared?

436
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,090
I wouldn't say "scared".

437
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,070
I'm actually shocked.

438
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,220
I'm a doctor

439
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,580
who can't even cure physical diseases,

440
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,790
yet I boast to cure mental illnesses.

441
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,300
How ridiculous!

442
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,940
Professor Lu is like a god

443
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,440
in gynecological oncology.

444
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,780
He is so patient with you.

445
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,580
What's more,

446
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,750
he's got the skills

447
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,460
of a top surgeon,

448
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,410
and the aura stemming

449
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,240
from his expertise and experience.

450
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,260
Everyone would be shocked.

451
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,900
Natural and smooth.

452
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,670
Do you know the feeling,

453
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
natural and smooth?

454
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,910
Professor Lu had not a second

455
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,180
of hesitation with his scalpel.

456
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,260
It's perfect,

457
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,569
like art.

458
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,329
Do you want to watch the replay?

459
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,170
This is a perfect operation

460
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
that one should watch dozens of times at least.

461
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,480
No drinks. Let's go back to the ward area.

462
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,970
Didn't you say that after we got the drinks

463
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,680
we were going for lunch?

464
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,950
I don't want drinks anymore.

465
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,160
It seems they're not happy

466
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,180
about us.

467
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,500
No.

468
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,470
It's about Yao Yao.

469
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,860
We always fight over her.

470
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,060
By the way,

471
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,850
I need to check on Dr. Huang.

472
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,360
She hasn't come out yet.

473
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,790
She felt uncomfortable

474
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,020
right after the operation.

475
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,740
I have to go see her.

476
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,340
It swells like a puff.

477
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,020
Help me.

478
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,630
In late pregnancy,

479
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,290
due to the uterus' pressure on the lower cavity,

480
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
the venous return is blocked.

481
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,530
I'm OK.

482
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,690
You can't perform long-hour operation anymore.

483
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,930
You'd better take some time off.

484
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,230
I'm happier in the hospital.

485
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,940
Since you came back last time,

486
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,550
no matter how many times I asked you,

487
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,560
your answer has always been "fine".

488
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,760
What happened in the police station

489
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,620
with your son?

490
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,390
And how did you get those injuries?

491
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,270
I don't want to talk about that anymore.

492
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,830
Anyway,

493
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,240
it's over.

494
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,140
Ms. Huang,

495
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,260
I know you're strong

496
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,300
and exceptional.

497
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,270
But I really don't want to see

498
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,230
you get hurt.

499
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,140
Of course, I also know that

500
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,580
you don't want to tell something humiliating

501
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,540
to a rookie like me,

502
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,480
but can you promise me

503
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,510
if anything happens

504
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,620
and you feel dangerous,

505
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,370
send me a code?

506
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,140
OK?

507
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,860
You must promise me.

508
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,290
If you don't,

509
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,470
I will tell everyone about

510
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,420
your injuries.

511
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,460
What's the code?

512
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,080
You'll perform the operation tomorrow.

513
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,640
Impressive.

514
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,370
Very clever.

515
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,780
In one way,

516
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,950
it looks like a

517
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,660
particularly normal work arrangement.

518
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,330
In another,

519
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,010
it's simply something impossible.

520
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,860
I'm really worried about you.

521
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,540
Especially your health.

522
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,640
OK,

523
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,220
I've already promised you.

524
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,580
Help me up.

525
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,660
When did you buy the milk tea?

526
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,580
Yao Yao bought these for us before she left

527
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,230
as an appreciation to the hospital

528
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,080
for saving her life.

529
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,570
I'm surprised that such a stubborn person

530
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,870
actually appreciated us.

531
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,380
I thought she'd say when she left,

532
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,790
"If something wrong happens to me,

533
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,820
I'll hold

534
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,920
you quacks accountable."

535
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,450
Once a bossy woman,

536
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,670
and now a grateful patient.

537
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:38,980
I feel sorry for her.

538
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,530
[Don't Let Doctors Kill You]

539
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,510
She gave me this book.

540
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,520
She thought if all the doctors in hospitals

541
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,780
are as professional as us,

542
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,000
this book wouldn't have existed.

543
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,830
What is this book about?

544
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,490
Let me read it.

545
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,260
There's no rush.

546
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,520
I have something more important

547
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,060
to show you.

548
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,370
A comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of LJX.

549
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,510
LJX refers to Li Junxiao.

550
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,680
On the left are his advantages

551
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,620
and on the right his disadvantages.

552
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,360
It's clear at a glance

553
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,940
which are more.

554
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,300
Seriously, Du Di?

555
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,340
I told you there's nothing between us.

556
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,620
And

557
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,060
there are two-thirds more items on the right

558
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,180
than the left.

559
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,500
How bad can this man be?

560
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,420
Advantages:

561
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,220
Tall, good-looking,

562
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,920
and healthy body,

563
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,810
which from the perspective of eugenics

564
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,400
is qualified;

565
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,010
medium IQ, Ph.D

566
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,560
like you, also qualified.

567
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,820
Disadvantages:

568
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,100
Treats women as reproductive tools,

569
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,240
patriarchal preference for sons,

570
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,920
unqualified;

571
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,340
often has a sense of being treated unfairly by the society,

572
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,690
highly selfish, loves to compare,

573
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,380
unqualified;

574
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,210
sometimes a big ego and sometimes self-abasement,

575
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,840
and vain dignity, unqualified;

576
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,940
-male chauvinism...
-OK, stop.

577
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,550
What's wrong?

578
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,190
I'm telling the truth.

579
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,100
You know that.

580
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,370
Am I wrong?

581
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,430
Maybe we have

582
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,820
different ways of dealing with our relationships.

583
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,030
For example, Feng Yuanhang and I

584
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,700
divorced,

585
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,580
but I will never say anything bad about him.

586
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,080
I don't like what you said

587
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,260
about Li Junxiao.

588
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,730
I'm not trying to get back at him.

589
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,910
I'm worried that you will be hurt again.

590
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,100
I know Li Junxiao

591
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,070
too well.

592
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,190
His flaws are deeply rooted.

593
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,030
I don't believe that a relationship

594
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,960
can change things a person

595
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,920
believe deep down in his heart.

596
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,170
Maybe he just

597
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,170
met the wrong person before.

598
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,580
You have feelings for him, right?

599
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,510
Or you wouldn't

600
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,460
have kept speaking for him.

601
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,050
You still love him, don't you?

602
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,100
Or why do you care so much?

603
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,420
I can tell you

604
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,220
100% sure that

605
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,410
I don't love him anymore.

606
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,320
We started a relationship

607
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,140
with our heads quiet and calm.

608
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,810
Our love was also passionless.

609
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,580
Now that I think about it,

610
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,710
I guess maybe

611
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,440
we dated because we didn't want to be lonely.

612
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,090
Not until we broke up

613
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,950
did I realize

614
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,900
that the values

615
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,740
we pursued

616
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,590
were completely different.

617
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,220
Maybe you're right.

618
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,080
I wasn't

619
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
the right person for him.

620
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,410
I told you this

621
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,750
because I don't want you to go out with Li Junxiao

622
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,690
to provoke Feng Yuanhang.

623
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,310
And I don't want you

624
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,660
to be hurt by a second man.

625
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,970
I really care about you.

626
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,900
Congrui,

627
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,180
why did you

628
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,460
have to come to the mall at this hour?

629
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,940
I have to work during the day.

630
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,500
I really don't have time.

631
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,180
Chuchu is due soon.

632
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,100
If I don't buy something for the baby,

633
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,380
it will hate me when it's born.

634
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,070
You love children so much.

635
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,280
The baby will love you.

636
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,830
This baby

637
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,380
is the first grandchild

638
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,710
of my mom's family.

639
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,430
I thought mine

640
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
would be the second

641
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,880
and when they were born,

642
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,890
my baby could inherit

643
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,520
your baby's clothes or something.

644
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,140
But...

645
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,800
You'll have more babies.

646
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,100
We both will.

647
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,350
I'll keep the baby's clothes for you.

648
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,530
You can come to pick them up at any time.

649
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,820
She doesn't mean that.

650
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,220
When she's pregnant,

651
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,860
I'm sure she'll want new clothes for her baby.

652
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,750
I think dressing up a child is

653
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,220
such a happy thing.

654
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,300
Chuchu,

655
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,840
I really don't know what you need.

656
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,120
Don't just look around.

657
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,410
Pick some.

658
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,180
I'll pay.

659
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,660
Right.

660
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,690
We don't know if it's a boy or a girl.

661
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,570
What color do you think we should choose?

662
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,250
No idea.

663
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,270
It troubles me too

664
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,180
when I'm shopping.

665
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,390
I wanted to ask Congrui

666
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,340
to confirm it for me,

667
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,070
but then I decided not to.

668
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,060
I couldn't let my cousin violate the rules.

669
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,290
I just think of it as a lottery.

670
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,480
I even made a bet with its father.

671
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,690
I bet it's a girl.

672
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,860
He bet it's a boy.

673
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,590
The loser will treat the winner to a fancy dinner.

674
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,390
Then I'll raise the stakes.

675
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,460
Well then, which side will you bet on?

676
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,140
Let's see.

677
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,540
The boy?

678
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,740
Chuchu.

679
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,250
Chuchu.

680
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,140
What's up? Are you OK?

681
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,020
What is the problem?

682
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,860
Nothing. I've been feeling tight in the chest lately.

683
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,780
I just had antenatal care.

684
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,320
There's nothing wrong.

685
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,320
Your mom said

686
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,980
you had a fever a while ago.

687
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,060
Maybe I caught a cold.

688
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,590
I didn't dare to take medicines,

689
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,860
so I held out for a few days.

690
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
You should go to the hospital right now.

691
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,640
Yes.

692
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,070
You feel tight in the chest and had a fever.

693
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,020
If it's something severe...

694
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,750
Chuchu! Chuchu!

695
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,400
Chuchu!

696
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,430
Chuchu, are you all right?

697
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,900
Chuchu!

698
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,300
What's going on?

699
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:32,980
Chuchu!

700
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,600
Chuchu, sweetie, don't scare me.

701
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,930
What should we do?

702
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:36,910
Don't panic.

703
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,820
Find help.

704
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,100
Anyone?

705
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,190
Someone help!

706
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,630
She fainted.

707
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,540
Somebody help!

708
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,580
Call an ambulance.

709
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,380
Someone fainted.

710
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,420
It's a pregnant woman.

711
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,980
She's on the fifth floor, over by the baby products.

712
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,580
She doesn't seem to be breathing.

713
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,820
Hurry up and help her.

714
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,980
I'm not sure what's wrong with her.

715
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,870
What if I do something wrong?

716
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,850
You're a doctor.

717
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,820
You're the only doctor here.

718
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,040
Who else is gonna save her?

719
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,400
Level her body. Chuchu!

720
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,240
Level her body.

721
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,200
Level her body.

722
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
What's next?

723
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,660
What's next?

724
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,900
CPR.

725
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,850
Right.

726
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,850
Chuchu, wake up.

727
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,070
Mom,

728
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,510
does she have a history of genetic heart disease?

729
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,220
I don't think so.

730
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,870
I've never heard of it.

731
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,330
No.

732
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,780
No. Chuchu.

733
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,860
Fulminant myocarditis.

734
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,260
Did someone call an ambulance?

735
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,580
Did you call an ambulance?

736
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,370
Yes, I did.

737
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,100
I made the call.

738
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,990
Here's a medical kit.

739
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,050
See if you need anything.

740
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,650
Give me the AED.

741
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,140
What...

742
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,770
Privacy, please.

743
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,450
Are you gonna give her an electric shock?

744
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,610
Is she gonna be OK?

745
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,660
More than 80%

746
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,850
of cardiac arrests

747
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,650
are the result of ventricular fibrillation.

748
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,980
She has no heartbeat.

749
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,260
She's not breathing on her own.

750
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,500
No circulatory signs.

751
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,710
Although there will be side effects on the fetus,

752
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,940
her life is more important now.

753
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,460
Is there anything I can do to help?

754
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,980
Put the electrodes in place.

755
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,140
Mom, stay clear.

756
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,570
Chuchu!

757
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:04,850
Chuchu!

758
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,500
Chuchu!

759
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,410
Watch your steps.

760
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,790
Check the fetus

761
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,730
in the uterus first.

762
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,920
What else?

763
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,290
The patient is 34 weeks and 4 days pregnant.

764
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,520
The patient complained

765
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,440
about having a cold and tightness in the chest.

766
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,810
She lost consciousness suddenly just now.

767
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,240
She didn't have heartbeat

768
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,320
until I gave her CPR.

769
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,500
But it's intermittent.

770
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,520
Are you

771
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,270
a doctor?

772
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,460
I work in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department of Shengji Hospital.

773
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,700
I guess it's pregnancy

774
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,970
combined with fulminant myocarditis.

775
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,340
Cardiogenic shock?

776
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,530
There's ventricular fibrillation.

777
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,860
We still need to defibrillate.

778
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,630
I'll call the emergency room.

779
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:53,740
Hello?

780
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,090
I'm Wu Congrui, a resident of

781
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,680
the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

782
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,090
We're taking a

783
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,170
suspected pregnancy

784
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,660
combined fulminant myocarditis

785
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,420
patient over.

786
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,070
We're 20 minutes away.

787
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,470
Please contact the anesthesiology department

788
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,420
and prepare for C-section under extracorporeal circulation.

789
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,940
Is it too early to prepare for

790
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,020
extracorporeal circulation?

791
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,860
No.

792
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,390
It all happened too suddenly.

793
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
And she's carrying a baby.

794
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,780
I'm afraid

795
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,300
a C-section under extracorporeal circulation is a must.

796
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,760
It's quite severe.

797
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,020
We can't let a pregnant woman die here.

798
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,680
It's almost impossible that she recovers

799
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,790
her heart function in a short time.

800
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,820
If this keeps up,

801
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,800
it will lead to damage to the organs.

802
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,930
We need to transfer her as soon as possible

803
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,830
to SICU.

804
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,540
Put her on ECOM.

805
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,380
Where is her family?

806
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,620
I'm her family.

807
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,440
Did you call

808
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,690
and ask us to make preparations?

809
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,180
Yes.

810
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,390
She's from our department.

811
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,480
First aid is safe and appropriate.

812
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,380
Ideas about the follow-up treatment

813
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,540
are also timely and accurate.

814
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,200
What's the decision?

815
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm not her immediate family.

816
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,450
Where is her immediate family?

817
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,460
I'll sign the consent.

818
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,240
I'm her cousin.

819
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,020
But...

820
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,500
Congrui,

821
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,510
don't worry.

822
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,180
The vice president is already

823
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,900
on the way here.

824
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,230
It's big when it comes to a pregnant woman.

825
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,460
The head of the cardiology department

826
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,540
will be here soon too.

827
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,920
Thank you, Dr. Tian.

828
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,000
You did a very good job

829
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,250
and handled it very calmly.

830
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,060
Go.

831
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,430
Take a break with your mom outside.

832
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,460
OK.

833
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,830
Congrui,

834
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,780
You mentioned "Com".

835
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,460
What does that mean?

836
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,430
Chuchu's heart

837
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,660
has a serious problem.

838
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,860
It can no longer

839
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,980
support the circulation of her body.

840
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,910
ECOM

841
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,200
is the state-of-the-art

842
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,970
technology for extracorporeal life support.

843
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,820
It can replace

844
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,780
human cardiopulmonary function,

845
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,130
enabling Chuchu's heart and lungs

846
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,720
to get sufficient rest

847
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,310
while having enough oxygen

848
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,180
so that doctors

849
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,340
will have the time to make an accurate diagnosis.

850
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,900
Otherwise, Chuchu

851
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,400
would die soon.

852
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
So serious.

853
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:57,910
Baby,

854
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,020
Mom feels for the first time

855
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,970
it's good I have a daughter who studies medicine.

856
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,500
Mom,

857
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,860
the daily charge of ECOM

858
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,010
is very expensive

859
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,220
and it's not covered by medical insurance.

860
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Will my aunt blame me?

861
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,340
Is money more important than life?

862
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,310
If she really blames you,

863
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,980
we will pay for it.

864
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,780
How much?

865
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,530
Plus the fee for ICU,

866
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,170
more than 10,000 a day.

867
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,080
10,000 a day.

868
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,680
It is expensive.

869
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,860
Sister.

870
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,490
Congrui,

871
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,550
How is Chuchu?

872
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,420
Chuchu just collapsed

873
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,780
due to cardiogenic shock.

874
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,070
The emergent ultrasound showed

875
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,260
it's fulminant myocarditis.

876
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,420
If left unchecked, Chuchu would die suddenly.

877
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,780
So I signed the consent

878
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,780
to put her on ECOM.

879
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,900
What?

880
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:44,990
ECOM?

881
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:45,980
You know it?

882
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,870
Yes, I watched it on TV.

883
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,190
Aren't people on ECOM

884
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,960
all dying?

885
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,030
She was fine when she left home.

886
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,330
I need to see Chuchu now.

887
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,490
Aunt, please calm down.

888
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,180
Now

889
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,910
the ECOM team

890
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,830
is inserting the catheters

891
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,570
into her body.

892
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,650
How did it go?

893
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,160
You must be scared.

894
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,980
It's pretty scary

895
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,050
when it comes to your own family.

896
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,510
I'm afraid I might do something wrong.

897
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,100
Then the rest of my family would hate me.

898
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,930
But you did a good job.

899
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,780
You were very professional.

900
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,190
ECOM

901
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,180
is her only option.

902
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,170
She'd die without it.

903
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,730
I was not professional at all.

904
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,600
I was really stunned.

905
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,950
I even forgot how to perform

906
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,460
CPR.

907
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,330
I'm not a qualified doctor.

908
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,140
Congrui,

909
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,370
you are a qualified doctor.

910
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,340
What should I do now?

911
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,580
Dr. Tian asks me to determine

912
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,660
when to terminate the pregnancy.

913
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,500
Follow your instinct as a doctor

914
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,460
and all the medical knowledge

915
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,710
you learned in the years.

916
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,620
Congrui,

917
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,130
you can do it.

918
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,260
This emergent treatment

919
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,460
has proved it.

920
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,430
From now on, you have to make your own decisions

921
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,570
on important things.

922
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,550
In this way, you can definitely

923
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,180
win Du Di.

924
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:31,980
You think so?

925
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,210
What do you mean "You think so?"

926
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,580
Of course, I do.

927
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,790
It's viral fulminant myocarditis.

928
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,590
With the support

929
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,000
of ECOM,

930
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,820
we performed

931
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,660
myocardial edema reduction,

932
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,600
immunomodulatory and antiviral therapy.

933
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,170
Now the patient's vital signs

934
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,030
have gradually stabilized.

935
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,620
Pregnancy aggravated

936
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,540
the viral infection.

937
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,580
The mother's heart function deteriorates rapidly

938
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,500
and shows severe hypoxia.

939
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,220
Are you the patient's family now?

940
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,520
Are you gonna be OK?

941
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,890
My family believes in me.

942
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,430
And I also believe in myself.

943
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,170
Let's get started.

944
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,610
Congrui,

945
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:15,580
don't worry.

946
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,660
I'm with you.

947
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,970
I will protect the baby.

948
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,780
Thank you.

949
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,500
Time of operation, 9:10.

950
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,610
No.

951
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,710
Get the baby out now.

952
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,440
Retraction.

953
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,560
I only have 30 seconds.

954
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,020
How's the baby?

955
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,040
Premature delivery,

956
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,360
pulmonary insufficiency.

957
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,870
It's healthy in other aspects.

958
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,100
These scales and procedures

959
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,570
now seem feasible.

960
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,480
But I think it's better to

961
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,920
try it out on a small scale

962
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,130
to find if it requires

963
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,750
any adjustments.

964
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,210
I'd like to ask you a question.

965
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,889
OK.

966
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,190
When I was looking for you in the garden,

967
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,100
I found this.

968
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,139
Can you tell me,

969
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,280
do you still love him?

970
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,270
Why do you ask?

971
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,250
What does it

972
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,860
have to do

973
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,650
with your question?

974
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:56,330
Look me in the eye and tell me,

975
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,870
do you still love him?

976
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,030
Why does everyone

977
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,730
ask me this question?

978
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,280
[Dad]

979
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:19,940
Why don't you answer it?

980
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,580
Why should I answer it?

981
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,140
What if

982
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,510
it's about your mom's condition?

983
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,660
No way.

984
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,890
They will give my mom

985
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,940
everything she wants

986
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,870
as long as

987
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,780
it's good for the baby.

988
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,160
They even ask me

989
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,830
if my mom can use

990
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,980
mosquito repellent.

991
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,460
He keeps calling me these days.

992
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,450
It must not be something good.

993
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,420
You can't be sure.

994
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,710
Although everyone

995
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,620
cares about your mom,

996
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,280
from what I saw in the past few months

997
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,660
at the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department,

998
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,930
many families

999
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,150
do take good care of both the unborn baby and the mother,

1000
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,060
but they still have

1001
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,520
superstitions and blind spots in their knowledge.

1002
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,140
And with what you know about your dad...

1003
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,310
You kept calling me.

1004
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:03,940
What is it?

1005
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,580
You finally called back.

1006
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,330
Do you still care about your mother's life?

1007
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,820
Get to the point. What is it?

1008
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,420
Du Di,

1009
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,140
your dad and I

1010
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,790
have returned to your grandma's place in the country.

1011
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,690
Your grandma misses you.

1012
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,100
Can you come back?

1013
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,420
How could that woman who thinks the old ways

1014
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,480
miss me?

1015
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,070
What do you want to say?

1016
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,900
I told you

1017
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,780
not to call

1018
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,840
this ungrateful girl.

1019
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,740
Du Di,

1020
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,440
I beg you.

1021
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,400
Come back, OK?

1022
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,100
Why did you beg her?

1023
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:36,940
Hang up.

1024
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:42,900
See?

1025
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,590
I'm making a fool of myself.

1026
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,260
Why do I feel that

1027
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,380
your mom is asking for your help?

1028
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,230
You said before that your grandma did not like

1029
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:50,990
you and your mother.

1030
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,760
Now your mom is over there.

1031
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,260
And she wants you to go back.

1032
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,180
Is there something wrong?

1033
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,030
I need to go back.

1034
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,330
I'll go with you.

1035
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,000
You wanna come with me?

1036
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,580
Why?

1037
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,660
I'm afraid you'll be impulsive.

1038
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,330
And as your boyfriend,

1039
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,330
shouldn't I go back with you?

1040
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,580
Do I have a wrong understanding

1041
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,330
of the customs here?

1042
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,740
You wanna go back with me

1043
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,420
to meet my parents?

1044
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,300
What are you gonna say

1045
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,870
when you meet them?

1046
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,420
If they ask about

1047
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,340
our plans

1048
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:34,770
for the future?

1049
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,400
What will you say?

1050
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,210
You have to think about it clearly.

1051
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,940
In China,

1052
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
this is a serious matter.

1053
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,560
Baby.

1054
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,940
Thank you

1055
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,660
for sending the child over.

1056
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,990
Although the child is healthy in most ways,

1057
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,170
it's about your family.

1058
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,030
I can't trust anyone else.

1059
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,220
How is Chuchu?

1060
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,610
Still in a coma.

1061
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,010
Her husband

1062
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,360
had been talking to her,

1063
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,140
but no progress.

1064
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,410
Today I want her to

1065
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,560
listen to the child's voice.

1066
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,180
Maybe that will wake her up.

1067
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,020
Chuchu,

1068
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,500
did you hear it?

1069
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,120
It's our baby's voice.

1070
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,490
It's a son.

1071
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,140
Didn't you say before

1072
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,060
you wanted a daughter

1073
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,240
who could have your beauty?

1074
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,010
♫My baby, are you sleeping♫

1075
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,820
And you wanted to put

1076
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,570
those pretty little skirts on her.

1077
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,180
But sorry,

1078
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,660
I win the bet.

1079
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,780
Look,

1080
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:50,920
♫I'm hearing your breath♫

1081
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,400
it's a son

1082
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,140
who has my happy-go-lucky attitude.

1083
00:38:53,220 --> 00:39:00,050
♫So lucky I can touch your smile♫

1084
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,100
Baby, are you talking to mom?

1085
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,480
Are you?

1086
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,430
Talk to mom.

1087
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:05,600
♫So lucky I can meet you♫

1088
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,010
OK?

1089
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:13,550
♫Let me hold your tiny hands♫

1090
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:20,210
♫Courage grows in my mind♫

1091
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:29,560
♫Let me keep you company through seasons♫

1092
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:35,820
♫Keep all your growth in my heart♫

1093
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,690
♫I heard the happiest cry♫

1094
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:50,130
♫Even the air is sweet♫

1095
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,020
Congrui,

1096
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,980
let me take you home.

1097
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,350
That's OK.

1098
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,310
I'll take her home.

1099
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,000
Will you leave her alone?

1100
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,220
Will you leave her alone?

1101
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,180
Stop arguing.

1102
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,940
Yuanhang,

1103
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,540
you asked me once

1104
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,060
if we still had a chance.

1105
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,300
I'll answer you now.

1106
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:05,740
We don't.

1107
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,550
All I need is

1108
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,350
an honest man.

1109
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,490
So I decided

1110
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,690
to try it out with Li Junxiao.

1111
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,260
Junxiao,

1112
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,740
what you said to me

1113
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,240
last time

1114
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,180
made me realize that

1115
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:25,990
if a man

1116
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,320
told the worst part of himself

1117
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,220
to me,

1118
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,800
this man would be the one

1119
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,880
I could spend my life with,

1120
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,300
because the most important quality of men

1121
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,580
is honesty.

1122
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:39,900
Congrui,

1123
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,900
I...

1124
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,820
have no car, no house, and no money.

1125
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,060
I don't know how many years I'll keep this way.

1126
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,150
Are you sure about it?

1127
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,180
You're a doctor.

1128
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,710
It's such a sacred profession.

1129
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,930
Why would your family background matter?

1130
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,150
Just now I saw Chuchu

1131
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,090
and her family

1132
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,810
defeat the disease with love.

1133
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,300
They helped each other.

1134
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,640
If there is no love in life,

1135
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,540
how boring it would be!

1136
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,570
I always believe in

1137
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,380
the inner strength

1138
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,060
and love.

1139
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,660
So let's love each other with all our hearts.

1140
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,170
OK?

1141
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,310
Yeah.

1142
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,900
Of course.

1143
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,350
OK, time to check the tickets.

1144
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,340
Du Di,

1145
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,860
it's been years

1146
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,420
and you're prettier.

1147
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,350
You've changed a lot.

1148
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,340
Yes, so beautiful.

1149
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,720
-Your daughter is great.
-Son,

1150
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:19,800
let's go.

1151
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,610
Come on.

1152
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,130
Learn from your cousin.

1153
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,990
She's a doctor.

1154
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,110
How much does a doctor

1155
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,980
earn a month?

1156
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,550
Quite a lot, right?

1157
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,900
Not really.

1158
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,100
She's not a permanent doctor yet.

1159
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,590
After so many years of study,

1160
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,220
she's still not a permanent doctor?

1161
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,730
Du Mendan's daughter

1162
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,860
went to a nursing school for a few years.

1163
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,610
Now she's been working for years.

1164
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,810
Nursing school is better.

1165
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,060
-Yes.
-They can work earlier.

1166
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,300
It's useless for a girl

1167
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
to get much education.

1168
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,330
How many people who are barely educated

1169
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,600
have a better career in the end?

1170
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,550
Du Di

1171
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,100
will be promoted.

1172
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:01,700
Right.

1173
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,040
Promoted and more promising.
