[Episode 19]

4
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,470
Which parent

5
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,430
wants their children

6
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,060
to watch these?

7
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,289
You can't gain fans like this.

8
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,930
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

9
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,490
You never asked.

10
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,490
OK,

11
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,030
give me more advice in the future.

12
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,660
The platform said

13
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,700
our live broadcast

14
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,900
involves sensitive words.

15
00:01:59,390 --> 00:01:59,900
I said we are

16
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,130
a medical science live broadcast.

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,520
They said they'd lift the ban

18
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,540
after scrutiny.

19
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,540
But in the next live broadcast,

20
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,020
we must consider kid viewers.

21
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,580
I really did not pay attention to that.

22
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,860
I can't believe this is happening.

23
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,330
We spread obstetric and gynecologic knowledge.

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,170
We can't avoid the medical terms.

25
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,780
There are so many of them.

26
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,579
If we can't use them,

27
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,100
what knowledge can we spread then?

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,829
Don't worry.

29
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,100
I'll help you find a way.

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,420
Our medical live broadcast

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,900
is targeted to the public.

32
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,930
If it's full of medical terms,

33
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,300
most people won't remember anything.

34
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,140
For example,

35
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,300
that tube.

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,950
What's all this nonsense?

37
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,300
If I tell people

38
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:42,960
in the live broadcast that

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,940
the most common site of ectopic implantation

40
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,220
is inside the tube,

41
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,579
they will laugh at me.

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,710
They'll wonder, what kind of doctor she is,

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,960
making things so implicit?

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,560
Congrui,

45
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,980
you're finally laughing.

46
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,400
You know what?

47
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,620
When you laugh,

48
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,000
I feel that all the gloom

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,500
is gone.

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,460
You do?

51
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,650
Really?

52
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,500
Of course.

53
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,670
Thank you for helping me so much.

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,210
Let me treat you to a big meal.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,050
What are you doing?

56
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,010
Do you think we have the luxury

57
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,040
of a trance in this department?

58
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:28,980
Head Nurse,

59
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm tired after delivering a baby.

60
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,790
Shouldn't you be at home now?

61
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,940
I just had a meeting at the hospital.

62
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,860
We're about to have

63
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,370
a new round of skill checks.

64
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,260
We need to

65
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,100
get prepared for the check and the test.

66
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,380
The way to a successful nurse

67
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,380
is quiz and test every day, every month

68
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,340
and every year.

69
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,700
Only that

70
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,620
can make you

71
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,820
a qualified nurse

72
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,020
in terms of both theory and experience.

73
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,460
I thought your work will be easier

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,660
as the Head Nurse.

75
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,640
Never knew you were worried about that too.

76
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,740
It's never been easy.

77
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,060
Today, two head nurses from other departments had an argument

78
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,140
over the assignment

79
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,100
of trained nurses.

80
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,880
I know we're all short of hands.

81
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,530
I can do nothing about it.

82
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,050
It's all about work.

83
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,720
You can't say who is wrong.

84
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,420
Oh my!

85
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,340
What a pain!

86
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,310
Head Nurse,

87
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:12,820
do you agree

88
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,300
that we midwives

89
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,940
are particularly hopeless?

90
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,829
We're doing an obstetrician's work

91
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,380
but we're just nurses.

92
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,290
Our salary

93
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:20,980
and other welfare

94
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,180
never go up.

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,340
There is not much room for promotion.

96
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,910
Doctors can be promoted to attending,

97
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,780
deputy director and director.

98
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,300
What about us?

99
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,580
Your problem

100
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,540
is troubling all of us.

101
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,790
You're nurses

102
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,060
who can make medical decisions,

103
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,030
yet you're not doctors

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,100
who can give medical advice.

105
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,420
It's awkward.

106
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,170
Some hospitals simply cancel

107
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,460
the position of midwives

108
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,460
and let doctors deliver babies.

109
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,940
But experienced midwives like you

110
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,010
are sought-after talents.

111
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,430
What good does that do?

112
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,990
Technically, I'm not a registered citizen here.

113
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,020
My parents urge me to go home

114
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,370
and marry a suitable man.

115
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,260
But I'm not willing to.

116
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,280
I'm a senior midwife at Shengji Hospital.

117
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,090
I want to find a good man.

118
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,180
But good men don't like me.

119
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,490
I'm too mediocre.

120
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,700
No money and no one loves me.

121
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,870
I really think

122
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,600
I can't hold on any longer.

123
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,450
You listen to me.

124
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,540
You can't rush when it comes to marriage.

125
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,570
Wait.

126
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,460
Did

127
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,560
another hospital offer you

128
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,170
a job?

129
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,460
I'm thinking of going to a private hospital.

130
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,920
I want to make more money while I'm still young.

131
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,810
Midwives like us

132
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,060
are in great demand in the obstetrical department

133
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,560
of private hospitals.

134
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,540
See?

135
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,700
I was right.

136
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,140
What you just said before

137
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,230
is all a bunch of lies.

138
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,540
You just want to leave.

139
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,480
No.

140
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,159
I'm not saying that to justify

141
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,820
my leaving.

142
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,490
My feelings are hurt today.

143
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,620
I'm heartbroken

144
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,900
and disappointed in myself.

145
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,520
Baby.

146
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,700
Baby, don't cry.

147
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
It's OK. Dad's here.

148
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,230
Don't cry. You're OK.

149
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,110
Miss Ma,

150
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,980
please check this out for me.

151
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,990
Take a look.

152
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,220
It's abnormal.

153
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,260
And these.

154
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,320
I've finished the test.

155
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,740
Maybe the tech department forgot it.

156
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:35,860
Correct it.

157
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,820
Don't worry.

158
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,300
Go fix it.

159
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,670
It's OK.

160
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:43,659
See you around.

161
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,930
Did the baby give you a hard time?

162
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,680
No.

163
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,190
Dr. Liu, can you help me

164
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,030
find a female nurse

165
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,340
to go into the Lady's Room

166
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,150
and see

167
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,200
if Yang Shu is in?

168
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,580
Doesn't the single ward

169
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,540
have a bathroom?

170
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,580
Why would she use the one outside?

171
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,240
I looked. She's not there.

172
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,130
Did you call her?

173
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,440
Yes, she left her phone on the bed.

174
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,430
Du Di, Yang Shu is missing.

175
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,820
I think she's having a depressive episode.

176
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,150
You're familiar with the inpatient building.

177
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,960
Please meet with her husband

178
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,400
and search the floors above.

179
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
Pay particular attention to the open

180
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,570
balconies and terraces.

181
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,890
I'll search the floors below

182
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,810
and the roads around the hospital.

183
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,620
OK.

184
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,500
He's waiting for you at the nurse's station.

185
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:04,890
Yang Shu!

186
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,250
Honey.

187
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,670
Honey,

188
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,620
what are you doing there?

189
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,460
It's too dangerous.

190
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,480
Come over here quickly!

191
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm coming over with the baby.

192
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,260
The wind is strong here.

193
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,300
Come back with me.

194
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,060
OK?

195
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,500
OK, don't cry.

196
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,020
Stop crying, baby.

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,030
-Stop crying!
-It's OK. Dad's here.

198
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,200
Mom is useless.

199
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,940
Mom doesn't make milk.

200
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,440
For so long,

201
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,580
I haven't been able to give you

202
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,460
a sip of milk.

203
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,030
I know you hate me.

204
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,620
I don't deserve to be your mom.

205
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,110
No, he doesn't.

206
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,809
The baby doesn't hate you.

207
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,610
He loves his mom.

208
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,750
Listen to me.

209
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,289
Come back with me, OK?

210
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,240
She's not in the right state.

211
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,610
Don't go near her.

212
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,470
Try to console the baby.

213
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,540
Take him to the back.

214
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,510
Try to stop the crying.

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,030
It's OK. Dad's here.

216
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,100
Baby, don't cry.

217
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,580
It's all right.

218
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,660
Hello?

219
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,610
We found Yang Shu.

220
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,540
She's on the rooftop.

221
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,480
Where are you?

222
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,640
I'm downstairs.

223
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,500
Downstairs?

224
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,190
Look up. Can you see her?

225
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,750
Yeah, I can see her.

226
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,990
Yang Shu is not in the right state.

227
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,030
Wei Yang tried to approach her with the baby in his arms.

228
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,100
She stepped back.

229
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,310
It's too dangerous.

230
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,280
We dare not to move.

231
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,220
What should we do?

232
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,160
I'll be right there.

233
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,190
Put her on speakerphone. Let me talk to her.

234
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,300
Yang Shu,

235
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,820
this is Dr. Liu.

236
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,960
Please calm down and listen to me.

237
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,180
Have you been drowsy lately?

238
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,450
You feel sleepy all the time.

239
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,110
and find little interest

240
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,840
in anything.

241
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,580
And you find yourself

242
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,510
worthless.

243
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,210
Let me tell you something.

244
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,890
It's not your problem.

245
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,460
It's because you're sick.

246
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,420
All these symptoms you have

247
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,900
are consistent with those of postnatal depression.

248
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,660
It's a disease, you know?

249
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,160
I'm…

250
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,930
sick?

251
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,100
Yes.

252
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,500
You had a major surgery.

253
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,850
Your hormones have changed drastically.

254
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,950
And you just went through

255
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,020
some unhappy things,

256
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,020
so your emotions are having a tantrum.

257
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,270
It's making you lazy,

258
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,380
and desperate

259
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,860
with low esteem.

260
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,030
But please believe me.

261
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,330
These are all temporary.

262
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,020
If you cooperate with the doctors,

263
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,780
your hormones will be stable,

264
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,270
the cut will heal

265
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,420
and you'll make milk.

266
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,530
You will get better gradually.

267
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,740
I'm afraid I can't wait for that day to come.

268
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,360
What if I don't get better?

269
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,420
You will.

270
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,630
Please believe me.

271
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,130
Please believe me.

272
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,300
I'm a doctor.

273
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,850
I proved it wasn't your problem.

274
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,970
I brought back your child.

275
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm professional.

276
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,700
And,

277
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,470
my mom

278
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,580
also killed herself due to depression.

279
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,300
I don't know

280
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,840
why she couldn't get past it.

281
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,990
I still don't know

282
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,860
why she...

283
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,340
why she left us,

284
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,770
but I do know

285
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,980
how pitiful the child

286
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,700
without a mother is.

287
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,350
I was sent abroad when I was very young.

288
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,070
I lived with a relative's family.

289
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,070
Every winter

290
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,620
I kept catching colds and fevers.

291
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,040
Later I learned that

292
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,370
the other Chinese mothers

293
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,940
gave their children long johns.

294
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,900
I didn't have a mother.

295
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,830
No matter how cold it was,

296
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,410
all I had were a pair of pants.

297
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,140
I always did well in school

298
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,580
and always received awards,

299
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,470
but my mom

300
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,060
never appeared in these ceremonies

301
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,180
to applaud for me.

302
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,970
My desk mate

303
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,290
was a white boy who was always

304
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,080
at the bottom of the test.

305
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,540
He often bullied me.

306
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,600
Once he moved one place up

307
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,640
from the bottom in an exam.

308
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,250
His mother hugged him

309
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,940
and said proudly,

310
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,820
"Son, you're great.

311
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,930
I'm proud of you."

312
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,990
But since I was a kid,

313
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,460
I had always been in the first place.

314
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,890
My mom had never

315
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,710
said that to me.

316
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,750
Professionally,

317
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,100
please trust

318
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,500
my judgment as a doctor.

319
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,800
You will be fine.

320
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,750
Emotionally,

321
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,180
please trust me

322
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,180
as someone's son.

323
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,060
All my life I've been denied

324
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,230
my mom's love.

325
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,740
I will be sad all my life.

326
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,620
I'll never forget that.

327
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,300
Yang Shu,

328
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,840
please go over there

329
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,740
and hold your baby.

330
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,850
Ask yourself

331
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,740
if you can hold on a little longer.

332
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,390
Postnatal depression

333
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,560
usually only lasts

334
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,510
3 to 6 months.

335
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,050
Please make a bet with me.

336
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,870
Get through it

337
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,220
and give your son a happy life.

338
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,380
OK?

339
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,470
I... I don't know.

340
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,700
I don't know if I can

341
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,130
hold on for that long.

342
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,930
Yes, you can.

343
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,660
You really can.

344
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,040
Listen!

345
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,050
Listen, the baby is crying again.

346
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,610
Don't cry.

347
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,730
He's crying again!

348
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,990
I can't even console a baby.

349
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,290
I don't deserve to be a mother.

350
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,770
Honey, that's not true.

351
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,950
Come over here!

352
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,130
I can't face him.

353
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,460
Harder.

354
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,180
I...

355
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,260
Hold on!

356
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,070
Grab me!

357
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,750
Honey, hang on!

358
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,580
Pull!

359
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,050
I...

360
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,650
Watch your knees.

361
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,550
Honey.

362
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,450
Honey.

363
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,250
Honey, I'm sorry.

364
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,110
I'm sorry, honey.

365
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,980
I promise I will

366
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,240
be good to you.

367
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,510
I'm sorry, honey.

368
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,050
Our hero and heroine.

369
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,540
How are your hands?

370
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,550
When he was pulling Yang Shu up,

371
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,620
he bumped his hand on the rail,

372
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,740
leaving a minor fracture.

373
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,260
It might take 10 to 15 days

374
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,780
to heal.

375
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,050
Mine are just some bruises.

376
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,740
It'll be OK in a couple of days.

377
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:09,980
How is he feeling?

378
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,710
Not good.

379
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,830
Neither the award nor the praise

380
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,860
from the hospital

381
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,970
cheered him up.

382
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,460
No wonder he ignored me just now.

383
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,720
If this keeps up,

384
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,190
I'm worried he'll be depressed too.

385
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,540
Keep an eye on him.

386
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,340
Don't worry.

387
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,890
I'll go over there.

388
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,050
The patient who jumped off the building

389
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,680
is leaving the hospital today.

390
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,520
Go now.

391
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,970
Dr. Liu,

392
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,040
I'm so sorry.

393
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,880
Due to impulsive behavior,

394
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,870
I only got a little scratch here,

395
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,460
but you're badly hurt.

396
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,080
Did you take your medicine today?

397
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,030
Yes, she did.

398
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,700
The head psychiatrist

399
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,240
came to see her.

400
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,860
Yang Shu

401
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,980
took the medicines he prescribed and said

402
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,980
the dark clouds in her mind

403
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,850
seemed to have disappeared.

404
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,940
It's good.

405
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,700
That's great.

406
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,590
Don't cry.

407
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,770
You just began to make milk.

408
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,230
Don't get too emotional.

409
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,920
Don't worry, I'm fine.

410
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,220
Look, where I'm going now,

411
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,900
I am a hero.

412
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,710
A long line of gorgeous girls

413
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,460
came to ask for my WeChat ID.

414
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,460
Could you please

415
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,290
stop bragging?

416
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,750
Dr. Du and I come

417
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,740
to say goodbye.

418
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,460
Mr. and Mrs. Wei,

419
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,380
Wei Yang,

420
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,220
I hope you can make some promises to us.

421
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,340
Yes, please, Dr. Liu.

422
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,380
First,

423
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,010
make sure Yang Shu takes the medicine.

424
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,910
If there are any problems, go to the psychiatric department.

425
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,020
Don't feel embarrassed.

426
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,620
I understand.

427
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,590
Second,

428
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
during the medical treatment,

429
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,860
her emotions will experience fluctuations.

430
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,210
Please try not to accuse her,

431
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,820
preach her,

432
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,020
or make her angry.

433
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,780
Try to create a

434
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,810
warm family atmosphere.

435
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,010
This is not just a request from me.

436
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,270
I've consulted with

437
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,640
the head psychiatrist.

438
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,890
He told me

439
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,390
this is the ideal caring

440
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,470
for a postnatal depressive patient.

441
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,500
Dr. Liu,

442
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,700
Dr. Du,

443
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,300
I promise you

444
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,710
I will double my care

445
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,800
for my wife.

446
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,190
And I also consulted

447
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,660
with the head psychiatrist

448
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,010
you mentioned.

449
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,350
I took notes on my cellphone

450
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,540
of the problems he told me

451
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,050
and made it the screen saver.

452
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,020
From now on,

453
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,760
I promise I will follow through with it.

454
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,510
That's great.

455
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,580
Congratulations on your discharge.

456
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,020
Thank you.

457
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:11,580
Thank you

458
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,320
Thank you.

459
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,710
Look how happy you are.

460
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,820
You know we're going home, right?

461
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,240
No one can come up to the rooftop anymore.

462
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,390
The hospital said

463
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,140
to prevent

464
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,280
similar events from happening,

465
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,160
all the rooftops of high-rises

466
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,350
and balconies will be locked up.

467
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,510
We can't come up for fresh air

468
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,620
anymore, either.

469
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,100
They have no other options.

470
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,980
The place has seen

471
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,260
so much desperation and pain.

472
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,960
If a patient jumps off,

473
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,220
his family

474
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,950
will hold the hospital accountable,

475
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,470
but they never reflect on

476
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,660
what they have done.

477
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,120
I never thought I saw so many things happen

478
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,350
in just a few months

479
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,890
after I came here.

480
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,060
Tomorrow is

481
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,220
the anniversary of my mother's death.

482
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,260
You should take a leave.

483
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,750
I may have to take

484
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,099
a very long leave.

485
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,140
Yeah.

486
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,589
Your injury

487
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,599
needs time to heal.

488
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,849
Don't run around.

489
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,060
Recently,

490
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,180
I've been simulating in my mind

491
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,050
my mom's mental state

492
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,280
when I was 6 years old.

493
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,860
I searched

494
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,170
in my memory

495
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,630
all the details about her.

496
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,700
I'm thinking

497
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,130
I should have been able to

498
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,990
do something

499
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,460
so that she can grow

500
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,500
an idea or some interest

501
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,680
in staying in this world.

502
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,150
My head is full of

503
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,580
these scenarios

504
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,830
and I can't stop thinking about them.

505
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,300
So,

506
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,390
I think it's better

507
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,740
for me to leave.

508
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,180
I want to

509
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,420
go back to my teacher's lab.

510
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,290
I know you're confused

511
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,320
and sad.

512
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
But I still hope that

513
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,920
you don't choose to run away.

514
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,390
You said

515
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,520
facing his wife's pain,

516
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,190
♫Behind this door♫

517
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,480
the husband must do something.

518

Likewise,

519

when we're facing

520
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,250
the pain within ourselves,

521
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,900
we must do something, too.

♫Always by your side with care♫

several times as much effort

536
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,100
to get it here.

537
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,140
Although

you came to the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department of Shengji

539

the safe haven and hope

♫Every soul is different now and dreaming about the distance♫

Why can't you just say so?

558

[Here rests my beloved wife, Bai Qing]

559
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:57,980
Mom,

560
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,270
I come to see you.

561
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,520
Did...

562
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,480
Did you like strawberries?

563
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,720
You must like them a lot.

564
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,700
Right?

565
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,340
Or you wouldn't have

566
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,340
washed so many of them

567
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,740
for me to eat before you left.

568
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,300
Did you want to leave me a sweet

569
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,060
or sour memory?

570
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,900
I haven't eaten strawberries in 20 years.

571
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,900
They taste good.

572
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,500
Your mom liked peony,

573
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,060
not chrysanthemums.

574
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,180
Is that so?

575
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,210
Too bad she didn't have the chance

576
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,160
to tell me herself.

577
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,990
My mother had postnatal depression.

578
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:15,880
You know that, right?

579
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,480
How did postnatal depression

580
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,180
develop into

581
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,100
real depression?

582
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,140
What did you do?

583
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,350
She wasn't depressed.

584
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,020
I read her medical record.

585
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,100
For six years,

586
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,960
she was suffering

587
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,730
from depression.

588
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,820
She had recurrent postnatal wound infections.

589
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,530
Did you take good care of her?

590
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,010
She kept calling in sick.

591
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,210
I remember she was often alone

592
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,150
at home taking care of me.

593
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,750
When she was suffering

594
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,860
from her illness and pain,

595
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,770
what were you doing?

596
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,460
Busy moving up the ladder?

597
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,780
She was sick for six years.

598
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,010
You went from attending

599
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,390
up to deputy director, and then director.

600
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,580
You went up like a rocket.

601
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,940
And she?

602
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,230
She was struggling with depression alone

603
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,410
and taking care of me.

604
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,700
Now you told me she wasn't depressed?

605
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,150
Are you justifying

606
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,730
your negligence?

607
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,070
Your mom was

608
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,340
a career-oriented person.

609
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,380
When we got married,

610
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,340
we agreed

611
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,420
to put our work first of having children.

612
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,540
But she was pregnant

613
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,900
soon after she was promoted to

614
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,980
the head nurse.

615
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,190
It was a surprise

616
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,420
that we were not prepared for.

617
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,380
Your mom felt at the time

618
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
that her position was not secure

619
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,860
and wanted to get rid of the child.

620
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,060
I didn't agree.

621
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,400
Although you were the surprising child,

622
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,260
I was willing

623
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,330
to accept you.

624
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,140
But after this surprise,

625
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,540
a chain of unexpected things happened.

626
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,650
When your mom was pregnant,

627
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,770
she was still working hard.

628
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,040
I couldn't stop her.

629
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,180
She said,

630
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,400
she would reduce the impact

631
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,740
of the pregnancy and the baby

632
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,690
on her work to the minimum.

633
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,600
She wanted to be

634
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,030
a great head nurse

635
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
who could win a Nightingale Medal.

636
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,140
She didn't want to fall behind me.

637
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,940
When she delivered you,

638
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,010
it was shoulder dystocia.

639
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,860
It tore the area between her vagina and anus.

640
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,860
I told her to take medicine on time

641
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,100
and rest.

642
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,590
But she went back to work

643
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,750
before she was recovered completely.

644
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,420
Then she got an infection.

645
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,270
After the infection,

646
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,490
she became more anxious and panicked.

647
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,900
Once she saw a little improvement,

648
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,510
she went back to work.

649
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,970
The infection continued

650
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,140
over and over again.

651
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,780
The originally career-oriented person

652
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,740
ended up calling in sick

653
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,700
frequently.

654
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,180
In the end,

655
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,260
her department couldn't take more.

656
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,290
The head doctor talked to her

657
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,070
and put her on long-term leave.

658
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,560
And her position as the head nurse

659
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,940
was replaced by someone else.

660
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,010
That was the last straw.

661
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,030
She wasn't depressed

662
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,740
at all.

663
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,150
She was just a tough woman.

664
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,460
For the sake of

665
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,330
some vain glory in work,

666
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,220
she neglected her family and child.

667
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,340
Jumping off a building

668
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,540
was even more irresponsible.

669
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,130
Jumping off a building?

670
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,180
So the day she disappeared,

671
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,380
she jumped off a building?

672
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,900
The only thing I was glad about back then

673
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,150
was that you didn't see your mom

674
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,190
jumping off.

675
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,070
If you saw it,

676
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,020
it'd be a nightmare

677
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,170
in your whole life.

678
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,650
I really did not expect

679
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,090
that as a doctor,

680
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,460
you attribute my mom's illness

681
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,230
to her being pushy and irresponsible.

682
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,410
If you put aside

683
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,070
your prejudice

684
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,590
and tried to understand her

685
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,710
and pay attention to her emotional changes back then,

686
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,840
it couldn't have escalated

687
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,790
into a real depression.

688
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,020
She was not depressed.

689
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,230
She was just pushy

690
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,060
and stubborn.

691
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,730
That's why she couldn't get out.

692
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,370
I advise you

693
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,760
to be careful in choosing a spouse.

694
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,640
Stay away

695
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,220
from the pushy women.

696
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,280
If she's obsessed with winning,

697
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,210
she'll fall apart at a setback.

698
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,110
No medicines

699
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,180
can save her.

700
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,490
How can you say that?

701
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,310
You're the one

702
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,260
who killed my mom.

703
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,460
It was your attitude

704
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,110
that drove my mom to a dead end

705
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,990
step by step.

706
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,740
Liu Zhenghua,

707
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,610
from now on,

708
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,700
I will never call you dad again.

709
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,550
I will never

710
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,210
need your advice on my life.

711
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,050
Bai Qing,

712
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,390
if I agreed with you

713
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,190
to get rid of the baby,

714
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,460
none of this would have happened, right?

715
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,900
None of this would have happened.

716
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,380
Right?

717
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,820
But I insisted to keep the child.

718
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,250
I'm a jerk.

719
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,020
I'm a real jerk.

720
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,800
I am.

721
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,650
Bai Qing,

722
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,500
I...

723
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,990
I regret it so much.

724
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,800
Oh my God!

725
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,760
This is astonishing.

726
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,900
This is absolutely mind-blowing news!

727
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,570
Oh my God!

728
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,780
Hello?

729
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,300
This is Tian Yunshan.

730
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,300
What?

731
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,290
The vote has been rescheduled.

732
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,240
Why?

733
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,020
An emergency.

734
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,740
OK, then I will ask no more questions.

735
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,900
Well,

736
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,830
we'll arrange it as soon as possible.

737
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:30,940
OK.

738
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,260
Bye.

739
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,810
Liu Nianbai,

740
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,750
you're giving false account of the fact.

741
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,220
You know very well

742
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,440
that your dad didn't take bribes.

743
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,660
And he explained to you.

744
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
Spreading such a video

745
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,330
is false accusation, do you understand?

746
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:56,950
You also know

747
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,260
my mom jumped off a building,

748
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,100
don't you?

749
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,960
Your family lives next door to mine.

750
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,120
You knew the truth all along.

751
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,420
Am I right?

752
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,820
It was a few years later.

753
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,240
I heard it

754
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,740
from my parents' conversation.

755
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,140
You're my best friend,

756
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:15,740
like my brother.

757
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,090
And you worked with my dad

758
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,950
to keep me in the dark for 20 years.

759
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,120
I think you're more like his son.

760
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,820
Your dad begged me

761
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,130
to take care of you

762
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,770
and not to tell you the truth

763
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,430
until you're strong enough to cope with it.

764
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,660
I think concerning this,

765
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
he should tell you the fact himself.

766
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,800
He has no remorse.

767
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,560
He made irresponsible judgments on my mom's depression

768
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,160
and shirked his responsibility.

769
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,340
He also interfered with my love relationship.

770
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,210
There's no chance

771
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,480
of reconciliation between him and me.

772
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,700
So please,

773
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,140
don't report

774
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,280
anything about me to him again.

775
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,230
Or we won't be able

776
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,820
to be friends anymore.

777
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,040
And believe it or not,

778
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,540
I did not spread that video.

779
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,910
But I want to thank

780
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,710
the person who did it.

781
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,200
Congratulations. You won a lottery!

782
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:05,950
But I didn't buy any.

783
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,100
You will soon be the doctor in charge

784
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,860
of a super Internet celebrity!

785
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,210
Which super Internet celebrity?

786
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,520
Angel Naomi, the Funny Dancing Queen.

787
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,940
Never heard of her.

788
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:14,990
What?

789
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,870
How can you be

790
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,920
a vlogger?

791
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,090
You don't even know the top Internet celebrities!

792
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,340
Director Tian made me

793
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,610
become a vlogger.

794
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,730
I had no choice.

795
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,310
You think I'm willing to do that?

796
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,220
Angel Naomi has the third largest number

797
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,620
of followers online.

798
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,820
Amazing.

799
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,980
What for?

800
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,810
What is she good at?

801
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,900
Check it out.

802
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,230
She's pretty

803
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,420
and good at dancing.

804
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,290
What's more,

805
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,390
she makes a fusion of street dance

806
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,500
with jokes.

807
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,170
It's thought she's both cool and fun.

808
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,090
It's a rare case

809
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,980
when there is a vlogger

810
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,710
who is both pretty and outgoing.

811
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,020
She makes whoever watches her videos laugh.

812
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,520
You tell me. If I lecture on ectopic pregnancy

813
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,670
while dancing,

814
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,460
will I get

815
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,830
tens of millions of followers?

816
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,610
In my opinion,

817
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,070
you will get a hundred million followers

818
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,240
if you lecture on ectopic pregnancy

819
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,640
while doing somersaults.

820
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,340
It's not easy to do a somersault.

821
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,810
You buy it?

822
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,170
You're joking on me again!

823
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,120
Go. Go. Go.

824
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,660
Give an indwelling venous catheter

825
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,340
to Wu Juan,

826
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,510
No. 13 Bed,

827
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,720
who needs to be transfused with continuous magnesium sulfate.

828
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,020
No. 13 Bed?

829
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,340
It's Angel Naomi.

830
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,940
So her real name is Wu Juan.

831
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,170
What a lame name.

832
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,370
It's the same person?

833
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,820
That is Angel Naomi?

834
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,340
Yes.

835
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,370
Goodness.

836
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,500
Filters are lairs!

837
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,980
I can't connect her with Angel Naomi.

838
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,740
Hurry.

839
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,210
Check her information.

840
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
No gossip!

841
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,230
Wait.

842
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,860
Let me take a look.

843
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,060
She was born in 1988.

844
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,720
But she said she was born in 1993

845
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,210
in her live streams.

846
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,530
Can people just

847
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,640
be honest?

848
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,000
How hurtful.

849
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,170
Honey.

850
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,420
The doctor told you to stay in bed.

851
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,080
Let's just cut it for several months.

852
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,490
It's not like we're penniless.

853
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,460
Why do you have to work so hard?

854
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,460
My followers complain about it if I cut the live streams,

855
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,580
accusing that I'm too arrogant.

856
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:04,900
They would unfollow me

857
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,090
one by one.

858
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,660
This is all we're capable of.

859
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,070
It's not some great talent.

860
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,730
We maintain our fans by keeping them accompanied.

861
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,340
Constant accompany.

862
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,370
If I don't keep them accompanied,

863
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,430
they'll think the money they spend on me is wasted.

864
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,330
So,

865
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,340
I can't cut it.

866
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,620
I'll have a spontaneous delivery

867
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,210
so that I can do live streams as soon as the baby is born.

868
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,270
This is the work ethic of an Internet celebrity.

869
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,950
Understood?

870
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,120
Understood.

871
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,730
It's true.

872
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,530
But I feel worried about you.

873
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,280
I'll be fine. I'll get changed.

874
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,750
You can't stand up.

875
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,670
Stay in bed.

876
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:36,700
Hon.

877
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,960
Lie down.

878
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,680
Be very careful.

879
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,340
Li Dabiao?

880
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,850
You're Angel Naomi's husband?

881
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,930
Oh, my gosh.

882
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,490
So you're a couple.

883
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,900
This is a huge gossip.

884
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,050
Well, Miss.

885
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,380
Please keep it to yourself.

886
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,720
My wife's network image

887
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,900
is fashion and joke.

888
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,930
Mine is silly and ring-a-ding.

889
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,270
No one can know

890
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,990
we're a couple.

891
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,450
Or we'll lose our fans.

892
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:01,940
Got it.

893
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,480
I'll keep it to myself.

894
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:03,960
No worries.

895
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,480
Come on, Naomi.

896
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,850
I'll give you an indwelling venous catheter.

897
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,460
Wu Juan, right?

898
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,630
You're now pregnant

899
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,480
for 30 weeks.

900
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,989
But your cervical canal

901
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,590
is less than 1 cm long.

902
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,469
So you should try your best

903
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,860
to stay in bed.

904
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,659
Don't stand up.

905
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,780
One of my fans told me

906
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,790
the one with a short cervical canal

907
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,480
can have cerclage of cervix.

908
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,980
That's only possible at the early stage of pregnancy.

909
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,949
Your uterus now is like

910
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,400
a balloon full of water

911
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,590
which is not tightened,

912
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,699
so it's easy for the water to seep.

913
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,360
We don't have

914
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,139
a better solution.

915
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,909
Stay in bed for as long as you can.

916
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,699
Hold on for as long as you can.

917
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,909
Don't put too much pressure

918
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,900
on your uterus.

919
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,650
Though

920
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,090
the survival rate of premature infant

921
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,239
in our hospital

922
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,980
is rather high,

923
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,510
but it's the best

924
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,960
if the fetus matures naturally

925
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,070
in its mother's uterus.

926
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,070
I have stayed in bed

927
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,989
except when I was doing a live stream.

928
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,639
You don't want anything to go wrong at the last moment, right?

929
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,310
You've been trying so hard for months.

930
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,409
Something can go wrong in one minute.

931
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,020
Luckily, you don't have

932
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,320
any bleeding or uterine contractions.

933
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,470
If you take a walk off bed

934
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,200
and do a live stream,

935
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,260
your baby can fall,

936
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,160
which may cause uterine contractions.

937
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,030
Then we'll have to

938
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,830
terminate the pregnancy.

939
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,320
I'll think about it

940
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,460
and find a way to do a live stream

941
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,330
without sanding up

942
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,320
or dancing.

943
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,510
I'm gonna prick.

944
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,430
Being an Internet celebrity

945
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,440
needs a lot of physical strength.

946
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Dancing

947
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,620
and interacting with followers

948
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,270
while telling jokes.

949
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,730
It's not an easy job.

950
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,770
Director Tian.

951
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,460
Sorry about that.

952
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:40,980
Sorry.

953
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,420
It's okay.

954
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,940
You're watching a short video?

955
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,020
Yeah.

956
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,810
What brings you to the wards?

957
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:49,980
Li Wei said

958
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,140
there are some complex cases.

959
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,380
I'd like to check on them.

960
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,380
Well.

961
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,860
I don't know the patients.

962
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,420
I'll learn about them.

963
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,330
You see?

964
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,420
One can be a celebrity

965
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,410
with a few followers.

966
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,460
It's easy-peasy to be a star.

967
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,860
What about you?

968
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,580
How many followers have you got?

969
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,820
Like hundreds of thousands?

970
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,000
It's nearly hundreds of thousands.

971
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,140
Not bad!

972
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,410
It took effect quickly.

973
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,680
How many exactly?

974
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,940
Sixteen.

975
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,820
How many?

976
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,990
Sixteen.

977
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,900
The definition of the word "nearly"

978
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,970
on your textbooks in the 90s

979
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,580
is quite different

980
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,960
from that

981
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,140
on our text books in the 70s.

982
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,500
Well, Director Tian.

983
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,620
I'm a mere beginner,

984
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,170
aren't I?

985
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,450
Don't worry.

986
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,610
I'll try my best.

987
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,740
Then make sure you learn

988
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,930
something

989
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,990
from this Nao something.

990
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,070
If the number of your followers fail

991
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,700
to reach a hundred thousand before she's discharged,

992
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,990
I'll have someone else take your place.

993
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,830
I called on all of my families and relatives,

994
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,420
plus every one of my friends.

995
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,140
That's how I got these 16 followers.

996
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,260
I don't have a hundred thousand relatives.

997
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,240
Follow my account.

998
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,980
Hello. Hi, everyone.

999
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,140
This is your dear Angel Naomi.

1000
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,210
Here I am in hospital today

1001
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,030
to get fully prepared

1002
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,300
for my baby to be born.

1003
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,500
In the past few months,

1004
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,060
I've been dancing for you.

1005
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,360
Isn't it soul-touching?

1006
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,630
But today the doctor told me

1007
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,470
I have to stop dancing.

1008
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,590
So,

1009
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,050
let's just chat today.

1010
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,950
You can ask me

1011
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,390
any questions.

1012
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,380
I'll surely answer them.

1013
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,810
Naomi.

1014
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,940
When is your baby due?

1015
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,840
When is it due? It's still early.

1016
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,720
But because of some tiny congenital problems

1017
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,210
of mine,

1018
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,720
I'll have to stay in bed,

1019
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,060
waiting for a few weeks for the baby to mature.

1020
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,260
The fans who like my dancing,

1021
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,520
you have to wait for a while.

1022
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,820
You're in poor health.

1023
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,600
So the baby is not in a good condition.

1024
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,000
I agree that you're in poor health.

1025
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,990
That was what my ex-girlfriend experienced.

1026
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,030
She had an abortion.

1027
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,590
The baby would be miscarried if you don't lie down.

1028
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,820
That's not true.

1029
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,660
I never had an abortion.

1030
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,550
It's just a tiny congenital problem

1031
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,580
of mine.

1032
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,500
It's the first time I've been pregnant.

1033
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,920
You put on make-up when the baby is coming out soon?

1034
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,120
You're just irresponsible.

1035
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,340
It may cause fetal malformation.

1036
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,560
-You are greedy for money!
-I didn't dare to turn on the computer

1037
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,670
when I was pregnant.

1038
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,450
Yet you're doing a live stream now.

1039
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,990
It has radiation, you know?

1040
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,300
It's bad for the baby.

1041
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,980
When being pregnant,

1042
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,350
the cosmetics I have been using

1043
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,330
are usable for pregnant women.

1044
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,170
Because during pregnancy,

1045
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,360
a mother-to-be's skin

1046
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,470
will greatly change

1047
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,400
due to changes in female hormone.

1048
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,840
It may become sensitive

1049
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,810
and vulnerable.

1050
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,580
So

1051
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,640
during pregnancy,

1052
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,950
I'd choose some safe cosmetics

1053
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,180
that contain natural plant ingredients

1054
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,460
with mild texture,

1055
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,690
which can easily be absorbed by the skin.

1056
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,150
Let me show you

1057
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,140
what I'm using

1058
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,110
so that you'll know.

1059
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,260
It's 100 percent safe.

1060
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,190
Come on, bring

1061
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,050
my cosmetics.

1062
00:38:59,620 --> 00:38:59,980
Come on.

1063
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:02,760
Come on.

1064
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,340
Let me show you.

1065
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,750
Let me share them with you.

1066
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,980
My "What's in my bag".

1067
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,690
Your cosmetics are

1068
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,580
usable for pregnant women?

1069
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,610
It's the one.

1070
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,220
It's a 100 percent safe product

1071
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,050
usable for mother-to-be.

1072
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,750
Don't worry.

1073
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,020
And.

1074
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,450
I never had any abortions.

1075
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,250
No worries.

1076
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,280
You know

1077
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,580
the doctors tend to exaggerate

1078
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,530
the situation.

1079
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,320
What are you doing?

1080
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,730
Angel Naomi is doing a live stream.

1081
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,380
There are some

1082
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,220
weird comments.

1083
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,170
She said the doctor told her to stay in bed.

1084
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,740
One comment said she's in poor health.

1085
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,300
One said she put on make-up when being pregnant.

1086
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,940
Another accused her irresponsible

1087
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,380
as she put the baby under radiation which will cause fetal malformation.

1088
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,560
One said the doctor exaggerated the severity.

1089
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,860
I'm so pissed.

1090
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm reasoning with him.

1091
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,910
You don't have to be so serious

1092
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,120
about what's happening online.

1093
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,620
They are a bunch of fribbles.

1094
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,750
It only occurred to me now

1095
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,860
there are many people

1096
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,220
who are ignorant of obstetric and gynecologic.

1097
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,470
What they are talking about is nothing but prejudice

1098
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,370
and fake science.

1099
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,480
See?

1100
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,330
There is someone picking up a fight,

1101
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,980
saying she must have had too many sex partners,

1102
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,260
so she got cervical erosion.

1103
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,500
I just can't believe it.

1104
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,490
Someone still buys it?

1105
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,220
Cervical erosion is

1106
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,180
not even a disease.

1107
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,060
Let me see.

1108
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,620
I got the hospital's and doctor's permission

1109
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,580
to do this live stream.

1110
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,230
Those Internet celebrities

1111
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,300
are basically

1112
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,160
catering for their fans.

1113
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,180
See?

1114
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,640
She doesn't have the gut

1115
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,430
to talk about her condition.

1116
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,310
Me standing up in the live stream?

1117
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:29,940
This...

1118
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,180
This is too...

1119
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,590
Easy!

1120
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,500
Is she insane?

1121
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,670
Stay calm, Congrui.

1122
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,480
Naomi

1123
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,380
is standing up.

1124
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,950
She stands up.

1125
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,950
You're in good shape.

1126
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,710
Right?

1127
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,720
Even during her pregnancy!

1128
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,990
Where is the big gift?

1129
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,490
Dancing? No.

1130
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,540
A heart for all of you.

1131
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,760
Where is the applause?

1132
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,460
Stay in bed!

1133
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,510
Fair skin.

1134
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,130
I heard some noise.

1135
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,370
Who is it?

1136
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:56,770
You're beautiful as always.

1137
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,160
The baby will be in danger if you stand.

1138
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,990
Don't take it out

1139
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,010
on the baby.

1140
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,090
Miss Doctor, you're pretty.

1141
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,550
What is going on?

1142
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,420
It's the very department of this hospital

1143
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,910
that asked me to boost

1144
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,590
Dr. Wu's account that spreads medical knowledge.

1145
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,150
Why did you give ten sports cars?

1146
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,210
And...

1147
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,770
-I can do this live stream
-He gave them to the doctor.

1148
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,510
because I'm in a single ward.

1149
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,240
She wouldn't listen to me.

1150
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,440
-Like it's my baby!
-Let's call it a day.

1151
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,870
-It's my baby. But I can't interfere.
-See you tomorrow, dear.

1152
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,030
Love you guys.

1153
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,660
-Just lie down.
-She just wouldn't listen to me.

1154
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,690
Great. I told you to take care of her.

1155
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,480
Take care of her!

1156
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,260
She just wouldn't listen to me.

1157
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,130
I'm alright.

1158
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,240
Just go to bed.

1159
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,250
Are you alright?

1160
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,580
Do you feel uncomfortable?

1161
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,500
No. No.

1162
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,620
I'm sorry.

1163
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,670
I was

1164
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,500
too loud just now.

1165
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,160
But I was really anxious.

1166
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,170
You're born with a short cervix uteri.

1167
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,150
Luckily,

1168
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,300
you have registered at Shengji Hospital

1169
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,610
and been put under intensive care,

1170
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,250
or you'll easily miscarry.

1171
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,590
Now it's already

1172
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,310
30 weeks.

1173
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,940
Why don't you just keep up the good work?

1174
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,260
And,

1175
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,480
those comments

1176
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,540
are so vicious.

1177
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,150
Why not quit the live stream?

1178
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,170
It may affect you.

1179
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,220
It's okay.

1180
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,980
I'm used to it.

1181
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,570
Those netizens aren't exactly

1182
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,610
bad people.

1183
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,670
They just want to find a way

1184
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,820
to vent their anger.

1185
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,110
What's more,

1186
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,810
it's my duty to please them.

1187
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,800
If I failed to do so,

1188
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:13,820
we wouldn't make

1189
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,130
so much money, would we?

1190
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,300
You have a strong will.

1191
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,330
Look like not all people

1192
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,810
can be an Internet celebrity.

1193
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,530
What choice do we have?

1194
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,700
If you really care about it,

1195
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,730
you'll die of anger.

1196
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,620
Just pretend you've never seen it.

1197
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,510
I think too much, then.

1198
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,800
But do stay in bed

1199
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,710
from now on.

1200
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,260
Got it?

1201
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,260
Thank you, Doctor Wu.

1202
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,640
Come to me if you have any problems.

1203
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,140
Okay.

1204
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,140
Thank you.

1205
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,360
-Take care of her.
-Thank you.

1206
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,230
Bye bye.

1207
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,460
Stay in bed. You hear that?

1208
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,590
Hi, Doctor Li.

1209
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,500
How do you feel today?

1210
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,310
What's your problem?

1211
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,690
Fine if you don't follow my words,

1212
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,160
but why don't you even take the doctor's advice?

1213
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,200
Are you crazy?
