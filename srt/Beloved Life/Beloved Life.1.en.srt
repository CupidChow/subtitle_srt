00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,820
What a good colleague.

174
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,340
Well,

175
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,260
let's eat the cake together.

176
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,110
I'll cut the cake for you.

177
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,540
Come here.

178
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,890
There's nothing to be celebrated

179
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,740
You've been hired as an attending doctor,

180
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,820
yet still have to work as the chief resident.

181
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,220
Wondering how long it will take.

182
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,970
Dr. Lin,

183
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,850
you should encourage the young,

184
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,440
instead of more negative talk.

185
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,830
Congratulations.

186
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,370
Congratulations.

187
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,230
As Dr. Lin said,

188
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,930
the hospital is understaffed.

189
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,530
And you haven't been done with the training yet.

190
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,700
I still have to work

191
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,559
as the chief resident.

192
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,390
for at least a year.

193
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,850
It's better than not getting hired.

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,840
Right.

195
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,409
How about this?

196
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,030
Let's celebrate tonight.

197
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,190
I heard that Lin Wei

198
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,260
deflated the trainees again today.

199
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,180
You know,

200
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,250
that's how he is.

201
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,050
His fingers get itch to say something uncomfortable.

202
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,460
What's up?

203
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,300
I want to have a communication with you

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,090
about personnel.

205
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,810
Now, Li Jun Xiao

206
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,510
has been promoted,

207
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,010
but his job hasn't been promoted yet.

208
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,060
As you know, totally there are

209
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,930
two chief residents in our department.

210
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,970
One got promoted.

211
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,970
What about the other?

212
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,790
He can't just skip meals and sleep.

213
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,220
So now you can search for

214
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,460
a suitable resident

215
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,520
to take over.

216
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,020
In principle,

217
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,450
after the residency training,

218
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,590
residents should work for another several years.

219
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,560
Only after the second round of training

220
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,010
can a resident become the chief resident.

221
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,020
I know that,

222
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,100
but now,

223
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,030
We urgently need some personnel.

224
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,440
If there is an excellent

225
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,970
and suitable resident,

226
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,900
I think it's totally fine to let someone take over first.

227
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,500
Look,

228
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,900
The incision is so small.

229
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,860
The stitches are so exquisite.

230
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,770
Who sewed this?

231
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,680
Du Di.

232
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,830
This morning, the parturient had a dystocia labor.

233
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,070
The fetal heart rate is dropping,

234
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,150
and the amniotic fluid is muddy.

235
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,150
The parturient's life is in danger,

236
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,360
but the line two arrived.

237
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,660
Du immediately decided

238
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,080
to do the cesarean section.

239
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,470
Not only did she finish the surgery perfectly,

240
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,700
the stitched incision is also perfect.

241
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
Du's technique

242
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,170
is already that great?

243
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,050
Yes.

244
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,500
After all, she's Director Zhang's student.

245
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,870
In terms of technology,

246
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,140
the next chief resident

247
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,090
must be Du.

248
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,540
But the chief resident

249
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,480
is not only required to be a skilled doctor,

250
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,540
but also need powerful

251
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,650
communication and coordination skills.

252
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,210
Not only need to have conversations with the family member,

253
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,330
but also coordinate and communicate with

254
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,920
every department in the whole hospital.

255
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,160
Du is too stubborn,

256
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,780
so that she always quarrels with patients' family members.

257
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,970
we can't do the cesarean section.

258
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,540
Why?

259
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,090
We can't do it without certain signs.

260
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,460
What do you mean?

261
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,030
I don't understand.

262
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,310
If you don't understand, then listen to the doctor

263
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
I can't stand it anymore.

264
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,010
Don't cry.

265
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,210
Shut your mouth and breathe.

266
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,320
Focus.

267
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,320
If you have the energy to cry, you have the energy to give birth.

268
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,170
Push harder.

269
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,700
One, two, three.

270
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:39,980
Push.

271
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,700
Come on. Try harder.

272
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,890
Relax. Relax.

273
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,960
Harder.

274
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,570
No.

275
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,600
It hurts so much.

276
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,670
I don't think I can give birth.

277
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,210
Doctor, how about we do the cesarean?

278
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,510
Having a spontaneous labor you suffered now.

279
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,940
Having a cesarean section you would suffered after that.

280
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,510
You're young and full of energy.

281
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,220
You must have energy to give birth,

282
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,870
right?

283
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,460
Come on.

284
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,750
You have to believe in yourself

285
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,140
and your baby.

286
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,440
It's trying to get out.

287
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,150
You have to work hard too, right?

288
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,530
The child is out.

289
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,260
Look.

290
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:11,800
You made it.

291
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,250
Worth it, right?

292
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,800
The baby looks like you.

293
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,980
Those eyes are so big.

294
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,190
You are

295
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,950
the gentlest

296
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,100
and the most professional doctor.

297
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,140
It was the mom's own

298
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,390
hard work.

299
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,030
Wu Congrui's communication and coordination abilities

300
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,770
is suitable.

301
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,510
She is

302
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,740
smart and honeylipped.

303
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,140
When she meets a bad-tempered family member,

304
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,610
she can do anything

305
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,980
like acting coquettishly, acting shamelessly or whining

306
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
to make them feel embarrassed

307
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,310
and not to lose temper

308
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,580
She can solve the problem.

309
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,580
But as for the professional skills,

310
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,530
compared to Du Di,

311
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,300
She's got a lot to work.

312
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,130
I mean why those two

313
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,500
can't be combined as one person.

314
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,610
Have you heard that?

315
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,820
I heard that among us residents,

316
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,920
after the training,

317
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,360
they will choose one to be the chief resident.

318
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,190
But only us

319
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,210
have the greatest hope to be chosen.

320
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,800
Do you want to be the chief resident?

321
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,030
Chief resident?

322
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,540
Of course.

323
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,620
It can save

324
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,780
a few years.

325
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,170
Just one year as the chief resident,

326
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,090
I can try to be hired as an attending doctor.

327
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,940
Becoming the attending doctor

328
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,300
is finally to be the real doctor.

329
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,510
We've been studying for so many years.

330
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,550
Isn't that what this is all about

331
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,580
But I also want to be the chief resident.

332
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,590
I always want to have a baby for years.

333
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,470
But I couldn't make it work.

334
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,700
Now I don't want to think about it anymore.

335
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,830
I want to focus on my work.

336
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,730
Leave the rest to fate.

337
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,570
Even the playing field.

338
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,670
I think it's the only way then.

339
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,140
I won't let you win.

340
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,010
Neither will I.

341
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,600
Why are you laughing?

342
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,610
Do it if you can.

343
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,310
You can't win acting like this.

344
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,650
Let me show you.

345
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,780
Sister?

346
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,610
Are you an adult? Why should I call you sister

347
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,740
Being a gamer has nothing to do with age.

348
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:32,930
Come on.

349
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,330
Li Qiao'er.

350
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:40,910
It's your turn.

351
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,710
I've been called. Hurry up.

352
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:47,380
I won.

353
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,980
It turns out that only with the good gamer

354
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,740
can upgrade quickly.

355
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,700
Go.

356
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,700
Wait for me to come out.

357
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,570
We'll battle again.

358
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,310
Hurry up. Hurry up.

359
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,660
Li Qiao'er.

360
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,580
Sit.

361
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,850
What's the matter?

362
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,870
She's pregnant.

363
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,080
So young.

364
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
I am almost 19 years old.

365
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,060
You're not married, are you?

366
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,520
No.

367
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,410
Is your file constructed here?

368
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,000
What is that?

369
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,770
I want an abortion.

370
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,930
Have you had it before?

371
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:26,700
No.

372
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,760
Go for a gynecologist first.

373
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,120
to see if there are conditions for abortion.

374
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,570
Go get a blood test later.

375
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,510
and the HCG.

376
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,400
Then go in for an ultrasound.

377
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,450
Go lie in bed.

378
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,350
Okay.

379
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,900
Dr. Lin, it's done.

380
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,510
When the result is ready,

381
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,260
you come back again.

382
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,260
Then I'll tell you

383
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,220
where to do the procedure.

384
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,800
Okay, thank you, doctor.

385
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,530
You're welcome.

386
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,220
Thank you.

387
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,830
Another girl who was cheated on

388
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,780
by her boyfriend.

389
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,260
In the end,

390
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,190
It's always the women who get suffered.

391
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,180
Why do I feel like

392
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,180
something is wrong?

393
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,710
What do you think?

394
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,170
Observe first.

395
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,470
There are risks,

396
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,920
but don't worry too much.

397
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,220
Dr. Huang,

398
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,070
thank you for accepting me.

399
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,540
I searched it online.

400
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,570
Many people say that

401
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,720
if the parturient has some serious diseases,

402
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,970
you must find Dr. Huang from Shengji.

403
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,140
They said you're an expert in obstetrics.

404
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,490
and the Song Zi Kwan-yin.

405
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,070
I'm afraid you won't accept me

406
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,890
since there are so many people come after you.

407
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,810
I'm not that amazing.

408
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,900
According to your situation

409
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,770
we should accept you.

410
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:42,890
Dr. Huang.

411
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,460
Congrui.

412
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,380
Li Ran.

413
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,980
This is my student, Wu Congrui.

414
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,230
I sent her to you

415
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,060
to be your primary doctor.

416
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,360
You can ask her

417
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,190
about some common questions.

418
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,060
Hi, Dr. Wu.

419
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,850
Hello.

420
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,850
Congrui.

421
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,690
Come here.

422
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,530
What's going on?

423
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,290
Her blood pressure is too high. It's very risky.

424
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,680
She's been giddy for days.

425
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,090
Keep an eye on her.

426
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,050
Isn't that just pregnancy-hypertension syndrome?

427
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,020
The most common disease.

428
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,300
Why do you have to tell me?

429
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,010
What's going on?

430
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,670
Tell me.

431
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,500
It doesn't look like that.

432
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,740
Her husband is not a good guy.

433
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,580
He's not easy to deal with.

434
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,040
I'm afraid others can't handle it.

435
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,830
You're smart and honeymouthed.

436
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,370
It's easy to communicate with him.

437
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,680
If I give this case to Du Di.

438
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,880
I'm afraid they'll fight.

439
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,060
That's insane.

440
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,230
Anyway, keep an eye on them.

441
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,320
I'm going for the surgery.

442
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't worry, Dr. Huang.

443
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,830
I will complete the task.

444
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,010
Does anyone come with you?

445
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,900
So should someone accompany me here,

446
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,460
or not?

447
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,540
It's better to have someone with you.

448
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,170
Yes.

449
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,520
We were playing games just now.

450
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,500
That's good.

451
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,020
You can't have an abortion.

452
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,660
It's luckily that you came early.

453
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,140
The echo tests shows that

454
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,010
you have an ectopic pregnancy.

455
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,930
The fetus attaches outside the uterus

456
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,099
It could attach to your fallopian tube.

457
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,339
What you need now

458
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,369
is to get the surgery immediately.

459
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,020
Having the ectopic pregnancy is very dangerous.

460
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,470
Once the fallopian tube gets broken,

461
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,630
your life will be in danger.

462
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,420
Go through the hospitalization procedure now.

463
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,460
Inform your family members

464
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,369
come here to sign the operation agreement.

465
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,750
Is...is it that serious?

466
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,420
Doctor.

467
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,339
Well,

468
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,380
is this surgery more expensive

469
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,340
than abortion?

470
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,170
I don't think your health insurance covers our hospital.

471
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,030
You need to spend more money.

472
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,090
Can I not do the surgery?

473
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
You have to.

474
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,640
But he only gave me the money

475
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,410
for abortion.

476
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,620
If I asked him for money again,

477
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,380
he would scold me.

478
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,500
Who is he? Is he even a man?

479
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,690
I'll talk to him for you.

480
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,790
No. No. No.

481
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,740
I mean what's your opinion.

482
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,810
If I don't the surgery,

483
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,970
how long can I hold on?

484
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,700
Let me explain it to you.

485
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,850
Why do you

486
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,950
have to do the surgery now?

487
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,900
Who is Li Qiao'er's family?

488
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,810
Is someone here with Li Qiao'er?

489
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,780
What's the matter?

490
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,850
It's you.

491
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,790
You are still obesssed with your phone?

492
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,460
Do you know

493
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,380
what your girlfriend suffered?

494
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,620
I don't know.

495
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,080
Have you had a physiological class?

496
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,140
You made a girl pregnant and refused to pay.

497
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,090
Are you a man?

498
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,100
Let me tell you.

499
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,250
Your girlfriend is pregnant.

500
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,340
She refuses to have the surgery now.

501
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,180
You mean Li Qiao'er?

502
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,210
She's not my girlfriend.

503
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,070
What?

504
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,460
when you tricked her into having sex with you,

505
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,200
she was your girlfriend.

506
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,180
Now that she got pregnant,

507
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,150
she's not your girlfriend anymore.

508
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,290
That was quick move.

509
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,220
Shameless on you!

510
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,550
Doctor.

511
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,530
Don't scold him.

512
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,960
He's not my boyfriend.

513
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,280
We just met today.

514
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,520
Don't protect him.

515
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,820
She's really not my girlfriend.

516
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,360
I'm here for a friend.

517
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,800
We just played

518
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,960
two rounds of game together.

519
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,530
It's really a misunderstanding.

520
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
Excuse me. Be careful.

521
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,540
Excuse me.

522
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,290
Sorry. Excuse me.

523
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,850
Please. Excuse me. Can I get by?

524
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,420
Please. Excuse me. Can I get by?

525
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,040
Excuse me.

526
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,230
Can I get by?

527
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:03,930
Excuse me. Excuse me.

528
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,790
Slow down.

529
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,660
My white shoes.

530
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,790
It's hard to buy these.

531
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,840
I wear them

532
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,870
for the first time to see Wei.

533
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,770
It's you.

534
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,220
The female ob-gyn.

535
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,000
Do you know me?

536
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,860
Don't try to making connection with me.

537
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,210
Since you're not her family,

538
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,660
please don't occupy

539
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,000
the seating resources of our O.B. department.

540
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,720
Please leave.

541
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,290
Doctor Du, right?

542
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,980
You talk irresponsibly

543
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,610
and are easy to get pissed off.

544
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,810
I suggest you test if you have endocrine dyscrasia.

545
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,810
in case it affects your patients.

546
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,240
Thank you.

547
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,770
Please leave now.

548
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,520
Don't worry.

549
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,200
I will never come again.

550
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,480
What a jerk.

551
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,180
Wait.

552
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,310
What's wrong?

553
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,320
Well,

554
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,910
can you please

555
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,900
lend me some money

556
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,850
since I helped you upgrade in game.

557
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,780
Feeling better?

558
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,980
Still dizzy.

559
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,600
This is my primary doctor,

560
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,260
Dr. Wu

561
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,770
This is my husband.

562
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,810
Her dizziness

563
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,860
has nothing to do with the sex life.

564
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,000
Well... this

565
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,100
dizziness has not that much to do

566
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,230
with what you did.

567
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,370
As for her,

568
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,710
We need to hurry up

569
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,340
to solve her hypertensive problem.

570
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,620
She has gestational hypertension.

571
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,700
So during pregnancy,

572
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,600
you need to eat something light.

573
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,560
Light food?

574
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,010
Does spicy chicken wings count?

575
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,910
Sir,

576
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,450
How could you think that

577
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,470
spicy chicken wings have anything to do with

578
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,250
light food.

579
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,550
What did you give her

580
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,360
during her pregnancy?

581
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,340
She likes salty food.

582
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,140
She likes spicy food.

583
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,420
Isn't it said that if the mother is having a girl she would like spicy food?

584
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,870
Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.

585
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,980
I bought them for her.

586
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,060
She's pregnant,

587
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,330
and still eat those high-fat, high-sodium takeouts?

588
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,300
What kind of husband

589
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,830
are you?

590
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,670
Didn't you go to antenatal classes

591
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,870
with your wife?

592
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,700
antenatal classes?

593
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,310
Your mother

594
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,310
or your mother-in-law,

595
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,900
didn't they tell you anything?

596
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,860
There was once a popular saying

597
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,700
in the past.

598
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,700
Have you heard of it?

599
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,640
in Chinese or English.

600
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,230
Chinese.

601
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,380
Human who lies

602
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,750
will swallow 1,000 needles.

603
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,940
Did you swallow it?

604
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:23,560
Me?

605
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,600
I wonder who lied at the clinic

606
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,300
turns out was blocked in front of the ward.

607
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,860
What do you mean?

608
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,050
You...

609
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,200
I just reminded you to keep fasting.

610
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,790
What's wrong with you as her boyfriend?

611
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,930
Can't you remind her?

612
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,070
Didn't I tell you though

613
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,490
that I'm not her boyfriend.

614
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,230
I just came to go through the hospitalization procedure

615
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,740
with my friend.

616
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,420
Friend?

617
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,050
If I remember that correctly,

618
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,910
she is the friend

619
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,660
you just met today.

620
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,230
Yes.

621
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,620
You are so idle.

622
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,180
You come to the clinic of the O.B. department

623
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,820
on working day.

624
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,970
make a friend by the way.

625
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,670
and accompany your friend to check in.

626
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,610
You will be with her

627
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,410
during the surgery?

628
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,300
Did you pay

629
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,030
the surgery.

630
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,850
I don't think so.

631
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,710
I need to meet a friend.

632
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,430
I won't do the surgery with her.

633
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,780
You really piss me off.

634
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,560
You're so persistent.

635
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,280
Doctor, are you still going to do the examination?

636
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,720
Yes.

637
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,050
Take a look at this bill.

638
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,080
Where are you going? Pay the money.

639
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,540
I've already paid.

640
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,900
It's now that you are scared.

641
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,070
It's normal

642
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,910
to stay here alone.

643
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,910
Call your boyfriend

644
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,620
to accompany you.

645
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,020
That guy just now.

646
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,780
He's really not my boyfriend.

647
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,260
I've never been hospitalized.

648
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,470
I don't know what to do.

649
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,580
So I asked him to help me.

650
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,470
He won't come back again

651
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,840
since he done with all procedures.

652
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,380
Really?

653
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,670
You're not protecting him?

654
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,270
Really.

655
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,110
He is a Doctor coming back

656
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,110
from abroad.

657
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,730
How can I match

658
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,600
such a boyfriend?

659
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,950
A doctor like him?

660
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,430
What about your real boyfriend?

661
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,290
Tell him to come over.

662
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,570
He said

663
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,110
When he gives me the money for the abortion,

664
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,280
and told me

665
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,340
not to meet him again.

666
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,180
What kind of man is he?

667
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,190
Shameless!

668
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,130
Doctor,

669
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,880
I can do this by myself.

670
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,700
I just borrowed some money from someone.

671
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,030
I should be able to afford the surgery.

672
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,290
We still need family members.

673
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,800
If anything goes wrong

674
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,900
during the operation,

675
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,020
we can communicate

676
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,950
with the family in time.

677
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,400
If something really happens,

678
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,080
just leave it to fate.

679
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,080
There's still some time before the surgery.

680
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,200
You'd better

681
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,100
call your family to to come here.

682
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,100
Congrui,

683
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,750
you didn't sleep well last night?

684
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,690
No matter how well the resident slept,

685
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,440
she wants to get more sleep.

686
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,190
If I were you,

687
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,480
I would have quit long ago.

688
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,920
Dr. Feng has developed so well

689
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,830
in the Newborne Department.

690
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,730
He is still at such a young age,

691
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,930
yet deputy director already.

692
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,200
You have such a reliable husband.

693
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,640
Why are you so tired?

694
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,760
Unless

695
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,510
your husband

696
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,750
is like that man just now.

697
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,010
That's too hard

698
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,410
He'll be unreliable for the rest of his life.

699
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,580
Check her blood pressure frequently.

700
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,870
gestational hypertension is a big deal.

701
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,200
I don't think

702
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,230
we can count on her husband.

703
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,960
Doctor.

704
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,000
Doctor.

705
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,970
My wife will check out soon, right?

706
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm not sure yet.

707
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,870
I have to go on a business trip

708
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,020
for a week.

709
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,830
Will she stay there for a week?

710
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,710
I'm not sure.

711
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,360
Do you have to go out?

712
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,710
Who will take care of her?

713
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,970
There's no one else at home.

714
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,480
She said she could do it by herself.

715
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,690
But...

716
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm coming. I'm coming.

717
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
My friend is waiting for me downstairs. I...

718
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,710
If you...if you have something,

719
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,400
call me.

720
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,710
But her blood pressure hasn't been controlled yet.

721
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,570
Call me.

722
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,470
Come back early.

723
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,550
What a jerk.

724
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,940
How unreliable.

725
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,590
Lalalala

726
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,150
Are you exhausted?

727
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,090
Lalalala

728
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,140
I delivered seven babies today.

729
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,270
Seven!

730
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,920
A whole team of little babies just like the Calabash Brothers.

731
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,930
Today I delivered the most babies

732
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,470
since I worked in this hospital.

733
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,290
Every time I see

734
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,230
the baby was born,

735
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,050
I felt

736
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,510
great happiness in my heart.

737
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,010
Although my body is tired,

738
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,510
the sense of accomplishment

739
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,420
make me very happy.

740
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,240
I chose OB-GYN before.

741
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,590
It was the right choice.

742
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,410
Because in this world,

743
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,370
there is no job

744
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,430
is more meaningful

745
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,370
than witnessing the birth of a new life.

746
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,700
The meaning is about to tiring you out.

747
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,710
A dystocia case

748
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,660
got me busy for the whole afternoon.

749
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,910
So I missed

750
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,730
Dr. Lin's surgery.

751
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:26,940
What time is it?

752
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,120
It's 8 pm.

753
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,960
I have to go now.

754
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,990
Li Junxiao asked me

755
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,830
to have dinner at his place.

756
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,010
He invited you to his place for dinner?

757
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,990
Is he going to propose to you?

758
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,200
No way.

759
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,900
Why not?

760
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,980
Has he ever

761
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,600
invite you

762
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,460
to his place for dinner before?

763
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,430
That's because it's too far away.

764
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,390
he lives in suburbs

765
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,370
with two roommates.

766
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,710
It takes two and a half hours to go back and forth.

767
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,290
Why not take that time to sleep?

768
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,190
So,

769
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,680
there must be something.

770
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,460
He got promoted today

771
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,180
What if he wants to make another happy events?

772
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,600
If he proposes to you,

773
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,170
will you say yes?

774
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,350
Why are you hesitating?

775
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,070
You two are the most stable couple

776
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,200
in the world.

777
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,500
Also, be careful.

778
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,420
Many single nurses

779
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,040
and doctors

780
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,640
are suitors for Li Junxiao.

781
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,210
Your reaction is too big.

782
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,190
He might be taken away by others

783
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,290
if you don't marry him.

784
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,290
Why didn't I know

785
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,150
that someone likes him?

786
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,150
It's not exaggerated at all.

787
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,800
I think Ye Ying has crush on him.

788
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,680
Do you really think

789
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,220
it's a good time for us to get married?

790
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,430
Why not?

791
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,020
I want to get married after I got hired as an attending.

792
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,640
One of you rents house in the suburbs

793
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,720
with others.

794
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,640
One lives in a basement

795
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,440
far from the hospital.

796
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,200
If two people get married together,

797
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,460
your living condition would get better

798
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,980
and the cost of life would decrease.

799
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,740
That's great.

800
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,940
If getting marriage

801
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,470
is only to reduce the cost of life,

802
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,900
it will be meaningless.

803
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,790
I still want to do it

804
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,460
after my work stabilizes.

805
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,060
I have to think about

806
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,270
every step in life clearly.

807
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,750
Don't let it affected by external factors.

808
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,540
But there are nothing to

809
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,810
affect your marriage.

810
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,830
You two have been dating

811
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,530
since college for five years.

812
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,600
I mean you should get married soon.

813
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,720
Do what one should do

814
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,980
at one's age.

815
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,870
You're 29. You should get married.

816
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,490
You know?

817
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,300
The way you talk now

818
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,650
is very like Director Huang.

819
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,110
I'll stop talking nonsense. I'm leaving.

820
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,030
Say yes.

821
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,900
Yes, you will.

822
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:27,630
You are here.

823
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,120
Why did you light the candle?

824
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,900
So romantic.

825
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,460
The landlord wants to sell the house

826
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,400
to force us to move.

827
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,010
I don't have time to move.

828
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,210
After my two roommates moved out,

829
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,730
he stopped the electricity in the house.

830
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,900
I thought

831
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,870
I bought vegetables and meat today

832
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,830
to cook for you.

833
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,130
But it's all wasted.

834
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,410
But I ordered some takeout.

835
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,660
It will arrive soon.

836
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,550
Why did you order takeout after such a long time preparing?

837
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,280
What did you order?

838
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,190
The crayfish we had

839
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,540
on our first date.

840
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,920
Crayfish is so expensive these days.

841
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,080
Although crayfish

842
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,680
is not suitable for

843
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,790
the atmosphere tonight.

844
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,760
But I think

845
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,790
it's meaningful.

846
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,390
Du Di,

847
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,090
There's no electricity tonight,

848
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,220
but the candles in the house

849
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,330
make this romantic.

850
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,420
Marry me.

851
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,830
My savings now

852
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,870
is only enough for the ring in this kind of size.

853
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,040
When I get a raise,

854
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,530
I will work hard and make money

855
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,360
to get a bigger one for you.

856
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,200
No.

857
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,080
I didn't mean that.

858
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,250
Get up first.

859
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,260
Haven't we discussed this yet?

860
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,950
we should get married

861
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,540
after our works stabilize.

862
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,890
I'm stable now.

863
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,970
When I knew that promotion,

864
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,450
my first thought

865
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,990
was to propose to you.

866
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,220
But I am not.

867
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,930
It's only the second round for me.

868
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,800
And there's one year before the training ends.

869
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,630
I have to compete with Congrui

870
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,670
to compete for the position of chief resident

871
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,330
one year later.

872
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,620
Why do you still need to compete with her?

873
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,940
Just let her win.

874
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,380
As long as you can guarantee that

875
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,230
you can pass the training exam,

876
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,580
I'm sure you can stay in the hospital.

877
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,730
Let's get married and have children first.

878
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,250
and then you can get promoted slowly.

879
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,370
Otherwise,

880
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,710
you will be chief resident for a year

881
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,520
and one year of training.

882
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,700
After all that,

883
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,910
you will be 31 years old.

884
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,360
If you are just like my situation,

885
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,110
for a while there will not be a suitable candidate

886
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,890
to take over

887
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,950
the chief resident's position.

888
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:45,990
If it takes two more years,

889
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,670
you'll become an elderly primipara.

890
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,210
Honey, here.

891
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,160
Honey,

892
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,330
we both are doctors.

893
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,210
If we want to have a family,

894
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,410
they will definitely sacrifice

895
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,610
one's career.

896
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,820
Women

897
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,670
will get married and have children sooner or later.

898
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,890
Whenever a woman has a baby,

899
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,000
she will delay her work.

900
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,420
So it's meaningless

901
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,370
to pick a better time.

902
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,220
I've thought about it.

903
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,620
If our first child

904
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
is a girl,

905
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,410
when she's two to three years old,

906
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,240
we'll have another child.

907
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:20,830
That's perfect.

908
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,750
A girl and a boy can make a good match.

909
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,590
Jun Xiao,

910
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,930
I haven't say yes to your proposal.

911
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,450
Yes.

912
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,630
I stood up in a hurry.

913
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,540
Let's finish the proposal.

914
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
I want to compete for the chief resident.

915
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:40,520
Why?

916
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,400
I want to finish the stage of junior doctor

917
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,190
in the shortest time.

918
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,790
And become the best ob-gyn

919
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,980
in the best O.B. department.

920
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,730
Back in college,

921
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,160
This is the goal I set

922
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,990
when I decided on the direction of obstetrics and gynecology.

923
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,390
And it has never changed.

924
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,300
I know.

925
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,250
I know your idol.

926
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,030
is Lin Qiaozhi.

927
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,460
But you can't be another Lin Qiaozhi.

928
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,770
She's never married in her life.

929
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,840
Do you want to be like her?

930
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,950
I am not saying that

931
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,110
I will follow into Lin Qiaozhi's every footstep.

932
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,540
But I am an up-and-comer now.

933
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,670
At such a critical moment,

934
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,690
you want me to stop my career

935
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,270
to give birth and take care of my family.

936
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,290
I will see the people around me

937
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,070
all on the way up,

938
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,200
but I sit here doing nothing.

939
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,530
I can't do this.

940
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,390
Besides, the time I would have spent on having a child

941
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,270
is not just one or two years,

942
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,960
but for at least four or five years

943
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,170
I won't get focused on my work.

944
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,680
Then my career will delay

945
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,870
for more than four or five years.

946
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,590
So you want to be an elderly primipara?

947
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,030
Thirties is not that old.

948
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,570
Why not?

949
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,600
You are

950
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,460
an ob-gyn.

951
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,320
There are many women

952
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,010
in their forties

953
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,230
They also get married and have children.

954
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:32,830
But the problems

955
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,630
in their bodies

956
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,630
are no match for

957
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,130
the girls in her twenties?

958
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,300
Have you ever seen a few

959
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,850
in their twenties with gestational hypertension?

960
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,170
We both are doctors.

961
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,610
Stop lying to yourself.

962
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,730
Besides, I'm not saying that

963
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,600
you should quit your job.

964
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,240
I just want you to put off your work for two years.

965
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,910
Just do it for our family.

966
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,590
Also I'm already an attending.

967
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,550
Why can't you

968
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,520
give up the competition for a while

969
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,720
and take good care of our family?

970
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,070
Why do I have to give up

971
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,120
the dream of mine

972
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,350
for the sake of the family?

973
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,120
Is my career

974
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,160
worthy of respect?

975
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:55,890
The truth is

976
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,990
as long as you female want to have a baby,

977
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,830
and take care of it,

978
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,090
it will definitely drag influence your work.

979
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,760
Otherwise, you can just be like Lin Qiaozhi.

980
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,960
It turns out that in your mind,

981
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,950
I'm even not an equal person as you

982
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,140
But

983
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,590
a tool with uterus.

984
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,990
Why should

985
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,740
a competent gynecologist

986
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,480
should take her family

987
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,160
as the ultimate goal of life?

988
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,140
Enough.

989
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,040
Stop arguing with me.

990
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,830
The truth is that women,

991
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,310
especially female doctors,

992
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,640
can't do well in

993
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,480
both work and family.

994
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,730
You can only choose one.

995
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,770
Don’t think that

996
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,710
you changed the character in your name from the meaning of having a brother

997
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,270
to being like a queen,

998
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,320
you are the real queen then.

999
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,790
Yes, even if we are the queen,

1000
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,000
you have to have a son

1001
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,710
and try your best to ascend the throne.

1002
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,420
Li Junxiao,

1003
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,080
You know

1004
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,950
I hate sexism most.

1005
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,530
You know I hate others

1006
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,200
saying my name is

1007
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,420
to having a younger brother.

1008
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,810
I always thought

1009
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,970
the reason why you chose the ob-gyn department

1010
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,040
is that you understand

1011
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,190
and respect women.

1012
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,540
I guess I was wrong.

1013
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,050
I can't say yes to

1014
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,520
your proposal today,

1015
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,270
Besides, I really need to think about it.

1016
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,910
Whether we

1017
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,710
are suitable to be together?

1018
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,570
What do you mean?

1019
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,940
Wait.

1020
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,470
Du Di,

1021
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,200
if you

1022
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,270
leave this door today,

1023
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:00,820
I, Li Junxiao,

1024
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,240
will never propose to you again.

1025
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,050
I need to use the bathroom.

1026
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,500
Calabash Brothers have shown their powers.

1027
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,690
Honey.

1028
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,720
Look.

1029
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,690
It's positive!

1030
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,469
Honey, do you

1031
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,530
forget how to smile?

1032
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,050
That's impossible

1033
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,739
Last month,

1034
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,400
we just had that once

1035
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,670
during the break.

1036
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:19,980
It can't be so accurate.

1037
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,159
Look.

1038
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,620
These are my efforts

1039
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,760
and the Calabash Brothers'.

1040
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,150
What does it have to do with Calabash Brothers?

1041
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:25,690
You don't understand.

1042
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,110
I've decided.

1043
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,600
The child's nickname

1044
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,460
will be Calabash Brothers.

1045
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,650
Are you still competing for the chief resident?

1046
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,310
Right.

1047
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,070
I can't participate in the training test

1048
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,219
in a year later.

1049
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,719
What should we do?

1050
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:43,860
Come here.

1051
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,830
Let me analyze it with you.

1052
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,850
The O.B. Department is understaffed.

1053
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,239
Besides, Director Tian just got promoted.

1054
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,679
The upgrade channel is not

1055
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,500
as tight as before.

1056
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,530
I should say

1057
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,710
this is the easiest stage to get promotion

1058
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,659
in Shengji O.B. Department

1059
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,710
ever.

1060
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,410
If we don't have baby now,

1061
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,720
we will finish the training one year later.

1062
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,670
with another year of chief resident.

1063
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,940
And your mentor

1064
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,680
is that

1065
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,990
most senior ones, Director Huang.

1066
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,500
If you can catch up with a good research project.

1067
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,350
It's very likely to get promotion rapidly.

1068
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:12,870
But if

1069
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,070
we keep this baby

1070
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,630
We'll continue to attend the training two years later,

1071
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,120
and be the chief resident for another year.

1072
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,790
It almost spent four years.

1073
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,870
After four years,

1074
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,090
the positions available

1075
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,510
will be occupied by others.

1076
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:25,700
no matter how hard you will try then,

1077
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,370
it's useless.

1078
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,760
So you must think this carefully.

1079
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,240
whether you want the baby

1080
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,400
or your career?

1081
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,340
I want this baby.

1082
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,300
Dr. Huang is going to do his rounds.

1083
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:43,990
Everything is ready.

1084
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,060
Family members,

1085
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,960
this is our director,

1086
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,510
Dr. Huang.

1087
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,890
I'm here to check on you guys.

1088
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,060
Hello, Director Huang.

1089
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,830
Hello.

1090
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,110
The patient in the first bed is 25 years old.

1091
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,560
The main cause is menopause for 13 weeks.

1092
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,710
and vomiting for six weeks.

1093
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,000
A week after her condition worsened, she was admitted to the hospital

1094
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,290
She used to have regular menstruation

1095
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,390
and then had menopause for 34 days.

1096
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,960
We have done the urinalysis

1097
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,460
and the HCG.

1098
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,170
It's confirmed that she's pregnant.

1099
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,180
Forty days after she got menopause, she had nausea

1100
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,410
and intermittent vomiting

1101
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,030
without abdominal swelling, diarrhea,

1102
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,780
and fever.

1103
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,810
Pulse up.

1104
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,390
We did the general check-up.

1105
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,140
It showed that there are mild dehydration symptoms.

1106
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,920
It fits the hyperemesis gravidarum.

1107
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,960
I remember you

1108
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,630
was admitted by me yesterday.

1109
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,090
The KET level

1110
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,350
was 150 per 100 milliliters.

1111
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,640
Your urinary specific gravity was at 1.025.

1112
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,110
How do you feel now?

1113
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,630
Director,

1114
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,410
Now she is still

1115
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,800
vomiting seriously

1116
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,190
I made her

1117
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,130
a lot of nutrimeals.

1118
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,000
But she can't eat a bite.

1119
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,470
What should we do?

1120
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,440
If she's always like this.

1121
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,670
How could the baby absorb nutrition?

1122
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,770
This gravida told me

1123
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,280
she wanted to have an abortion.

1124
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,060
But this mother-in-law

1125
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,280
put too much pressure on her.

1126
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,470
by keeping her eating.

1127
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,030
But in this situation,

1128
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,440
She can't eat anything.

1129
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,540
I understand your concern.

1130
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,740
But at this point

1131
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
I have to explain to you.

1132
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,070
This hyperemesis gravidarum

1133
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,850
is different from

1134
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,720
common norning sickness.

1135
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,860
It's a disease

1136
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,130
not something mental.

1137
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,010
nor just being namby-pamby.

1138
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,010
We need to cooperate with the doctor.

1139
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,930
The care and understanding of the family members

1140
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,680
are very important to the mother.

1141
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,470
I understand.

1142
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,590
I understand.

1143
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,070
I've been taking good care of

1144
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,220
to take care of my daughter-in-law.

1145
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,870
You are a good mother-in-law.

1146
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,150
Your daughter-in-law is also a good one.

1147
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,710
But you don't know

1148
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,420
there was some gravidae

1149
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,670
with serious hyperemesis gravidarum in our hospital.

1150
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,610
Also someone can't stand it anymore.

1151
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,300
After discussing with family members,

1152
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,030
someone chose

1153
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,690
to do the abortion.

1154
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,290
Your daughter-in-law

1155
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,490
is pretty tough.

1156
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,610
She is so strong.

1157
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,940
You need to encourage her.

1158
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,480
Thank you, Director Huang.

1159
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,710
I will hang in there.

1160
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,750
Don't worry.

1161
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,690
We will help you.

1162
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,140
What should we do next?

1163
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,700
Congrui, your turn.

1164
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,150
Try intermittent fasting.

1165
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,600
Adequate intravenous injection to supplement the patient's nutrition.

1166
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,080
Inject 3,000 to 3,500 ml

1167
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,310
per day.

1168
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,230
Add potassium extremum, calcium extremum,

1169
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,280
and increase caloric intake.

1170
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,710
Add vitamin C.

1171
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,570
Vitamin B6.

1172
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,580
What else?

1173
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,030
There's more?

1174
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:17,930
Also,

1175
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,110
Fix the hypopotassaemia and hypoglycemia as soon as possible.

1176
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,000
and correct dehydration.

1177
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,550
During the treatment,

1178
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,870
closely monitor the blood electrolyte level,

1179
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,830
the urinalysis

1180
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,270
and the arterial blood gas.

1181
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,560
Strictly record the intake and outflow.

1182
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,950
Doing fluid replacement by her urine volume.

1183
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,450
Okay.

1184
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,430
Wang Qianqian, 32 years old.

1185
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,320
20 weeks pregnant.

1186
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,710
She was pulled to the hospital by ambulance last night.

1187
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,050
She had little vaginal bleeding

1188
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,070
after doing housework.

1189
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,970
The echo tests shows

1190
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,960
some suspicious signs of placental abruption.

1191
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,450
What's your opinion

1192
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,000
your treatment?

1193
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,220
Du Di,

1194
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,470
based on

1195
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,540
her clinical performance,

1196
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,360
it's very risky to keep the baby.

1197
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,400
We should

1198
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,610
terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible.

1199
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,770
What do you think? Chongrui.

1200
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,250
Judged by the ultrasound test,

1201
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,720
we can terminate the pregnancy.

1202
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,990
But...

1203
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,540
But?

1204
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,160
But I suggest we keep the fetus,

1205
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,310
because she has polycystic ovarian syndrome.

1206
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,090
She hasn't been pregnant for seven years.

1207
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,290
This baby was conceived

1208
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,410
because she was treated of infertility

1209
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,870
for many years.

1210
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,640
If she does the abortion this time,

1211
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,240
I'm afraid she won't have

1212
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,170
the chance to be a mother again.

1213
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,070
Dr. Huang,

1214
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,930
please help me.

1215
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,300
I really want to

1216
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,370
keep this baby.

1217
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,110
How about this?

1218
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,620
First of all, We'll keep your baby.

1219
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,980
I'll find you

1220
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,540
an well-experienced

1221
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,220
doctor

1222
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,650
to give you another ultrasound test.

1223
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,190
If it shows no fresh bleeding

1224
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,970
and all indicators are good,

1225
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,450
you can try

1226
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,600
to keep the baby.

1227
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,000
Great.

1228
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,300
Thank you so much, Director Huang.

1229
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,810
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

1230
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,120
What's your name?

1231
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,970
Chen Ping.

1232
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,820
Chen Ping.

1233
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,590
Doctor,

1234
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,980
we have to do a C-section this time.

1235
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,630
She had two babies

1236
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,370
that both are naturally-borned.

1237
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,500
There's no signs of C-section now.

1238
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,750
She's a multipara.

1239
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,580
She will have a third natural birth.

1240
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,380
It should be fine.

1241
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,510
But the babies both died.

1242
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,080
How?

1243
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,790
They both died

1244
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,580
in less than 12 hours after she gave birth.

1245
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,830
Look at my daughter-in-law.

1246
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,700
She is short and young.

1247
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,350
with small butts.

1248
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,750
It must be that the baby was squeezed by the mother

1249
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,270
during the normal birth.

1250
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,600
That's impossible.

1251
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,590
There must be

1252
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,590
some reasons.

1253
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,730
Did the babies perform an autopsy?

1254
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,940
They were so little.

1255
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,580
Isn't that a sin?

1256
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,660
We didn't do it.

1257
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,760
Did you

1258
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,910
tell the doctor?

1259
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,380
Why isn't it on the medical record?

1260
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Such a shameful thing

1261
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,240
How could we

1262
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,220
shouting about it?

1263
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,740
Anyway, we have to do the C-section this time.

1264
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,620
How about this?

1265
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,700
I'll discuss with the superior doctor

1266
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,800
and I'll reply you then.

1267
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,220
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

1268
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,350
Please help me.

1269
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,160
OK.

1270
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,600
My name is Yuan Ya.

1271
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:54,760
The due date has passed away.

1272
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,640
I'm going to have a natrual birth.

1273
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,090
Do you have the uterine contraction?

1274
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:57,820
No.

1275
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,530
Normally in this case,

1276
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,440
the due date is the 40th week.

1277
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,840
There is no need to terminate the pregnancy.

1278
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,940
If there are no special problems

1279
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,030
we don't need to terminate the pregnancy.

1280
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,020
We can wait for the 41th week

1281
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,630
to do the labor induction.

1282
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,600
You can give natural birth.

1283
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,960
If your induction fails, we will give you the caesarean section.

1284
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:10,840
If there are any other

1285
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,910
comorbidities.

1286
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,460
we need specific analysis.

1287
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,970
I have to give a natural birth.

1288
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,100
It depends on

1289
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,750
your actual situation

1290
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,750
and also

1291
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,280
the fetus's situation.

1292
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,500
My judgment is fine.

1293
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,400
You're in the hospital.

1294
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,490
If you still need to make your own judgment,

1295
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,390
what do you want us doctors to do?

1296
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,260
What your doctor said

1297
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,430
are not always right.

1298
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,190
We will consider

1299
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,210
your opinion as well.

1300
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:28,770
Calm down.

1301
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,550
Don't argue with the patient.

1302
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,640
Her due date passed.

1303
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,740
So she must be very anxious.

1304
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,070
If you don't listen to the doctor in the hospital,

1305
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:37,790
then don't come at the very start.

1306
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,670
Patients nowadays

1307
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,930
are full of ideas.

1308
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,750
They will check it online.

1309
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,470
If you are driven by

1310
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,470
their emotions,

1311
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,290
they will complaint about

1312
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,080
your bad attitude.

1313
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,590
Sometimes,

1314
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,820
You'll just need to be patient awhile, and then you'll be all right.

1315
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,890
Look at me.

1316
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,080
I just smile.

1317
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,800
I'll smile no matter what the patients have done to me.

1318
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,430
It's hard to rant at someone who is already on their knees.

1319
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,770
No wonder the head nurse said you have high emotional intelligence.

1320
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,280
I can't force myself to smile.
