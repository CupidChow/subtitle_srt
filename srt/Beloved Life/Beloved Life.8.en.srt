00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:44,580
Done.

5
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,330
Not bad, Liu Nianbai.

6
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,100
You're quite versatile.

7
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,200
Thanks.

8
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,450
Praise me more.

9
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,060
I'll get up

10
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,680
if you praise me to 100%.

11
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,479
If you don't get up, I'll kick you.

12
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,509
I'm up now.

13
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,520
Your company has finally hired a new worker.

14
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,570
That nursing worker was always late.

15
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,200
She should have been fired long ago.

16
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,990
Bed 46 needs a nursing worker.

17
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,740
Hurry up.

18
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,350
Are you new?

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,240
Go get changed first.

20
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,560
The clothes are in the lounge.

21
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,630
Over there.

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,650
Hello, are you a nursing worker?

23
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,930
Ma Zan and dad are both here.

24
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,940
We don't need a nursing worker.

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,480
No?

26
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,470
I'm leaving then.

27
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,430
Don't go.

28
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,340
Mom, I work every day.

29
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,510
I may not come every day.

30
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,170
It's convenient to have a nursing worker.

31
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:08,930
Mom?

32
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,230
So this is the daughter-in-law?

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,310
So, your mom and wife

34
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,170
give birth together?

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes, double happiness.

36
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,920
Son, the nursing workers

37
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,950
are not quite necessary.

38
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,660
I can take care of both of them.

39
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,380
Dad.

40
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,579
Can you take care of me

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,510
when the doctor checked my dilatation?

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,160
When I need sponge bath or go to the toilet,

43
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,230
can you take care of those?

44
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,310
You have to turn around

45
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,370
even when I'm having an ultrasound.

46
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,610
How can you exactly take care of me?

47
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,260
It's settled.

48
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,510
Six thousand a month, right?

49
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,680
Six thousand?

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,120
Yes.

51
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,600
Thank you.

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,110
Take good care of my wife.

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,270
Okay, I will.

54
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,150
I'll throw away

55
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,270
your garbage, okay?

56
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,500
Who are you?

57
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,950
I... I...

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,600
This is illegal.

59
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,520
Do you know?

60
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,880
How would I know?

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,670
A nurse

62
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,500
asked me to go there.

63
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,040
I don't know what's going on.

64
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,290
What is this place?

65
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,860
This is a hospital.

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,500
What is a hospital for?

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,470
A hospital is a place to save and treat patients.

68
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,810
It's a serious place.

69
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:25,770
First,

70
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,200
you haven't been trained.

71
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,610
It's illegal to work without certification.

72
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,540
Second,

73
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,750
you haven't had rigorous

74
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,820
physical examination and disinfection.

75
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,470
It's against the law to go in and out of the ward

76
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,620
with bacteria.

77
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,030
You're going to jail.

78
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,090
No, no, no.

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,560
Please don't sue me.

80
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,140
I...

81
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,380
I just came to find someone.

82
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,670
A nurse told me

83
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,260
to go to Bed 46.

84
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,350
I went there without thinking.

85
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,140
I did nothing.

86
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,659
I just threw away some trash.

87
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,280
What do you say

88
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,230
I take off these clothes

89
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,690
and return them to you?

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,670
Don't tell anyone.

91
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,140
Are you from the countryside too?

92
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,550
Yes.

93
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,890
Why do you come to the city?

94
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,280
I've only been here for two days.

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
I haven't done anything yet.

96
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,210
We're destined to meet.

97
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,030
Let me find you a job.

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,750
Just don't sue me.

99
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,670
How dare I ask you

100
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,790
to find a job for me?

101
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,750
Here's the thing.

102
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,490
I've been working in this hospital

103
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,250
as a nursing worker.

104
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,950
I have to come every morning.

105
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,120
My daughter-in-law just gave birth recently.

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,010
I have to help them to take care of the baby.

107
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,840
That's why I'm always late,

108
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,740
always.

109
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,770
If I keep doing this,

110
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,650
I can't keep my job.

111
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,980
You look quite honest

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,140
and deft with the work.

113
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,300
I want to recommend you

114
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,480
to my boss.

115
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,820
You go and have some

116
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,600
nursing workers' training.

117
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,890
We'll take turns

118
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,970
in this ward.

119
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,140
I can also take a breath.

120
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,140
What do you think?

121
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,290
Okay.

122
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,570
But is the training

123
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,620
difficult?

124
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,570
No, no.

125
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,740
It's tiring to be a nursing worker,

126
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,409
but our work is stable.

127
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,970
The doctors and nurses are of high quality.

128
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,080
They don't scold us or skimp on our wage.

129
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,930
Sometimes when a woman

130
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,090
is discharged,

131
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,740
she might give

132
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,380
the food or drink to the nursing workers.

133
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,830
If you're lucky to run into a generous family,

134
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,290
or some family has a son,

135
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,260
they even give us a red envelope with lucky money.

136
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,980
Just go take the nursing work training.

137
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,920
Do whatever

138
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,170
the training requires you do to,

139
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
then you'll be fine.

140
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,220
Thank you in advance then.

141
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,460
It's okay that I do some more work

142
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,410
and take less money.

143
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,660
It's settled then.

144
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,760
The twins of this pregnant woman are in different positions:

145
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,140
one is in normal position and the other remains breech.

146
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,860
The relative position of the twins

147
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,010
are very important.

148
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,180
If the first baby, the lower one that is,

149
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,710
is in head position

150
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,010
We can consider the spontaneous delivery.

151
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,610
As for the second baby,

152
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,810
after the first delivery,

153
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,970
we need to artificially rupture the membranes immediately

154
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,420
and deliver it by breech extraction.

155
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,030
Otherwise, if the orifice of the uterus retracts,

156
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,290
the second child won't be able to come out.

157
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,770
If the fetus in the breech position is incomplete

158
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,240
breech or feet presentation,

159
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,040
after the artificial membrane rupture,

160
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,960
there may be

161
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,030
prolapse of cord at any time.

162
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,350
The breech extraction

163
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,260
is a difficult technique.

164
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,409
So for now,

165
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,940
unless both of the twins are in head position,

166
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,170
it's usually recommended to have a C-section.

167
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,710
But in this case

168
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,140
a spontaneous delivery should be

169
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,860
viable.

170
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,780
It looks like so.

171
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
But during the delivery,

172
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,790
many problems may emerge.

173
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,370
For example, after the first one is born,

174
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,030
the risk of uterus cavity suddenly decreases.

175
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,240
The fetus will change position.

176
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,270
If it switches to a horizontal position,

177
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,720
it's impossible to be delivered through the vagina.

178
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,580
We need to change to C-section immediately.

179
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,610
The position is very likely to

180
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,360
change.

181
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,810
If the second fails to be delivered spontaneously,

182
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,440
then in the end, they'll have two ways of delivery.

183
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,410
The family will feel

184
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,280
they've suffered twice.

185
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,620
They would really mind it.

186
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,320
You being younger than me,

187
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,410
I didn't expect you can be

188
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,180
my teacher in the aspect of delivery.

189
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,900
Of course.

190
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,020
Do you think

191
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,930
we midwives know nothing?

192
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,140
As for this pregnant woman,

193
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,380
I suggest you have a thorough communication

194
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,140
with the patient's family.

195
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,270
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

196
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,530
I will.

197
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:34,950
What's wrong?

198
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,740
Nothing.

199
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,370
I have something to do.

200
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,170
Let's work well on the case of twins

201
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:39,850
this afternoon.

202
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,670
Okay.

203
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,950
Eat slowly, sis.

204
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,850
Have some soup. Don't choke.

205
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,630
The food in your canteen

206
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,530
is so delicious.

207
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,030
The food in the hospital

208
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,470
is just clean and cheap.

209
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,100
It's not tasty at all.

210
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,110
You citizens

211
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,900
are so spoiled.

212
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,110
If you work at the construction site for two days

213
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,570
and have the food from a big pot there,

214
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,590
you'll know

215
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,580
what not tasty means.

216
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,740
Can you tell me now?

217
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,170
What are you doing here?

218
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,580
I came to find Du Di

219
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,660
and to see if you two

220
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,710
are still possible to get together?

221
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,730
No.

222
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,680
Don't do this again.

223
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,220
Is that Du Di?

224
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,809
Who is the man next to her?

225
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,140
A colleague of ours.

226
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,920
I think

227
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,300
he has a special relationship with Du Di.

228
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,720
Is that man rich?

229
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,450
Did Du Di dislike you

230
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,320
because you're poor?

231
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,650
Sister,

232
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,070
Stop asking about these things.

233
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,900
What did you do in the ward?

234
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,620
I have good news for you.

235
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,820
I found a job.

236
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,060
Someone introduced me to be a nursing worker.

237
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,980
[Jiangbin Home of Nursing Workers Company, Ltd.]

238
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,040
I don't agree.

239
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,790
Why not?

240
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,490
Sister.

241
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,560
Aren't you here for a trip?

242
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,920
Just stay for two days and go back.

243
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,060
Why are you looking for a job here?

244
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,770
It's great to work here.

245
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,480
It's better than working on a construction site.

246
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,530
They offer higher wage, too.

247
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,990
Besides,

248
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,270
your salary

249
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,070
can just afford that small house.

250
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,770
When I get paid,

251
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,360
let's find a bigger one together,

252
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,560
a closer one to the hospital.

253
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,080
Sister, stop messing around.

254
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,390
Just stay for two days and go back.

255
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,600
Besides, if you work here,

256
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,460
how about my brother-in-law?

257
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,080
I...

258
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,770
I'm divorced.

259
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,180
Why?

260
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,190
We've been married for years

261
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,070
and I couldn't get pregnant.

262
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,950
Your brother-in-law said I couldn't bear babies.

263
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,410
My mother-in-law

264
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,680
forced me to eat all kinds of folk remedies.

265
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,540
You couldn't even imagine

266
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,930
how bad those folk remedies taste.

267
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,390
They even made me vomit and have a diarrhea.

268
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,080
I really can't stand it anymore.

269
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,380
Why didn't you come to me?

270
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,930
Your brother is

271
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,350
a gynecologist.

272
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,410
How about this?

273
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,250
You and my brother-in-law

274
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,490
come for a check-up tomorrow.

275
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,330
It's no use.

276
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,330
Why not?

277
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,140
He has other women now.

278
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,150
He's cheating,

279
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,800
but he uses having babies as excuses.

280
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,090
That bastard.

281
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,350
I'll get even with him.

282
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,360
Don't go.

283
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,600
Your brother-in-law helped you a lot

284
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,860
all these years when you were in school.

285
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,270
My mother-in-law always scolds me.

286
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,120
The other day she called me

287
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,550
a brother-raising "momster"

288
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,090
and called you a bottomless pit.

289
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
He's not a bad guy.

290
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,400
If you have to blame someone, blame me.

291
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,210
I don't have a good womb.

292
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,280
I couldn't get pregnant whatsoever.

293
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,630
Now that I'm divorced,

294
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,420
your brother-in-law didn't ask me

295
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,620
to pay back the money for your tuition.

296
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,570
Just let me stay in the hospital, okay?

297
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,030
I won't tell anyone that I'm your sister.

298
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,920
Let's pretend we don't know each other.

299
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,700
Sister, you...

300
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,460
I won't embarrass you.

301
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,760
Do you usually

302
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,830
practice with this?

303
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,690
Or else?

304
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:22,580
Only rookies use

305
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,580
pig skin.

306
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,800
I'm done. You guys go ahead.

307
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,090
She said I'm a rookie.

308
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,360
What do you think you are then?

309
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,030
Du Di's techniques

310
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,100
are getting even better.

311
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,640
When can I, the pig,

312
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,970
catch up with her, the chicken?

313
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,520
What is she so arrogant for?

314
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,760
You'll surpass her sooner or later.

315
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,190
If I were her, I would be arrogant too.

316
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,740
Look at her skills.

317
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,930
Haven't you heard of it?

318
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,220
The better a person is, the more low-profile he is.

319
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,390
There are so many academicians

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,960
in Shengji.

321
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,050
None of them is arrogant.

322
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,720
They are all gentle and modest.

323
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,930
If I were a academician,

324
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,240
I would walk horizontally.

325
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,980
I won't walk straight.

326
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
Stop dreaming.

327
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,770
What do you want to ask? Hurry up.

328
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,020
Among all the women you've delivered,

329
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,250
what's the oldest age?

330
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,030
What will happen

331
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,020
during the process?

332
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,120
It's quite common

333
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,140
to meet women in their 40s.

334
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,160
There was once a woman over 50,

335
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,240
but there are many complications.

336
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,150
She went to C-section directly.

337
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,930
She didn't come to me at all.

338
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:21,980
It mainly

339
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,130
depends on

340
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,320
the primipara's physical condition.

341
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,610
If she is old and weak,

342
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,040
the laboring process will be extended.

343
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,140
In which case,

344
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,710
the uterus will be less powerful to contract.

345
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,410
It's possible to bleed after delivery.

346
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,440
If she has other diseases,

347
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,790
the problem will be more complicated.

348
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,900
Does your patient

349
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,700
have any diseases?

350
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:45,950
I...

351
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,110
You want

352
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,440
to be an academician like this?

353
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,370
And you dream to walk horizontally?

354
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,330
Hurry up and recite

355
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,190
the medical records!

356
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,160
Why is everyone scolding me?

357
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,370
Oh no.

358
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,540
I took it for nothing.

359
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,590
What do you mean?

360
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,390
I've never seen

361
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,470
such a healthy old woman.

362
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,710
She has no heart disease,

363
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,630
nor high blood pressure.

364
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,040
She doesn't even have hemorrhoids.

365
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,360
No wonder she's already 48

366
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,120
and still wants to have the baby.

367
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,100
I would give birth

368
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,370
if I were this healthy at 48.

369
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,450
Are you talking about Shang Guifen?

370
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,040
Let me see.

371
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,160
Oh, you're right.

372
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,480
She's good at taking care of herself.

373
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,300
She must be from a rich family.

374
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,130
I've already figured it out.

375
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,610
This couple

376
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,170
has a regular life.

377
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,940
They don't smoke or drink.

378
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,070
They just like traveling.

379
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,100
When they have spare time,

380
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,050
they like to go jogging.

381
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,640
I know

382
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,950
I shouldn't be

383
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
depressed by her healthiness.

384
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,660
But if I knew this,

385
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,170
why would I steal it from my best friend?

386
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,880
What about her daughter-in-law?

387
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,100
How is she now?

388
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,750
I don't know.

389
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,360
Let me check it for you.

390
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,230
Rudimentary horn pregnancy?

391
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,870
And it's a full term?

392
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,140
No, that can't be.

393
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,440
[Sangji Hospital Inpatient Record]

394
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,230
Look.

395
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,650
Rudimentary horn pregnancy

396
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,100
is the malformation of uterus.

397
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,190
There is another uterus

398
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,160
next to a normal uterus,

399
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,620
which is similar or different.

400
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,560
And this uterus

401
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,510
is often underdeveloped.

402
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,950
It's called a rudimentary horn.

403
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,650
If the embryos develops

404
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,230
in this uterus,

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
It's a rudimentary horn pregnancy.

406
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,170
It often breaks by itself

407
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,080
during the middle term.

408
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,390
It's extremely rare

409
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,450
to see such a pregnancy last to full term.

410
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,250
This is the first time I saw rudimentary horn.

411
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,010
The C-section of a rudimentary horn pregnancy

412
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,180
needs to deal with the rudimentary horn

413
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,450
at the same time.

414
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,750
We might even need to remove it altogether.

415
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,660
The surgery is extremely complicated.

416
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,880
The risk of bleeding is high.

417
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,240
Normally, in the early pregnancy,

418
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,550
it should be stopped in time

419
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,970
when a rudimentary horn pregnancy was found out.

420
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,420
Otherwise, it may break at any time.

421
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,580
It's extremely risky

422
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,420
to choose to go on the pregnancy.

423
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,230
Why did she

424
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,390
rish so much to get pregnant until the full term?

425
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,200
Junxiao,

426
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,850
do you think God

427
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,830
is punishing me?

428
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,960
I stole a patient from my best friend.

429
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,670
But I got an ordinary one.

430
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,940
What she's been left, is a rare one.

431
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,950
It's really rare.

432
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,550
I guess when you both

433
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,490
rushed in,

434
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,660
neither of you

435
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,760
checked the patient's medical records carefully.

436
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,760
Director Huang received

437
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,870
the senior patient.

438
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,040
Because she's quite old,

439
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,170
the hospital attached great importance to it.

440
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,910
Dr. Huang checked her

441
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,990
in person.

442
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,330
I think you still have a chance.

443
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,280
Director Huang will help you anyway.

444
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,180
Go to her

445
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,290
and ask her

446
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,370
to swap the patient

447
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,160
between you two.

448
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,910
I can't do that.

449
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:56,900
You're a coward.

450
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,160
This is how competition is.

451
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:01,890
You can't get cold feet now.

452
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,140
I took it once.

453
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,820
I felt guilty for a long time.

454
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,370
If you ask me to switch back,

455
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,760
that's not something humans should do.

456
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,770
Anyway, think it through.

457
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,280
You two have at most

458
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
one year left.

459
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,810
For such rare cases,

460
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,590
you may not encounter one

461
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,460
for a year.

462
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,220
But it is so rare,

463
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,270
what if

464
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,060
I can't handle it?

465
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,070
I'm afraid even I can't.

466
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,790
Not to mention you.

467
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,100
Didn't you create a filing

468
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,970
in our hospital?

469
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,700
I don't want to meet

470
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,480
my mother-in-law in the same hospital.

471
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,560
So you know about

472
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,310
your own situation.

473
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:45,980
Yes.

474
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,580
I transferred here because

475
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,730
my husband said

476
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,880
it's safer to come here.

477
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,430
The operation...

478
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,920
Has been arranged, right?

479
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,590
Why do you keep asking?

480
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,620
Before the surgery...

481
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,070
I told you to stop.

482
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,260
If you want to say anything, tell my husband.

483
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,950
Your risk of operation...

484
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,820
Stop talking.

485
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,210
Doctor.

486
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,970
What surgery?

487
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,040
Isn't she having a spontaneous delivery?

488
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,730
How could she

489
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,670
have a spontaneous delivery?

490
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,319
-Her surgery is very risky. -Stop it. I don't want to hear it.

491
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,599
What's wrong with you?

492
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,560
The surgery is coming up.

493
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,339
We can't find your husband

494
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,630
to sign the consent form.

495
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,710
When I communicate with you,

496
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,750
you never let me finish.

497
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,869
You shouldn't have

498
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,099
taken the risk to have the child.

499
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,700
Do you know that your rudimentary horn

500
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,069
may break at any time?

501
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,890
Doctor, I'm here.

502
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,390
Let's talk outside.

503
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,720
See you.

504
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,940
Doctor, my parents don't know yet.

505
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,240
I was afraid they would worry,

506
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,110
so I didn't tell them.

507
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,470
I didn't expect that they

508
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,060
were admitted by two directors

509
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,780
but still ended up in the same ward.

510
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,380
I'm sorry.

511
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,350
You don't have to apologize to me.

512
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,820
I can forgive

513
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,020
your wife's attitude towards me.

514
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,140
But I can't understand

515
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,900
your way of doing things.

516
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:01,770
And you.

517
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,030
Why didn't you stay here to protect her?

518
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,510
Where did you go?

519
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,240
I couldn't find you.

520
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,500
Although you didn't create a filing

521
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,160
in Shengji,

522
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,060
the doctor in the last hospital

523
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,910
should have told you

524
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,730
from the beginning

525
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,170
how dangerous

526
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,860
rudimentary horn pregnancy is?

527
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,910
Yes.

528
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,120
She's only 24.

529
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,570
It's not like she can't give birth again.

530
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,470
Why

531
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,420
take such a big risk?

532
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,290
I'm sorry.

533
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,790
It's...

534
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,430
We didn't think it through.

535
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,510
Didn't think  it through?

536
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,870
As a husband,

537
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,560
what do you take

538
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,140
your wife's body?

539
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,460
You should cherish

540
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,180
your wife.

541
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,010
I'm sorry.

542
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,020
And I understand

543
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,720
your wife is in a bad mood,

544
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,470
but she can't keep a long face every day.

545
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,770
Her mother-in-law was just beside her.

546
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,120
She's in a bad mood

547
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,120
if she sees the daughter-in-law's bad mood.

548
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,870
The whole family is in a bad mood

549
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,740
and doesn't communicate with the doctor.

550
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,480
Do you think that'll work?

551
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm sorry.

552
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,350
It's all my fault.

553
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,150
If I had gone earlier,

554
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,100
this wouldn't have happened.

555
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,130
Senior,

556
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,240
the consent is not signed yet.

557
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,920
Come with me to the office.

558
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,390
I'm going to tell you

559
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,500
the risks of the surgery.

560
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,010
Her surgery is scheduled the day after tomorrow.

561
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,950
Director Tian will do it for her.

562
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,340
You must come,

563
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,330
because your mother

564
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,460
will give birth in these two days.

565
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm afraid something urgent

566
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,130
happening during the operation.

567
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,010
Your family can't take care of her.

568
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,780
Thank you, doctor. I'll definitely come.

569
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,280
Thank you.

570
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,460
What are you studying?

571
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,510
Director Huang,

572
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,270
what are you going to do

573
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,560
with Meng Shuang's RHP?

574
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,250
Let me test you first.

575
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,000
How much do you know

576
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,110
about the RHP?

577
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
RHP means a rare kind of pregnancy

578
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,060
where the embryos

579
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,490
embedded and developed

580
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,930
in the rudimentary horn.

581
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,140
There's only one in

582
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,940
100,000 possibility.

583
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,690
Who would think Meng Shuang can have one.

584
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,920
I dealt with

585
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,860
a case of RHP before

586
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,290
with Director Zhang.

587
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,540
There are no clear symptoms in the beginning.

588
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,530
If you can't

589
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,720
get a timely and effective treatment

590
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,860
in the early stage,

591
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,890
as the term of pregnancy grows,

592
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,190
it's very likely that

593
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,420
the rudimentary horn breaks.

594
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,300
The pregnant woman may have abdominal hemorrhage,

595
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,910
shock, or even death.

596
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,810
It's like the pregnant house.

597
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,490
is deformed.

598
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,450
The child happens to be in a deformed place.

599
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,960
If the child grows up,

600
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,690
the house will collapse.

601
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,680
But Meng Shuang has made

602
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,970
to such a late term,

603
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,270
which I've never seen before.

604
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,130
Director Huang,

605
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,780
Although Meng Shuang didn't have

606
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,730
her examinations in our hospital,

607
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,300
But she's diagnosed in our hospital.

608
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,860
Should we operate as soon as possible

609
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,380
to prevent haemorrhage?

610
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,420
I've asked Du Di to inform her family

611
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,500
to perform the operation.

612
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,300
Director Huang.

613
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,580
Sit here.

614
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,340
Thank you.

615
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,660
Let me get you through the risks

616
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,330
of the surgery.

617
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,410
Dr. Wu,

618
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,730
It's about the senior patient in Bed 45.

619
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,000
Her body temperature was a little high just now.

620
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,710
Would you take a look?

621
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,400
Bed 45? It's my mom.

622
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,940
Wait.

623
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,500
You, the filial son,

624
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,510
your father is there.

625
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,560
We also sent two doctors.

626
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,560
Your mother will be fine.

627
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,130
Can you figure out

628
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,910
your wife's condition first?

629
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,150
Yes, I'm sorry, Doctor.

630
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,200
I'm a little worried.

631
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,710
I'll sign the consent form first.

632
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,430
Take a look.

633
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,440
If you have any questions,

634
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,000
you can ask me.

635
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,860
No problem.

636
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,620
Have routine urine and blood tests,

637
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,040
and ultrasound, too.

638
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,130
All of them.

639
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,050
Check three indicators of infection,

640
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,990
C reaction protein,

641
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,300
and procalcitonin.

642
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,880
Besides having a fever,

643
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,000
what other symptoms do you have?

644
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,150
No.

645
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,530
Feel it again.

646
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,710
Does it hurt anywhere?

647
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,290
No.

648
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,060
How about this?

649
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,810
Come with me to the examination room.

650
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,010
Please help her get up.

651
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,750
Doctor.

652
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,310
Is there anything wrong with her?

653
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,750
Well...

654
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,470
It's hard to say.

655
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,000
Let's talk after the examination.

656
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,160
Thank you.

657
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,370
Doctor,

658
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,640
Is it because she's anxious

659
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,710
or worried?

660
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,000
They just knew

661
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm going to have an operation.

662
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,290
It's possible.

663
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,190
Your mother-in-law

664
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,780
is under a lot of pressure lately.

665
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,160
But we don't know anything specific

666
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,700
before the result is out.

667
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,390
What?

668
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,580
Sorry, Director Huang.

669
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,960
I wanted to change the habit of biting my nails,

670
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,240
so I applied iodine.

671
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,300
You do have to change it.

672
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,230
You take in so many bacteria.

673
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,960
I don't bite when my hands are dirty.

674
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,980
The ultrasound...

675
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:52,780
Is it alright?

676
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,720
Everything is fine.

677
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,590
Thank you, doctor.

678
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,600
That's good.

679
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,700
There's nothing wrong.

680
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,870
I heard that Bed 45 had a fever.

681
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,890
Did you find out the reason?

682
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,920
No.

683
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,580
The ultrasound is fine.

684
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,850
The test report is fine too.

685
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,100
She has no medical history.

686
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,790
Is it just a common cold?

687
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,880
She is under pressure

688
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,550
a lot lately.

689
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,210
It might affect her mood

690
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,860
and thus her immune system.

691
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,110
She's so old.

692
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,440
What if something happens?

693
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,980
I think we should look into it again.

694
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,970
I shouldn't have snatched it from you that day.

695
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,490
I've been feeling bad

696
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,400
since then.

697
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,590
I think I should give you

698
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,560
the complicated cases

699
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,930
so that you can improve quickly.

700
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,790
That would be a fair competition.

701
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,540
How about we switching the cases?

702
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,590
It's not that I pity you.

703
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,120
I really think

704
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,330
I shouldn't have stolen it from you that day.

705
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,580
I tried to steal it from you too.

706
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,040
You don't have to feel sorry

707
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,640
or pity me.

708
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,140
I won't lose to you.

709
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,230
Slow down.

710
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:34,840
Be careful.

711
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,910
Where's your husband?

712
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,550
He said he would come.

713
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,650
He said he would come.

714
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,330
But where is he now?

715
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,670
I called several times

716
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,330
but he didn't answer.

717
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,530
Why don't I go with you?

718
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,890
Mom has dilated two fingers.

719
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,110
You'd better not go.

720
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,840
Ma Zan said he would come.

721
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,500
You go to the operating room first.

722
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,030
I'll call him.

723
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,440
He's so irresponsible.

724
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,450
She's always like this,

725
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,920
barging around.

726
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,330
You should go.

727
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,540
I'm fine here.

728
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,830
I wonder

729
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,570
where Ma Zan is.

730
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,300
These days, he whether doesn't come

731
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,650
or just stays for a little while.

732
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,890
Meng Shuang

733
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,230
is having such a big operation.

734
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,150
We couldn't even

735
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,180
see his shadows.

736
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,470
I'll beat him to death.

737
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,960
You'd better calm down.

738
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,180
He's going to be a father soon.

739
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,950
Do you think he's still a kid?

740
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,510
He's not here?

741
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,540
Yes.

742
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,590
I'll help you

743
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,350
to persuade him.

744
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,750
No matter how unwilling he is

745
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,810
to have a sibling,

746
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,870
after all,

747
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,780
he's gonna be a big brother.

748
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,880
Right? He shouldn't fixating on that.

749
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,340
No.

750
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,210
My son agrees with our second child.

751
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,010
The moment his father had this idea,

752
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,480
he persuaded us to have the baby every day.

753
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,290
Yes.

754
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,910
Then it must be your daughter-in-law

755
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,840
said something to him.

756
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,420
Look.

757
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,670
Your daughter-in-law

758
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,790
has never smiled

759
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,610
since she came here.

760
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,030
No matter how filial your son is,

761
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,780
he can't beat her continuous fight.

762
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,840
Why don't we give them

763
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,130
our house after their baby is born?

764
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,850
That would make them happy.

765
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,630
What should this baby do

766
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,880
in the future?

767
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,790
Well...

768
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,820
I told you I didn't want to give birth.

769
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,580
You insisted on having a daughter.

770
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,010
Stop crying.

771
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,820
You're going to give birth.

772
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,220
Keep your energy.

773
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,290
All right.

774
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,380
Is my husband not here yet?

775
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,290
Don't worry.

776
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,700
Dr. Du went to look for him.

777
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,690
Let her scold him when she finds him.

778
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,600
Don't cry.

779
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,670
Didn't he say he would come?

780
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm afraid he can't come.

781
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,330
I'm so scared.

782
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,430
He will come.

783
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,430
Don't be sad.

784
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,730
The fetus's head has been exposed.

785
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,440
It's okay.

786
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,790
Though you're old,

787
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,470
you're still in good health.

788
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,840
The cold is under control.

789
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,210
Although the last baby was

790
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,380
a little long from now,

791
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,000
as long as you follow the doctor's instructions,

792
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,540
it'll be fine. Good luck.

793
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,300
Thank you, Director.

794
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,430
Is our son here?

795
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,130
I just called, but he didn't answer.

796
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,190
Did something happen?

797
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,900
You've been like this lately.

798
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,600
Are you regretting it?

799
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,760
It's too late to say anything now.

800
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,710
It's here.

801
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,590
Focus. Harder.

802
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,980
Come on. Come on.

803
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,230
Come on!

804
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,240
Hello, Dr Du, I'm almost there.

805
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,350
Can you hurry up?

806
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,360
Doctor,

807
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,220
if you can

808
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,390
reach my husband,

809
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,640
can you tell him

810
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,720
no matter what,

811
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,660
hold on until he sees the baby.

812
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,700
What does this mean?

813
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,970
I'm really afraid that he can't hold on.

814
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,020
Stay strong. He'll come.

815
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,990
The surgery will start soon.

816
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,740
Where is Du Di?

817
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,160
She's waiting for her family outside.

818
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,280
Her family hasn't arrived yet?

819
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,610
He didn't answer all the calls.

820
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,480
His wife is

821
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,260
about to lose her uterus.

822
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,430
He's so careless.

823
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
Her vitals are stable.

824
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,370
Shall we start at 10:30?

825
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,820
Yes.

826
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,760
Don't we wait for Du Di?

827
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,750
We don't need two assistants.

828
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,970
It's she who begged me to let you come.

829
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,710
Du Di asked you

830
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,720
to let me be your assistant?

831
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,700
Yes, she asked me for a long time.

832
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,620
Nianbai, you'll be the second assistant.

833
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,940
Me? Second assistant?

834
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,020
I can go up again.

835
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,740
OK.

836
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,960
Let's start.

837
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,690
Ma Zan, come with me

838
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,420
Why were you so slow?

839
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,480
You've wasted my time to do the surgery.

840
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,550
Why are your legs weak?

841
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,340
You're not the one who has the surgery. Hurry up.

842
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,540
What's wrong?

843
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,090
Ma Zan!

844
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,410
Emergency! Emergency!

845
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,320
Emergency! Call emergency!

846
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,910
Intubation.

847
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,940
His blood oxygen is bad. Where is his family?

848
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,320
His family is in the operating room.

849
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,370
His wife is going to give birth.

850
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,610
Do you know his medical history?

851
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,310
No.

852
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,450
Ask his family. Hurry.

853
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:53,860
Okay.

854
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,560
It's a boy.

855
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,710
He's quite healthy.

856
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,950
Next it is tough.

857
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,560
Remove the rudimentary horn first.

858
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,090
Director Tian,

859
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,660
Is the fallopian tube

860
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,920
adhered with the uterus?

861
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,410
Someone did her homework.

862
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,790
Fortunately, the invervention department

863
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,500
performed arterial embolism on both sides of uterus,

864
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,580
to avoid major bleeding.

865
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,120
But the separation

866
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,180
is still difficult.

867
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,690
It's best not to hurt the fallopian tube.

868
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,870
I’ll try again.

869
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:26,960
Director Tian.

870
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,550
It’s too hard.

871
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,480
It's too risky

872
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,040
to have a baby like this.

873
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:36,850
She should have operated

874
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
earlier.

875
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,540
Every woman

876
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,670
has their own pain.

877
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,590
Making a judgement

878
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,690
based on medicine

879
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,430
is ideal of course.

880
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,590
But if someone risks their life

881
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,450
to have a baby,

882
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,260
The biggest test

883
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,480
for a doctor is

884
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,940
to make the optimal choice

885
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,180
while accepting their decision.

886
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,380
This is the duty of a doctor.

887
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,850
They're separated.

888
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,910
Luckily,

889
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,270
both the fallopian tube and the ovary are safe.

890
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,580
Director Tian, you’re too fast.

891
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,730
It won’t be too risky

892
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,080
for her to have another baby.

893
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,900
You should also practice hard

894
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,370
to keep more uteri.

895
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,590
Because the uterus

896
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,660
is too important for women.

897
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,970
Why haven't Du Di and her family

898
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,810
here yet?

899
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,440
No, I'm exhausted.

900
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,080
No, no, no. Keep it up.

901
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,210
Otherwise, the baby won't come out.

902
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,290
Come on!

903
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,050
Doctor, I'm exhausted.

904
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,270
Give her some energy.

905
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,870
Uncle.

906
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,820
Is your son sick?

907
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,950
Who?

908
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,410
Your son! He's in the emergency room.

909
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,210
It's very dangerous.

910
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,280
Please tell me his medical history.

911
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,100
Otherwise, it will delay the rescue.

912
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,850
My son is not sick.

913
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,310
Can he spray blood all over his body if he's not sick?

914
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,020
Think about it.

915
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,380
What's wrong with my son?

916
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,820
Du Di, what are you doing?

917
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,750
My son.

918
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,220
I...

919
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,340
Don't move.

920
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,370
Give birth to the baby first.

921
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,570
She has exhaustion and the fetus head has just dropped.

922
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,150
Inform the anesthesiologist to do it here.

923
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:14,980
One, two, three, get ready to leave the bed.

924
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,260
Get out of bed.

925
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,390
Get out of bed.

926
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,650
Auntie, have something to eat.

927
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,310
You can't just replenish with fluids.

928
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,290
Doctor,

929
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,020
It's the seventh day since my son's death.

930
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,650
I can't even wait for him.

931
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,540
His father went back alone.

932
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,500
If he can't see us,

933
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,550
he will be lonely.

934
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,710
But you have

935
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,870
your youngest son.

936
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,410
He hasn't had any breast milk

937
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,390
for seven days.

938
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,360
You need to eat to have milk.

939
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,170
When will my daughter-in-law

940
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,810
come back?

941
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,300
She comes out of ICU today.

942
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,380
Don't get too excited when you see her.

943
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,690
Calm down.

944
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,250
She was bleeding during the surgery.

945
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,640
It was not easy for her to survive.

946
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,300
How can I be excited?

947
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,840
I just want to ask her

948
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,940
what happened to my son.

949
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,710
Okay.

950
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,699
Three, two, one.

951
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,610
From this day,

952
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,750
you can rest in the general ward.

953
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,340
You should be discharged soon.

954
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,900
Aunt, you haven't eaten.

955
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,800
Don't move.

956
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,300
Mom.

957
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,080
Why don't you eat?

958
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,469
How sad will Ma Zan be

959
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,949
to see you like this?

960
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,320
He left without telling me.

961
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,290
Will he feel bad?

962
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:46,940
Mom.

963
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,060
Ma Zan loves you and dad

964
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,510
and loves me.

965
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,010
He found out he had blood cancer long ago.

966
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,440
Blood cancer?

967
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,800
This...

968
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,640
When did this happen?

969
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:08,830
Two years ago.

970
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,760
When he just found out,

971
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,590
he wanted to divorce me.

972
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:15,940
I said no.

973
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,720
You have to give me a child.

974
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,880
At that time, dad wanted to have a second child.

975
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,490
He said

976
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,250
you must give birth to another child.

977
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,590
Otherwise, when he leaves,

978
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,340
his mom would die with him.

979
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,570
He wants his mom to live on.

980
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,460
In the past two years, he had chemotherapy

981
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,710
while taking care of our family.

982
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,880
When our due date was coming,

983
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,760
he suddenly told me

984
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,290
he couldn't hold on.

985
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,560
But he still increased the dosage

986
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,870
and persisted.

987
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,540
He wanted to see the baby born.

988
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,320
Mom.

989
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,840
I didn't tell you this

990
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,280
because I was afraid you couldn't stand it.

991
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,630
I can only hold it in my heart.

992
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,910
I feel so sad.

993
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,100
I'm angry

994
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,680
not because you're having a second child.

995
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,530
It's about Ma Zan's illness.

996
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,710
I could do nothing.

997
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,370
I can't discuss with you.

998
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,710
My child.

999
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,190
Mom.

1000
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,430
Eat well

1001
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,010
and raise our brother-in-law well.

1002
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,770
Ma Zan didn't leave.

1003
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,080
Ma Zan's heart stopped

1004
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,860
at 11:28.

1005
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,580
Brother-in-law was born

1006
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,860
was 11:29.

1007
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,540
Ma Zan came back

1008
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,760
to be your son again.

1009
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,890
Mom.

1010
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,300
Take care of yourself.

1011
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,440
Do you think

1012
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,740
Ma Zan is filial, doing this?

1013
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,630
I don’t know.

1014
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,340
Is it a good thing

1015
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,220
to tell your parents

1016
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,990
or is it

1017
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,730
even worse?

1018
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,220
If only the future

1019
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,320
could be predicted.

1020
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,140
Things are unpredictable.

1021
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,810
You never know

1022
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,400
which one would come first,

1023
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,870
the future or an accident?

1024
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,340
Nianbai.

1025
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,440
What are you thinking?

1026
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,930
I should be an unfilial son,

1027
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,140
compared to Ma Zan,

1028
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,370
Don't think like that.

1029
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,560
Everyone has their own pain.

1030
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,790
Ma Zan does,

1031
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,180
So do we.

1032
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,600
We will try our best

1033
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,370
to save every patient.

1034
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,280
But we can't

1035
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,610
to heal every patient.

1036
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,620
Let's go to the ward.

1037
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,760
Congrui.

1038
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,640
I'm sorry.

1039
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,310
I didn't have the courage

1040
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,680
to apologize to you formally.

1041
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,060
After all,

1042
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,070
I'm a gynecologist.

1043
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,160
I know if it were

1044
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,450
a healthy baby,

1045
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,510
there wouldn't be such an easy miscarriage

1046
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,580
just because you pushed me.

1047
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,400
But now,

1048
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,220
I still can't get over that.

1049
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,520
The story of the mother-in-law and

1050
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,890
the daughter-in-law giving birth at the same time,

1051
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,160
so dramatic.

1052
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,750
Ob-Gyn.

1053
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,020
What a beautiful place.

1054
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,430
As long as the baby is born,

1055
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,660
there's hope.

1056
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,910
Are you really addicted

1057
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,710
in the gynaecology department?

1058
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:20,830
I'm not blaming you.

1059
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,840
Just annoying you dad a bit would be enough.

1060
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,660
How could I annoy him?

1061
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,130
Isn't he nominated as an academician?

1062
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,000
He's very popular.

1063
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,940
But if he passes,

1064
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,300
Director Tian will be more miserable.

1065
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,260
The first application

1066
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,080
may not pass.

1067
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,640
With his ability,

1068
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,540
he's gonna pass sooner or later.

1069
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,050
You

1070
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,860
care about your dad?

1071
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,460
Who cares about him?

1072
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,800
The nomination list has been spread all around the hospital.

1073
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,460
I have to see it.

1074
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,330
Although he

1075
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,400
is recovering well,

1076
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,370
but he's old.

1077
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,370
You should move back

1078
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,080
and live with him.

1079
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,500
You can take care of each other.

1080
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,990
Move back to live with him?

1081
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,060
In a few days,

1082
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,460
Either him or me will die.

1083
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,310
Let's make the world peaceful.

1084
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,340
I noticed that you and Du Di

1085
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,580
get along very well recently.

1086
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,140
I'm a bit surprised.

1087
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,050
It feels like

1088
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,100
Tom and Jerry become good friends.

1089
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,460
You've known her for so long.

1090
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,430
Don't you know

1091
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,860
she's cruel outside and soft-hearted inside?

1092
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:17,810
I know.

1093
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,850
But many people are already scared

1094
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,010
when looking at the outside.

1095
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,980
Who would have the mood

1096
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,750
to see if she's soft-hearted inside?

1097
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,580
You people

1098
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,580
just don't know

1099
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
how to admire independent and strong women.

1100
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,450
If she were in our school,

1101
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,890
she'd have so many suitors.

1102
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,370
What now? Are you interested in her?

1103
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,010
Wei, you are so gossipy.

1104
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,710
What is he doing here?

1105
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,190
Is he still drinking?

1106
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,340
Does that mean

1107
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,510
I gave him a liver for nothing?

1108
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,340
No, I have to get my liver back.

1109
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,350
Sit down.

1110
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,530
There's a private box.

1111
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,750
People in the medical circle

1112
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,600
often organize

1113
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,670
a small-scale gathering.

1114
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,420
Calm down.

1115
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,780
Besides, this kind of gathering

1116
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,710
is very private.

1117
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,580
They won't let you in.

1118
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,560
He's probably just having a party,

1119
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,190
but not drinking. Stay here.

1120
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,820
For my liver,

1121
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,860
I have to see it with my own eyes.

1122
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,050
Stubborn.

1123
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,600
Sorry, sir.

1124
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,530
This place is booked today,

1125
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,390
so you can't go in.

1126
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,480
All of the place?

1127
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,050
No.

1128
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,120
They only booked this one.

1129
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,680
Our hospital wants to hold

1130
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,840
a date party for single people.

1131
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,180
So I'm here to take a look at the place.

1132
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,740
How about this? I'll take you

1133
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,950
to the big room over there?

1134
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,430
Okay.

1135
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,260
This way, please.

1136
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,660
You look good.

1137
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,140
You're recovering well.

1138
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,560
You're drinking again.

1139
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,550
I'll take a picture and see how you explain it.

1140
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:10,610
Sorry, sir.

1141
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,100
Hello, who are you looking for?

1142
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,300
Him.

1143
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,910
Did you see him drinking?

1144
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,370
There's one glass in front of him. He must have drunk it.

1145
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,360
He promised your mom

1146
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,150
he wouldn't drink it.

1147
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,670
How do you know?

1148
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,150
When he was on the leave,

1149
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,940
I accompanied him

1150
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,100
to your mother's grave.

1151
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,380
He told your mother then.

1152
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,350
My mom's death anniversary is coming.

1153
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,450
Go visit her when you're free.

1154
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,480
Okay, I'll be back.

1155
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,620
Why are you spacing out?
