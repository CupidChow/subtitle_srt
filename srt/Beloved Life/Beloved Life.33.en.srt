[Episode 32]

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,240
I'll inform an attending physician

5
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,720
to schedule her for surgery as soon as possible.

6
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,580
We'll also closely monitor

7
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,130
the fetal heart rate.

8
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,990
Thank you.

9
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,130
This is our first baby,

10
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,580
so my wife is very nervous.

11
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Sorry to trouble you.

12
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,729
Are you sure it's your first baby?

13
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,220
Yeah.

14
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,570
Then

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,920
if you think of something

16
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,650
or if you want to talk to me alone,

17
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,190
you may find me

18
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,900
in my office.

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,479
OK.

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,490
I'm really starting to doubt life.

21
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,730
That's obviously

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,910
a scar of lateral episiotomy.

23
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,840
She had a baby before.

24
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,640
How come they both said

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,390
it's their first baby?

26
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,450
Maybe that woman lied to her husband.

27
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,510
She may lie to her husband,

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,550
but she mustn't lie to me.

29
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,980
If I treat her

30
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,680
as a primipara,

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,550
she might have a precipitate labor.

32
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,730
Besides, Dr. Lin

33
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,590
clearly wrote on her medical records

34
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,410
a multipara.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,000
Then how did Dr. Lin

36
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,720
know it?

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,010
Maybe we should give her

38
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,980
a further examination.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,240
Come on!

40
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,790
Don't push them.

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,030
You don't even want to tell

42
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,920
what's going on with your eyes.

43
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,840
Can't you let others

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,670
have some privacy?

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,730
I didn't have plastic surgery.

46
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,250
Then did you have a lift?

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,020
But your skin looks not sagging.

48
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,570
No.

49
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,770
Are you here for Dr. Du?

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,810
Dr. Du,

51
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,710
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,610
I didn't tell you the truth

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,180
in the ward.

54
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,340
This is not

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,150
our first baby.

56
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,450
But…

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,140
You can't be kidding.

58
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,060
This is a hospital.

59
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,980
How can you be inconsistent about

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,990
whether it's your first baby?

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,100
Exactly.

62
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,300
Who just said with certainty

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,030
that it's your first baby?

64
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,810
In front of my wife,

67
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,820
I can't tell you the truth.

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,630
18 years ago,

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,460
she gave birth to a son.

70
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,700
But three years ago

71
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,640
when he was in high school,

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,250
he went outing with his classmates

73
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,050
and got trapped in the mountains by a rainstorm.

74
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,910
Then he had an accident

75
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,230
and died.

76
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,660
It was a terrible blow

77
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,170
to my wife.

78
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,850
She cried all day

79
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,470
and became completely different.

80
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,450
She used to cry and laugh

81
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,460
and loved to dress up.

82
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,180
But she became quiet after that

83
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,250
and sometimes she could just sit still

84
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,800
for all day

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,110
without saying a word.

86
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,300
It wasn't until she got pregnant again

87
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,320
that she suddenly cheered up again.

88
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,690
But I soon noticed

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,560
that she has forgotten

90
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,050
everything about our son.

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,640
Then,

92
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,940
I kept my son's clothes and photos

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,690
out of her sight.

94
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:26,960
But one day,

95
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,490
she found our group photo.

96
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,970
She pointed at

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,930
our son in the photo

98
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,940
and asked who he is.

99
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,620
I was stunned.

100
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,140
But afterwards I thought

101
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,690
this might be a good thing.

102
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,270
Forgetting our son,

103
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,100
she wouldn't feel so much pain.

104
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,950
And she could be happily

105
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,300
waiting for our baby

106
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,310
to be born

107
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,230
as if it's our first baby.

108
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,750
That's the happiest thing for her.

109
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
So would you please,

110
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,450
please

111
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,140
help me keep it from her?

112
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,400
Please don't let her know the truth.

113
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,360
Now the umbilical cord around the neck

114
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,130
has already made her nervous.

115
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
If she remembers

116
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,700
our deceased son,

117
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,300
I'm afraid she can't stand it.

118
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,770
We can do it.

119
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,000
About her conditions,

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,100
I will talk to you privately.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,720
But

122
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,710
you raised your son up to 15.

123
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,780
How could she suddenly forget all about him?

124
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,750
Are you really sure

125
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,650
there's nothing wrong with her health?

126
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,230
I took her to do a checkup.

127
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,490
She is very healthy.

128
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,980
I think

129
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,920
she might be too sad

130
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,500
and has selective amnesia.

131
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,190
I consulted a psychiatrist

132
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,210
and I was told

133
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,730
that this is possible.

134
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,700
Possible?

135
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,510
This judgement is too vague.

136
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,470
My concern is

137
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,220
whether she has

138
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,000
any hidden disease.

139
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,409
She didn't have her physical examination

140
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,200
in Shengji, right?

141
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,360
What about this?

142
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,570
I'll schedule her for another checkup.

143
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,640
Otherwise, I can't rest assured.

144
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,560
OK.

145
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,830
Thank you, Dr. Du.

146
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,820
That's my job.

147
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,410
Everything including BP is fine.

148
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,180
Moreover,

149
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,050
the psychiatric rate scale

150
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,250
shows that

151
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,180
she is completely normal,

152
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,190
even more normal than I am.

153
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,290
It's weird.

154
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,540
Are there people

155
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,560
who really have selective amnesia?

156
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,600
This doesn't conform to medical commonsense.

157
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,950
How could there be no other symptoms

158
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,340
in an amnesia case?

159
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,130
President Liu.

160
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:26,970
President Liu.

161
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,750
Just sit.

162
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,460
Just sit.

163
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,290
Your father is over there.

164
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,780
Don't you go over and say hi?

165
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,270
Now I can tell

166
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,340
that my father is strong.

167
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,520
He hasn't chosen to forget me.

168
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,540
Your eyes' swelling should have gone down.

169
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,670
You can take off your sunglasses.

170
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,030
I think you should find a time

171
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,970
to have a good talk with your father.

172
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,090
No.

173
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,540
Whatever,

174
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,120
it's up to you.

175
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,950
I know how you feel.

176
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,890
But to be honest,

177
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,240
after watching the video last night,

178
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,600
I've realized how much he loves you.

179
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,580
And I can understand

180
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,310
that there're many things

181
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,780
he couldn't control.

182
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,300
He is still good

183
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,980
in health.

184
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,030
Some words are better to be said

185
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,010
before it's too late.

186
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,720
Otherwise,

187
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,430
it would be like my mom and me.

188
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,420
Just have the meal.

189
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,500
It's getting cold.

190
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,090
If it's major depressive disorder (MMD),

191
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,650
there must be some physiological symptoms,

192
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
such as hair loss,

193
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,570
long-term insomnia,

194
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,540
and the feeling of varying degrees of pain.

195
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,730
She has none.

196
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,760
Her hair is thicker than mine.

197
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,570
She sleeps better than I do.

198
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,220
She would tell the doctor if she feels pain.

199
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,000
I chatted with her

200
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,180
about her recent days

201
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,220
and about her dates

202
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,200
with her husband.

203
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,720
She remembers everything.

204
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,760
She has lost

205
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,520
exactly that part of her memory.

206
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,750
What a strong learning atmosphere!

207
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,080
It's good.

208
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,130
You've started organizing a learning session

209
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,860
and invited me.

210
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,750
Director Tian,

211
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,100
about that selective amnesia case,

212
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:04,920
we haven't

213
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,780
found out the cause.

214
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,260
I've read the details

215
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,030
and talked to President Liu on the phone.

216
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,720
Du Di and Nianbai,

217
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,300
you go and see President Liu now.

218
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,950
President Liu?

219
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,870
This is an obstetric and gynecologic case.

220
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,170
It might involve the psychiatric department.

221
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,030
The Neurosurgery Department…

222
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,860
You mean…

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,870
I'm not sure about it now.

224
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,430
President Liu

225
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,750
saw similar cases before.

226
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,190
He asks you to see him

227
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,570
will all relevant materials.

228
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,100
Can you see it?

229
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,720
It's here,

230
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,870
near the memory center.

231
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,610
President Liu,

232
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,890
how did you know it's brain tumor?

233
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,690
Memory is controlled by brain.

234
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,670
Then memory loss

235
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,340
must be related to brain.

236
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,040
In the Neurosurgery Department,

237
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,190
we have many amnesia cases due to
neurological defects

238
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,490
caused by compression from brain tumor.

239
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,580
Director Tian contacted me

240
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,360
in the first place.

241
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,160
I scheduled the patient

242
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,290
for an unenhanced brain CT.

243
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,470
She's pregnant,

244
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
so we didn't do that

245
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,400
in her physical examination.

246
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,030
Generally speaking,

247
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,290
if a patient

248
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,960
never complained of vomiting and headache,

249
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,470
we wouldn't connect it

250
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,140
to brain diseases.

251
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,960
And brain tumor

252
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,390
is a very complicated disease.

253
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,980
A slight difference in size and position

254
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,180
may cause different symptoms.

255
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,740
Her tumor is still small

256
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,540
and has only affected part of her memory.

257
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,700
If it grows bigger,

258
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,000
it would be worse.

259
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,860
I suggest an elective surgery to remove it.

260
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,660
Before or after childbirth?

261
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,790
After she gives birth

262
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,300
and recovers,

263
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,040
it could be done.

264
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,220
OK.

265
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,980
I'll go

266
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,010
talk to the family about this.

267
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,030
Thank you, President Liu.

268
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,900
Go ahead.

269
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,080
You stay.

270
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,280
Why?

271
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Just do what I said.

272
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,350
After coming back,

273
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,710
you haven't been home yet, right?

274
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:23,650
No.

275
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,330
Then come back

276
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,770
when you have time.

277
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,220
What else do you want to ask me?

278
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,250
No.

279
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,060
Then

280
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,000
go with your girlfriend.

281
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,490
I heard that you just had a cold.

282
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,530
You had a liver transplant

283
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,530
and your immunity is not as good as before.

284
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,460
Don't work so hard.

285
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,340
You're back.

286
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,460
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

287
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,350
You must haven't had dinner yet.

288
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,340
I'll do some grocery shopping.

289
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,620
Don't bother. I had it.

290
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,100
Do you just eat this?

291
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,300
I'm used to

292
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,740
the packed meal from the hospital.

293
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,230
Why don't you hire someone

294
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,850
to cook for you?

295
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,690
It's inconvenient

296
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,750
to have someone unfamiliar at home.

297
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,610
I'll have this myself then.

298
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,340
Why isn't there any water?

299
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,130
How have you

300
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,390
lived such a life?

301
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,340
No wonder you had a poor liver.

302
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,670
Come on, don't eat this.

303
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,900
It's cold.

304
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
It's okay.

305
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,420
-Let me warm it up for you.
-I'm used to this.

306
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,630
I thought you're living

307
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,900
a happy and free life alone.

308
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,420
It seems that you're abusing yourself.

309
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,300
You rarely come back.

310
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,300
Don't be angry.

311
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,300
I watched the video.

312
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,500
Why didn't you show it to me earlier?

313
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,040
About what your mother said

314
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,210
before she died,

315
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,650
I watched it many times.

316
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,880
But I didn't know

317
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,660
how to interpret it.

318
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,010
I couldn't even interpret it,

319
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,010
how could I

320
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,340
let an immature child

321
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,000
watch it?

322
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,780
Whose fault was that,

323
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,760
your mother's or mine?

324
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,110
I thought about it for many years.

325
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,140
I finally figured it out.

326
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,260
It was my fault

327
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,210
in the final analysis.

328
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,150
As her mate in life,

329
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,830
I failed to help her

330
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,850
restore her confidence in work.

331
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,920
As her husband,

332
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,390
I made her feel like

333
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,010
she was an accessory.

334
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,620
Your mother

335
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,900
was such an excellent woman

336
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,870
and such a strong woman.

337
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,030
But I couldn't understand her.

338
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,630
Therefore,

339
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,550
I rather want you to hate me

340
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,140
than hating

341
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,210
your mother.

342
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,540
At least

343
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,240
for the two of us,

344
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,380
there's someone we both love.

345
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,120
But

346
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,380
that's unfair to me.

347
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,500
Yes.

348
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,500
But I didn't know what to do.

349
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,420
With that kind of pain,

350
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,370
I couldn't raise you up well.

351
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,330
I know

352
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,180
it's hard to grow up abroad alone.

353
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,630
I feel really sorry for that.

354
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,340
However,

355
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,700
you would feel free

356
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,030
while staying abroad.

357
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,800
It's better than watching me

358
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,329
wearing a sad look every day.

359
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,859
You should have told me these earlier.

360
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,819
I don't know if it's too late

361
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,819
to tell you these now.

362
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,060
I'll hire a housemaid for you tomorrow.

363
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,860
You're too old

364
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,130
to take care of yourself.

365
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,540
If something happens to you,

366
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,630
it will be me to take care of you.

367
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:58,940
You…

368
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,770
Are you planning to move back?

369
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,500
I'll see.

370
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,620
Baby.

371
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,550
He's opened his eyes.

372
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,280
Baby.

373
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,560
Look at Mommy.

374
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,810
-Honey.
-Look at Mommy.

375
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,380
Honey.

376
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,540
He looks exactly like Xiaole.

377
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,690
Are you so happy that you've become silly?

378
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,270
This is Xiaole.

379
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,590
Right? You're Xiaole.

380
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:36,680
Yeah.

381
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,830
Xiaole.

382
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,500
Lin Xiaole.

383
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,250
Smile at Mommy.

384
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,700
Xiao…

385
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,190
When did you

386
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,070
give him the name?

387
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,910
Have you forgotten?

388
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,460
When we were dating,

389
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,070
you said that

390
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,000
I was happy all the time.

391
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,820
Then you gave me the nickname,

392
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,180
Xiaole.

393
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,330
I thought this is a good name

394
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,940
and decided to call our first baby

395
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,300
Xiaole.

396
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,770
You're called Xiaole.

397
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:02,540
Yeah.

398
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,800
I've forgotten that.

399
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,820
Xiaole.

400
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,900
I'm your daddy.

401
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,070
This is your mommy.

402
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,690
-Dr. Du.
-Congratulations.

403
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,560
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

404
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,260
Mr. Lin, may I have a talk with you?

405
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,730
Dr. Du,

406
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,100
what's the matter?

407
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,760
Have you made up your mind?

408
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,300
Is this tumor

409
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,700
benign or malignant?

410
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,390
According to President Liu's judgement,

411
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
it's a benign tumor.

412
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,800
Then

413
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,330
until when we can wait?

414
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,930
Until when?

415
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,680
You can't think that way.

416
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,590
If the tumor grows bigger,

417
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,060
it wouldn't be just a matter of compression.

418
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,300
It may affect

419
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,240
other brain tissues

420
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
and cause a brain damage.

421
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,340
You can't wait any longer.

422
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,620
It's okay.

423
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,320
The tumor is now not life-threatening.

424
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,280
She named our son

425
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,640
Lin Xiaole.

426
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,340
It's also

427
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,090
the name of our first son.

428
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,550
Watching her holding the baby

429
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,300
so happily,

430
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,830
I really hope

431
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,940
that our lives could go on like this.

432
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,130
If she undergoes a surgery

433
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,580
and has the tumor removed,

434
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,330
I'm worried that

435
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
she would remember our first son

436
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,870
and forget the second.

437
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,180
Is that possible?

438
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,450
I'm not sure about it.

439
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,210
But after the tumor is removed,

440
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,660
it's possible to remember the past.

441
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,270
You don't know

442
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,530
how she lived her life before.

443
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,810
She was just like a walking dead.

444
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,770
She is finally alive.

445
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,670
I really…

446
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,350
I really dare not

447
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,460
go back to the life we lived before.

448
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,140
Yes.

449
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,280
But do you want her to be happy but sick,

450
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,620
or depressive but healthy?

451
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,300
If I were you,

452
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,900
it would also be a hard choice for me.

453
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,300
Congrui, you're still here.

454
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,400
Director Huang.

455
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,940
I've searched for some data

456
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,180
about ovarian cancer.

457
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,220
Why?

458
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Are you interested in

459
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,510
studying gynecological tumors?

460
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,360
No.

461
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,330
I still like what I'm doing.

462
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,270
Seeing new babies come to the world every day

463
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,860
is the happiest thing about being a doctor.

464
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,810
I did that for Junxiao's sister.

465
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,390
Yeah?

466
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,430
No wonder

467
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,630
he's been restless lately.

468
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,420
Among gynecological tumors,

469
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,000
ovarian cancer is not the most common,

470
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,090
ranking the third.

471
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,620
But the mortality rate is the highest.

472
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,190
Therefore, it's known as

473
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,460
the most ferocious killer

474
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,280
for women.

475
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,440
I'm really worried about her.

476
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,290
Fortunately, it's still at the early stage.

477
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,740
I tried to get her hospitalized

478
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,720
for timely treatment,

479
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,940
but she doesn't agree.

480
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,240
Then you'd better talk her through.

481
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,700
Early detection,

482
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,650
diagnosis and treatment

483
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,260
are very important.

484
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,740
Among patients with early-stage ovarian cancer.

485
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,470
the five-year survival rate

486
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,700
is as high as 90%.

487
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,030
Even if it recurs within two years after surgery,

488
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,870
the treatment result

489
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,790
is really good.

490
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,570
If it's the advanced stage,

491
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,920
the result would be different.

492
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,790
Among cases with advanced ovarian cancer,

493
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,030
the five-year survival rate

494
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,050
is only between 30% and 40%

495
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,390
Her sister is actually

496
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,180
worried about money.

497
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,210
I'll try to talk her through later.

498
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,140
Yes.

499
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,670
She must not miss

500
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,940
the best time for treatment.

501
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,940
Where is Junxiao?

502
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,350
Director Tian just called him.

503
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,240
I don't know what's going on.

504
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,020
Give me back my grandson.

505
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,830
I want my grandson.

506
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,060
-That's right.
-Give him back to me.

507
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,190
You have to

508
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,500
compensate us today.

509
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,180
Otherwise we won't leave.

510
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,630
Right.

511
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,680
It's a doctor

512
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,900
from Shengji Hospital

513
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,220
who killed my son.

514
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,700
You have to fire him.

515
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,340
We are going to sue him in court.

516
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,270
I want my grandson.

517
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,270
I want my grandson.

518
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,840
Why is my life so miserable?

519
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,100
Ma'am.

520
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,350
Calm down.

521
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,150
Let's talk about it.

522
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,680
You said

523
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,110
Li Junxiao aborted your grandson.

524
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,500
I have a question.

525
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,540
At which hospital did he do it?

526
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,860
Was it here at Shengji?

527
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,230
Don't…

528
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,270
Don't change the subject.

529
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,970
Even if

530
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,990
he didn't do it

531
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,820
at Shengji Hospital,

532
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,130
but still,

533
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,020
he's one of your doctors here,

534
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,860
right?

535
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,780
You are his superior.

536
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,770
Shouldn't you take responsibility?

537
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,380
That's right.

538
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,520
I'll take responsibility.

539
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,030
It's all on me.

540
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,740
You can just talk to me.

541
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,950
Don't make a scene in the hospital.

542
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,280
You bastard.

543
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,090
What are you doing?

544
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
It's him.

545
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,460
Stop it.

546
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,220
It's this quack.

547
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,140
Give me back my grandson.

548
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,620
Stop it.

549
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,210
Calm down.

550
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,260
You can file a complaint all you want.

551
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,190
But don't even think

552
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,290
that you can hit people here.

553
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:35,820
Guards.

554
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,700
Throw them out.

555
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:37,890
Come back after you calm down.

556
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,580
What are you doing?

557
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,300
Move.

558
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,040
Give me back my grandson.

559
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,950
Listen, Li Junxiao.

560
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,460
I'll file a complaint.

561
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,010
You'll get fired!

562
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,620
Explain.

563
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,780
I was working

564
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,950
at Ye Ying's hospital.

565
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:57,870
That guy

566
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,780
is Ye Ying's friend.

567
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,610
His wife was seven-month pregnant

568
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,050
They already have two daughters

569
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,070
and wanted a boy this time.

570
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,870
But turned out it was a girl again.

571
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,400
So they wanted to abort it.

572
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,620
And you helped them?

573
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,790
Ye Ying promised me

574
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,890
that there wouldn't be any problems.

575
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,220
And it was their wish

576
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,250
to abort the child.

577
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,120
They signed the agreement.

578
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,600
Junxiao.

579
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,140
My years of support has been in vain.

580
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,500
The chairman of the student union.

581
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,750
The doctor of a Grade A Class 3 hospital.

582
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,750
How can you be so blind

583
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,150
at a critical time?

584
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,980
You work a part-time job.

585
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,580
I'm not against it.

586
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,070
But the least you can do

587
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,150
is to work in a decent hospital.

588
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,350
You know the notorious history

589
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,380
of Ye Ying's hospital.

590
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,820
How could you go there?

591
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,870
I'm sorry. Director Tian.

592
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,590
I'll have to fire you.

593
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,630
Director Tian.

594
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,390
It's the only way to protect you.

595
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:47,950
Do you understand?

596
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,520
It's not going to do you any good

597
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,360
with the patient's families

598
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,990
coming all the time to make a scene.

599
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,060
Thank you.

600
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,530
Junxiao.

601
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,030
I have to warn you.

602
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,880
Ye Ying told them

603
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,630
where you work,

604
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,650
and led them to me

605
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,620
to file a complaint.

606
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,030
She's trying

607
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,740
to let you

608
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,780
take all the blame.

609
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,140
You have to be careful.

610
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,540
Don't turn it into big trouble.

611
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,080
So we did the health check.

612
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,410
It's good for our health.

613
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,080
-Ruirui is back.
-You are back.

614
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,170
Why are you here?

615
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,520
Feng is here

616
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,870
to bring us the fruits.

617
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
The cantaloupe

618
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
is so fresh.

619
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,980
Why do you look so pale?

620
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,820
I'm fine. Just a little tired.

621
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,220
Maybe you should go rest in your room.

622
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,710
Isn't it time for you to go home?

623
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,010
You have operations tomorrow.

624
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,860
You…

625
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,030
Don't say that.

626
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,220
He just got here.

627
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,720
I do have operations tomorrow.

628
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,710
I guess I'll leave now

629
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,490
and visit Dad and Mom next time.

630
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,850
Your dad and mom.

631
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,900
Goodbye, Dad.

632
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,940
Be safe.

633
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420
I'm so sorry.

634
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,110
Be safe.

635
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,430
What was that about?

636
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,220
I want to ask you that.

637
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,940
You drove him away

638
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,800
without even offering dinner.

639
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,560
It's already over for us.

640
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,440
Why would you give him hope?

641
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,200
Ruirui.

642
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,840
Don't be so stubborn.

643
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,750
When Feng had

644
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,070
the vasectomy,

645
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,910
we were so mad at him.

646
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,820
We thought

647
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,130
he was being wayward

648
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,280
for having the operation

649
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,540
without telling us.

650
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,590
We only know it now

651
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
that he did it to protect you.

652
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,100
So you found out.

653
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:38,940
Ruirui.

654
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,570
Don't put so much pressure

655
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,880
on yourself.

656
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,530
If it's too risky to have children,

657
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,100
you don't have to do it.

658
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,860
Feng Yuanhang told us

659
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,930
just now

660
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,610
that if you will get back to him,

661
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,950
he's fine being childless

662
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,530
for all his life.

663
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,460
But I'm in a relationship

664
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,700
with Li Junxiao now.

665
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,460
Li Junxiao.

666
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,690
Where is he?

667
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,330
You were talking about getting married.

668
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,630
Your mom and I

669
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,570
had even got the invitations ready.

670
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,670
But now we don't even hear

671
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,200
a word from him.

672
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,290
If we knew that he's so unreliable,

673
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,420
we wouldn't have agreed on this relationship.

674
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,630
Ruirui.

675
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,810
Feng did hurt you before.

676
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,330
But now you understand

677
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,530
that his intentions

678
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,190
were good.

679
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,830
Hear me out.

680
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,420
Why don't you give him another chance?

681
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,210
What do you think?

682
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,780
It's true that

683
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,300
I'm grateful to him.

684
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,830
But the love is dead.

685
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,700
It can't come back to life.

686
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,000
We can't return to the past.

687
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,740
Ruirui.

688
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,700
Since you are so determined,

689
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,660
we won't push you to do anything.

690
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,120
But you have to think twice

691
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,470
about marrying Li Junxiao.

692
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,120
Don't get married just to be married.

693
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,310
If he's unreliable,

694
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,130
you can stay single all your life

695
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,160
and live at home.

696
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,100
We can afford to feed you.

697
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,230
I'm so lucky to have you.

698
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,040
We're lucky to have you, too.

699
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,180
Do it.

700
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,220
Don't do it.

701
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,580
Do it.

702
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,040
Don't do it.

703
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,210
Do it.

704
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:12,850
Don't do it.

705
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,010
Do it.

706
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,630
Don't do it.

707
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,170
Do it.

708
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,820
Don't do it.

709
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,320
Do it.

710
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,860
Don't do it.

711
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,540
What is it?

712
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,080
What's the solution?

713
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,240
You'll do it or not?

714
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,400
This flower isn't good.

715
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,220
I'll find another one.

716
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,380
We both know that we should do it.

717
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,630
But the question is,

718
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,770
how do we persuade them to do it?

719
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,340
There is a saying

720
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,270
that you can do anything

721
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,030
with time and patience.

722
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,740
I'll persuade them

723
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,390
with time and patience.

724
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,380
Don't bother.

725
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:55,820
I'd say

726
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,120
when the tumor grows too big,

727
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,230
they'll have to come.

728
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,010
If we remove it earlier,

729
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,090
there will be more memory

730
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,120
for her.

731
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,690
Every mother

732
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,840
wants to remember her child.

733
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,580
No matter how sad they are,

734
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,980
the most beautiful memory is always

735
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,980
when they have the child.

736
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,420
I have to try.

737
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,650
The volume is good.

738
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,020
The urine…

739
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,410
The excrement is normal too.

740
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,140
Here.

741
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,380
Dr. Liu.

742
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,060
Everything's fine.

743
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,750
This is scar-reducing cream.

744
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,580
It works well with stretch marks.

745
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,090
After she wakes up, give it to her.

746
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,270
Thank you.

747
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,170
Dr. Liu.

748
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,180
You really don't have to come all the time.

749
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,310
You take such good care

750
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,120
of Ma Ru.

751
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,370
The other patients even thought

752
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,900
that you were her family.

753
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,620
Families and doctors

754
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,510
are basically the same.

755
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,690
We all want the best for the patient.

756
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,880
And,

757
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,990
I can only be happy

758
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,940
when they take me for her family.

759
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,310
I know

760
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,380
why you are doing all this.

761
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,060
You want to persuade me

762
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,020
to let her have the operation, right?

763
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,550
I didn't make it

764
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,580
that obvious…

765
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,300
If this happens to another family,

766
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,020
they can discuss it.

767
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,060
But I can't discuss it with her.

768
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,910
Please forgive me.

769
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,410
I don't want her to have the operation.

770
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,320
If we do it,

771
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,000
it might affect

772
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,620
her memories a little bit.

773
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,460
But it's certainly better

774
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,110
for her brain.

775
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,220
I have decided.

776
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,090
We won't do it.

777
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,860
We're going home tomorrow.

778
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,570
Please think twice.

779
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,220
There's no need.

780
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,000
Just go.

781
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,110
No, listen to me.

782
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,580
I'm doing this for her sake.

783
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,520
We can't let the tumor

784
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,220
get worse.

785
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,940
Say no more.

786
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:06,890
We won't do it.

787
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,820
What are you talking about?

788
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,830
Do what?

789
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,870
That's about it.

790
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,160
You mean I have a brain tumor.

791
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,320
And you won't

792
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,650
let me

793
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,610
have the operation?

794
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:29,510
Yes.

795
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,300
If it's just a brain tumor,

796
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,080
it can't be such a difficult decision.

797
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
Is there anything else

798
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,770
you are not telling me?

799
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,020
Anyway,

800
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,330
it's okay

801
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,980
if you don't do it now.

802
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:49,590
I'll do it.

803
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,180
Why?

804
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,440
No reason.

805
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,430
I'm willing to trust

806
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,620
Dr. Liu.

807
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,780
Dayou.

808
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,200
This is not our first time

809
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,020
going to a doctor.

810
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,150
But,

811
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,390
we've never met a doctor

812
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,380
who's as conscientious as

813
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,660
Dr. Liu.

814
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,350
Right?

815
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,060
On the one hand,

816
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,860
he can't force you.

817
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,340
On the other hand,

818
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,370
if he's too pushy,

819
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,000
he won't get off the hook

820
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,930
once anything goes wrong.

821
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Dr. Liu

822
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,560
is trying so hard

823
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,590
to persuade you

824
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,970
to do this.

825
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,760
It proves that this thing

826
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,140
is absolutely necessary.

827
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,780
And,

828
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,220
he's prepared

829
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,270
to take responsibility.

830
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,140
Right?

831
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,420
So I'm willing to trust him.

832
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,300
Thank you.

833
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,100
Thank you for your trust.

834
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,650
But,

835
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,740
if you do it...

836
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,380
If I do it,

837
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,870
there might be a bad consequence,

838
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,500
right?

839
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,580
And there are so many things

840
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,850
you can't tell me now, right?

841
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,500
It's okay.

842
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,510
Actually,

843
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,960
I've been very happy lately.

844
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,400
But,

845
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,430
I still feel like

846
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,890
it's foggy in my brain.

847
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,330
Like it's not clear

848
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,480
and something's not there.

849
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:26,980
So,

850
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,940
I want to have the operation.

851
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,240
After the operation, if…

852
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,480
If something bad happens,

853
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,530
I won't be afraid.

854
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,480
Because I have you

855
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,500
and Xiaole.

856
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,550
We will make it through.

857
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,740
We definitely will.

858
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,180
Right?

859
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,290
Right.

860
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,120
Cheer up, silly.

861
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:57,770
Geez.

862
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,660
Right?

863
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,880
Why are you sweating so much?

864
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,060
You are not doing the operation.

865
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,300
It's been four hours.

866
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,440
I'm so nervous.

867
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,070
It's not a big tumor.

868
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,219
But it's located poorly.

869
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,650
One little shift of the scalpel,

870
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,460
the brain gets damaged.

871
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,030
It's only natural that the operation takes a long time.

872
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,780
I know.

873
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:30,730
But…

874
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,540
You fear that President Liu will be liable for it?

875
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,370
You have to believe in your dad.

876
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,000
No matter how your relationship is,

877
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,320
he's still

878
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,630
the best neurosurgical expert

879
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,420
in our hospital.

880
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,040
He's not young anymore.

881
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,820
I don't know if he'll be fine

882
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,840
sitting there for so long.

883
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,460
How long has it been?

884
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,120
Eight hours.

885
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,630
No wonder my back hurts.

886
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,800
His legs must have gone numb

887
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,760
from sitting for so long.

888
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,650
It's over.

889
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,760
Close it.

890
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,520
President.

891
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,830
Let's go that way.

892
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,230
What?

893
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,860
What will he do?

894
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,950
You two go back first.

895
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,180
Go.

896
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,980
We need people in the wards.

897
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,480
Just go.

898
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,300
What?

899
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,500
Is there anything

900
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,570
you're not satisfied with?

901
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,590
Thank you.

902
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,450
Dad.

903
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,900
Why?

904
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,530
It's a doctor's duty.

905
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,420
Dad.

906
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,670
I'll walk you back to your office.

907
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,480
No need.

908
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,900
I can take it.

909
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,340
Dad.

910
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,270
Dad is your umbrella.

911
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,410
It's so good to have it.

912
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,740
[Dad]

913
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,540
Hello.

914
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,140
Du Di.

915
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,220
You have to save your mother

916
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,740
and your brother.

917
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,440
I know.

918
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,840
Du Di.

919
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,180
I beg you.

920
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,290
Please.

921
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,140
Save your mom.

922
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,800
You are here.

923
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,860
Director Huang.

924
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,030
How is my mom?

925
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,660
She has infections

926
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,660
in the windpipe and alimentary tract

927
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,650
because of long-term intubation.

928
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,620
Hydrops in both kidneys.

929
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,680
And also infections

930
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,590
in her blood and lungs.

931
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,470
We have to do

932
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,330
the cesarean section now.

933
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,050
Otherwise the fetus

934
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,900
might get infections too.

935
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,270
I'll be the first assistant.

936
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,100
No, Du Di.

937
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,480
You are her family.

938
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,470
And you're always emotional

939
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,320
whenever

940
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,520
it comes to your mother.

941
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,300
I'm sorry, Du Di.

942
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,730
I have to be responsible for her.

943
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,600
Congrui will be the first assistant.

944
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,150
Du Di.

945
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,280
It's going to be okay.

946
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,430
Seven points in the first minute.

947
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,860
Mild asphyxia.

948
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,970
But the baby

949
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,830
is strong.

950
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,020
We're prepared

951
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,620
for many possible situations.

952
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,620
But none of them happened.

953
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,030
I'll send the baby to the ICU.

954
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,340
Du Di.

955
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,090
If your mom knew

956
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,090
about this,

957
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,860
she'd be proud.

958
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,750
Mom, did you hear?

959
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,250
Prepare to sew her up.

960
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,180
Director Huang.

961
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,760
Can I do it?

962
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,420
As her daughter,

963
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,070
I've never done much

964
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,020
for her.

965
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,130
I'm not a good daughter.

966
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,070
This is probably

967
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,500
the only thing I can do for her

968
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,610
for now.

969
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,470
Director Huang.

970
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,980
Let her do it.

971
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,270
Okay.

972
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,530
Thank you, Director Huang.

973
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,370
I'll be your assistant.

974
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,030
You did well.

975
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,080
You can send her to the ICU.

976
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,490
Your mom

977
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,930
is practically stable now.

978
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,970
But the post-birth treatment

979
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,900
will be tricky.

980
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,150
Be prepared for the worst.

981
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,900
Don't leave.

982
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,900
There must be a mistake.

983
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,670
Wait till I get it straight.

984
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,260
Did you send the wrong baby?

985
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,640
They said it's a boy.

986
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,020
Why is it a girl now?

987
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,290
Can you at least ask about

988
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,990
my mom first?

989
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,590
Okay.

990
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,460
I'll ask.

991
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,460
How is your mom?

992
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,490
The operation is successful.

993
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,620
But she still has infections.

994
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,720
Then treat her.

995
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,380
Now. Tell me.

996
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,220
Where is my son?

997
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,780
That one

998
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,540
is not my child.

999
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:19,990
Right?

1000
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,040
Was there another woman delivering

1001
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,780
in the operation room?

1002
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,330
Go.

1003
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,020
Tell me.

1004
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,530
That one they brought out

1005
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,210
is your daughter.

1006
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,900
No way.

1007
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,350
How is that possible?

1008
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,220
When you do the sex diagnosis

1009
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,150
last time,

1010
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,290
you said it's a boy.

1011
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,300
Uncle.

1012
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,260
We can talk about it

1013
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,200
after we send Aunt

1014
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,540
to the ICU, okay?

1015
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,140
No.

1016
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,080
Get this straight here and now,

1017
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,400
or no one can leave.

1018
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,000
Leave him. Let's go.

1019
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:42,680
You want to go?

1020
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,180
Give me back my son!

1021
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,500
I lied to you.

1022
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,770
I wanted you

1023
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,690
to treat my mom better.

1024
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,430
Then I wanted

1025
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,260
to save the baby.

1026
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,180
So I lied to you.

1027
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,130
Are you satisfied now?

1028
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,570
How can you?

1029
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,150
How can you make your mom

1030
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:08,890
suffer like this?

1031
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,040
Calm down, Uncle.

1032
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,410
I'll beat you to death!

1033
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,620
What's going on?

1034
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,020
Mister.

1035
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,380
Mister.

1036
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,050
Mister.

1037
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,280
You have to help me.

1038
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,710
Du Di did a sex diagnosis

1039
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,900
for us.

1040
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,260
And she said

1041
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,270
that my wife had a son.

1042
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,270
That's why we kept the baby.

1043
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,330
My wife is vegetative now.

1044
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,740
She suffered for so long

1045
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,400
just for this baby.

1046
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,900
But turned out

1047
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,450
it's a girl.

1048
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:44,860
Tian Yunshan.

1049
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,050
The hospital has always strongly

1050
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,410
prohibited fetal sex diagnosis

1051
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,270
without medical needs.

1052
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,240
What is this about?

1053
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,460
This…

1054
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:52,860
There might be a misunderstanding.

1055
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,520
Please give me some time

1056
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,410
to find out what happened.

1057
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:55,810
President.

1058
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,880
Get up first.

1059
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,090
Calm down.

1060
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,980
We can talk about it, whatever it is.

1061
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,720
Don't get worked up.

1062
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,280
You have to grant me justice.

1063
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:01,940
Okay, okay.

1064
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,850
Give me back my son.
