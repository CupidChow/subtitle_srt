that the signs of real labor

are regular uterine contractions,

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,770
The labor can be slow.

175
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,300
Some take 2 or 3 days.

176
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,290
Can you just be nice to us?

177
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,090
We have come

178
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,760
here so many times,

179
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,530
but you always send us back.

180
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,260
Too much trouble, don't you think?

181
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,250
It's the hospital's rule

182
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,700
that an expectant woman in false labor cannot be hospitalized.

183
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,570
Also,

184
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,110
we're at full capacity now.

185
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,700
When you're in real labor,

186
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,670
I'll receive you

187
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,890
even if I have to add an extra bed in the hallway.

188
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,470
But it's unnecessary at the moment.

189
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,720
Please go home.

190
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,140
Fine. We'll go home.

191
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,020
Here, get the bags.

192
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,870
Easy.

193
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:07,940
Come on.

194
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,740
I need to pee.

195
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,610
Zhenzhen, can you hold that?

196
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,510
I can't.

197
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,200
I feel terrible.

198
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,140
I'm feeling constant pains.

199
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,020
Gao Jian, can you stop the car?

200
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,260
Mom, we're on the overpass.

201
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,330
I can't stop the car.

202
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,660
And look at the safety barrier.

203
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,630
She couldn't climb across the barrier

204
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,500
even if I stopped the car, could she?

205
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,790
Honey, I feel terrible.

206
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,130
Hang in there.

207
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,020
I'll drive faster.

208
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
We'll soon be home, babe.

209
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,140
Just hang in there.

210
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,880
We'll be home in five minutes.

211
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,210
Hang in there.

212
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,930
Zhenzhen.

213
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,460
What is the matter with you?!

214
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,330
Turn the light on before changing the lane, will you?

215
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,240
An expectant mother in the car!

216
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:56,990
You know?

217
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,750
All right, keep driving.

218
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,370
You should have

219
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,980
kept a distance.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,060
Hey, dad, he didn't turn on the light.

221
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,760
You saw that, didn't you?

222
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,350
That was a sudden brake.

223
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,340
You scared Zhenzhen.

224
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,570
What's wrong?

225
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,520
I think I peed my pants.

226
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,400
What's the matter, Zhenzhen?

227
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,180
No, this isn't urine.

228
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,880
It smells like amniotic fluid.

229
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,690
Her water breaks.

230
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,130
Mom!

231
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,780
Turn around.

232
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,590
Turn around. Back to the hospital.

233
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,610
To the hospital now.

234
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,100
I can't believe this traffic jam.

235
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,510
What do we do now?

236
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,540
If her water

237
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,630
runs out,

238
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,100
there's a risk of anoxia for the baby.

239
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,020
You should've listened to me.

240
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,710
We should've stayed in the hotel.

241
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,720
It's your fault!

242
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,240
You said it was dirty in the hotel.

243
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,790
We have so many

244
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,570
disinfecting wipes.

245
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,130
We could just disinfect the entire room.

246
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,100
I didn't see

247
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,590
her water breaking coming, did I?

248
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,780
Plus, the doctor said

249
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,620
the labor would take 2 or 3 days.

250
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,480
She didn't mention

251
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,590
any unexpected water breaking.

252
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
If you ask me,

253
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,710
it's that doctor's fault.

254
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,060
She's indifferent to the patients.

255
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,070
If anything happens to Zhenzhen

256
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,060
and the baby,

257
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,170
I'll make her pay.

258
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,470
Mom, please stop.

259
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,390
Yeah.

260
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,510
Complaints are useless

261
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,820
at this point.

262
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,350
More water keeps coming out.

263
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,020
What do I do, mom?

264
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,480
It'll be fine.

265
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,120
Hurry up.

266
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,710
What now?

267
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,530
We have no choices

268
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,110
but to drive on the bicycle lane.

269
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,820
You're breaking traffic regulations.

270
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,630
Let the police write me tickets.

271
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,630
I don't care.

272
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,410
Go, go, go.

273
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,030
Hurry.

274
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,540
We need to save the baby.

275
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,280
Over here.

276
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,450
What took you so long?

277
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,990
I have finished my lunch already.

278
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,190
Several babies in the morning.

279
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,150
I'm starving.

280
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,590
The food is cold.

281
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,410
We eat cold food every day,

282
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,880
don't we?

283
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,060
Hello.

284
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
Yang Zhenzhen is back.

285
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,460
That's false labor. What's she doing back here?

286
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,480
Her water broke?

287
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm coming.

288
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,790
Why does her water break so soon?

289
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,060
I'm coming, too.

290
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,490
It's been hours.

291
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,490
Hey, stop there.

292
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,730
I told you

293
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,600
it was real labor.

294
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,410
You didn't believe me.

295
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,190
You sent us back,

296
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,620
and her water broke on the way.

297
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,840
You must apologize to me.

298
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,390
Please, Zhenzhen's mother.

299
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,620
Calm down, let's be reasonable.

300
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,690
Jian's dad,

301
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,200
there's no point in arguing with her.

302
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,650
Please be calm.

303
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,480
Can you let me go in there

304
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,170
and check her up?

305
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,840
No.

306
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,990
You can't even tell

307
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,900
real labor from false labor.

308
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,870
You have done terrible harm

309
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,660
to my daughter.

310
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,540
Listen.

311
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,120
I'm an obstetrician gynecologist, too.

312
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,250
I'll deliver the baby, okay?

313
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,140
As long as it's not her.

314
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,830
You will stay here.

315
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,450
We're at a hospital.

316
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,900
If you have a problem,

317
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,860
you can file a complaint to the administration.

318
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,710
Get your hands off me.

319
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,700
I don't have a problem.

320
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,740
I'm telling you,

321
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,710
you will be staying here.

322
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,450
Before my daughter

323
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,270
gives birth to her child,

324
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,180
you can't go anywhere.

325
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,980
Also,

326
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,740
if anything happens to my daughter,

327
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,580
I'll file a complaint against you to your supervisor.

328
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,620
I have other work to do.

329
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,550
Stop this nonsense.

330
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,970
I'll be in the in-patient department.

331
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,650
I'm not going anywhere.

332
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,400
I don't believe you.

333
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,970
You must wait right here.

334
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
Let go. Come on.

335
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,100
Quiet, quiet.

336
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,370
You need to relax.

337
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,290
I can't take this anymore.

338
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
I need to excrete.

339
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,140
I'm in so much pain.

340
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,420
Dr. Wu, it's an emergency labor.

341
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,090
She can't exert herself.

342
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:25,940
The contractions are too strong.

343
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,180
The fetus's head hit the pelvic floor very fast

344
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,890
and caused reflections,

345
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,230
so she can't control herself.

346
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,440
The drop was too fast,

347
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,610
her perineum isn't fully expanded.

348
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,540
It'll cause a laceration.

349
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,810
The fetus is too big. The force of labor is too strong.

350
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,310
You must control your strength.

351
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,830
I can't…

352
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,090
I can't…

353
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,830
My arms are sore.

354
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,410
The baby is about to break her perineum.

355
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,050
I can't take this anymore.

356
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:44,940
Please,

357
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,120
let me push the baby out.

358
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,380
I'll be relieved.

359
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,690
You can't lose control,

360
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,150
or there will be serious perineal laceration.

361
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,290
Don't push too hard.

362
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,030
Don't push

363
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,990
when there's a contraction.

364
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,810
Listen to me. Breathe. Relax.

365
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,100
The fetus's head is out of the pelvis.

366
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,930
The baby

367
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,910
cannot be flushed out.

368
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,170
Make sure her perineum isn't damaged.

369
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:02,770
Relax.

370
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,850
The doctor asks you to relax.

371
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,180
No. The head is out.

372
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,480
Don't worry. Don't worry.

373
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,240
Come on. Have faith in the doctors.

374
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,520
Doctor, how is she doing?

375
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,940
How's she?

376
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,210
Let's talk over there.

377
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,200
How is she?

378
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,180
How is she?

379
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,000
The good news is, both the mother and the girl are safe.

380
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,480
Great. It's a girl.

381
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,690
Girl is good, too.

382
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,480
Good. Great.

383
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,090
However, there was

384
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,370
a small problem

385
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,680
during the labor.

386
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,900
But

387
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,980
I have stitched her wound up.

388
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,700
The nurse station gave you an emergency call,

389
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,360
so I knew you didn't

390
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,550
have lunch.

391
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,400
Thanks.

392
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,710
I saved your life.

393
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,030
You could have starved to death.

394
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,780
Are you going

395
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,060
to be my girlfriend, then?

396
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,940
I only value

397
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,680
two things in my life.

398
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,990
My shoes and my face.

399
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,930
Now, you have ruined them both.

400
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,110
The thing you value the most

401
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,750
should be your professional expertise,

402
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,470
not your

403
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,560
pretty face and white shoes.

404
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,420
Who gives you the right

405
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,900
to judge my professional expertise?

406
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,890
Your clinic skills.

407
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,880
That's only part of it.

408
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,790
I dare you a contest of academic expertise with me.

409
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,070
Bring it on.

410
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,380
What about this?

411
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,890
We'll choose a subject.

412
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,770
If you lose,

413
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,920
you'll be my girlfriend.

414
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,660
If I lose,

415
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,170
I'll be your boyfriend.

416
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,119
I'm full.

417
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,690
Think about

418
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,869
when to have the contest.

419
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,170
Be careful with the piercing.

420
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,430
The remaining needle of the patient of Bed No. 3 can be removed.

421
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,920
OK.

422
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,200
A cup of milk tea for you.

423
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,570
Slow down.

424
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,950
This cup of milk tea

425
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,550
is just what I needed.

426
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,220
You have no idea

427
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,180
how nervous I was.

428
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,150
Why?

429
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,560
When did you start to be nervous

430
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,620
in the communication with a patient's family?

431
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,610
It wasn't that.

432
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,650
It was Yang Zhenzhen's laceration.

433
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,740
You know,

434
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,780
my hands were shaking

435
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,190
when I stitched her up.

436
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,860
You completed the stitching independently.

437
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,500
Good for you. It's worth a celebration.

438
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,420
I don't think so.

439
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,290
Du Di was able to do it a long time ago.

440
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,580
You had no idea

441
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,820
how I summoned my courage

442
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,030
to stitch her up.

443
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,900
It turned out good, though.

444
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,460
I think I exceeded my limit.

445
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,140
Thank you

446
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,310
for helping me

447
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,170
with all those practices.

448
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,920
Well, the celebration is happening.

449
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,930
Look, I'll make a reservation for tonight.

450
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,070
A feast, huh?

451
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,280
Senior.

452
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,160
What do you want?

453
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,510
Get in the car.

454
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,780
I'll take you to have something tasty.

455
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,510
You bought a new car?

456
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,610
Your house is near the hospital.

457
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,690
Why did you buy a car?

458
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,620
I see you have a lot of money to waste.

459
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,650
I bought the car to chase girls.

460
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,790
It's inconvenient

461
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,520
if I can't drive girls out for fun.

462
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,180
Well, I don't want to hinder your fun.

463
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,090
I'll take the subway.

464
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,610
I'm just…

465
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,460
Senior.

466
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,540
It's rush hour.

467
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,620
How did you get here

468
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
faster than the subway?

469
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,700
I just gave it a shot.

470
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,900
And the traffic was okay tonight.

471
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,170
Your had your fun already?

472
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,320
She rejected me.

473
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,420
I'm hungry. Let's grab some food.

474
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,480
I'll pass.

475
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,920
I'll go home and read some articles.

476
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
That's too bad.

477
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,110
I was going to discuss

478
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,990
my foreign teacher's

479
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,180
latest research result with you.

480
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,370
Where?

481
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,700
Crayfish caesarean.

482
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,590
You got that?

483
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:16,800
I'll film this.

484
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,680
What?

485
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,630
I have my teeth, don't I?

486
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,130
Get out of here.

487
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,990
It's dinner time.

488
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,210
Let's have some crayfish.

489
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,860
You said yourself

490
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,680
that you'd practice hard.

491
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,670
Let's just eat.

492
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,590
You practice

493
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,430
when you eat.

494
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,570
You cut things up, you stitch things up.

495
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,750
Otherwise,

496
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,310
how are you going

497
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,080
to catch up with others?

498
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,040
No wonder you stitched up my shoes.

499
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,420
About that,

500
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:55,780
I'm sorry.

501
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,080
I'm okay.

502
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,630
Perhaps in the future,

503
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,810
stitched-up shoes

504
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,750
will be a trend.

505
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,070
What's the crap?

506
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
What was this latest

507
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,740
research result

508
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,880
that you talked about?

509
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
It's mainly

510
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,760
about the embryo screening,

511
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,540
that is especially targeted at the parents with genetic diseases.

512
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,490
How to prevent a genetic disease

513
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,570
from being passed down to their child…

514
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,420
It's an expensive restaurant,

515
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,370
and it's far away from the hospital.

516
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,960
Why did you bring me here?

517
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,440
This is the first time

518
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,610
I treat you to dinner.

519
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
So it has to be formal.

520
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,740
Seriously?

521
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,810
I just did a stitching

522
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,970
independently.

523
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,100
Why not?

524
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,270
You deserve it.

525
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,320
Well, I'll enjoy myself.

526
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,730
How is it?

527
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,360
So good.

528
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,890
Just like everybody says.

529
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,020
It's very fresh.

530
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,110
Congrui, there's something

531
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,980
that I didn't tell you before.

532
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,200
When you were moving,

533
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,620
the umbrella you found,

534
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,270
wasn't from Feng Yuanhang.

535
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,710
I lent it to you

536
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,370
in the library.

537
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,340
Really?

538
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,780
My roommate

539
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,800
always took my umbrella without telling me.

540
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,640
He lost so many of my umbrellas.

541
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,680
I didn't want to waste more money on umbrellas,

542
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,140
so I carved an "L"

543
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,560
on the bottom of the handle.

544
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,360
The first letter of Li.

545
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:43,710
Gosh.

546
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,180
I don't remember it

547
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
at all.

548
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,550
I noticed a men's umbrella

549
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,180
in my room.

550
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,620
I thought Feng Yuanhang gave it to me,

551
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,400
so I put it away.

552
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,070
I didn't know it was yours.

553
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,820
All you thought about at that time

554
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,180
was Feng Yuanhang, right?

555
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm sorry.

556
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,080
I really don't remember.

557
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,710
Congrui,

558
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,060
answer me this,

559
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,610
did we overlook

560
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,870
other choices

561
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,170
when we chose over lovers?

562
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,800
If we

563
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,830
had considered other options,

564
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,700
we wouldn't have had

565
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,730
to stick with one person.

566
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,110
Perhaps.

567
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,020
What?

568
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,630
Did you ever consider other options

569
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,750
besides Du Di?

570
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,280
We'll split the bill.

571
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,580
What?

572
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,830
You think I can't afford it?

573
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,340
That's not what I meant.

574
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,460
Why would I spend your money

575
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,310
for no particular reason?

576
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,710
Splitting bills is not what we do here.

577
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,980
A capable man

578
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,640
won't let his girl spend any money.

579
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,890
Come on.

580
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,580
Tuck in.

581
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,140
Finished?

582
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,410
Excuse me, bill please.

583
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,300
I have paid for it.

584
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,090
When?

585
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,030
When you were out

586
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,940
on the phone.

587
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,640
I said I was going to treat you to dinner.

588
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,830
You can't pay for it.

589
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,780
You shared your teacher's

590
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,210
latest research result with me.

591
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,450
So I paid for the meal to express my appreciation.

592
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,340
What should I do?

593
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,880
You didn't even give me an opportunity.

594
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,930
Are we going?

595
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,140
Fine.

596
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,570
I see many people here.

597
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,460
Director Tian.

598
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,880
I heard you would make rounds,

599
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,470
so we've been waiting here.

600
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,950
What seems to be the problem?

601
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,710
My daughter felt pains in her belly,

602
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
and came to the hospital three times.

603
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,670
She said it was false labor,

604
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,830
and sent us back.

605
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,030
And on our way home,

606
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,220
her water broke.

607
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,080
The traffic was bad that day.

608
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,540
But we made it to the hospital and she gave birth to the baby.

609
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,860
But the baby was too big,

610
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,520
my daughter was injured.

611
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,110
Yeah.

612
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,350
Hadn't my son

613
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,420
used the bicycle lane,

614
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,090
we would have lost the baby.

615
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,600
Why do you have to mention this?

616
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,060
Explain to me.

617
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,100
They came and asked to check her in.

618
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,260
But all signs indicated false labor.

619
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,390
So I told them

620
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,030
about the points for attention,

621
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,860
and asked them to go home.

622
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,360
But unexpectedly, her water broke on the way.

623
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,570
How dare you call it false labor.

624
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,680
That was a misdiagnosis,

625
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,620
you know?

626
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,470
Zhenzhen's mother,

627
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,020
please stay calm.

628
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,680
Please calm down.

629
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,170
Director Tian,

630
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,040
we knew that

631
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,420
the baby was a big one.

632
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,060
So to be safe,

633
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,300
we came to the hospital once she had a feeling.

634
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,370
But this doctor here

635
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,010
refused to check our daughter in.

636
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,140
We're not here to start a dispute,

637
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,720
but we do need an answer.

638
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,820
I hope

639
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,020
you take this matter seriously.

640
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,900
Yeah, yeah.

641
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,860
OK.

642
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,420
Please be calm.

643
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,850
I'll get a full picture of this incident,

644
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,140
and give you an answer soon.

645
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,690
Is that okay?

646
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,500
Sure, sure.

647
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
From the record,

648
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,460
you didn't make a mistake.

649
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,310
But did you think about

650
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,160
the possibility of precipitate labor due to the size of the fetus?

651
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,490
Did you have a thorough communication

652
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,830
with her family?

653
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,150
We don't receive false labor.

654
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,990
That's the rule.

655
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,930
Who could predict this precipitate labor?

656
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,890
Couldn't you

657
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,220
just bend the rules a little?

658
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,250
They were so anxious,

659
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,220
and they came for the third time.

660
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,620
There could be unexpected circumstances.

661
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,140
Like her precipitate labor, which actually happened.

662
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,770
And they got more agitated.

663
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,340
How could they possibly understand you?

664
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,570
Their agitation

665
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,790
had nothing to do with the precipitate labor.

666
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,470
Du Di,

667
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,400
yes, you strictly

668
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,730
followed the rules.

669
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,100
However,

670
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,450
you didn't consider

671
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,920
how the expectant mother

672
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,700
and her family would feel.

673
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,230
And if

674
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,170
bad things happen,

675
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,240
there would be issues.

676
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,830
Du Di, the rule is the rule,

677
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,670
but we're humans.

678
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,600
If there were empty beds,

679
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,650
a situation like this,

680
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,490
three false alarms,

681
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,440
giant fetus,

682
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,590
very anxious

683
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,780
family members,

684
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,830
could have been

685
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,990
handled with flexibility.

686
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,220
You could've reported to the supervisor

687
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,840
and they'd make an exception.

688
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,140
No empty bed at the time.

689
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,460
Du Di,

690
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,040
you should really learn

691
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,410
from Wu Congrui.

692
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,460
As a doctor,

693
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,260
you need to comfort both the patients

694
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,450
and their family.

695
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,310
I don't see any point

696
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,100
in continuing the lecture.

697
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:38,940
Listen.

698
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,220
You will go out and apologize to her family,

699
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,350
and ask for their forgiveness.

700
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,200
If they don't forgive you,

701
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,100
I'll deduct your bonus.

702
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,450
You can deduct my bonus directly.

703
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,720
Please don't.

704
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,940
She will make the apology at once.

705
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,890
I wish

706
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,670
they were one person.

707
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,430
That's what I think.

708
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,510
Just stop

709
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,990
irritating Director Tian.

710
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,970
He's been tolerant enough this time.

711
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,100
It's just an apology.

712
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,540
You're the most hard-working doctor

713
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,100
in our hospital.

714
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,780
-But the most hard-working doctor won't get any bonus?
-Just stop.

715
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,610
Director Tian is a pushover.

716
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,230
Who could predict

717
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,300
the precipitate labor, huh?

718
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,190
Conciliate the family.

719
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,620
Apologize to the family.

720
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,260
What's the point?

721
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,120
This isn't conciliation.

722
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,290
You know the biggest difference

723
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,650
between us and ordinary folks?

724
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:27,970
It is

725
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,440
the gap of expertise.

726
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,390
What we think is common knowledge

727
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,860
is confusing

728
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,070
for ordinary people.

729
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,380
The medical knowledge

730
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,100
is like the cooks' culinary skills.

731
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,660
It's common knowledge for the cooks,

732
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,910
but if you don't know what

733
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,910
condiments they're using,

734
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,830
you cannot

735
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,870
get the taste right, right?

736
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,790
But I'm worried that

737
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,430
if I make the apology,

738
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,540
I'll get into a fight with them.

739
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,350
How about this?

740
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,150
I'll be watching you in secret.

741
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,600
Once anything is wrong,

742
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,810
I'll hold you back.

743
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,980
Du Di,

744
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,230
I think you're capable of doing anything

745
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,420
if you are committed.

746
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,920
Just go.

747
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,390
Go for it.

748
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,150
Well, do what you want with me.

749
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,410
But I didn't make a misdiagnosis.

750
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,150
Doctor,

751
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,500
we won't curse at you,

752
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,380
nor will we hit you.

753
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,080
They're in the room.

754
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,230
I won't let them out.

755
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,260
I just consulted

756
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,700
some of my friends in the medical field,

757
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,740
and they talked to

758
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,660
a few experts.

759
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,510
They have got it all

760
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,540
figured out.

761
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,450
My daughter-in-law

762
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,380
had precipitate labor. And it was uncommon.

763
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,370
And on our way home,

764
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,380
my son's sudden brake

765
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,240
kind of scared her.

766
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,810
It might be the immediate cause

767
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,260
of the precipitate labor.

768
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,300
So

769
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,100
I'd like to formally apologize to you.

770
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,380
I'm sorry.

771
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,410
You didn't make a misdiagnosis.

772
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,070
I thought…

773
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,740
However, doctor,

774
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,850
can I ask you a question?

775
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,760
What if

776
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,260
you checked her in?

777
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,420
If you had patiently

778
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,130
told us that

779
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,030
there would be a chance of precipitate labor

780
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,370
instead of

781
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,760
affirmatively informing us

782
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,870
that the labor

783
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,060
could last 2 or 3 days,

784
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,440
we wouldn't have

785
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,900
driven all the way home.

786
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,630
We'd have stayed in a hotel near the hospital.

787
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,650
That way,

788
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,870
the labor could have gone more smoothly, right?

789
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,430
And my daughter-in-law wouldn't have

790
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,660
had to go through so much pain.

791
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,090
You're doctors,

792
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,280
and we trust your expertise.

793
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
But do you know

794
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,370
that there's a big gap

795
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,590
between our medical knowledge

796
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,540
and yours?

797
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,380
You could've given us more information.

798
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,710
You could've been more patient, then…

799
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,610
Her laceration could've been…

800
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,130
Doctor,

801
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,620
I believe you're committed

802
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,270
to your career,

803
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,140
so do you have the heart

804
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,410
to see a young mother in pain?

805
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,820
I'm sorry.

806
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,180
I don't know

807
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,170
how to express it,

808
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,400
but I'm really sorry.

809
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,580
I hope you don't need to be sorry again.

810
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,320
What did he say to you?

811
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,910
He didn't raise his voice at you.

812
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,060
What happened?

813
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,870
Maybe I was really wrong.

814
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,740
I imposed the suffering

815
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,890
that could've been avoided on Yang Zhenzhen.

816
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,160
Yes, Yang Zhenzhen went through hell,

817
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,310
but I don't think it's right

818
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,430
that Director Tian

819
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,000
blamed the whole thing on you.

820
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,790
If we had

821
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,140
enough beds,

822
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,390
why would we

823
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,960
be so strict with all those expectant mothers?

824
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,860
When we just started working

825
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,650
at Shengji,

826
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,910
Director Huang

827
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,750
told us this.

828
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,540
"As an obstetrician gynecologist,

829
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,730
you cold be exhausted both physically and mentally..

830
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,200
Because things are more complicated

831
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,940
outside the operation room.

832
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,350
What we are dealing with

833
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,640
is not just a life,

834
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,760
but a whole family".

835
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,900
This thing

836
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,600
can serve as a lesson.

837
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,020
Now that experience is gained,

838
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,700
you will try

839
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,990
to explain more

840
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,780
when you talk to patients.

841
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,060
Don't beat yourself up.

842
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,010
What? Leave me alone.

843
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,560
Squeeze it.

844
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,790
Does it help?

845
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,600
What a waste.

846
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,860
Not really.

847
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,110
It's still edible.

848
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,730
Unbelievable.

849
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,820
When you feel bad,

850
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,750
and don't feel like crying,

851
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,610
it works perfectly.

852
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,520
Today, I have learned

853
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,580
that some words

854
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,130
can hurt more than curses.

855
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,500
When a good doctor like you

856
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,300
takes a blow and feels bad,

857
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,070
then soon, she'll evolve into a better doctor.

858
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,940
Previously, I always thought

859
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
a good doctor only needed

860
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,150
to perform operations flawlessly,

861
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,380
but now,

862
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
I start to realize

863
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,730
that many patients

864
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,750
regard the doctors good at communications

865
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,710
as the real good ones.

866
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,210
Do you think

867
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,250
Congrui is a chatty good doctor?

868
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,310
Why can't you

869
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,800
be a doctor who's good at

870
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,860
both operations and chats?

871
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:49,760
I…

872
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,120
You need to learn to express yourself.

873
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,350
Express your happiness, your concerns,

874
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,400
your care,

875
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,750
and your kindness from the bottom of your heart.

876
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,110
You always keep things to yourself.

877
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,860
I don't know how.

878
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,670
You can learn.

879
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,860
How?

880
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:12,860
Step one.

881
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,750
Compliment me sincerely.

882
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,150
No criticisms, only compliments.

883
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,020
You…

884
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,909
You…

885
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,810
You…

886
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,810
Are…

887
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,699
Come on.

888
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:39,830
You have fair skin.

889
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,800
Is that all?

890
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,510
Hey, that's not good enough.

891
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,460
Come back and try again.

892
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:49,820
Thank you.

893
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,469
Not at all.

894
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,300
I've got a number.

895
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,670
Do I come straight up to see you?

896
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,660
No more numbers in the morning.

897
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,560
I gave you the extra number.

898
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,690
I'm almost finished.

899
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,240
Before my lunch break,

900
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,870
you can come into my office.

901
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,250
OK. I love you, bestie.

902
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,460
I'm coming right over.

903
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,490
Hello. Hi.

904
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,760
Please wait over there.

905
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,120
Thank you.

906
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,590
You only started

907
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,290
to watch this?

908
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,860
It's been streamed online for a while.

909
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,350
I was busy with work.

910
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,520
I didn't have time for it.

911
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,940
Now, I'm pregnant.

912
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,510
I have got a long vacation.

913
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,880
So I figured

914
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,940
I could pick up

915
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,460
all the popular TV shows in the past.

916
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,740
I tell you what,

917
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,980
this isn't suitable for us

918
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,120
pregnant women.

919
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:00,980
The home wrecker

920
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,010
in the drama is the worst.

921
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,230
She makes me so mad.

922
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,020
I feel you.

923
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,250
I would get so mad

924
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,590
when I got too deep into it.

925
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,980
I'm afraid it may be bad for the baby.

926
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,300
But

927
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,310
I want to know so badly

928
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,390
if it serves the home wrecker right

929
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,130
at the end.

930
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,460
So I can't help myself

931
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,200
but keep watching one episode after another.

932
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,910
Women like us can tell

933
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,180
right away

934
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,380
that this girl

935
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,890
is no good.

936
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,150
And she's unreasonable.

937
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,200
But men

938
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,100
don't think so.

939
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:26,880
When my husband and I

940
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,190
watched this together,

941
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,190
he said

942
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,490
the home wrecker was a thoughtful one,

943
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,730
so it's normal that men like her.

944
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,180
I was so mad

945
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,680
that I nearly broke up with him.

946
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
Some men

947
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,060
are partly human

948
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,280
and partly animal.

949
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,550
When the animal part gets the better of the human part,

950
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,660
even if he has a fairy lady at home,

951
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,770
he will still go out there

952
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,490
and forage for garbage.

953
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,470
What a precise metaphor.

954
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,300
Very insightful.

955
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,670
I'll sum it up

956
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,440
and post it on my moments.

957
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,420
You know what?

958
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,410
Some of my friends

959
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,130
are actually having affairs

960
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,150
with married men.

961
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,850
They should read it.

962
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,460
You are

963
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,940
not even 30, right?

964
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,440
22. You?

965
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm 42.

966
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,140
I'm 20 years older than you are.

967
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
Why didn't you have a child earlier?

968
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,390
I got married

969
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,730
after I graduated from college.

970
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,990
But my husband

971
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,940
didn't have a good job at the time,

972
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,690
so I chose not to have a child

973
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,560
because a child might slow down my pace in career

974
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,230
and would be a heavy burden for us.

975
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,630
But later,

976
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,470
he quit

977
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,960
and started up his own business.

978
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,050
And it turned out a success.

979
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,020
Our life's getting better,

980
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,990
so I thought we could

981
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,310
have a kid.

982
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,580
I'm the opposite.

983
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,160
I wanted to marry

984
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,280
a promising man

985
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,180
and have a child as early as possible

986
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,700
and then devote myself in career.

987
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,750
And when I'm older,

988
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,970
I'll have my career and my child.

989
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,030
No. 25, Guo Caiting.

990
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,260
Guo Caiting.

991
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,140
It's me. I'm going in.

992
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,910
I'm Guo Caiting.

993
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,290
I enjoyed our chat.

994
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,990
Thank you.

995
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,410
Me, too. I'm Zhang Ying.

996
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,060
See you later.

997
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,250
See you.

998
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,150
No. 25?

999
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,130
25 pregnant women

1000
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,390
in one morning?

1001
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,240
My bestie is a machine.

1002
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,260
All indicators are normal.

1003
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,220
But you should get your fertility service certificate

1004
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,310
as soon as possible, though.

1005
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,390
Alright, I got it.

1006
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,010
My husband has been very busy.

1007
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,920
He can always

1008
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,840
make time

1009
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,720
for you.

1010
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,990
Also, your antenatal care

1011
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,790
and maternity insurance

1012
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,190
both need the certificate.

1013
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,910
If you want to give birth at Shengji,

1014
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,360
you must hurry up.

1015
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,670
OK.

1016
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,560
Come in.

1017
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,260
OK.

1018
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,320
I'm off, Director Huang.

1019
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,810
See you.

1020
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,500
Sister.

1021
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,300
I thought

1022
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,520
I was the last one.

1023
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,870
This is Director Huang, you know?

1024
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,270
Are you finished?

1025
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,080
Yeah. Bye.

1026
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,060
OK, bye.

1027
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:14,630
See you.

1028
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,380
You must be exhausted.

1029
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,290
I'm alright. I'm used to it.

1030
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,400
I don't even remember how exhaustion feels.

1031
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,290
I think

1032
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,920
you should take your maternity leave earlier.

1033
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,690
We're about the same age.

1034
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,630
I'm feeling tired all the time

1035
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,900
even though I'm not doing anything.

1036
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,690
Yet you're still

1037
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,700
working so hard.

1038
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,030
You're so amazing.

1039
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,750
Sometimes, you'll feel

1040
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,460
being at work is better than staying at home.

1041
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,100
Enough of me. What about you?

1042
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,630
Do you enjoy your retirement?

1043
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,700
I'm not retired.

1044
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,170
I'm only temporarily

1045
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,190
away from work

1046
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,540
to have a baby.

1047
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,380
Oh, you know what?

1048
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,210
As soon as I realized I was pregnant,

1049
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,080
I wanted to come here.

1050
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,900
But my husband

1051
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,830
asked me

1052
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,450
to go to a private hospital near our house.

1053
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,700
I wondered

1054
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,760
why I should

1055
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,440
go to a private hospital?

1056
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,670
I'm an elderly primipara.

1057
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,360
What if something goes wrong?

1058
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,030
I don't think any private hospital

1059
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,300
can handle that.

1060
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,860
Look at you.

1061
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,500
Your husband paid big money,

1062
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,320
yet you're still complaining.

1063
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,250
Are you showing off?

1064
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,020
No.

1065
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,330
I swear I'm not.

1066
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,820
I'm being totally honest.

1067
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:19,820
Alright.

1068
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,790
Show me all the reports

1069
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,860
that you got

1070
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,580
at the private hospital.

1071
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,590
They are all here.

1072
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,920
Let me see.

1073
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,630
All indicators look good.

1074
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,700
Don't worry.

1075
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,460
How can I not be worried?

1076
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,250
I got pregnant in my 40s, after all.

1077
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,710
Down's syndrome screening is a must.

1078
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,780
Did you have amniocentesis?

1079
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,690
No.

1080
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,080
The private hospital

1081
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,070
isn't qualified

1082
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,150
to do any prenatal screening

1083
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,570
or prenatal diagnosis.

1084
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,740
You'd better have one here.

1085
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,860
I'll make an appointment for you.

1086
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,460
OK.

1087
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,100
How long will I get the report

1088
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,200
after the check?

1089
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,900
About a week.

1090
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,940
Go get the check-up

1091
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,760
this afternoon, okay?

1092
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,060
Measure her fundal height

1093
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,680
and abdominal girth.

1094
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,220
OK.

1095
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,390
You'll humiliate yourself

1096
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,820
because I won't lose.

1097
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,150
What if you lose?

1098
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,700
If you lose,

1099
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,910
you'll cook dinner

1100
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,740
for Liu Nianbai for a week.

1101
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,850
That's a good idea.

1102
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,060
Shut up.

1103
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,630
If you lose,

1104
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,470
you'll be wearing

1105
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,810
pink lip gloss for three days.

1106
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,370
How did they even start the contest?

1107
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,310
An intern passed out in the operation room.

1108
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,260
Dr. Lin

1109
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,580
asked everybody to do more exercise.

1110
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,720
Du Di said she had kept doing exercise.

1111
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,820
Dr. Lin didn't believe her,

1112
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,190
so here we are.

1113
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,960
Fine. Deal. Bring it on.

1114
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,000
I'll be the judge.

1115
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,700
3, 2, 1. Game on.

1116
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:08,870
Come on.

1117
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,100
Good.

1118
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,400
No way. This is impossible.

1119
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,150
Nothing is impossible.

1120
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,220
We're not done here.

1121
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,000
Best 2 out of 3.

1122
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,950
Hey, he goes back on his word.

1123
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:34,440
Dr. Lin,

1124
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,510
this isn't right.

1125
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,040
Don't be a sour loser, right?

1126
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,340
Fine, I lost.

1127
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Lip gloss, huh?

1128
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,200
Come on.

1129
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,100
But no girl in our department

1130
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,750
carries a lipstick around, right?

1131
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,780
No lipstick?

1132
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,870
Well, that's not on me.

1133
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,690
I have one.

1134
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,130
I now announce

1135
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,160
that Du Di won.

1136
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,270
I'll fulfill my duty

1137
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,370
by punishing the loser.

1138
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,170
Don't worry, Dr. Lin.

1139
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,870
I'll be very careful with your lips.
