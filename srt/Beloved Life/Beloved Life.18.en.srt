Baby, who do you look like?

He has a flat nose.

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,790
But we both have a high nose.

170

Right.

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,470
Is he our baby?

178
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,420
Let me check it.

179
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,590
It's right.

180
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,700
It's your baby.

181
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,160
It's clear on the wristband.

182
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:54,990
When did you

183
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,940
put the wristband on him?

184
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,030
In the surgery room.

185
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,040
In the surgery room?

186
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,750
We didn't see the baby when he was born.

187
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,440
How could we know

188
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,570
whether you're telling the truth?

189
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,630
Did you get the wrong baby?

190
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,450
No way.

191
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,020
It's impossible.

192
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,030
You took

193
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,790
the wrong operation agreement.

194
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,270
What's impossible in you?

195
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,510
It's really impossible.

196
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,260
The management of our hospital

197
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,270
is strict.

198
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,940
We check

199
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,380
each link.

200
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,940
It may be possible

201
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,480
in the past time

202
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,830
or in some

203
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,620
irregular hospital

204
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,390
now

205
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,280
to take the wrong baby.

206
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,550
But it's impossible

207
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,230
to happen

208
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,520
in Shengji.

209
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,440
How about this?

210
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,100
Describe to me each link

211
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,150
you have done

212
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,230
in detail.

213
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:30,830
No.

214
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,560
Wait a minute.

215
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,020
Wait.

216
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,580
Son.

217
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,030
How about call

218
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,540
Dr. Liu

219
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,550
and let him listen to it?

220
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,450
If you don't trust us,

221
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,290
you can do the paternity test.

222
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,870
We don't have time to

223
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,860
guess it with you.

224
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,270
If you don't trust our hospital,

225
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,300
you can choose another one.

226
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,380
-Let's go.
-You…

227
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,620
Mind your tone.

228
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:45,990
-Let's do it.
-Mom.

229
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,740
It's…

230
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,660
Her tone…

231
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,250
Mom.

232
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,540
No way.

233
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,790
I've heard that the baby

234
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,020
hasn't grown well when he was born

235
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,730
and we can't tell who he looks like.

236
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,810
Just wait.

237
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,450
When he's grown up, we can tell.

238
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,060
Well.

239
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,830
Let me tell you, son.

240
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,120
The doctor always makes mistakes.

241
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,710
I don't trust her.

242
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,660
You said that

243
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,530
Shengji is the best hospital.

244
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,070
How can the best hospital

245
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,180
make such a

246
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,100
low-leveled mistake?

247
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,390
Just do the test.

248
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,250
It doesn't take much time.

249
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,700
You...

250
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,180
you pretend to be suspecting the doctor,

251
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,890
but you're suspecting me in fact.

252
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,670
I…

253
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,530
When I was just pregnant,

254
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,170
Mom kept spying on me,

255
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,150
asking about the time

256
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,420
and checked the time several times.

257
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,350
Mom.

258
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,660
If Wei Yang

259
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,460
didn't come back,

260
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,850
I can accept

261
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,800
your suspicion.

262
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,480
But Wei Yang was back

263
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,430
and stayed for three days.

264
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,340
So I was pregnant.

265
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,520
Is that so suspicious?

266
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,390
Xiaoshu,

267
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,320
Mom doesn't suspect you.

268
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,800
She never told me.

269
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,350
I haven't suspected you.

270
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:52,980
No.

271
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,790
I haven't suspected you.

272
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,720
No.

273
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,630
You've been married for years

274
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,060
and haven't been pregnant.

275
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:58,820
Suddenly,

276
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,180
you were pregnant.

277
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,100
I...

278
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,320
I was happy

279
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,780
and caring.

280
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,420
I only worry that

281
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,600
they got the wrong kid.

282
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,820
You have

283
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,100
read the news, right?

284
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,030
A mom

285
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,190
had raised her son for 28 years.

286
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,750
The son got ill and went to the hospital for a check,

287
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
and was told to get his liver changed.

288
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,060
The test turned out that

289
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,730
it's not her son.

290
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,870
They took the wrong baby.

291
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,940
How terrible,

292
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:24,850
right?

293
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,700
Well,

294
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,800
if we do

295
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,250
a paternity test,

296
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,140
we can

297
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,220
be relieved,

298
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,190
right?

299
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,700
Xiaoshu.

300
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,920
I have heard about

301
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,140
the news.

302
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,700
I trust you.

303
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,500
Dad and Mom also trust you.

304
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,540
Besides,

305
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,870
it's our baby,

306
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,240
no need to worry about it, right?

307
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,390
You're bullying me

308
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,210
together.

309
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,950
How come?

310
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,750
Just let

311
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,620
her feel relieved,

312
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,100
alright?

313
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,670
Just explain

314
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,730
the process.

315
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,350
Tell her

316
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,760
it's impossible.

317
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,230
And make an acknowledgment

318
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,900
in the neonatology department.

319
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Then it's done.

320
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,360
Now they

321
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,670
have to make a paternity test

322
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,700
and call the media.

323
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,330
Du Di.

324
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,880
It's just

325
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,070
a simple suspicion

326
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,100
and is easy to deal with.

327
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,250
How could you make it

328
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,170
so complicated?

329
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,950
Even if I have explained,

330
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,960
they wouldn't believe me.

331
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,670
They asked the other hospital

332
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,460
to question me,

333
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,720
how could they trust me?

334
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,920
Yang Zhenzhen's case

335
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,940
happened not that long ago.

336
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,470
Now there's another problem of

337
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,620
miscommunication between doctor and patient.

338
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,790
Why don't you

339
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,900
never let others trust you?

340
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,850
Du Di.

341
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,700
What have you done?

342
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,640
What has she done?

343
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,120
She must have done something

344
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,300
to make the patient's family suspect her.

345
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,170
You're a rare visitor, Dr. Huang.

346
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,740
You've been gone for two days.

347
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,970
How did you

348
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,060
get connected?

349
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,360
Did you go to

350
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,380
Himalaya

351
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,250
or the seabed?

352
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,700
Sorry, Dr. Tian.

353
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,880
My phone was crashed

354
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,420
in the police station.

355
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,220
I bought a new one

356
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,170
after settling all the business.

357
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,220
I will explain

358
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,290
to you later.

359
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,580
Now let's deal with Du Di's business.

360
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,310
What did

361
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,440
Du Di do?

362
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,340
Du Di took the wrong operation agreement

363
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,000
when explaining the operation plan

364
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,700
to the patient's family.

365
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,390
She gave the operation agreement of

366
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,570
an advanced cervical cancer patient

367
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,650
to the family.

368
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,840
They were scared.

369
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,040
After that,

370
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,860
they don't trust Du Di anymore.

371
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,620
Du Di is always powerful,

372
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,340
never communicating well with patients' families.

373
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,220
Director Huang.

374
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,070
I've been communicating patiently

375
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,040
with her family.

376
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,150
But you have no idea…

377
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,590
Du Di, can you stop

378
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,530
making mistakes?

379
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,430
I just admitted you into the academic project,

380
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,260
but now you caused

381
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,980
such a big trouble for me.

382
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,870
There's

383
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,710
something worse.

384
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,460
What else has she done?

385
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,270
Tell me.

386
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,710
The result of

387
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,500
Yang Shu's paternity test is out.

388
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,860
Unmatched.

389
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,480
Stop.

390
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,180
Unless there's another puerpera

391
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,010
in the operating room that day,

392
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:57,840
or

393
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,020
there's no way to make a mistake.

394
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,380
It's not our

395
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,600
neonatology department's fault.

396
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,700
In this condition,

397
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,890
there's only one explanation.

398
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,200
The woman cheated on her husband.

399
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,410
Maybe the family

400
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,000
has realized it and insisted that

401
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,410
the baby doesn't look like them.

402
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,220
Du Di.

403
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,380
There's concrete evidence.

404
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,270
There's no problem with

405
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,060
the hospital's process.

406
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,760
The problem was caused

407
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,780
due to your improper communication.

408
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,630
So,

409
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,180
you talk with the family

410
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,050
and tell them to

411
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,840
settle their domestic issue

412
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,660
by themselves.

413
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,310
If they make a fuss,

414
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,740
there will be no good for them.

415
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,330
Well…

416
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,260
Mom.

417
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,870
Why not have some food in the canteen?

418
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,540
I'm OK.

419
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,680
Food?

420
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,100
I'm not in that mood.

421
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,830
Your dad-in-law and Wei Yang

422
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,580
went to talk with the journalists.

423
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,060
How's it going?

424
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,590
It's meaningless

425
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,490
to sigh here.

426
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
Just have some food

427
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,380
and take a walk.

428
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, okay then.

429
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,950
I'll take a walk

430
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,630
and buy you some food.

431
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,690
How can it be?

432
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,510
God.

433
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,440
Come in.

434
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,030
You're the doctor

435
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,930
who took the wrong baby.

436
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,750
My family members are not here.

437
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,000
What's up?

438
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,970
I've been waiting

439
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,910
for the whole morning

440
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,500
for your family's absence.

441
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,740
You...

442
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,500
you want to tell me something, right?

443
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,510
We've checked

444
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,370
the monitors

445
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,950
and found no problem

446
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,620
in our procedure.

447
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,670
In other words,

448
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,850
the baby

449
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,750
is your son

450
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
born in the operating room.

451
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,910
My superior asked me

452
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,970
to tell your family directly.

453
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,910
But I think it's better to

454
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,700
tell you first.

455
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,110
It will be no good to you

456
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,400
if you keep making trouble.

457
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,940
Can you tell people the truth?

458
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,660
What do you mean?

459
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,030
The hospital is clean

460
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,240
anyway,

461
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,860
and the baby is your son.

462
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,330
Can you

463
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,440
tell them the truth?

464
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,300
There will be a big trouble

465
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,700
if you keep lying.

466
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,970
It sounds like

467
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,460
it's for my good.

468
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,480
You asked me

469
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,540
don't make the fact

470
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,930
that I cheated public.

471
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,780
Do you mean that?

472
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,970
Your surname is Du.

473
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,210
Dr. Du.

474
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,260
I assure you.

475
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,780
I didn't cheat.

476
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,440
My husband is the father.

477
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,740
We've been married for three years

478
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,390
and had no kid.

479
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,660
He's an architect.

480
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,060
He was sent to Africa to assist with the construction.

481
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,030
When he left home,

482
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,910
My parents-in-law started to

483
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,540
spy on me.

484
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:11,940
At first,

485
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,250
I have to report where I go.

486
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,460
Later,

487
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,060
except for my working hours,

488
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,980
as long as

489
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,619
I was with a man

490
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,810
on the feast

491
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,250
or on the street,

492
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,730
my mother-in-law would be angry

493
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,870
and reported to my husband

494
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,580
in the video call.

495
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,310
Later, to avoid the trouble,

496
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,020
I quit all the dates with

497
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,990
my classmates or colleagues.

498
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,350
I came back home after work.

499
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,220
I bought all the stuff online.

500
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,550
Last year,

501
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,140
my husband

502
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,950
was back for a vacation.

503
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,290
I was pregnant out of expectation.

504
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,230
I was so happy.

505
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,670
Really.

506
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,340
On the one hand,

507
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,950
I was finally pregnant.

508
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,790
When my husband finished his work,

509
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,900
he would be a father.

510
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,820
On the other hand,

511
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,580
I was pregnant

512
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,980
so that I can finally

513
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,300
hang around with my friends.

514
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,370
Well,

515
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,480
I was pregnant,

516
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,830
so she couldn't suspect

517
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,660
me of cheating, right?

518
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,910
It was so difficult

519
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,620
for me in the past two years.

520
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,280
But I can swear,

521
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,790
I didn't cheat.

522
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,440
My husband is the father.

523
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,460
If I lied,

524
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,850
I shall be punished.

525
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,110
Don't move. Don't move.

526
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,310
Mind your wound.

527
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,340
Dr. Du.

528
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,230
Please.

529
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,760
Don't lie.

530
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,540
I can tell

531
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,490
you're straightforward.

532
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,520
Please,

533
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,490
don't lie for the hospital.

534
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,270
I didn't cheat.

535
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,400
I didn't.

536
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
It's impossible in

537
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,220
Shengji hospital.

538
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,700
In Shengji, we had

539
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,400
strict management of babies

540
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,540
even in the 1970s or 1980s

541
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,070
when there were

542
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,140
no digital management or wristbands.

543
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,680
This is the doctor in charge,

544
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,380
Dr. Du.

545
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,380
According to our regulations,

546
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,580
the transformation of babies

547
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,230
are conducted by

548
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,900
nurses of the neonatology department.

549
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,390
As the resident doctor of obstetrics and gynecology department,

550
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,150
she only

551
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,740
accompanied

552
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,740
and assisted the transformation.

553
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,670
How could a doctor

554
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,390
who didn't

555
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,820
touch the baby

556
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,060
take the wrong baby?

557
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,530
Dr. Du,

558
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,750
during the whole process,

559
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,150
you didn't touch the baby,

560
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,610
right?

561
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,170
In the surgery room,

562
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,590
I was assisting

563
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,340
Dr. Tian.

564
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,390
The surgery

565
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,060
was quite special.

566
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,560
So, it was recorded

567
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,430
and collected by the hospital.

568
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,110
You can check it.

569
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,470
When the baby was born,

570
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,740
he was delivered to the

571
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,740
neonatology department.

572
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,210
After we assured his condition,

573
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,420
we put him into the incubator.

574
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,690
After the surgery,

575
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,320
the nurses of neonatology department

576
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,190
took away the incubator.

577
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,230
I went to NICN

578
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,060
with them.

579
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,170
During this process,

580
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,730
including later when

581
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,670
neonatology department sent the baby back,

582
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,020
I didn't touch him.

583
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,050
Was it possible that

584
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,870
the neonatology department made a mistake

585
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,660
in internal management?

586
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,860
It's impossible.

587
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,580
What is NICU?

588
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,990
The management

589
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,330
is so strict.

590
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,710
In other words,

591
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,740
the woman cheated on her husband,

592
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,570
but she didn't admit it, right?

593
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,410
Please, Dr. Du.

594
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,720
Don't lie for the hospital.

595
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,620
I didn't cheat. I didn't.

596
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,650
If you can't prove my innocence,

597
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,300
I am doomed.

598
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,630
I can't live with grievance

599
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,760
and shame all my life.

600
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,930
Please, Dr. Du.

601
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
Please.

602
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,200
We can't tell

603
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,870
without evidence.

604
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,940
Du Di.

605
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,850
You have talked to the patient's family, right?

606
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,820
Let them know it.

607
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:53,980
I don't think

608
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,120
she was lying.

609
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,780
She said she didn't.

610
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,080
Nonsense.

611
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,260
She must be lying.

612
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,540
Director Tian.

613
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,580
It's a Rashomon.

614
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,780
Either the woman is lying,

615
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,660
or your hospital is lying.

616
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,110
Doctor Du is so hesitant,

617
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,540
I'm afraid there're some secrets.

618
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,870
I can't write

619
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,050
the clarifying report for you.

620
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,720
I hope you can

621
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,760
get more solid evidence.

622
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,610
Of course,

623
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
I will keep investigating.

624
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,720
How can it be a Rashomon?

625
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,310
It's the concrete fact.

626
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,250
So clear.

627
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,020
What's wrong with you, Du Di?

628
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,140
I asked you to clarify.

629
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,700
But you messed things up.

630
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,140
Du Di.

631
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,590
No matter

632
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,660
how the hospital deals with it,

633
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,180
I won't keep you

634
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,960
even though you're

635
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,800
Dr. Zhang's last student.

636
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,540
The obstetrics and gynecology department

637
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,300
doesn't allow a worker who stands opposite the hospital.

638
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:50,780
Dr. Tian.

639
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,630
Maybe

640
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,140
there're some hidden facts.

641
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,800
I think

642
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,400
we should investigate.

643
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,450
[Lin Wei]

644
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,900
Du Di is in trouble.

645
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,360
The hospital doesn't admit the mistake

646
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,800
and the puerpera doesn't admit cheating.

647
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,030
The paternity test shows unmatched.

648
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,190
These led to expulsion?

649
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,020
Are you kidding me?

650
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,970
Bai.

651
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,970
The beauty of the science of genetics

652
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,530
is also its intricacy.

653
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,480
You must be rigorous.

654
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,710
Dive deep before you see

655
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,730
the beauty of the truth.

656
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,090
Just because the paternity test

657
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,500
doesn't match

658
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,410
doesn't mean

659
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,910
the child is not biological.

660
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,220
The human body

661
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,510
has so many hidden secrets

662
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,000
just waiting for you to discover.

663
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,980
Bai, do you know

664
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,350
what time it is in the US?

665
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,730
I am 70.

666
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,460
Oops, I always think you're 30.

667
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm sorry, Lawrence.

668
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,450
But I really need you.

669
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,300
No, no, no.

670
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,670
My girlfriend

671
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,420
really needs you.

672
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,140
Your girlfriend?

673
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,540
I'm listening.

674
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,500
Hi, Lawrence.

675
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,620
Hello, everybody. I'm Lawrence.

676
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,540
Nice to meet you.

677
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,460
Everybody,

678
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,280
Lawrence is my supervisor

679
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,480
and a famous genetic scientist,

680
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,940
as well as the chief scientist of

681
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,540
Shengji-GHU

682
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
coordinated project.

683
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,210
Lawrence, this is Dr. Tian,

684
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,500
my boss in China.

685
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,820
Hi, nice to meet you.

686
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,940
And all these are my colleagues.

687
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,670
Doctor Tian, nice to meet you.

688
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,860
Lawrence, bravo!

689
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,920
As for the dispute over the baby in

690
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,270
obstetrics and gynecology department,

691
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,280
Lawrence thinks

692
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,750
it might be caused

693
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,170
by the gene.

694
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,490
Gene? Gene?

695
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,170
It rarely

696
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,160
happens.

697
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,430
Next, I'll let

698
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,320
Lawrence introduce.

699
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,260
Lawrence, please.

700
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,470
We once assisted

701
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,150
a couple

702
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:52,700
to give birth to

703
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,180
a test tube baby.

704
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,750
However, the blood type of the baby

705
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,190
was not connective to either of the parents.

706
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,220
They questioned us

707
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,510
whether we got

708
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,610
the sperm or ovum wrong.

709
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,290
The paternity test showed

710
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,240
that the mother matched

711
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,670
but the father didn't.

712
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,060
As you know, in this hospital,

713
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,420
it is impossible

714
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,230
to get that wrong.

715
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,510
After a lot of testing,

716
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,230
we found the baby,

717
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,100
although not

718
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,870
the father's

719
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,510
biological child,

720
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,620
was actually a close relative.

721
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,420
For example, a brother.

722
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,740
But the father had no brother.

723
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,570
What did he say?

724
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,160
What did he say?

725
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,430
He said that

726
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,910
this situation happened before.

727
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,070
The baby's gene

728
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,850
didn't belong to the father,

729
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,990
but the father's brother.

730
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,550
But the father had no brother

731
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,620
It was the ghost then.

732
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,950
"Ghost".

733
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,460
Stop.

734
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,090
Listen to him.

735
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,610
The truth is

736
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,900
the father is a mosaic.

737
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,190
Human mosaic

738
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,340
occurs early

739
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,190
in the

740
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,550
formulization of the egg.

741
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,630
When the inner cell masses form,

742
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,700
some of the genetic material,

743
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,440
for example, a chromosome

744
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,100
or gene

745
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,590
mutates.

746
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,590
Then you'll find the embryo

747
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,550
has two

748
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,390
DNA systems

749
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,100
in its body.

750
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,780
Two.

751
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,440
In other words,

752
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,280
the father

753
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,480
was a mosaic

754
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,500
and had two

755
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,240
DNA systems.

756
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,490
He had two kinds of sperms.

757
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,490
The baby's gene

758
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,220
has two

759
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,260
possibilities.

760
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,210
A person has two genes.

761
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,490
What a winner.

762
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,360
On further

763
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,470
examination,

764
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,140
the DNA

765
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,690
of some of the father's semen

766
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,430
was consistent

767
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,190
with the baby.

768
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,830
There're fewer

769
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,060
than 100 cases worldwide

770
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,210
that are being reported.

771
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,080
If the hospital

772
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,660
or the mother did not lie,

773
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,580
this is the only possibility.

774
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,800
I see.

775
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,060
Thanks, Lawrence.

776
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,250
If we want to

777
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,360
perform similar tests,

778
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,620
would you be able to help?

779
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,780
Of course.

780
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,830
Great.

781
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,500
Let me discuss

782
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,030
with my colleagues

783
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,520
and get back to you later.

784
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,150
Good luck to your girlfriend.

785
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,110
Bye.

786
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,570
What's your idea?

787
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,660
I don't agree with the genetic test.

788
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,100
There are less than

789
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,370
100 cases in the world.

790
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,440
How can it be so coincidental?

791
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,480
I think the woman is lying.

792
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,630
Besides, the genetic test

793
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,740
costs so much time, energy and money.

794
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,210
If the result

795
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,720
turns to be negative,

796
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,330
our hospital will lose more.

797
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,180
Dr. Li.

798
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,230
As the doctor-in-charge,

799
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,750
don't you know that

800
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,550
science can not

801
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,470
be explained

802
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,220
by coincidence?

803
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,890
Does anyone else

804
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,650
have any idea?

805
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,480
You resident doctors

806
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,870
can also share your ideas.

807
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,510
The rare case with

808
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,860
less than 100 examples in the world,

809
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,030
and cheating and lying

810
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,730
which happen all the time,

811
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,540
I think the latter is more possible.

812
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,600
Come on.

813
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,820
We should not guess

814
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,800
but demonstrate for science.

815
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,480
Any more ideas?

816
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,590
Congrui, how about you?

817
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,480
I…

818
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,900
I think

819
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,100
the rare situation

820
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
is not that trustful

821
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,810
in this case.

822
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,150
This is a good chance

823
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,240
to show

824
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,120
Shengji's capability.

825
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,050
If the result turns out to be a mosaic,

826
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,150
the media

827
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,860
will report it greatly.

828
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,100
The obstetrics and gynecology department's

829
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,020
gene test and antenatal diagnosis

830
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,100
of Shengji will be famous.

831
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,760
If it turns out not,

832
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,060
the baby's DNA

833
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,670
matches

834
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,380
his mother's,

835
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,350
proving that she cheated.

836
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,130
That's good then.

837
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,460
For the hospital's innocence

838
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,750
and Du Di's

839
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,080
innocence,

840
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,300
I've made up my mind.

841
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,300
Let's do it.

842
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,660
Nianbai,

843
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,330
you take charge of it.

844
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,670
Thank you, Director Tian.

845
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,020
That's the situation.

846
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,430
You and Yang Shu

847
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,420
should make a genetic test.

848
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,220
The result will come out in half a month.

849
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,240
I don't want to do it.

850
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,730
This is your mistake.

851
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,670
Stop trying to make excuses.

852
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,190
We never make mistakes.

853
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,540
If you don't do the test,

854
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,370
what should your wife do?

855
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,100
You seem to be suing the hospital,

856
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,210
but haven't your parents

857
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,670
been suspecting her?

858
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,350
I'd rather believe that

859
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,780
this was the hospital's mistake.

860
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,750
If the result

861
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,550
turns out that

862
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,740
it's not the so-called mosaic,

863
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,620
I was definitely cheated.

864
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,650
To assure your parents,

865
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,560
Yang Shu has given up

866
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,140
all the social activity and entertainment

867
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,660
under their supervision.

868
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,660
You don't believe the hospital

869
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,070
or your wife.

870
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,070
Let me ask you,

871
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,700
if you insist on the lawsuit,

872
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,870
how will you take care of your baby

873
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,900
in these years?

874
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,800
Will you raise him?

875
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,720
Why should I

876
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,830
keep other's baby?

877
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,300
What if this is your baby?

878
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,320
I don't believe it.

879
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,010
Your mistrust

880
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,270
has made your wife so painful.

881
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,070
A man should do something

882
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,820
in front of his wife.

883
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:25,970
Otherwise…

884
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,070
Otherwise, you will kill her.

885
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,700
Yang Shu said,

886
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,060
she won't get out of the hospital

887
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,420
with the suspicion,

888
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,780
or her life will be doomed.

889
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,280
If you are a man,

890
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,590
you should make a decision carefully

891
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,340
for your beloved one.

892
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,170
Make a decision

893
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:41,980
based on trust and love.

894
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,510
But I'm afraid.

895
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,350
Being afraid is of no use.

896
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,310
Now you're a father.

897
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,710
Being a superman

898
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,530
in your son's eyes,

899
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,450
or being hated by him,

900
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,770
make a choice.

901
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,420
You haven't gone to the talk show

902
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,420
for a long time, right?

903
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,820
I can't.

904
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,660
I don't want to laugh

905
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,950
or see others laugh.

906
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,570
Has her fever gone down?

907
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,140
Her temperature hasn't been down

908
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,210
in the morning and at the noon.

909
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,680
Infection is

910
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,380
hard to tell.

911
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,290
Even if the antibiotics are right

912
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,060
and with proper quantity,

913
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,990
her immunity

914
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,180
plays an important role.

915
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,580
She refused to eat or drink,

916
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,320
and is sustained by the infusion bottle.

917
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,150
She sleeps

918
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,940
all day.

919
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,010
We can't even wake her up.

920
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,490
Thank you

921
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,020
for clarifying for me

922
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,830
and taking care of Yang Shu.

923
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,390
I did that partly for you,

924
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,980
and partly for myself.

925
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,260
You've lost weight.

926
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,430
Don't maltreat yourself

927
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,450
even though you're worried.

928
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,100
Be healthy,

929
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,840
and you can solve the problems.

930
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,210
You're so confident.

931
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,020
There's nothing that troubles you.

932
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,740
No.

933
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,960
I'm weak.

934
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,460
There're a lot of things I can't solve.

935
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,330
I haven't

936
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,720
told you the truth.

937
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,380
Du Di,

938
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,620
I'm Liu Zhenghua's son.

939
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,720
At first,

940
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,220
I stayed in Shengji's obstetrics and gynecology department

941
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,540
to irritate him.

942
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,870
Shengji obstetrics and gynecology department

943
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,720
was where my mother worked.

944
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,800
She was the head nurse

945
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,890
here years ago.

946
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,630
It was the name

947
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,010
in the medical record you saw.

948
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,300
Bai Qing.

949
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,980
The one who got repetitive infection

950
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,910
and depression.

951
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,620
When I was six,

952
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,820
my mom went missing.

953
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:12,710
My father

954
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,140
sent me to live with my aunt overseas.

955
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,460
They only told me that

956
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,020
my mom was killed in an accident.

957
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,460
I hate my dad.

958
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,590
Though my mom was gone,

959
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,030
how could he

960
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,950
threw me abroad

961
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,940
at such a young age?

962
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,720
He never visited me

963
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,010
except for sending me money.

964
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,780
At first,

965
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,190
I didn't know English at all

966
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,480
when I was in primary school.

967
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,620
I had no friends.

968
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,410
There were only foreigners

969
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,070
in my house apart from my aunt.

970
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,850
I started to fight and act as a bad boy.

971
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,560
I wanted my aunt

972
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,410
to tell my dad

973
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,710
and asked him to take me away.

974
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,220
Even visiting me,

975
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,710
scolding me

976
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,660
or even hitting me was acceptable.

977
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,980
Just let me know

978
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,090
that I had a father.

979
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,170
The doctor who can be promoted

980
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,160
to the director is usually busy.

981
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,430
Besides, does he

982
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,590
have a new family?

983
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,770
For those years,

984
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,790
he has been alone.

985
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,710
People think that

986
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,620
he loves my mother so much.

987
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,790
He even changed my name into

988
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,100
Nianbai.

989
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,820
But I think he's making a show.

990
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,130
Especially when I found out that

991
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
my mom killed herself.

992
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:39,860
Killed herself.

993
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,620
I felt strange that

994
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,220
my mom prepared strawberries

995
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,260
for me the day she went missing,

996
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,410
so how could she abandon me?

997
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,830
I've been investigating

998
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,300
the truth why my mom left.

999
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,410
When I found the medical record,

1000
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,100
I was sure that

1001
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,219
she had depression which developed from

1002
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,389
postnatal depression.

1003
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,510
It's rare.

1004
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,350
She had been struggling with depression

1005
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,270
for six years.

1006
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,159
What did the man

1007
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,770
beside her do

1008
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,440
in the six years?

1009
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,719
He was making operations, writing papers, and getting a promotion.

1010
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
He was the one who did nothing

1011
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,420
while his wife

1012
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:31,530
was suffering.

1013
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,940
I am helping you.

1014
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,820
But I am also

1015
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,980
saving my mother.

1016
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,610
I can't overcome it

1017
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,550
in my mind.

1018
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,940
What should I do?

1019
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,350
Thank you for bringing me here.

1020
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,710
In fact, you can

1021
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,140
ask the nurse to bring him to you.

1022
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,150
They're not sure that

1023
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,380
this is my baby.

1024
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,360
I dare not to.

1025
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,310
Dr. Liu.

1026
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,200
Does this little baby

1027
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,460
have memories?

1028
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,140
Theoretically,

1029
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,130
no.

1030
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,670
He is studying to

1031
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,900
get to know the world.

1032
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,920
If this is my kid,

1033
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,690
I'm so afraid that he would hate me

1034
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,020
for not feeding him

1035
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,230
or holding him.

1036
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,710
His family is here.

1037
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,870
But he has to stay

1038
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,970
in this incubator for a long time.

1039
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,130
Very soon.

1040
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,380
The result will come out soon.

1041
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:17,950
When the result comes out,

1042
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,340
you can make it up to him.

1043
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,760
He won't hate you.

1044
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,590
As his mother,

1045
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,040
I can't do anything for him.

1046
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,190
I'm so useless.

1047
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,290
He is your baby.

1048
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,740
Has the result come out?

1049
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,980
Director Tian asked me to call you.

1050
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,290
The result has come out.

1051
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,290
It's the mosaic.

1052
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,140
You husband indeed

1053
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,320
owns two DNA systems.

1054
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,580
The other one matches.

1055
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,160
This is your kid.

1056
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,300
The hospital didn't make a mistake

1057
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,380
and you didn't cheat.

1058
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,520
Great, Yang Shu.

1059
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,470
You're clean.

1060
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,610
There are fewer than 100 cases worldwide.

1061
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,020
We found one.

1062
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,190
What does it prove?

1063
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,950
It proves

1064
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,610
Shengji's obstetrics and gynecology department's ability.

1065
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,920
Congrats!

1066
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,050
I decide that our department

1067
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
should award Liu Nianbai

1068
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,330
with 800 yuan.

1069
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,110
So cheap.

1070
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,420
However, through this incident,

1071
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,600
I feel that

1072
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,540
we doctors

1073
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,760
should not only do our jobs

1074
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,490
in the hospital,

1075
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,860
but also undertake the important mission of

1076
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,630
scientific popularization.

1077
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,330
So, today we had a meeting,

1078
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,420
asking each department

1079
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,160
to popularize the medical knowledge

1080
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,520
by we-media.

1081
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,540
I thought these were

1082
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,990
not our business.

1083
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,770
But now

1084
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,260
I think it's so important.

1085
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,570
So, our department should

1086
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,900
try something like

1087
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,630
Video Channel,

1088
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,520
Weibo Channel, etc.

1089
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,720
The honor

1090
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,830
like today's news

1091
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,200
should be advertised

1092
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,620
to increase the influence of our

1093
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,210
obstetrics and gynecology department.

1094
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,440
Dr. Huang.

1095
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,460
You take charge of it, OK?

1096
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,670
Why not let the young doctors

1097
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,500
try it?

1098
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,770
Congrui has the affinity.

1099
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,000
Let her try.

1100
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,650
OK.

1101
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,630
It's up to you.

1102
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,650
It was Du Di

1103
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,960
who insisted that the puerpera didn't lie.

1104
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,000
How come

1105
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,160
she isn't awarded?

1106
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,430
Well,

1107
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,760
the morning meeting

1108
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:21,730
is over.

1109
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,490
Dismiss.

1110
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,120
People always say that

1111
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,620
the kids will grow more beautiful.

1112
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,840
Exactly.

1113
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:38,880
Baby.

1114
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,480
You know what?

1115
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,320
When you were born,

1116
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,370
you looked so ugly

1117
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,230
with wrinkles on your face.

1118
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,350
I was so stunned.

1119
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,760
Later,

1120
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,160
he's become more beautiful.

1121
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,150
Dr. Du.

1122
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,650
Sorry.

1123
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,140
We were too narrow-minded

1124
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,190
and wronged you.

1125
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,320
Dr. Liu, thank you.

1126
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,980
You cleared things up.

1127
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,470
Darling,

1128
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,450
apologize.

1129
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,360
Well,

1130
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,520
it's actually

1131
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,080
not our fault, right?

1132
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,720
Who could predict that

1133
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,630
the rare case with less than 100 examples

1134
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,270
worldwide happened to us?

1135
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,430
Stop making excuses, apologies.

1136
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,900
Dr. Du.

1137
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,700
Sorry.

1138
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,390
It's OK.

1139
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,470
It's not my first time to be

1140
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,580
questioned by the patients and their families.

1141
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,500
But,

1142
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,450
you should apologize

1143
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,650
to the baby's mother.

1144
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,310
I...

1145
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:35,960
Sorry.

1146
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,650
You're not the one to apologize.

1147
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,900
Sorry.

1148
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,430
I have to apologize.

1149
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,680
I'm delectated.

1150
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,130
I can't feed the baby.

1151
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,830
I'm so useless.

1152
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,920
No, darling.

1153
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,100
Don't be so stressed.

1154
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,520
We've bought the milk powder, right?

1155
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,910
We can feed our baby milk powder.

1156
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,960
I know

1157
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,900
you were upset these days.

1158
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,670
I'm sorry.

1159
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,990
Sorry.

1160
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,400
Cheer up.

1161
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,430
Where did

1162
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,580
you get these?

1163
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,720
Search "broadcast equipment"

1164
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,530
and these are on sale.

1165
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,520
And Director Huang

1166
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,440
applied for some expenditure.

1167
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,430
We can get these reimbursed.

1168
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,410
Shall we put the skeleton

1169
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,920
as the background

1170
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,300
or the womb specimen?

1171
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,540
I don't think the viewers

1172
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,970
will accept either.

1173
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,740
It's a medical science popularization live streaming.

1174
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
We should put something

1175
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,530
connecting to the hospital.

1176
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,370
How about the transfusion frame?

1177
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,580
No.

1178
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:40,730
I see.

1179
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,170
The film of B-mode ultrasound.

1180
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,570
It's connected to the hospital

1181
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,880
and won't scare the viewers.

1182
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,590
Let me try.

1183
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,220
Good.

1184
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,760
Let's start then.

1185
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,640
What's this?

1186
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,770
It's my speech draft.

1187
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,580
That's what I'm going to say today.

1188
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,810
The speech is themed

1189
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,380
"Don't underestimate ectopic pregnancy".

1190
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,800
Will it be a little like

1191
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,200
reading a report?

1192
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,310
The live streaming will last an hour.

1193
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,660
If I don't write them down,

1194
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,130
I would be speechless

1195
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,030
after two sentences.

1196
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:15,980
Right.

1197
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,270
Let's start.

1198
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,310
Today, I'm going to talk about

1199
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,090
the danger of ectopic pregnancy.

1200
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,950
You haven't introduced yourself.

1201
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,560
Hello, I'm Wu Congrui,

1202
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,160
a resident doctor in Shengji hospital.

1203
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,050
Today, I'm going to

1204
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,460
talk about

1205
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,050
the danger of ectopic pregnancy.

1206
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,470
Ectopic pregnancy,

1207
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,650
as its name suggests,

1208
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,820
means that the embryo is not in the womb.

1209
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,440
Welcome my first fan,

1210
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,590
Flying Feifei.

1211
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,610
Come on, Congrui.

1212
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,480
I'm Li Fei.

1213
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,320
Ectopic pregnancy

1214
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,510
is a familiar acute abdominal
disease in the gynecology department

1215
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,120
and the main reason of pregnant women's death

1216
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,830
in the first trimester of pregnancy.

1217
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,200
If you get vagina irregular blooding

1218
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,940
and stomachache

1219
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,160
after menelipsis…

1220
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,420
How come the live streaming stopped?

1221
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,800
What's wrong?

1222
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,100
Let me ask the customer service.

1223
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,860
Is it the internet malfunction?

1224
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,020
No.

1225
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,050
Hello.

1226
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,910
Oh my god.

1227
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,660
How could you speak out

1228
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,510
the professional terms

1229
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,370
like vagina directly?

1230
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,240
These are sensitive terms.

1231
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,140
Don't you know?

1232
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,540
I'm doing the science popularization of

1233
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,800
gynaecology and obstetrics.

1234
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,260
How could they be sensitive?

1235
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,830
You can't

1236
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,290
read the report anyway.

1237
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,310
You have to tell stories.

1238
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,810
You should replace

1239
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,340
the sensitive terms

1240
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,880
with the euphemistic terms.

1241
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,480
Even it's the science popularization,

1242
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,410
there're kids

1243
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
watching the live streaming.

1244
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,760
No parents want

1245
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,820
their kids

1246
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,440
to watch these.

1247
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,690
You can't win fans in this way.

1248
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1249
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,870
You didn't ask me.

1250
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,930
OK.

1251
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,420
Keep reminding me.
