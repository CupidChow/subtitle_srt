4
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,560
See you, Mom.

5
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,330
See you.

6
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,800
See you.

7
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,860
Lu Sichen.

8
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,470
Can you be polite?

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,870
I went to your parents' meeting no matter how.

10
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,000
Let go.

11
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,630
I'm gonna be late.

12
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,300
I have a few questions for you.

13
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,660
What's happening to your mother?

14
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,170
Why does your dad keep her in the house?

15
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,150
Don't know.

16
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,540
You must know why.

17
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,010
For the sake that I helped you once,

18
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,100
can you get your mom out of the house

19
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,060
for me?

20
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,180
Why would you get her out?

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,470
It must be unsafe for your mom

22
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,450
to be kept at home.

23
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,110
I have to get her out.

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,370
It's of no use. Save your breath.

25
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,920
Lu Sichen.

26
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,710
Do you want to be someone

27
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,780
like your father?

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,710
If you don't,

29
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,890
you should do something, shouldn't you?

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,990
The class will begin.

31
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,230
Drop the act.

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,560
Since when did you become so keen about school?

33
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,660
Let me go. I'm gonna be late!

34
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,240
Can you be a man?

35
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,450
I'll wait for your call!

36
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,030
36.2-degree centigrade.

37
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,090
The fever is gone.

38
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,230
Diabetes

39
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,990
can easily cause infection.

40
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,390
It's a rather

41
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,460
serious one.

42
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,550
At present,

43
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,840
have a light diet.

44
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,220
Let's see how things will change.

45
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,860
Or you can have the cesarean section.

46
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,280
I told you I want to have spontaneous delivery.

47
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,390
Director Huang

48
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,860
told you you may have spontaneous delivery.

49
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,730
But now things

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,820
have changed.

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,840
At this final period of time,

52
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,630
the baby grows bigger.

53
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,490
It's related to

54
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,310
your diabetes.

55
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,620
A baby weighing over 4kg

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,510
at birth

57
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,500
is defined as fetal macrosomia.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,810
Before the labour,

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,579
we will make predictions

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,579
according to uterine height, abdominal girth

61
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,640
and fetal presentation.

62
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,750
We will measure the baby's biparietal diameter,

63
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,890
abdominal diameter and hipbone length

64
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,980
by ultrasound to make predictions.

65
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,820
Director Huang predicted

66
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,750
the baby weighed

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,750
less than 4kg.

68
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,020
So there was a chance.

69
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,150
Now I predict the baby

70
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,540
weighs over 4kg.

71
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,220
You should have a cesarean section.

72
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,540
So it's all your prediction.

73
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,820
It is.

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,149
What are the predicted deviations?

75
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,220
We evaluate by ultrasound.

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,120
We're 90 percent sure.

77
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,860
Firstly,

78
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,670
I want to have a second baby as soon as possible.

79
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,590
A cesarean section won't allow me to recover soon.

80
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,480
Secondly, I've checked the data.

81
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,510
A baby born in spontaneous delivery with extrusion

82
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,830
will have a better

83
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,510
physical coordination.

84
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,390
So,

85
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,980
I'll try spontaneous delivery if possible.

86
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,370
Just take the doctor's advice.

87
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,090
Leave me alone. I know what I'm doing.

88
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,530
There are huge risks

89
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,420
in spontaneous delivery with fetal macrosomia.

90
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,310
The labour stage will last for too long

91
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,860
which may cause the baby's suffocation

92
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,060
and put the puerpera in danger.

93
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:01,910
Possibly,

94
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,900
you'll fail to give birth

95
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,860
and have cesarean section halfway.

96
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,730
Shoulder dystocia is the most dangerous situation.

97
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
It means the baby's head is out

98
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,070
while his shoulders

99
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,230
are stuck

100
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,940
inside your body.

101
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,910
That's when the baby can easily get suffocated.

102
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,410
Shoulder dystocia caused by fetal macrosomia

103
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,160
is of extremely high risk.

104
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,110
I'll give it a try no matter how.

105
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,530
Follow me to pay the fees, please.

106
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,810
Tingting.

107
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,150
You're pregnant

108
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,790
and have gained more weight than before.

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,280
But these aren't great changes compared with

110
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,460
how you looked back in high school.

111
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,570
I told you

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,060
I wasn't from No.14 Middle School.

113
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,500
Have I ever mentioned I was from No.14 Middle School?

114
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,060
I remember

115
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,750
you got

116
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,140
admitted by the best art school.

117
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,250
And you showed up at the party for times.

118
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,010
But then you disappeared.

119
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,530
What happened to you these years?

120
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,150
And your husband...

121
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,220
These are private matters.

122
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,710
It's unnecessary for me to report my life

123
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,190
to a schoolmate I haven't met for years.

124
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,650
And, I'm not in the mood to recall the old days.

125
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,310
You know I've always been

126
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,770
an annoying busybody.

127
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,620
In my opinion,

128
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,659
since you married a husband like him,

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,060
you should accept him

130
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,740
and show some respect,

131
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,170
rather than turning an old schoolmate down

132
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,360
in front of him.

133
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,490
It's not fair to him.

134
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,810
Glad you know

135
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,980
you've been a busybody.

136
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,260
Just do your job as a doctor.

137
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,500
Call me if anything is wrong.

138
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,020
The size of the fetus

139
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,090
is at a critical point.

140
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:27,990
It's possible it's in the limits

141
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,140
when it's born.

142
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,060
It's also possible it's off limits.

143
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,700
So it's hard to judge.

144
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,280
Even if you go to the director,

145
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,020
she would tell you

146
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,190
to respect the guardian's choice.

147
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,500
From your point of view,

148
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,710
cesarean section is the safest way.

149
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,580
But if spontaneous delivery is inevitable,

150
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,010
experienced midwives and doctors will be needed

151
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,250
just in case.

152
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,100
Fine.

153
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,030
If she insists on spontaneous delivery,

154
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,570
it's the only choice for me.

155
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,060
Hey, one more thing.

156
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,220
I think something is wrong

157
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,510
with Director Huang.

158
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,659
What can be wrong with her

159
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,659
when she's staying at home?

160
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,540
I got to the supermarket.

161
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,920
I'll hang up.

162
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,909
I'll need to sort out the data

163
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,930
for Director Tian

164
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,630
after the grocery.

165
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,500
Okay, go ahead.

166
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,190
Okay.

167
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,140
Is the pain before the labour normal?

168
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,160
Yes, the pain is normal.

169
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,820
Du Di.

170
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,260
Director Huang is in trouble.

171
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:14,620
What is it?

172
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,340
Don't know. I haven't found her yet.

173
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,320
What are you doing

174
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,220
in the middle of the night

175
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,780
instead of sleeping?

176
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,310
I'm giving answers online.

177
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,020
Sister.

178
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,110
What answers?

179
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,740
You see.

180
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,300
I registered an account

181
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,460
as an online doctor.

182
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,790
When I'm not on duty,

183
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,220
I can give consultations online.

184
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,340
I can make some extra money in this way.

185
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,700
Drop it.

186
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,620
You work as hard as an ox.

187
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,100
And you don't sleep when you're off duty.

188
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,660
You think you are made of iron?

189
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,420
Sister, I am not made of iron.

190
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,640
I am a human. If I'm a human,

191
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,980
I need to earn a living.

192
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,770
I need to date someone and get married.

193
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,660
Then I'll need money.

194
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,580
If I solemnly live on my wages,

195
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,290
when

196
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,540
can I give a good life

197
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,470
to the ones

198
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,540
I cherish?

199
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,160
So I have to earn some extra money.

200
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,450
Had you known learning medicine is arduous,

201
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,140
you should have learned something else

202
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,740
given your excellent grades.

203
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,220
Except for eight years at college,

204
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,070
then

205
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,630
you work with low wages.

206
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,930
That thing... Residency training,

207
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,070
which cost you three years, right?

208
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,980
Then you work as a chief resident for a year.

209
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,890
It's even not the end.

210
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,550
You will have to get promoted step by step.

211
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,990
The ones at your age

212
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,150
would be a manager

213
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,610
in other sections.

214
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,980
Yet you're only a doctor.

215
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,660
Who do you hear it from?

216
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,590
You know a lot about it.

217
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,830
I heard the nagging

218
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,670
from those residents

219
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,980
in the hospital.

220
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,090
I can even recite it.

221
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,900
Even you can recite the nagging.

222
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,390
Seems that those residents

223
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,580
are complaining constantly.

224
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,970
Tell me about it.

225
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,900
Junxiao.

226
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,350
If you are really in need of money,

227
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,140
I have thousands of bucks.

228
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,290
Take it.

229
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,570
Sister, I'm good.

230
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,250
I just want to earn some money,

231
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,110
just in case.

232
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,710
Just stop it.

233
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,800
You won't be rich in a single day.

234
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,420
You have an early shift tomorrow. Go to bed.

235
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,260
I got it. Okay.

236
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,430
And you know what?

237
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,660
Even if you quit sleeping every day,

238
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,510
you won't be

239
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
a millionaire.

240
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,420
Okay, I got it.

241
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,640
You go to sleep. I got it.

242
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,950
Go back to sleep.

243
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,420
Hey.

244
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,730
You made me sober now.

245
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,090
What about me making you some food?

246
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,700
It's not necessary.

247
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,770
Go to sleep.

248
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,580
Don't stay up!

249
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,940
Go now.

250
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,340
When can I earn the money

251
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,610
for the proposal ring?

252
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,630
Make way! Make way!

253
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,800
Stop whining.

254
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,620
I need to get some sleep.

255
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,980
Everyone in the ward is in pain.

256
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,060
Yet you're the only one whining. How spoiled.

257
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,610
Hey, mute.

258
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,990
Get a doctor.

259
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,990
Is she giving birth?

260
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,050
Or just get her to the delivery room.

261
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,870
What's your attitude?

262
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,150
Don't mind my attitude.

263
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,740
You're too noisy.

264
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,980
Don't let your noise get my wife

265
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,850
into trouble.

266
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,120
Go now!

267
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,590
What is it?

268
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,620
It hurts.

269
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,660
The nurse told me.

270
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,640
She had uterine contractions in daytime.

271
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,660
The cervical dilation is less than 2cm wide.

272
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,860
The pain is normal.

273
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,950
Stay calm and write it down.

274
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,290
It hurts badly.

275
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,680
This is her first pregnancy.

276
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,200
It may be normal pain.

277
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,090
No wonder it hurts so badly.

278
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,810
This is irregular contraction.

279
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,420
Cervix uteri is in a bad condition.

280
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,330
We have to give you dolantin.

281
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,460
Wait here for me.

282
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,000
I need to get a superior doctor.

283
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,700
You need to keep an eye here.

284
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,290
The patient is inexperienced in her first pregnancy,

285
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,000
mistaking it for normal pain.

286
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:47,900
The fact is that this is

287
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,980
hypertonic uterine inertia.

288
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,090
Her guardian...

289
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,510
It's not convenient to communicate with him.

290
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,830
What's hypertonic uterine inertia?

291
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,460
In labour, the uterus muscle

292
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,980
creates contractions

293
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,910
with patterns, frequencies

294
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,800
and accumulating scales.

295
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,590
Without patterns,

296
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,510
or irregular frequencies and scales,

297
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,980
the uterus muscle

298
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,090
will be in tense.

299
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,810
Pressure in uterine cavity

300
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,710
and tension in uterus

301
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,630
will

302
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,510
remain intensive.

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,440
If lucky, it'll only affect the labour stage

304
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,340
and cervical dilation.

305
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,010
If unlucky, it will cause fetal distress

306
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,300
leading to dangers,

307
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,820
even rupture of uterus.

308
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,900
But don't worry about it.

309
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,800
Dr. Wu will keep an eye

310
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,450
here.

311
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,670
I'll be on call.

312
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,490
If the pain still goes on an hour later,

313
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,690
we'll handle it.

314
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,190
Mom.

315
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,560
What do you want to eat after waking up?

316
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,180
I've been away from you

317
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,060
for years.

318
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,110
I don't even know

319
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,580
what you like to eat now.

320
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,300
When I was a child,

321
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,340
you cooked chicken.

322
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,140
One chicken leg for me

323
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,490
and the other one for my dad.

324
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,190
I asked you,

325
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,350
"Why don't you have one?"

326
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,610
You told me you didn't like it.

327
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,660
Chicken necks and heads,

328
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,340
fish heads and tails

329
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,900
were all eaten by you.

330
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,040
I even told my fellows

331
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,080
"It's strange of my mom.

332
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,380
She likes eating nothing

333
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,540
but the parts with little meat and many bones."

334
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,490
Now when I think of it,

335
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,320
I find myself a fool.

336
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,180
Go get some rest.

337
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,530
These days,

338
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,650
I heard your words for your mother.

339
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,090
I heard

340
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,650
what your mother did for you.

341
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,170
It only occurred to me

342
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,060
it's how it feels

343
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,980
to have a mother.

344
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,890
I don't want to know

345
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,730
how it feels without a mother.

346
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,920
I don't want you to know, either.

347
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,950
Then don't urge me to leave.

348
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,710
We're doctors.

349
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,780
We all know

350
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,470
to wake up a vegetable

351
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,270
doesn't depend on

352
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,640
companions day and night.

353
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,230
It's the result

354
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,300
of medical care, time

355
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,480
and the families' perseverance.

356
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,100
It may take you

357
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,360
a long, long time

358
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,440
to wait for your mother to wake up.

359
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,700
Before that day comes,

360
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,390
can you just take good care of yourself?

361
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,440
I dare not leave.

362
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,020
I'm afraid that once I leave,

363
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,360
she'll be gone, too.

364
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,620
Does it still hurt?

365
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,540
Does it hurt even worse?

366
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,750
Say something.

367
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,960
Can she stop whining?

368
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,089
I feel like giving birth here.

369
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,220
Hon, don't worry.

370
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,060
I'll check it.

371
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,730
Get a doctor!

372
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,800
She passed out because of the pain.

373
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,060
Ring the bell.

374
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,040
The bell for emergency.

375
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,600
What's happening now?

376
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,520
Obvious abdominal bloating.

377
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,430
High uterus tension.

378
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,070
No relaxation.

379
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,480
Consider threatened rupture of uterus.

380
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,640
It's dangerous without a cesarean section.

381
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,580
Fine.

382
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,730
She has been torn about spontaneous delivery.

383
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,180
God doesn't give a chance.

384
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,520
Guardians wait outside.

385
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,540
Don't worry.

386
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,150
4.22kg.

387
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,590
Yes!

388
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,300
A right prediction makes you thrilled?

389
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,890
It's not because of the right prediction.

390
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,140
Mainly because it's hard

391
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,660
to make precise predictions in medicine.

392
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,990
If the prediction

393
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,950
is almost the same as the fact,

394
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,220
it'll be easy to explain to the guardians.

395
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,060
Right.

396
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,750
Especially when it's a troublesome patient.

397
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,800
Congratulations, you're a mother now.

398
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,100
It's a boy.

399
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,490
4.22kg.

400
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,130
His voice is loud.

401
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,090
Give him a kiss.

402
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,900
I have my own baby.

403
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,120
The big eyes

404
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,170
resemble his father's.

405
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,260
So does his voice.

406
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,930
Dr. Wu, thank you.

407
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,130
It's alright.

408
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,640
This is our duty.

409
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,430
I failed to

410
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,660
notice her worse conditions.

411
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,290
And I failed to describe her conditions.

412
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,910
I feel so guilty and scared.

413
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,040
Even if you hadn't noticed it,

414
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,280
I would have come to the ward.

415
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,260
This is Shengji. She's in safe hands.

416
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,900
I am a burden to her.

417
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,340
You're husband and wife.

418
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,780
No one is a burden.

419
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,780
Hopefully,

420
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,350
she can face your conditions bravely in the future.

421
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,620
It's not the case, doctor.

422
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,180
It's not her who can't face it,

423
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,590
but me.

424
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,300
I used to be a tenor.

425
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,270
My vocal cord was ill and removed.

426
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,630
I lived in depression for a long time

427
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,720
and refused to meet people.

428
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
She cut ties with all of her old friends

429
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,500
in order

430
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,500
not to make me feel bad.

431
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,630
I feel sorry for it.

432
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:16,990
Hello?

433
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,020
Wait there for me. I'll be right there.

434
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,890
Du Di.

435
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,340
I'll head to Director Huang's place.

436
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,250
I lost contact with her for days.

437
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,320
I couldn't reach her

438
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,400
no matter how hard I tried.

439
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,740
I doubt

440
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,870
she is detained at home

441
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,740
by her husband.

442
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,030
Her son

443
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,760
called me just now,

444
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,270
saying he'll open the door and let me hurry.

445
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,500
I'll go with you.

446
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,290
Go.

447
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,820
How is everything going?

448
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,090
You wait here for me.

449
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,450
I'll get my mom out.

450
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,010
Mom, where is my math exercise book?

451
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,320
Where did you put it?

452
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,180
What book?

453
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,670
Math exercise book.

454
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,810
Let me think.

455
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
Come and have a look.

456
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,980
Go now!

457
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,390
Who are you people?

458
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,500
What's happening here? What are you doing?

459
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,400
Hurry. Go now.

460
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,630
You go first. I'll cover you up.

461
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,280
What cover up? Stand behind me.

462
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,480
You naughty boy.

463
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,490
What's your prank

464
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,390
in the middle of the night?

465
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,610
Your mother is in poor health.

466
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,550
Don't annoy her.

467
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,300
Go get her back.

468
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,850
Go with your mother. Hurry.

469
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,280
Stop the prank.

470
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,900
Don't be fooled by a kid

471
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,730
in the middle of the night.

472
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,170
I don't think he's fooling me.

473
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,050
He is good at lying.

474
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,820
Congrui went to his school for parents' meeting

475
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,970
on behalf of Yunling.

476
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,300
He was the last one in the test again.

477
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,420
He is trying to seek revenge.

478
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,360
No matter what,

479
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,790
have Director Huang tested

480
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,740
in the hospital.

481
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,640
Don't go too far.

482
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,040
Leave my wife

483
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,280
alone.

484
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,250
You want to pick up a fight?

485
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,450
Don't blame me then.

486
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,210
Are you playing the fool?

487
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,460
Why are you back?

488
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,130
I'm fetching my mom's ID card.

489
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,430
The pills worked.

490
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,580
What pills?

491
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,670
Don't know.

492
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,880
I grab some of every kind

493
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,820
of the pills my mom is taking

494
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,030
and put them in his beer.

495
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,380
Fine, I have to call an ambulance for you.

496
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,010
Director Tian.

497
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,810
Director Huang didn't recognize me.

498
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,940
Don't panic. Let me check.

499
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,250
What pills did he take?

500
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,370
These.

501
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,050
They are taken from her house.

502
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,060
It's mainly

503
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,980
because of the sleeping pills.

504
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,640
And most of them

505
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,610
are antidepressant and antianxiety.

506
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,700
Okay. I got it.

507
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,540
Thanks.

508
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,950
Hello?

509
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,790
How's it going on?

510
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:06,930
What?

511
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,350
The ER?

512
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,920
What are the pills?

513
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,710
Okay, I know.

514
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,980
Director Tian.

515
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,690
According to Du Di, Director Huang took

516
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,890
too much psychotropic medication

517
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,030
so she's mumbled now.

518
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,480
Psychotropic medication?

519
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,540
How is that possible?

520
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,490
Du Di said

521
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,710
she'd bring the bottles here.

522
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,390
Do we need to

523
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,400
ask for a group consultation

524
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,360
with physicians and psychiatrists?

525
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,030
I'll see

526
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,140
what pills she took exactly.

527
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,140
I want you to do me a favor.

528
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,040
Sure.

529
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,510
Something must be going on with Director Huang

530
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,000
during her vacation.

531
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,250
I'm really

532
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,000
suspicious of her husband.

533
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,540
There's definitely something wrong with him.

534
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,570
Her husband

535
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
doesn't let anyone near her.

536
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,420
Would you please

537
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,010
inform the entire department

538
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,120
to protect Director Huang

539
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,950
and not to let her husband get near her?

540
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,380
Congrui,

541
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,130
that's only your guess

542
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,750
and is groundless.

543
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,180
According to our hospital regulations,

544
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,650
without a proper reason,

545
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,720
we can't prohibit

546
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,030
family visits.

547
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,120
And Direct Huang

548
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,020
is about to go into labor.

549
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,710
Once anesthesia and surgery are required,

550
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,700
her family should be there

551
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,500
and sign for confirmation.

552
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,100
But Director Huang was healthy

553
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,200
when she left for vacation,

554
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,180
now she's back like this.

555
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,020
There must be

556
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,770
something going on.

557
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,100
I'll inform the entire department

558
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,100
that without me

559
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,020
and without my permission,

560
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,280
no one can take Director Huang

561
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,070
out of the hospital.

562
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,700
Okay.

563
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,470
Be careful.

564
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,600
It's a tough night and I'm starving.

565
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,930
Let's eat.

566
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,500
Have some steamed stuffed buns and noodles.

567
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,100
What?

568
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,500
Don't you like these?

569
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,020
I'm worried about my mom.

570
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,030
I'm also worried about my dad.

571
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,590
Are you worried about your dad?

572
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,970
You little brat,

573
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,740
how did you get the idea

574
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,730
to drug him?

575
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,500
I was afraid to wake him up.

576
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,420
I couldn't fight him.

577
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,930
Thankfully,

578
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,510
if he didn't faint,

579
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,730
I probably couldn't stop him.

580
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,530
I got to go.

581
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,030
I have to go to school.

582
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,600
I could ask for a leave of absence for you.

583
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,680
I won't take a leave.

584
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,710
I trust you

585
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,780
to take care of my mom.

586
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,950
Since when did you start

587
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,540
to love school?

588
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,880
Since my dad

589
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,870
locked my mom up.

590
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,220
If I don't study well,

591
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,780
how could I fight my dad in the future?

592
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,950
What else did he do?

593
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,160
You ask him yourself.

594
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,440
I got to go.

595
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,260
You're awake.

596
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,530
How are you feeling? Do you want some water?

597
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,640
Just take a little, slowly.

598
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,240
Have I given birth?

599
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,860
Not yet.

600
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,600
I didn't have contractions.

601
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,820
But why am I in the hospital?

602
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,100
Don't you remember

603
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,260
what happened last night?

604
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,830
No.

605
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,130
I've been feeling drowsy lately.

606
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,150
Tell me

607
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:22,880
do you remember

608
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,810
whether you took some meds

609
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,410
and what the dose was?

610
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,800
I think I did,

611
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,570
but I don't remember what I took.

612
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,770
As for the dose,

613
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,490
I think I took several meds.

614
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,390
You took the meds

615
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,050
without knowing what they were.

616
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,820
Director Huang, you're a doctor.

617
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,440
I really can't remember.

618
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,050
Then do you remember

619
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,070
what happened

620
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,320
during your vacation?

621
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,410
Tell me everything

622
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,590
you can remember.

623
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,340
Congrui,

624
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,650
Lu Yu hasn't been doing well

625
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,110
in his career in the last few years.

626
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,190
In the law firm,

627
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,470
those who joined the firm with him

628
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,010
have all become partners.

629
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,360
Only he

630
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,460
has not yet been promoted.

631
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,860
Then what?

632
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,440
Then I kept getting promoted.

633
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,550
Every time you came to my house,

634
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,780
and praised me for being so capable,

635
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,220
getting promoted so quickly,

636
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,490
and having set many records

637
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
in Shengji's Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

638
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,530
Hearing that,

639
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,460
Lu Yu felt bad.

640
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,640
So what?

641
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,220
So,

642
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,190
he would hit me when he was in a bad mood.

643
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,680
I just knew

644
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,720
those bruises on you

645
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,910
were not that simple.

646
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,820
He did those to you,

647
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,000
right?

648
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,420
On the one hand,

649
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,050
I thought

650
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,650
that would be only temporary.

651
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,600
As long as he comes through

652
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
and his career goes well,

653
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,720
he would change.

654
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,200
On the other hand,

655
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,900
I really hope

656
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,580
that my child could grow up

657
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,840
in a healthy environment.

658
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,770
So, I tried to put up with him.

659
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,590
But Lu Sichen

660
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,700
knows about his domestic violence!

661
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:52,900
Yes.

662
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,780
Every time he did it,

663
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,530
I put up with it and tried not to make sounds.

664
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,550
And the door was closed every time.

665
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,110
But I really don't know

666
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,690
how he found it out.

667
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,280
But last time,

668
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,160
Sichen was taken into the police station.

669
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,690
Then I knew

670
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,490
I could no longer keep silent.

671
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,520
After returning home,

672
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,610
I told him that I would divorce him.

673
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,450
Then he said

674
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,180
that I had depression

675
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,300
and forced me

676
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,630
to take many different meds.

677
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,630
And then

678
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,300
he forced me to stay at home.

679
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,170
He looks mild mannered,

680
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,670
but he's actually so violent and brutal.

681
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,510
I'm going to expose him.

682
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,180
I won't spare him.

683
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,380
Director Huang,

684
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,600
I'll surely

685
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,460
keep you and your child safe.

686
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,070
Congrui,

687
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,640
you help me send my child

688
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,820
to his grandparents.

689
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm here now and I don't know

690
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,680
what his father would do to him.

691
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,580
I'll send him there this afternoon.

692
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,820
I assure you.

693
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,920
Dudu, you have a fever.

694
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:33,870
I'm fine.

695
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,130
You never say uncle.

696
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,790
You must rest today.

697
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,520
You look so thin but are actually muscular.

698
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,990
Why do you do so much exercise?

699
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,530
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

700
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,110
No.

701
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,250
I must seize this opportunity

702
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,710
to save the beauty.

703
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,570
I can do it.

704
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,820
How are you feeling? Does the cut still hurt?

705
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,390
The anesthesia has worn off.

706
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,590
It still hurts when I move.

707
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,980
But it's really amazing.

708
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,830
As long as I see the baby,

709
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,900
I wouldn't feel it.

710
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,490
Many mothers feel the same.

711
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,290
When you ask them why they give birth again,

712
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,330
they would say

713
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,410
they've forgotten

714
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,180
how much it hurt.

715
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,800
Thank you, Clever Bean.

716
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,240
You still remember my nickname

717
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,070
at senior high school.

718
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,050
How could I forget the nickname I gave you?

719
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,240
It turns out to be you.

720
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,690
I wondered for three years,

721
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,960
but no one told me who started to call me that.

722
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,620
When we were in high school,

723
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,530
you were garrulous and talkative.

724
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,990
You were also short and clever,

725
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,290
just like a bean.

726
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,860
You were really active.

727
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,180
You talked the most

728
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,300
in class.

729
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,350
But you always

730
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,270
took the first place in exams.

731
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,170
You're just like a clever bean.

732
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,700
Okay.

733
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,030
Fortunately, I grew taller.

734
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,240
My husband told me yesterday

735
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,410
that he wants to invite our friends to dinner

736
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,260
when the baby is one month old.

737
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,300
Congrui, he's finally come through.

738
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I'm so glad.

739
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,220
Seeing you

740
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,140
love and support each other,

741
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,330
I'm really touched.

742
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,460
Well, I don't know how to describe it.

743
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,070
But when the one you love

744
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,230
can't come round,

745
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,410
you need to keep him accompany without complaint

746
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,940
and believe that one day

747
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,370
he would do the same to you.

748
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,470
This is love, right?

749
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:36,920
Right.

750
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,010
What are you doing here? Where's Du Di?

751
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,340
I'm taking over her shift. She's sick.

752
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,320
I sent her back to rest.

753
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,300
Sick?

754
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,880
Has she taken medicine? Is it serious?

755
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,750
Don't worry. She's just too tired and has a fever.

756
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,500
But she took the meds.

757
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,940
She will be fine after a few days' rest.

758
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,710
She's been tired

759
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,010
because of taking care of her mother.

760
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,220
Yesterday,

761
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,500
she went to save Director Huang with me.

762
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,590
She must be very tired.

763
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,670
It's a good thing.

764
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,429
At least she could have a good rest.

765
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,130
How is Director Huang doing?

766
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,800
She has sobered up a little.

767
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,810
I asked Li Fei to watch over her now

768
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,020
and not let her husband get near her.

769
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,480
It's really unbelievable.

770
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,980
Her husband is such a jerk.

771
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,960
He should work hard

772
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:23,870
for his career.

773
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,179
Why does he take it out on his wife?

774
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,100
I'll take care of Director Huang.

775
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,790
I'll also take care of Du Di

776
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,610
together with you.

777
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,260
I wish they both are well.

778
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,460
Are you reconciled?

779
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,810
Not yet.

780
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,860
She might be

781
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,020
still angry with me.

782
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,670
But no matter what she does to me

783
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,320
and what she thinks of me,

784
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,210
I would be there for her,

785
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,790
just like she was there for me

786
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,370
when I felt

787
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,480
the worst.

788
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,969
She is actually no longer angry with you.

789
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,670
Otherwise, she wouldn't

790
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,370
follow you to see Director Huang.

791
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,340
Du Di is sick.

792
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,380
Today, let me

793
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,330
take care of her mom with you.

794
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,100
That's good.

795
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,790
Today,

796
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,840
it's time to clean her mom's body.

797
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,260
It's inconvenient for me to do it.

798
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,820
Do you know that her mother

799
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,420
has been transferred to the SCU?

800
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,370
Yes.

801
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,580
I'm going out

802
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,480
to see Director Tian.

803
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,560
Why do you want to see him?

804
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,480
Negotiation.

805
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,730
[Director's Office]

806
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,340
Since you're already here,

807
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,270
don't you come in to have a cup of tea?

808
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,110
Director Tian,

809
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,380
thank you, but no tea for now.

810
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,950
What are you here for?

811
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,300
Well…

812
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,980
Well…

813
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,190
You have five minutes.

814
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,630
I'm going to a meeting.

815
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,030
Director Tian, here is the thing.

816
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,620
This time

817
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,780
at the national O.B. skill competition

818
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,840
I took the first place

819
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,770
and Du Di took the second.

820
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,070
But there is only one chief resident vacancy.

821
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,980
In principle, it should be for me.

822
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,510
Right?

823
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,150
But I hope you can promote

824
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,070
the two of us to chief resident.

825
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,660
Otherwise, I would resign too.

826
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,830
Then you would lose

827
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,500
both the first and the second.

828
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,510
I don't think

829
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,450
the superiors want this to happen.

830
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,370
Am I right?

831
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,310
Why don't you learn something good from Du Di

832
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,570
instead of threatening others?

833
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,260
No, no, no.

834
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,760
This is not a threat.

835
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,500
I'm just

836
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,740
suggesting a possibility

837
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,180
and humbly discussing it with you.

838
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,090
Humbly? Where do you look humble?

839
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,640
I've been wearing an ingratiating smile.

840
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,630
Really humbly.

841
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,850
Don't bother.

842
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,070
I'll strive for it with the superiors.

843
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,950
Du Di is now in a low mood.

844
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,060
As her close friend,

845
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,300
you need to help her cheer up.

846
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,430
If she keeps being so down,

847
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,660
it would affect

848
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,390
the final-stage assessment and work.

849
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:41,860
Understand?

850
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,590
Understood.

851
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,430
How did I

852
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,240
turn a threat into ingratiation?

853
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,180
Senior,

854
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,700
I'm really sorry.

855
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,570
I said

856
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,030
I'd like to introduce my sister to you.

857
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,650
But I have to go back on my word.

858
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,170
She likes someone else.

859
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,980
It's okay.

860
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,310
Forced love doesn't last.

861
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:08,830
Right?

862
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,000
Senior,

863
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
I have a low income now.

864
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,250
I can't even afford a ring

865
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,730
for my girlfriend.

866
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,610
If something happens

867
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,900
to my family,

868
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,020
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to hold on.

869
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,100
You're too honest.

870
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,550
You should talk more about it

871
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,890
with your seniors like me.

872
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,180
Senior.

873
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,220
It's been not long since I graduated.

874
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,980
I only have a fixed salary

875
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,700
and no other ways to make money.

876
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,500
In your department,

877
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,990
there're a lot of opportunities.

878
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,560
I have a friend

879
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,450
who runs

880
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,640
a high-end confinement center.

881
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,480
For introducing one client to him,

882
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,060
you could get ten thousand as commission.

883
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,720
Ten thousand?

884
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,450
Is it a licensed

885
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,550
confinement center?

886
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,590
I said you're too honest.

887
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:56,980
You can rest assured

888
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,200
that it's absolutely licensed

889
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,280
and absolutely reasonable and legal.

890
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:09,960
There're so many.

891
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,430
These were all given

892
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,500
to my boss.

893
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,760
His wife doesn't like these

894
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,040
and gave these to me.

895
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,780
Look at this.

896
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,740
I once thought

897
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,020
those dumped in the hospital

898
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,450
were already too much.

899
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,870
These are all good stuff.

900
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,580
They just have too much money.

901
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,850
I'm leaving then.

902
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,350
Drive carefully.

903
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,240
Bye-bye.

904
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,070
Bye-bye.

905
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,750
Sister,

906
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,230
what are you doing here?

907
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,420
Junxiao, you're here right on time.

908
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,780
Just help me bring these upstairs.

909
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,770
What are these?

910
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,370
Good stuff.

911
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,300
What have you been doing these days?

912
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,530
Why do you still go out

913
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,680
during an hour and a half lunch break?

914
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,120
Someone just asked me out

915
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,140
for a favor.

916
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,030
This…

917
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,310
He proposed to me yesterday.

918
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,960
I said yes. Are you happy for me?

919
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,510
I'll finally

920
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,920
start a family.

921
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,920
Do you still

922
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,100
disapprove of us?

923
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,660
No. I'm thinking about

924
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,750
preparing a good dowry for you.

925
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,440
Hello.

926
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,570
Qin Yingying?

927
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,130
Hello.

928
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,570
I'm your bedside clinician.

929
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,610
My name is Li Junxiao.

930
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,590
If you have any questions,

931
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,100
please feel free

932
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,810
to ask me.

933
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,420
Thank you, Dr. Li.

934
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,100
That's my job.

935
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,210
Honey!

936
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:39,690
What's up?

937
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,410
The baby just kicked me.

938
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,720
Just feel it.

939
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,450
Be good. Don't kick your mommy.

940
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,110
Have you found a confinement center yet?

941
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,980
Dr. Li,

942
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,540
that's the problem.

943
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,050
My Libra wife

944
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,070
has visited

945
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,780
a dozen of confinement centers.

946
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,040
But she complained that

947
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,340
they're either too far or too poor in service.

948
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,110
We finally found one

949
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,260
that is good in all aspects,

950
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,310
but her close friend

951
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,930
complained about it before.

952
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,290
But now,

953
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,840
all have been booked.

954
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,820
We have to

955
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,660
go home for confinement.

956
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,470
I've suffered a lot to have the second baby.

957
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,240
I just want to stay

958
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,100
in a comfortable confinement center.

959
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,780
What?

960
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,540
Can't I?

961
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,710
Honey, honey. Take it easy.

962
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,710
What about this?

963
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,880
While you're hospitalized,

964
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,550
I'll look for some more.

965
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,580
There is a good one.

966
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,980
One of my patients

967
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,870
is staying there.

968
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,780
She said it's really comfortable there.

969
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,340
They've been open for only a few months,

970
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,580
so they're having discounts now.

971
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,610
Then…

972
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,490
Really?

973
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,030
Dr. Li,

974
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,060
do you have the contact?

975
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,660
I can send you some information about it.

976
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,970
Come on.

977
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,110
-Friend him on WeChat.
-Okay, okay.

978
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:44,930
It's really great.

979
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,810
We've been looking for a confinement center

980
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,070
for a long time.

981
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,700
I've sent you that.

982
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,310
They signed the contract so quickly.

983
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,100
They are so ostentatious.

984
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,500
At this rate,

985
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,240
I would be able to save money soon.

986
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,300
Head Nurse, who are you looking for?

987
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,160
I heard that you introduced

988
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,430
a confinement center for No.18 Bed.

989
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,060
Yes.

990
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,140
They said they hadn't found a satisfied one

991
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,730
and my friend just opened one.

992
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
So, I recommend them there.

993
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,580
Have a seat.

994
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,470
I'm okay.

995
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,410
In Shengji Hospital,

996
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,440
some doctors are desiring to

997
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,540
become an academician or specialist,

998
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,660
some are eager to

999
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,020
become a leading specialist,

1000
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,330
while some others are working hard

1001
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,760
for a higher reputation and salary.

1002
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,870
Of course,

1003
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,700
there're some engaging in social relations

1004
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,500
and introducing patients

1005
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,060
as a scalper.

1006
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,650
Which kind of doctor do you think you will be?

1007
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,950
I don't know yet.

1008
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,220
Okay, then there is still hope for you.

1009
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,710
Let me tell you this.

1010
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,420
As a doctor,

1011
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,110
once you earn an off-the-books income,

1012
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,510
there would be no return.

1013
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,910
Superficially,

1014
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,780
it can help you

1015
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,780
ease your financial burden.

1016
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,190
But in the long run,

1017
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,820
you would be restrained by others.

1018
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:06,660
For instance,

1019
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,960
the one who gave you money today

1020
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,340
is very likely to become

1021
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
someone who can control you.

1022
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,340
I've been working as a nurse for decades

1023
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,170
and have seen many such cases.

1024
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,320
I can't say that

1025
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,070
there're no such doctors in Shengji.

1026
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,910
But I still want to ask you the same question.

1027
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,240
What kind of doctors

1028
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,390
do you want to be in the future?

1029
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,130
If you still want to be

1030
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,270
a specialist,

1031
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,580
then don't do it again.

1032
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,500
I don't want this to happen again.

1033
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,550
If Director Tian finds out

1034
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,120
that this happens under my nose,

1035
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,460
I would feel embarrassed too.

1036
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,460
Do you agree?

1037
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,420
Yes, you're right.

1038
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,540
It won't happen again.

1039
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,670
Okay. I'm leaving then.

1040
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,220
Head Nurse,

1041
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,740
can you tell me

1042
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,060
how did you know about it?

1043
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,150
You only focused on

1044
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,620
introducing her to the confinement center.

1045
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,040
Why didn't you ask whether she's

1046
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,500
my niece?

1047
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,660
My niece's husband asked me

1048
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,160
to thank you on their behalf.
