look, he's smiling.

6
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,620
Look.

7
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,060
Great. Now we are stuck in traffic.

8
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,980
Everybody goes out on the weekend.

9
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,280
Why are you so calm about it?

10
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,210
I have to. What else can I do?

11
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,540
I already warned you

12
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,389
when you suggested

13
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,300
that we take a road trip nearby.

14
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,060
But you wouldn't listen.

15
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,180
So you are prepared for this.

16
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
I wanted to take you out

17
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,380
to relax a bit.

18
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,060
And now all we get to see

19
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,490
is cars on the highway.

20
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,860
Dr. Liu.

We're waiting for you.

Where are you now?

25
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,050
I'm afraid we have to postpone.

26
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,690
I'm stuck on the highway.

27
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,460
It's okay.

28
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,140
I can start the streaming

30
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:09,930
Just tell me

31
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,250
when you're almost here.

32
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:11,980

Okay.

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,710
We need to see the heart.

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,640
Dear.

38
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,730
Are they stuck

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,550
on the highway now?

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,880
Yeah.

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,210
Thankfully,

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,360
the guest house he booked

43
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,270
is not far from here.

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,329
Otherwise,

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,040
he can never make it today.

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,250
You reminded me.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,410
I have to call the guest house owner

48
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,550
and see if everything is ready.

49
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,550
Don't bother.

50
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,740
I already did.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,960
It's all ready.

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,280

54
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,520
Tell me.

55
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,650
Do you think I should ask Director Tian

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,040
about my reinstatement?

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,600
What were you thinking?

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,930
Nothing.

59
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,480
Don't think about work when you are out to have fun.

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,880
The most important thing now

61
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,320
is to completely relax.

62
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Enjoy your life.

63
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,170

What is it?

71
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,310
You are the vice president now?

72
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,210
That's probably not happening now.

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,170
But there is something

74
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
that made me happy.

What is it?

76

I just went to the president's office.

77

Du Di's dad withdrew his complaint

against her.

That's so good.

He's still her dad.

83
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,909
Yeah.

At least he did a good thing this time.

Yeah.

No.

Quit sniffling.

Let's go.

134
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,990
Where is it?

135
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,480
Over there.

136
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,680
How is she?

137
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,330
How many weeks pregnant?

138
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,290
Any complications?

139
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,860
36 weeks.

140
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,620
No illness.

141
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,590
We wanted to go to our hometown

142
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,310
to have the baby.

143
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,880
But she started to feel pain on the way.

144
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,870
She's having outflow now.

145
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,750
How do you feel now?

146
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,670
Can you hear me?

147
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,710
Doctor. Please save my baby.

148
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,430
Relax.

149
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,390
I'll put down your seat first.

150
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,440
Find something

151
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,150
to put under her bottom.

152
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:47,760
Okay.

153
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,150
When your bottom is high up,

154
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,550
there will be less outflow.

155
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,520
Don't worry.

156
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,600
She's having a baby.

157
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,150
She's delivering now.

158
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,350
Stuck in traffic here.

159
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,560
She's having it now?

160
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,110
Heave.

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,750
Easy, easy.

162
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,950
It's okay.

163
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,320
It's gonna be okay, baby.

164
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,830
Keep it as high as possible.

165
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,190
Okay.

166
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,920
Easy.

167
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,710
Did you call an ambulance?

168
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:06,780
I did.

169
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,040
But look at the traffic.

170
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,760
I don't know

171
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,400
when they'll be here.

172
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,710
Do you know the fetus's position?

173
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,030
We did an ultrasound last week.

174
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,190
They said the head is up.

175
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,510
Breech position.

Doctor.

192
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,590
How is she?

193
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,750
She has a cord prolapse.

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,150
Really?

195
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:56,990
You…

196
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,070
What does it mean?

197
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,670
Cord prolapse

198
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:00,950
is a childbirth complication

199
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,230
that's highly fatal to the fetus.

200
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,550
Because cord prolapse

201
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,590
causes pressure,

202
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,920
and the blood flow

203
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,030
of the cord

204
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,040
can be blocked.

205
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,630
The lack of oxygen for the fetus

206
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,180
will cause

207
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,950
serious fetal distress.

208
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,440
In more serious cases,

209
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,800
the fetus can die from asphyxia.

210
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,710
What…

211
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,780
What should we do?

212
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,350
When…

213
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,440
When will the ambulance

214
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,110
be here?

215
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,200
I'll try my best

216
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,360
to hold the fetus's breech

217
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,390
to heave the cord a little bit.

218
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,340
So there will be less pressure

219
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,070
on the cord.

220
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,670
But I won't be able to do it for long.

221
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,870
I'll try to ask them to send a helicopter.

222
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,110
Ask the ambulance

223
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,039
to come quickly.

224
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:33,750

229
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,590

When will you be here?

Just passed the Qinghe toll station

232
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,490
for about two kilometers.

233
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,150
The ambulance is stuck on the way.

234
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,230
They can't be here soon.

235
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,040
The helicopter will be here

236
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,800
in about ten minutes.

237
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,870
Can you keep it for that long?

238
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,250
I can.

239
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,030
Don't worry about me.

240

But now there's a problem.

241
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,990

on the ground

243
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,150
about a kilometer away.

244
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,380
We need to send her there

245
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,830

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,730
But they transferred you to the emergency department

351
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,860
just when you got in here.

352
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,710
Do you blame me?

353
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,730
It's okay.

354
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,570
I can deal with

355
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,440
those flu patients.

356
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,890
But I just feel that the flu

357
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,810
is more serious than we think.

358
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,890
I've seen it developing into pneumonia

359
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,290
in many cases.

360
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,130
You'd better wear your mask.

361
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,010
It's fine. It's not the first time.

362
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I heard that the superior hospital

363
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,290
had already taken a sample

364
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,330
and reported it.

365
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,410
But we don't know

366
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,330
when the result will come out.

367
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,810
I'm just a little worried.

368
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,190
It's okay.

369
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,330
It's like this every winter.

370
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,830
Okay?

371
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,850
Come with me.

372
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,450
You need to be fed before work.

373
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,100
Let's go.

374
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,500
Put on your mask.

375
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,380
It's fine.

376
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,290
Just come with me.

377
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,140
Why are you here?

378
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,930
I want to ask you.

379
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,690
Weren't you going to propose?

380
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,060
Why didn't you do it?

381
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,090
Congrui.

382
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,790
Both of us have to face the reality.

383
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,590
I don't want a diamond ring.

384
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,260
I want sincerity.

385
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,920
You shouldn't have come now.

386
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,280
There's an influenza

387
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,540
spreading around here.

388
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,180
It's highly contagious.

389
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,730
Put on your mask.

390
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,060
Then I'll take you to lunch.

391
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,280
And then you'll go home.

392
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,740
Be good, okay?

393
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,460
I'm not going home.

394
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,690
I took a day off

395
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,570
to talk to you

396
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,290
about us.

397
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,340
I want to get back together with you.

398
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,900
I've asked you before

399
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,570
if you still want to marry me.

400
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,860
And you didn't answer.

401
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,060
I thought you didn't like me anymore.

402
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,730
Turned out,

403
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,540
you went to book a diamond ring for me.

404
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,060
I'm waiting for you here.

405
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,820
I'll wait till you can face

406
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,930
your true self.

407
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:21,740
Junxiao.

408
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,150
Junxiao.

409
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,660
The sample check result is back.

410
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,740
This is not regular flu.

411
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,460
It's a virus

412
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,300
that's similar to SARS.

413
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,100
Really?

414
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,810
Does the virus

415
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,260
affect pregnant women and fetuses?

416
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,500
We don't know yet.

417
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,740
The hospital has to secure an area

418
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,100
to build isolation wards

419
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,740
for patients with symptoms like

420
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,410
fever and coughing.

421
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,650
I'll take charge.

422
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,580
Congrui.

423
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,500
It's very dangerous here.

424
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,250
Go home.

425
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,100
We'll talk about us

426
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,570
after I'm finished with all this.

427
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,790
In this case,

428
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,350
I don't think I can go home.

429
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,070
Hello.

430
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,370
Yes. This is Du Di.

431
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,790
I already have a job.

432
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,660
Unfortunately.

433
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,060
I'll pass for now.

434
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,500
Thank you for your trust.

435
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,330
All the hospitals

436
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,310
are fighting to win over

437
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,130
my girlfriend so soon.

438
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,450
Stop teasing me.

439
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Surprise.

440
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,370
You bought flowers again?

441
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,740
Did you forget

442
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,780
the nightmare with 520 roses

443
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,530
last time?

444
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,940
I saw them on the way back.

445
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,850
So I bought them.

446
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,620
This is the flavor of life.

447
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,580
You need to learn to enjoy your life.

448
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,060
So, Dr. Liu,

449
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,700
the one who enjoys his life,

450
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,910
are you hungry?

451
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,780
Do you want to eat?

452
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,540
Dudu.

453
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,650
What did you make for me this time?

454
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,340
Guess.

455
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,330
Slow down.

456
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,980
It's delicious.

457
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,750
If you get tired of being a doctor,

458
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,620
you can still be a cook.

459
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,300
Right.

460
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,590
Why are all the hospitals

461
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,830
starting to call me now?

462
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,660
Why is that?

463
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,330
My phone's always ringing these days.

464
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,560
Didn't you see?

465
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,280
The video of you saving people

466
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,540
is all over the internet.

467
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,620
It's trending now.

468
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,370
Of course all the hospitals

469
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,180
would want a professional and altruistic doctor.

470
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,020
Only Director Tian doesn't know

471
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,100
to value good doctors.

472
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:21,890
Look.

473
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,420
Make way.

474
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:24,980
Make way.

475
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,540
Please, make way.

476
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,100
Be careful.

477
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,220
Move a little.

478
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,100
Slow down.

479
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,700
Easy.

480
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:29,870
Steady.

481
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,440
Steady.

482
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,580
Be careful.

483
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:31,970
Careful.

484
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,760
Easy.

485
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,370
Watch your feet.

486
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,140
Aunt.

487
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,670
Don't do this.

488
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,380
We need a doctor.

489
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,100
Make way.

490
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,450
My dad is feeling so bad.

491
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,110
It's okay.

492
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,460
Dad.

493
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,700
Put on another one.

494
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,260
For safety.

495
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,410
Calm down.

496
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,420
Lanhai Hospital.

497
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,180
Li Junxiao's hometown is in Lanhai.

498
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,470
Could Lanhai Hospital

499
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,490
be the county hospital he went to?

500
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,580
Congrui just went there.

501
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,110
I need to call her

502
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,820
and ask what happened.

503
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,859
The phone you dialed

504
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,160
is not answered for the moment.

505
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,390
How is it?

506
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,060
The phone you dialed

507
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,730
is not answered for the moment.

508
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,410
She's not answering.

509
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,420
Maybe she didn't hear the ring.

510
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,690
Call her later.

511
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,040
I know Congrui.

512
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,480
If the situation is really so serious,

513
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:24,940
she would stay there

514
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,849
and help out.

515
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,510
Congrui.

516
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,300
You didn't rest well for two days.

517
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,620
Go to the lounge later

518
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,060
and get some sleep.

519
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,130
You stayed up longer than I did.

520
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,410
Look at all the people

521
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,490
in there.

522
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,900
You can't tell who caught the flu

523
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,660
and who didn't.

524
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,140
We can't let it go on like this.

525
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,820
Now in the O&G department,

526
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,540
the confirmed and suspected cases

527
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,100
are increasing every day.

528
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,460
I heard that some doctors in other departments

529
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,420
have also been infected.

530
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,270
We don't have any

531
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
protective measure.

532
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,020
Just a mask every day.

533
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,140
I'm afraid

534
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,140
that we get infected someday.

535
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,500
The isolation ward is not enough.

536
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,350
We can't take any severe cases

537
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,180
with the capacity of this hospital.

538
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,860
Not to mention,

539
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,830
we lack medical supplies.

540
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,180
You reminded me.

541
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,380
I need to call

542
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,010
the superior in Shengji

543
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,080
and ask him about the impact

544
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,800
of the flu on pregnant women.

545
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:21,770
Junxiao.

546
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,400
Why are there so many pregnant women

547
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,380
in your hospital?

548
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,000
This is a big county

549
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,450
with a large population.

550
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,310
And this is

551
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,030
the only big hospital here.

552
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,300
Director Tian.

553
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,310
What medicine and dosage

554
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,690
should we use on pregnant women with the flu?

555
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,500
Can the fetus be infected?

556
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
We don't know anything.

557
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,870
I'm really worried

558
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,100
that we can't take in

559
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,820
so many patients

560
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,780
with the hospital's capacity.

561
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,740
They have transferred people

562
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,700
from other hospitals

563
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,940
to help at Lanhai county.

564
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,110
In principle, the deployment

565
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,860
is unified.

566
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,980
But considering the number of pregnant women

567
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,580
in your hospital,

568
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,570
I'll tell my superior

569
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,710
and see if we can send a team

570
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,380
to back you up.

571
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,590
Thank you, Director Tian.

572
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,900
But you have to hurry up.

573
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,420
Junxiao.

574
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,140
Don't worry.

575
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,900
I'm going downtown now.

576
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,050
Hello?

577
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,980
Du Di,

578
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
I'm so sad.

579
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,980
What's going on?

580
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,060
What happened?

581
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,100
Come on,

582
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,930
what happened?

583
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:27,700
Are you alright?

584
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,780
Tell me you're not infected.

585
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,020
I'm not alright,

586
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,170
not at all.

587
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,360
You know what?

588
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,250
Some patients

589
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,900
were getting better,

590
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
but they still died.

591
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,780
I've never seen

592
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,570
such a weird epidemic.

593
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,690
We're so helpless

594
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,880
and could only watch their conditions

595
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,300
get worse.

596
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,390
Don't be afraid.

597
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,980
Wait for me. I'll go find you.

598
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,820
You can't come.

599
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,300
It's dangerous here.

600
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,660
Since you can be there, so can I.

601
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,940
That's it.

602
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,570
I've just

603
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,700
gathered some supplies

604
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,820
and I'll bring them with me.

605
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,660
You must take care of yourself

606
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,880
and stay safe.

607
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,540
I'll take care of myself.

608
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,180
Wait for me.

609
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,670
Yeah.

610
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,260
Don't you have the key?

611
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,500
You wouldn't know who is here.

612
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,160
Director Tian?

613
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,340
What brings you here?

614
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,620
If I'm not coming,

615
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,100
I'm afraid you would be working

616
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,700
at another hospital.

617
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,060
Let's talk inside.

618
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,780
Director Tian, come in, please.

619
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,450
I told Director Tian

620
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,130
that many hospitals are contacting you.

621
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,450
You're starting to consider it, right?

622
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,510
Du Di,

623
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,970
I'm here today

624
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,260
to reinstate you.

625
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,420
You may go back to Shengji.

626
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:54,910
Director Tian,

627
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,540
are you here in person

628
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,460
just to reinstate me?

629
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,830
Really?

630
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,410
It's unbelievable.

631
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,490
Why is it unbelievable?

632
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,460
You have no idea

633
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,810
how much viewers

634
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,810
the expressway rescue video has attracted.

635
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,420
That's not a big deal at all.

636
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,480
This actually has little to do

637
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,140
with the video.

638
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,940
Your father went to the hospital

639
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,180
and withdrew his complaint against you.

640
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,610
That's why

641
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,450
I can sit here today.

642
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,070
According to the hospital's decision,

643
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,340
given your

644
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,500
excellent performance,

645
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,180
both you and Wu Congrui

646
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,300
are appointed as chief resident.

647
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,300
We hope

648
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,500
you can keep working hard,

649
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,970
and keep helping pregnant women

650
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,140
and delivering babies

651
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,590
in Shengji's Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

652
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,770
Director Tian,

653
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,890
we're so honored

654
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,370
that you come in person to announce this.

655
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,650
Don't be garrulous.

656
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,300
Director Tian,

657
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,550
I really appreciate you for coming in person.

658
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,890
But I can't go back now.

659
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,220
You seem to harbor resentment.

660
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,100
You have no idea how many times

661
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,450
I went to the general office for you.

662
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,340
It's normal for you to harbor resentment.

663
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,980
But we are all

664
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,260
on your side

665
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,980
and all looking forward to your return.

666
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,700
Director Tian, I don't mean that.

667
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm not harboring resentment.

668
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,550
Okay then.

669
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,260
Let's go.

670
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,380
But now,

671
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,610
I have a more important thing to do.

672
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,220
I'll go to Lanhai first

673
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,060
to find Congrui.

674
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,690
Lanhai is now

675
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,370
also the most important task for me.

676
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,940
Junxiao has asked me for help many times.

677
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,130
Shengji's medical team

678
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,060
is about to leave.

679
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:18,820
Du Di,

680
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,550
would you like to

681
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,860
be a doctor

682
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,790
of Shengji's medical team

683
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,340
to the front?

684
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:23,780
I would.

685
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,020
So would I.

686
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,660
Why do I feel like

687
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,020
I'm your marriage witness?

688
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,720
Yeah?

689
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,140
-Go pack the luggage.
-OK.

690
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Let's leave on the first day of the Lunar New Year.

691
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,650
The first day of the Lunar New Year?

692
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,120
I can't wait.

693
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:38,970
I'm leaving now.

694
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,100
The hospital must have prepared

695
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,580
a lot of supplies.

696
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,620
Don't carry so many yourself.

697
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,500
No.

698
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,810
I'm worried.

699
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,940
Bringing one more

700
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,100
might save one more life.

701
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,700
I just asked Congrui

702
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,810
what they need most

703
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,780
right now.

704
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,330
Guess what?

705
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,850
Diapers.

706
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,180
Do they have so many babies?

707
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,040
No.

708
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,920
They have to work for a dozen hours

709
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,940
in protective suits

710
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,640
and couldn't go to the toilet.

711
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:22,990
I'll go buy those now.

712
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,850
I've done that.

713
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,620
You're more thoughtful.

714
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,260
Thanks.

715
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,220
Why thank me?

716
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,220
You make me feel like I'm an outsider.

717
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,290
Last weekend,

718
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,730
were you planning

719
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,410
to propose to me?

720
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,820
You've known it.

721
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,810
The trunk was filled with flowers and balloons.

722
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,160
And once an hour,

723
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,060
you would secretly

724
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,610
report our location to Angel Naomi.

725
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,260
If I still couldn't know it,

726
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,070
I would be a fool.

727
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,690
So, I didn't do

728
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,770
my secret work well.

729
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,660
I'm sorry

730
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,430
that everything you prepared

731
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,340
was ruined.

732
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,500
My proposal was ruined,

733
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,810
but my girlfriend

734
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,240
heroically saved a mother and a baby.

735
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,500
It's two lives.

736
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,780
It's more significant than a proposal.

737
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,100
Liu Nianbai,

738
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,070
are you certain

739
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,330
that you want to

740
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,260
spend the rest of your life with me?

741
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,980
About this,

742
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm more certain

743
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,610
than every decision

744
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,820
I've ever made.

745
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,810
So,

746
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,140
your answer is…

747
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,820
I'll tell you

748
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,010
when I come back alive.

749
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,200
Wu Congrui.

750
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,020
Du Di.

751
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,050
It's so great to see you here.

752
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,890
I'm here to fight alongside you.

753
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,420
I brought masks and protective suits

754
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,220
as well as diapers.

755
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,530
They've been sent to the warehouse.

756
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,880
There're shortages

757
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,850
of all supplies.

758
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,500
To save one protective suit,

759
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,810
we dare not eat

760
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,540
and drink

761
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,770
to avoid going to the toilet.

762
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,990
Many more medical supplies

763
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,210
will be sent here

764
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,700
with Shengji's medical team.

765
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,650
That's really great.

766
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,780
With your help,

767
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,140
patients here would be saved.

768
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,540
Come on, let me help you.

769
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,150
[Isolation Area of Obstetrics and Gynecology]

770
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,090
[Disinfection Area of Isolation Ward]

771
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,130
Behind this door

772
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,510
is the isolation area.

773
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,780
There're three wards inside.

774
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,080
In each ward,

775
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,060
there're pregnant women infected.

776
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,310
Two of them

777
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,690
are in serious condition.

778
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,000
Are you sure to go inside with me?

779
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,540
You've known me for so long.

780
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,530
When have you seen me get cold feet

781
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,820
in face of difficulties?

782
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,620
Are you wearing a diaper?

783
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,380
Yes, I'm all set as you told me.

784
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,530
To avoid going to the toilet,

785
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,620
I just ate a little for breakfast.

786
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,760
You can't do that.

787
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,570
We'll stay inside

788
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,340
for more than ten hours.

789
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,580
I'll be fine. I have hardtacks.

790
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,290
I can take that if I'm hungry.

791
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,190
Okay.

792
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:34,980
Let's go.

793
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,670
Do you think

794
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,480
we can win the fight against the flu?

795
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,420
If you asked me this question

796
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,420
a few days ago,

797
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,850
I really had no confidence.

798
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,780
When I just got here,

799
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,540
I couldn't control myself.

800
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,620
The hospital

801
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,690
was unprepared for this.

802
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,940
Li Junxiao

803
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,450
had no protective gear at all.

804
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,620
And I really

805
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,660
had no confidence.

806
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,580
But now supplies are being sent here

807
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,220
from across the city.

808
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,180
I learned that

809
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,300
medical teams from across the country

810
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,340
are being sent here to support us.

811
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,540
I'm now

812
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,500
a bit more confident.

813
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,700
We'll surely make it.

Doctors,

815
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,370
the pregnant woman on Ward 2 Bed 1

is having a continuous decrease

her weak uterine contractions.

But the amount of bleeding is moderate.

Her uterus contracts well.

♫The warmest hands in the world♫

Director, you're too tired.

Let me do the

871
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,460

Why are you sweating?

We just performed an operation.

891
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,180
We had a successful cesarean section

892

for a pregnant woman.

893

is negative.

We were so worried.

896
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,040
We're worried

897
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,260
that the baby would get infected.

Do you miss me?

how we

performed this operation?

No.

903
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,380
I only want to know whether you miss me or not.

904

Yes.

905
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,260
I miss you, too.

Tell you some good news.

We're leaving to meet you soon.

Who will come?

Besides me, who else do you want to see?

911

Director Tian, Director Huang,

and Dr. Lin.

You know what?

914
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,410
There's really a shortage of doctors.

915
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,430
Fine.

916

This is you,

You must be safe,

wait for us.

How are you doing?

00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,690
What?

923
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,160
How are you doing today?

924
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:03,760
I'm getting used

925

to the pace of work inside here.

926

Don't worry about me.

927
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,260
You must keep yourself safe, okay?

928
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,810
Don't get infected.

929
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,820
I've been so fragile recently

930
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,810
and cried a lot.

931
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,610
Congrui,

932
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,570
you're just so stressed out.

933
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,300
Don't push yourself too hard.

934
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,140
I really hope

935
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,690
this epidemic could end soon.

936
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,550
After going through this,

937
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,900
I'll cherish every minute

938
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,020
with you.

939
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,670
You're finally willing

940
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,620
to face your heart.

941
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,290
When this is over,

942
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,360
let's celebrate the festival together

943
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,950
and welcome the brand new year.

944
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,380
I'll never let go of you again.

945
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:48,810
Congrui,

946
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,980
would you give me another chance

947
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,630
to be with me?

948
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,050
You are a fool.

949
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,360
Of course I would.

950
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,000
Happy New Year!

951
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,020
Happy New Year!

952
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,580
Make a New Year wish.

953
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,430
I wish

954
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,830
everyone can

955
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
survive this epidemic.

956
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,140
We will.

957
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,770
If there is a cup of Long Island Iced Tea,

958
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,810
it would be great,

959
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:47,870
and perfect.

960
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,220
I did go out to find it.

961
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,760
But all restaurants, bars and shops

962
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,760
are closed.

963
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,620
I could find nothing.

964
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,420
When can we

965
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,780
go back to a normal life?

966
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,880
I hope this could be over soon.

967
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,510
When this is over,

968
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,690
what will be the first thing

969
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,260
you want to do?

970
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,950
If it was in the past,

971
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,780
there would be many things I want to do.

972
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,770
But now,

973
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,940
I only hope

974
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,850
that we don't have to wear a mask

975
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,420
and we can walk freely on the street

976
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,590
and breathe freely.

977
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,820
Then we can see

978
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,580
each other's smile.

979
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:15,710
What about you?

980
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,300
Why are you laughing?

981
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,020
I want to kiss the person I like,

982
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,100
without wearing a mask.

983
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,770
Okay, I'll help you with that.

984
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,820
I would firstly drag Li Junxiao

985
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
to the front of you

986
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,739
and press his head

987
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,540
for you to kiss.

988
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,380
Who would be the second?

989
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:34,810
Me.

990
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,100
Then forget about the first one.

991
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:37,580
Okay.

992
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,340
May our wishes come true as soon as possible.

993
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,860
Cheers!

994
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,570
Today is the first day of the Lunar New Year.

995
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:49,650
It should be a day

996
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,179
for family reunions.

997
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,540
But you have to leave your homes to support Lanhai

998
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,260
and support those medical workers.

999
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,740
I have no requirements for you

1000
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,060
except for the words on the banner:

1001
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,580
Come Back Safely.

1002
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,380
You must remember

1003
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,870
that I want you to come back

1004
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,180
safe and sound.

1005
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,440
Remember?

1006
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,530
Yes.

1007
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,050
Director Tian,

1008
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,190
please rest assured

1009
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,530
that I will

1010
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,450
bring them back safely.

1011
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,390
OK.

1012
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,690
Get ready to go.

1013
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,620
Director Huang,

1014
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,420
Your baby is still little

1015
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,500
and needs to be taken care of.

1016
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,820
Maybe you should reconsider.

1017
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:27,850
I don't think you should go.

1018
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:28,990
Doesn't matter.

1019
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,460
My mother is taking care of her.

1020
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,260
I'm duty-bound to go.

1021
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,010
Don't look at me.

1022
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,390
I'm more duty-bound.

1023
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,790
I'm a single man,

1024
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,220
with no family to worry about.

1025
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,190
Fei,

1026
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,070
when you get there,

1027
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,490
you mustn't be careless.

1028
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,620
You must wear a protective suit all the time,

1029
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,880
especially when you're in close contact

1030
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,990
with the patients.

1031
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,880
Did you hear me?

1032
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,260
Yeah, Head Nurse.

1033
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,620

when a kid with leukemia is discharged.

the kid would be carried out by an uncle.

1162
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,650
That symbolizes

1163

"I'll never come back."

"I'll never come back."

1166

the patients would come back some day.

00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,090
Forever discharge means

the patients have been cured

1169
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,050

Although

1171
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,140
I don't like

1172
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,130
those weird ways they use

1173
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,180
to say goodbye

1174
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,900
to me.

1175
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,340
But I later thought

1176
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,180
that a doctor would feel devastated

1177
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,850
to see the same patient again.

1178
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,820
"Again!"

1179
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,940
"Not cured yet!"

1180
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,850
For doctors,

1181
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,650
"see you" has various meanings.

1182
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,810
That makes us feel awkward

1183
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,540
in socializing.

1184
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,430
Sometimes when I'm about to raise my hand

1185
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,020
after a meal with a friend,

1186
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,160
I would wonder

1187
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,100
whether I should say "see you".

1188
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,530
Would my friend remember

1189
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,700
that I'm a doctor?

1190
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:49,770
Therefore,

1191
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,220
I've gradually become a person

1192
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,900
who doesn't like to say "see you".

1193
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,380
-Bravo!
-Bravo!
