[Beloved Life]

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,840
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,860
I just wanted to check on Feng Yuanhang

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,610
in the neonatology department.

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,259
The head nurse told me

7
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,780
that Feng Yuanhang

8
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,360
was temporarily transferred

9
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,150
for being excluded by our department.

10
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,979
I don't know

11
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,020
why did you divorce,

12
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,289
but everyone is backing you up,

13
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,550
you should be happy.

14
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,050
I'm not happy.

15
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,350
I didn't divorce him

16
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,950
because I didn't love him anymore.

17
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,560
I don't want you to treat him like that.

18
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,060
If you're still in love,

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,490
you shouldn't divorce.

20
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,810
But we don't have children.

21
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,699
Feng Yuanhang

22
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,000
doesn't want any children.

23
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,900
He got a vasectomy.

24
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,390
Are you alright?

25
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,610
Why did he do it?

26
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,220
Everyone asks the same question

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,420
on hearing this.

28
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,990
He said

29
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,010
he did it for me.

30
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,900
I know,

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,079
he thinks I'm still a child,

32
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,990
incapable of being a mother.

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
But he just broke my dream

34
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,770
of being a mother.

35
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,140
I can't accept that.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
No one can accept that.

37
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,750
What's the meaning of having a family?

38
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,620
No matter how many

39
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,410
beautiful words you use,

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,040
it's all about

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,000
living a life, raising children,

42
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,180
and growing old together.

43
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,530
If he doesn't want to live a life,

44
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,500
raise children,

45
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,900
and grow old with you,

46
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,270
that means

47
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,190
he doesn't want what you want.

48
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,790
That's what I think.

49
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,060
Feng Yuanhang is my first love.

50
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,550
From the day

51
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,210
I decided to be with him,

52
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,570
I set a goal

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
every month.

54
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,610
All these goals lead us to nothing else

55
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,390
but getting married, having children

56
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,300
and growing old together.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,850
Li Junxiao,

58
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,900
when you

59
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,390
forced Du Di to marry you,

60
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,270
I thought

61
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,240
you disrespected her.

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,690
Now when I think back,

63
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,220
it's just you two

64
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,400
want different life.

65
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:34,930
It seems that

66
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,060
you and I,

67
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,880
are the same people.

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,630
Since you're not the same people,

69
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,790
there's no need to be sad anymore.

70
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,010
We both need to cheer up.

71
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,040
The next one will be the right one.

72
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,740
Of course.

73
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,570
Give me more candies.

74
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,140
So I can go to work

75
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,710
happily.

76
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,460
No more candies.

77
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,860
Any more?

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,790
No more. Check it yourself.

79
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,050
If you like it,

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll buy you a pack tomorrow.

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,100
You know,

82
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,380
eating sweets can really

83
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,550
make you feel better.

84
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,340
Then I will

85
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
buy you a bucket tomorrow

86
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,240
and put it on your table,

87
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,930
so you can be happy every day.

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,660
Deal.

89
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,240
Deal.

90
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,830
Don't you look down on me.

91
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,630
I can

92
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,640
afford chocolates.

93
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,620
Still reading?

94
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,710
All you do is

95
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,790
reading, reading.

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,760
Can you get a girlfriend

97
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,540
from books?

98
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,090
Brother, listen.

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,590
I have been observing for days.

100
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,900
I think the midwife in your hospital,

101
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,220
Su Ye

102
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,900
has a crush on you.

103
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,810
What do you think of her?

104
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,470
Sister,

105
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,850
I don't want a relationship now.

106
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,260
I just want to do my job well.

107
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,100
So that means,

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
you don't like her.

109
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,960
What about Dr. Wu? Wu Congrui?

110
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,700
I remember it.

111
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,710
You said that

112
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,740
there was this urban girl

113
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,870
you liked in college,

114
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,300
but you didn't dare

115
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,460
to tell her.

116
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,890
And you watched her

117
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,450
get married.

118
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,940
Later you pursued Du Di.

119
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,470
Tell me,

120
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,100
that girl

121
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,400
was Dr. Wu, right?

122
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,420
Sister, stop it.

123
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,040
It was her.

124
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,409
I knew it.

125
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,380
Between Dr. Wu and Du Di,

126
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,520
of course you would choose Dr. Wu.

127
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,840
You see, Dr. Wu is

128
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,600
good-looking and nice.

129
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,320
The patients in the hospital,

130
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,560
and the doctors and nurses

131
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,540
all like her.

132
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,850
She's not like Du Di,

133
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,170
who pulls a long face every day.

134
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:01,880
Brother,

135
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,700
how is Dr. Wu's

136
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,210
family condition?

137
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,890
If they're rich,

138
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,720
it would be great.

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,730
So you don't have to work so hard.

140
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,540
Sister,

141
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,700
what do I have

142
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,470
to ask for

143
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,730
a rich family?

144
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,290
I'm just a small doctor,

145
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,780
no one is willing to be with me.

146
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,700
They're short-sighted.

147
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,480
The older the doctors are, the more valuable they are.

148
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,530
We will be better off

149
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,140
in the future.

150
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,460
Hope so.

151
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,100
Still can't get off the ventilator?

152
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,340
Did the family change their minds?

153
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,180
No.

154
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,130
They insist on moving out.

155
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,620
The baby will be over

156
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,080
in a few hours out.

157
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,650
So don't go out today.

158
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,940
I'll figure it out.

159
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,500
Hurry up then.

160
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,820
We haven't given the baby any medicine today.

161
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,220
If the family doesn't agree,

162
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,260
we can't give her medicine.

163
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,490
I know.

164
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:56,620
Wait for me.

165
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,390
What are you gonna do?

166
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,350
You can't ask us

167
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,740
to donate to her?

168
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,700
Donate what?

169
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,340
How can they save the boy only

170
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,310
when they have enough money?

171
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,520
I have to make them pay for it.

172
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,410
Senior, I'm with you.

173
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,610
What can I do?

174
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,040
Come here.

175
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,060
How do you feel today?

176
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,340
It doesn't hurt that much.

177
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,650
The prognosis is very good.

178
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,920
You can be discharged

179
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,540
in a week.

180
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,210
How about the babies?

181
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,140
Both are

182
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,010
in the NICU.

183
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,390
The older one is relatively stable.

184
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,700
We just need to keep his body temperature,

185
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,720
nutritional intake,

186
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,850
and prevent complications.

187
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,110
The younger one

188
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,100
is more complicated.

189
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,380
Respiratory failure,

190
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,490
low body weight, hypoglycemia,

191
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,720
neonatal jaundice and hypothermia.

192
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,930
The family wants

193
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,220
the younger one

194
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,940
to get out of the NICU.

195
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,060
It's hard to say once she's out.

196
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,780
Did you think it over?

197
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,590
Director.

198
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,140
How many times

199
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,210
have you asked?

200
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,690
Can you stop?

201
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,880
We're really out of money.

202
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,200
We can only save one.

203
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,970
Please think again.

204
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,580
They're both

205
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,700
your fresh and blood.

206
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:35,820
It hurts to give up

207
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,580
either of them.

208
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,380
Okay.

209
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,039
Let's go.

210
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,060
Senior,

211
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,210
is it always bad that a premature infant

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,150
is underweight?

213
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,180
It's hard to say.

214
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,800
Their younger baby

215
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,620
seems to have a lot of problems,

216
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,230
but the older one experiences

217
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,190
infections, intracranial hemorrhages,

218
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,370
blood sugar instability,

219
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,840
hyperbilirubinemia,

220
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,070
and feeding intolerance.

221
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,220
You know,

222
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,470
premature babies

223
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,070
linger at

224
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,440
the jaw of death every day.

225
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,630
Their conditions may deteriorate,

226
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,450
and they may even die

227
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,690
before leaving the hospital.

228
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,700
The kid who left two days ago

229
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,670
is four weeks older than them.

230
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,960
So you mean,

231
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,460
the family thought the older one is safe,

232
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,340
then they move the younger one out of the incubator,

233
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,620
in the end, they might lose both children?

234
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,620
Isn't that…

235
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,320
What is it called?

236
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,730
It is like drawing water with a sieve.

237
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,310
Exactly.

238
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,100
Wait.

239
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,860
What did you just say?

240
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,810
Nothing, just chat.

241
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,580
No.

242
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,480
You said that the older one

243
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,550
is better, didn't you?

244
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,750
Does "better"

245
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,730
means "healthy"?

246
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,110
Which doctor assured you that

247
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,300
he would be discharged healthy?

248
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,370
No one said that.

249
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,940
If I were you,

250
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,210
I would save both.

251
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,570
Better than losing two in the end.

252
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,700
Let's go.

253
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,810
Honey, what to do?

254
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,970
How about,

255
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,160
we keep them both now.

256
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,020
If they're both gone,

257
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,900
we will have

258
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
nothing to count on.

259
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,460
Go borrow some money.

260
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,650
Tell the doctor,

261
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,470
don't take the baby

262
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,360
out of the incubator.

263
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,260
We have money, no need to borrow.

264
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,240
But you said we're out of money!

265
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,170
You said we're out of money!

266
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,820
Okay, honey.

267
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,760
Calm down.

268
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,860
I did it all

269
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,660
for our family.

270
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,300
Nice play.

271
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,300
Where are you going?

272
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,040
I know you mean good,

273
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,980
but intimidating patients and families

274
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
is against professional ethics.

275
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,840
You're lucky to be caught by me,

276
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,590
not by Director Huang.

277
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,760
I'm

278
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,460
more merciful than her.

279
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,440
Du Di,

280
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,730
don't enter

281
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,180
the operating room this week from tomorrow.

282
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,100
Reflect on yourself.

283
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,220
Liu Nianbai,

284
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,830
from tomorrow,

285
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,630
take a one-week

286
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,430
admission training

287
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,530
with the new interns

288
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,280
in the hospital.

289
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,030
Clear your minds up.

290
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,440
Weiwei,

291
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,130
please.

292
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,460
The new interns

293
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,890
are all undergraduates.

294
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,470
You ask me to train with them?

295
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,400
It's silly.

296
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,020
First,

297
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,920
please call me Dr. Lin.

298
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,520
Dr. Lin.

299
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,040
Second,

300
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,280
if you don't agree,

301
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,450
I will tell everyone

302
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,470
tomorrow morning.

303
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,020
We will see what the leaders have to say.

304
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,990
Senior, help.

305
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,790
Do as what your superior says.

306
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,420
Mom.

307
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,910
Mom.

308
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,050
Why are you still here?

309
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,940
Your dad went to buy the tickets.

310
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,770
I came to check on you

311
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,850
while he's not around.

312
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,380
Take this.

313
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,770
Why give me this?

314
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,690
There are 20,000 yuan in it.

315
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,430
You keep it.

316
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,700
What do you mean?

317
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,440
Just take it.

318
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,610
This might be the last money

319
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,250
I can give you.

320
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,140
It's not much,

321
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,050
but enough

322
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,250
for a wedding dress

323
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,880
in the future.

324
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,670
Put it away.

325
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,310
Where did you get the money?

326
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,020
I know

327
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,350
he keeps

328
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,500
all the money in his hand.

329
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,450
How did you save this money?

330
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,250
I got it from your dad.

331
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,040
I still remember when I was in school,

332
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,380
he didn't even want to pay the tuition fee.

333
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,080
Now he is so generous

334
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,300
to give me 20,000 yuan?

335
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,540
He really tries so hard

336
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,580
for his son.

337
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,450
So,

338
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,380
do you want me to sign an agreement

339
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,460
to promise that I will never

340
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,940
fight for property with his son in the future?

341
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,400
Don't hate your dad.

342
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,520
It was difficult for him too.

343
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,520
Mom,

344
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,660
I never wanted

345
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,600
your money.

346
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,640
Yes,

347
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,150
eight years in medical school,

348
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:12,870
I spent some money,

349
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,780
but I earned

350
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,980
most of it from scholarships

351
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,620
and work-study.

352
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,980
Now I have a job,

353
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,700
I can make money myself.

354
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,780
It's not much,

355
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,950
but I live a frugal life

356
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,730
and give the rest

357
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,580
to the family.

358
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,780
Am I not doing enough?

359
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,470
Why do you think

360
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,340
I would covet

361
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,020
your property?

362
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,570
Give me 20,000 yuan

363
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,360
to get me out of it?

364
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,340
What exactly

365
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,140
am I to you?

366
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,260
I'm sorry.

367
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,730
Take it back.

368
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,320
I don't want it.

369
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,390
I'm so happy.

370
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,820
This is my first time watching a talk show.

371
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,100
I checked it up

372
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,590
and it's said that there is a mystery guest

373
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,030
in this talk show club.

374
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,360
And he is a doctor.

375
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,650
A doctor in talk show?

376
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,310
What does he talk?

377
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,800
Heart, liver, stomach, spleen?

378
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,780
Cancer or cerebral and myocardial infarction?

379
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,790
Or an obstetrician

380
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,980
talks about uterine fibroids

381
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,720
and ovarian cysts.

382
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,670
Are these laughable?

383
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,020
People are here for talk show,

384
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,270
not to see a doctor.

385
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,210
You're ruining it.

386
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,090
I just can't image.

387
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,300
There is also a possibility

388
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,180
that someone

389
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,540
who was in medical school for a few days

390
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,870
and come to bluff around

391
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,580
in the name of doctor.

392
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,260
Who said that? It's not.

393
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,830
I'm not talking about you.

394
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,390
Did you upset your senior?

395
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,180
No.

396
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:16,990
What's wrong?

397
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,970
You know how many wheels on a bike?

398
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,520
Two. You're the third one.

399
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,560
The third wheel.

400
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,670
I asked you out to have fun.

401
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,810
Cheer up.

402
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,100
If you hadn't insisted

403
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,260
that I owed you a favor

404
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,150
and forced me to come out,

405
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,090
I wouldn't be here

406
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,950
wasting my time.

407
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,190
Senior,

408
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,350
I know you're in bad mood

409
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,200
for the penalty.

410
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,250
Congrui is in bad mood too.

411
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,710
So I asked you out

412
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,020
to have some fun.

413
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,000
Think about the silver lining.

414
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,020
We were punished,

415
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,020
but we

416
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,650
saved a girl.

417
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,210
We should be happy.

418
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,810
It's an accomplishment, right?

419
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,140
Right.

420
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,850
We should be happy.

421
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,630
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

422
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,390
Where is Liu Nianbai?

423
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,450
Ladies and gentlemen,

424
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,290
the show is about to start.

425
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,060
First,

426
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,340
we're sure you're watching

427
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,700
a doctor's talk show.

428
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,970
The most significant feature

429
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,180
of this talk show is that

430
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,750
if you suffer from myocardial infarction

431
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,380
or cerebral infarction while watching,

432
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,210
you will be rescued

433
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,840
within the golden rescue time.

434
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,300
Because the actor is a doctor.

435
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,130
This talk show is also called

436
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,140
You-Won't-Die-From-Laughter

437
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,290
Talk Show.

438
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,340
-Since the artist on this talk show…
-What's so funny?

439
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,980
You can take pictures or videos

440
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,430
of the artist

441
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,020
except for his face,

442
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,790
feet, legs and buttocks.

443
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,780
The artist does not

444
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,910
want to be laughed at by the patients

445
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,370
when he's treating them.

446
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,190
Thank you for your cooperation.

447
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,790
Now welcome our Dr. Bai.

448
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,900
Great.

449
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,760
No way.

450
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,030
We have a star

451
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,260
around us?

452
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,460
As an obstetrician,

453
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,099
I like to ask

454
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,550
the patients' families a question.

455
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,290
Why do you want to have children?

456
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,470
Everyone has their own answer.

457
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,460
Some would say,

458
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,140
isn't it natural

459
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,380
to have children?

460
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,450
Some would say,

461
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,339
it's time to have children.

462
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,650
Some would say,

463
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,720
it is for the sake of inheritance.

464
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,910
These answers are all boring.

465
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,319
Until one day

466
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,329
I met a very

467
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,470
confident man.

468
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,270
He said,

469
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,870
I think I need to

470
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,980
pass on my good genes.

471
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,940
I admire his confidence,

472
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,990
but his genetic testing showed

473
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,920
that what he passed on to his children

474
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,910
might not be what the children wanted.

475
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,050
Such as baldness, big face, single eyelid,

476
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,200
and some genetic diseases.

477
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,080
These particularly confident parents

478
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,220
are also very confident

479
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
when educating their children.

480
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,170
I'm so good at math,

481
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,270
how can't you even memorize

482
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,930
a multiplication table?

483
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,070
At this time,

484
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,200
I really hope the children

485
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,680
know some medical knowledge,

486
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,310
so they can answer back.

487
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,520
I did not inherit

488
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,930
your mathematical talent,

489
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,010
but I inherited

490
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,660
your buck teeth,

491
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,040
dad.

492
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,310
I didn't make the choice,

493
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,650
but you did,

494
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,240
dad…

495
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,660
It's so true.

496
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,990
My dad always says I'm ugly.

497
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,620
I told him,

498
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,440
call me ugly

499
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,100
when he looks like

500
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,210
Leonardo DiCaprio.

501
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,060
Excellent.

502
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,530
Where is she?

503
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,330
Did she go back because it's boring?

504
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,380
We should go back too.

505
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,280
We have a shift tomorrow.

506
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,340
I'll say goodbye to Nianbai.

507
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,340
Okay.

508
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,060
Thanks.

509
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,480
Never thought it was you, Nianbao.

510
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,020
Where is my Senior?

511
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,130
I don't know.

512
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,070
Maybe she thought it was boring.

513
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,010
So she left.

514
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,720
We're leaving too.

515
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,840
We have to work tomorrow.

516
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,410
Take care.

517
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,360
Bye.

518
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:18,720
Bye.

519
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,900
Bye.

520
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,380
Senior?

521
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,110
This is the first time I made people cry

522
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,060
on a talk show.

523
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,670
The family changed their mind last night

524
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
and decided to save both.

525
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,760
So the situation is stable now.

526
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,540
Not bad. We try our best to save them.

527
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,060
Next,

528
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
Director Huang will

529
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,550
make arrangements for

530
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,150
the OBGYN conference in three months.

531
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,720
Considering that Director Huang

532
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,760
is getting labor soon,

533
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,680
Lin Wei will lead you

534
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,830
to the conference

535
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,880
this time.

536
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm not going.

537
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,940
Why?

538
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,590
I'm neither director,

539
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,610
nor professor.

540
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,950
It's a humiliation to Shengji

541
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,900
if I take the lead.

542
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,620
Please find another director.

543
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,900
Do you know how rare

544
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,700
this opportunity is?

545
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,380
Do you know how many

546
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,910
experts you will meet

547
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,090
at the conference?

548
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,290
I hope you can

549
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,060
get to know more people

550
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,000
in the evaluation committee,

551
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,690
cooperate with me to do

552
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,140
some scientific researches,

553
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,500
improve your level,

554
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,460
and become a specialist

555
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,320
in Shengji as soon as possible.

556
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,820
So no title, no specialist?

557
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,010
My interest is on clinic.

558
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,190
Surgeries are all I care for.

559
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
So don't bother me

560
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,660
with these things.

561
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,480
Not only to be a specialist,

562
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,890
I hope you can

563
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,000
be a role model

564
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,170
to young doctors.

565
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,890
It is enough to have

566
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,300
Director Huang as a role model.

567
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,460
-Can you…
-Director Tian.

568
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,780
Let me talk with him for the rest.

569
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,770
Let's dismiss.

570
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,810
All right.

571
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,900
Dismiss.

572
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,300
Congrui.

573
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,980
Thanks.

574
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,900
Why are you staring at me?

575
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,710
Do you have nothing to do?

576
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,880
Are you feeling better?

577
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:11,830
Come.

578
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:12,730
Take a look.

579
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,100
It looks much like your son.

580
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,980
How does your son feel

581
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,080
about you having a second child?

582
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
Is he happy or angry?

583
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,130
He's happy.

584
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,020
He always wanted

585
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,940
a playmate.

586
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,730
I was also worried that he's too lonely.

587
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,410
Now little boys like to play

588
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,980
online games all day long.

589
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,960
They can only make friends online.

590
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,500
Fighting and killing all day,

591
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,380
too violent.

592
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,600
If he has a little brother

593
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,510
or sister,

594
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,830
he should have more

595
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,220
emotional exchanges.

596
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,240
Good if he's happy.

597
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,090
Most of us have

598
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,180
four or five siblings in our families.

599
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,340
The oldest ones not only dare not to be jealous,

600
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,730
but also had to take care of their younger brothers and sisters.

601
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,830
Now you see,

602
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,470
it's so difficult

603
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,780
to have a second child.

604
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,270
We have to be very careful.

605
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,100
Maybe people nowadays

606
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,260
love themselves more.

607
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,010
So they put their own emotion

608
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,140
in priority,

609
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,780
and express it very directly.

610
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,730
Director Huang,

611
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,880
the fetal heart rate of bed No.4 is inaudible.

612
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,760
Please go take a look.

613
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,420
OK.

614
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,780
I got this.

615
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,830
The doctor is coming now.

616
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,890
It'll be all right.

617
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,190
What took you so long?

618
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,460
My baby is dying!

619
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,100
Sorry, sorry.

620
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,450
Hurry, will you?

621
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,300
Why do you come to work with a swollen belly?

622
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,980
What's the status?

623
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,660
The fetal heart rate was normal

624
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,430
when she got into the hospital.

625
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,320
We monitored it again after two hours,

626
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,870
and it's gone.

627
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,470
Use Doppler ultrasound to monitor it again.

628
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,380
-OK.
-The doctor is here.

629
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,890
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

630
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,430
Thank you.

631
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,310
Hurry up.

632
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,020
Thank you.

633
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,620
Here.

634
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,150
It's fine,

635
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,050
dear, it's fine.

636
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,540
It's going to be alright.

637
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,220
Believe me.

638
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,780
How could that be?

639
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,860
You said the heart rate

640
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,870
was normal when she got in?

641
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,060
Stop talking.

642
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,380
Just save her now.

643
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,870
Save her, save her!

644
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,530
Please calm down, sir.

645
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,530
We're trying to save her.

646
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,430
How can I calm down?

647
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,330
You've taken turns

648
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,630
to check on her.

649
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,710
Is it necessary?

650
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,520
We need to figure out

651
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,080
the situation first.

652
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,580
Listen to me.

653
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,550
If anything happens to my child,

654
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,360
I'll never let you off.

655
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,130
Give her an ultrasound.

656
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,700
Easy, easy.

657
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,610
Take it easy, honey.

658
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,090
Hurry, hurry.

659
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,520
Please.

660
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,530
Would you hurry up?

661
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,760
Where's it? Hurry.

662
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,380
Hang in there.

663
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,390
Where is it?

664
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,380
Where's it?

665
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,010
We're almost there.

666
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,370
Can't you get another doctor for me?

667
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,600
I don't want these rookies

668
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,610
and this pregnant woman.

669
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,610
Be quick!

670
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,230
Please show some respect

671
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,110
to our doctor.

672
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,770
Director Huang

673
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,880
is very experienced.

674
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,350
Her professionalism won't be affected by pregnancy.

675
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,780
If there's

676
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,720
any problem with my child,

677
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,590
I won't let any of you go.

678
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,870
Please calm down.

679
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,520
Many reasons can cause

680
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,810
abnormal fetal heart rate.

681
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,600
I don't care

682
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,630
and I don't want to care.

683
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:47,930
If something

684
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,740
happens to my child,

685
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,970
you're all responsible for it.

686
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,990
Mister,

687
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,930
please keep calm.

688
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,370
Let's do the check-up first.

689
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:53,940
Check-up.

690
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,800
Then hurry up

691
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,670
and do the check-up!

692
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,390
Move it!

693
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,760
Why are you wasting time here?

694
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,690
All you know is

695
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,590
to collect money.

696
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,470
Could you show

697
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,420
some respect to us?

698
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,350
Everyone

699
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,530
is worrying about your baby,

700
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,300
but you

701
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,100
have been abusive all the time.

702
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,470
You're the one who's been wasting time.

703
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,580
If something really happens to the baby,

704
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,390
it's your problem.

705
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,930
My child's heart stopped beating

706
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,860
while you were around,

707
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,140
and now you're passing the buck to me.

708
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,570
I'm going to beat you.

709
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,540
Hey, calm down.

710
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,590
I'm gonna beat you now.

711
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,580
What are you doing?

712
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,290
None of your business.

713
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,870
Go do the check-up.

714
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,980
Be careful.

715
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,910
Come on, let's go.

716
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,580
I'm warning you.

717
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,750
This is a hospital.

718
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,270
Stop making a scene,

719
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,200
or I won't go easy on you.

720
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,060
What's the huge meal for?

721
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,020
For our big heroine.

722
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,360
It's Director Huang's treat.

723
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,860
Great. More treats will be better.

724
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,190
Hey, where did you learn that

725
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,200
and who did you learn from?

726
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,820
I've been working out in the gym for two years,

727
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,510
don't you know?

728
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,950
I know you've been to the gym,

729
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,850
but I didn't know

730
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,800
you did strength training.

731
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,380
Then what else am I supposed to do?

732
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,410
Jogging?

733
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,970
Let me join you.

734
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,300
It's enough to have me protect you.

735
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,930
Why do you want to join me?

736
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,130
Sometimes I also want

737
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,060
to protect others.

738
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,350
Such as Director Huang?

739
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,340
Senior.

740
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,480
What is it?

741
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,960
Why aren't you with the interns?

742
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,990
What are you doing here?

743
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,380
How could you do this?

744
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,620
Let me explain.

745
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,110
Du Di didn't mean to do it.

746
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,060
How could you

747
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,010
do such a cool thing

748
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,110
when I was not around?

749
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:51,700
Do you know

750
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,540
how sad I feel

751
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,550
that I didn't

752
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,860
witness your heroic deed

753
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,430
and could only

754
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,610
watch the video shared by others?

755
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,060
Make it up to me.

756
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,330
Hello?

757
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,130
Du Di.

758
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,820
Director Tian asked us

759
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:07,530
to go to his office.

760
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,930
Is he going to reward you?

761
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,140
I'm going with you.

762
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,110
You got physical with the patient's husband

763
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,190
and the video was posted online.

764
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,540
Now he's complaining about us

765
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,420
based on this video,

766
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000
saying that you wronged him.

767
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,410
The hospital wants me to deal with it severely.

768
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,440
How could you do such a thing

769
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,230
to tarnish the hospital's reputation?

770
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,060
Du Di,

771
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,260
I think

772
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,090
you're going to get fired.

773
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,340
Director Tian.

774
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,960
It was him who started all this.

775
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:30,860
Director Huang

776
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,190
is heavily pregnant,

777
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,520
and he kept pushing her.

778
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,710
You don't know how dangerous it was.

779
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,900
Du Di only did that to protect

780
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,840
me and Director Huang.

781
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,620
How dare he make complaints?

782
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,870
I think he deserved that.

783
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,940
So what if he pushed her?

784
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,950
His child's life was in danger,

785
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,980
so he got anxious.

786
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,530
And you just started the fight?

787
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,110
Many of these medical disputes

788
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,720
happened because of

789
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,230
inadequate communication.

790
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,600
Wu Congrui.

791
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,390
Everyone praises you

792
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,380
for getting a high EQ and good communication skills.

793
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,360
That was how you communicate?

794
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,260
Director Tian.

795
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,990
You don't know about the situation.

796
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,270
He's a grown man.

797
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,780
He hit me first.

798
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,300
Du Di only fought him back

799
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,000
because she wanted to help me out.

800
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,960
Then why didn't you

801
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
solve the problem with words

802
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,690
instead of fists?

803
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,340
Anyway,

804
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,780
it was your fault.

805
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,620
This female doctor is so cool!

806
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,010
What are you talking about?

807
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,520
It's really sad to see that

808
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,920
a female doctor has to learn martial arts.

809
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,480
The doctor has a bad attitude.

810
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,670
But that's not a reason

811
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,080
for him to make a scene.

812
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,910
You see?

813
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,060
There's another doctor

814
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,800
who's pregnant here.

815
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,230
Is he trying to murder the baby?

816
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,590
There can be no appeasement with violence against doctors.

817
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,390
The hospital should be equipped with armed police.

818
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,850
OK, stop it.

819
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,590
Director Tian,

820
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,270
Du Di's behavior received

821
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,180
only positive feedback online.

822
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,960
She didn't tarnish the hospital's reputation.

823
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,250
You can't punish them.

824
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,240
You stay out of this.

825
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,430
Go back to work.

826
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,350
I can't stay out of this.

827
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,590
My senior is falsely accused

828
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,410
and I can't do nothing about it.

829
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,530
If you have to fire her,

830
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,900
fire me as well.

831
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,210
Du Di did that to protect me.

832
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,580
You're going to fire me, too.

833
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,500
I think you're trying to

834
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,410
give me a heart attack here.

835
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
You're all doctors.

836
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,230
Don't act on impulses.

837
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,770
It won't do you any good

838
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,710
if you get emotional

839
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,990
when interacting with the patients.

840
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,020
Du Di.

841
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,800
I don't care about the feedback online.

842
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,820
I must take the complaint

843
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,950
against you seriously.

844
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,320
According to the regulations of the hospital,

845
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,060
You'll have a demerit on your record. And write a statement of self-criticism.

846
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,570
Your monthly bonus will also be deducted.

847
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,110
If this happens again,

848
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,010
you'll be fired immediately.

849
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,350
This is unfair!

850
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,690
Are you making me punish you?

851
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,770
Director Huang.

852
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,480
You want to see me?

853
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,740
OK, OK.

854
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:30,900
I'll be there in a minute.

855
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,740
Go, go, go.

856
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,860
All of you leave now.

857
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,450
Go!

858
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:35,630
Director Tian.

859
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,420
-Let's go.
-About this...

860
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,580
We Chinese all like

861
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,250
to say that

862
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,560
"Don't let your child lose

863
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,620
at the starting line."

864
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,650
Because of this,

865
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,710
many parents force their kids

866
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,180
to take extracurricular classes.

867
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,340
I just don't understand.

868
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,520
Shouldn't the parents

869
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,070
be the starting line?

870
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,900
Genetics aside,

871
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,950
even if all the children in the world

872
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,730
are born

873
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,650
with the same physical conditions,

874
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,300
their starting line

875
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,670
should be decided respectively

876
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,470
by the personality, insights, and knowledge

877
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,340
of their parents.

878
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,310
They've already fallen behind,

879
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,550
but they argue that their kids

880
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,340
stand on the same starting line with others.

881
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,780
Can their kids fly?

882
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,250
Also, many pregnant women

883
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,070
take lots of

884
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,260
dietary supplements

885
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,890
during pregnancy,

886
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,660
hoping

887
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,070
their babies will

888
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,340
win at the starting line.

889
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,830
But when the starting gun is fired,

890
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,790
other people's kids

891
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,500
are already at the starting line,

892
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,550
and their babies

893
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,550
are still stuck in the pelvic cavity.

894
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,510
We fight with each other

895
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,780
over status, power, money,

896
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,270
boyfriends and girlfriends,

897
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,540
and once we lose,

898
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,880
we shift the blame on our parents

899
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,380
for letting us lose at the starting line.

900
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,180
I found that

901
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,590
the starting line is just

902
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,420
a perfect excuse.

903
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,830
We can always use it to justify ourselves.

904
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,620
I have a question.

905
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,790
There aren't many people here today.

906
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,140
Can I also use this excuse?

907
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,260
Yes!

908
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,370
I feel better then.

909
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,980
Thank you.

910
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,740
OK.

911
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,330
I was so scared.

912
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,030
If you did get fired

913
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,680
because of me,

914
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,090
I'll never get over it.

915
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,850
If I were really fired

916
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,540
because of this,

917
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,360
I wouldn't regret it.

918
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,610
It means that my workout

919
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,240
is worth it.

920
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,830
We're competitors.

921
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,750
I don't want to disqualify you

922
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,300
from the competition because of me.

923
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,140
Wu Congrui,

924
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,030
becoming the chief resident

925
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,180
is very important to me,

926
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,500
but compared with our friendship,

927
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,780
the latter matters more.

928
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,620
Don't do that.

929
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,970
People are watching.

930
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,760
Senior, wait for me.

931
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,620
What do you have there?

932
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,110
I didn't see how you

933
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,890
made the brave move.

934
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,520
Show it to me again.

935
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,060
Don't be ridiculous.

936
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,890
Go back to your training.

937
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,010
I'm running late.

938
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,300
Have you noticed that

939
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,750
you seem very happy

940
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,540
with Liu Nianbai?

941
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,460
Am I?

942
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,040
You didn't see how he

943
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,880
drove me crazy.

944
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,400
Let's go.

945
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,190
Director Huang's waiting for you.

946
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,130
Yes, I get it.

947
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:11,670
Thank you.

948
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,010
Director Huang, I'm back.

949
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,250
Why is the cesarean section?

950
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,590
The baby's heart rate was normal

951
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,310
when Liu Xiaoyu had the ultrasound.

952
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
But after she came to the ward,

953
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,240
it became abnormal again.

954
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,600
I think it's the umbilical cord.

955
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,880
The baby's heart rate suddenly slowed

956
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,390
to the same level as its mother's.

957
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,230
I decided to

958
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,120
give her a cesarean section

959
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,340
just to be safe.

960
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,680
But the problem is

961
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,500
my child's teacher

962
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,230
called me just now,

963
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,310
and asked me to go to his school

964
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,170
right away.

965
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm going to the operating room,

966
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,060
and my husband's away on business.

967
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,980
Could you go there for me?

968
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,380
Alright, I'm on it.

969
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,610
OK.

970
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,770
Whose kid is he?

971
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,970
He's Director Huang's son.

972
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,650
Director Huang's in another surgery.

973
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
It'll be over soon.

974
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,110
Liu Xiaoyu's fetal heart rate

975
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,110
has skipped many beats.

976
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,990
Do you know what happened?

977
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,820
You've got the result?

978
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,020
We cut her belly,

979
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,270
and found that the baby

980
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,120
was playing with the cord.

981
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,300
If it holds on to the cord tightly,

982
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,130
the heart rate is gone.

983
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,560
People are saying that

984
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,790
this naughty baby

985
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,690
almost killed itself

986
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,160
in its mommy's belly.

987
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,270
Is Liu Xiaoyu's husband

988
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,300
feeling better now?

989
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,820
He's feeling much better.

990
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,180
He bought a lot of candies

991
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,840
for everyone in the ward

992
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,710
and kept

993
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,620
apologizing to Director Huang.

994
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,860
He also withdrew the complaint against me.

995
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,320
But Director Tian said,

996
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,950
still, it doesn't mean

997
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,130
what I did was right.

998
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,340
So he gave me a demerit.

999
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,000
Anyway,

1000
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,270
it's good that the baby is fine.

1001
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,270
This abnormal fetal heart rate

1002
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,580
really confused me.

1003
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,390
I even thought

1004
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,540
it was something supernatural.

1005
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,930
Did you just deliver a baby?

1006
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,830
They don't allow me to go to the operating room,

1007
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,940
so I go to the delivery room instead.

1008
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,140
I'll always keep myself busy.

1009
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,550
Senior, Congrui,

1010
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,660
whose kid is he?

1011
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,179
-Director Huang's son.
-Director Huang's son.

1012
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,090
Cool.

1013
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,580
You finally made it?

1014
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,060
It's tiring

1015
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,520
to study with these kids.

1016
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,050
Let's go to Liuye Island.

1017
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,550
I'm busy.

1018
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,230
I defended you today.

1019
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,889
Aren't you going to thank me?

1020
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,420
Senior.

1021
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,690
Only one glass.

1022
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:33,889
Yes!

1023
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,520
Let's go.

1024
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,820
How's it? Isn't it cool?

1025
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:52,420
Du Di.

1026
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,340
You were so cool.

1027
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,520
I wonder what kind of man

1028
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,429
is worthy of you.

1029
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,460
Let me think.

1030
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,900
First,

1031
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,060
he should be taller than you.

1032
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,220
Second,

1033
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,240
he should have eight-pack abs.

1034
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,540
Third,

1035
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,850
he must have beards.

1036
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,530
Why must he have beards?

1037
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,790
How about someone like me?

1038
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,260
Like you?

1039
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,290
You're too weak.

1040
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,600
Du Di would give you an overarm throw easily.

1041
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,460
That's not true.

1042
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,180
I'm very strong, okay?

1043
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,130
Look.

1044
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,270
Boring. I'm leaving.

1045
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,210
Don't leave.

1046
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,530
You can't leave.

1047
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,170
You just came here.

1048
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,260
Let go.

1049
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:26,900
I won't.

1050
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,720
Unless you show me

1051
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,830
the other skills you've got.

1052
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,030
Why would I show you?

1053
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,600
You're bored?

1054
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,330
You want to get thrown?

1055
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,600
Come on, do it.

1056
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,030
Let go.

1057
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,420
No.

1058
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:37,710
Do it.

1059
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:48,900
Are you satisfied now?

1060
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,410
Are you alright?

1061
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,310
Of course he's alright.

1062
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,050
I did it gently.

1063
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,900
What's wrong?

1064
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,770
My butt hurts.

1065
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,240
You hurt my tailbone.

1066
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,250
How's it possible?

1067
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,750
It... It really hurts.

1068
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,100
Don't move.

1069
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,880
I'm calling an ambulance for you.

1070
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,540
No need.

1071
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,850
Could you... take me home?

1072
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,050
You, send him home.

1073
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,380
I don't want him.

1074
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,230
You hurt me, so you're responsible.

1075
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,230
Exactly, I didn't hurt him.

1076
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,280
There's a camera here.

1077
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,410
Fine.

1078
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,060
I'll take you home, alright?

1079
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,760
Can't you walk properly?

1080
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,550
My butt hurts.

1081
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,380
How can I walk properly?

1082
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,190
It hurts every time I take a step.

1083
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,660
Come on.

1084
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,760
Put your arm around my shoulders.

1085
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,460
What are you doing?

1086
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,950
Senior, what perfume are you wearing?

1087
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,340
84 disinfectant water.

1088
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,060
Then

1089
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,270
you really like men with beards?

1090
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,710
I don't.

1091
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,230
Why?

1092
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,450
It's unhygienic.

1093
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,650
That's a relief.

1094
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,890
I feel sorry for your parents,

1095
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,850
who have raised such a stupid son like you.

1096
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,800
You should feel sorry for my dad,

1097
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,140
but not my mom.

1098
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,690
She left us a long time ago.

1099
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,420
Senior.

1100
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,990
It doesn't matter

1101
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,920
what our parents

1102
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,340
gave us.

1103
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,790
We should get on

1104
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,910
with our own lives.

1105
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,260
Don't be the way they are.

1106
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,620
What do you say?

1107
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:07,500
Careful.

1108
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,680
OK, you're home.

1109
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,210
I gotta go.

1110
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,460
You can't leave.

1111
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,740
Why can't I leave?

1112
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,180
You just gave me an overarm throw.

1113
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,300
I remembered

1114
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,740
that I didn't have a chance to eat my hamburger.

1115
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,970
I haven't had dinner.

1116
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,390
I'm starving.

1117
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,820
Then order a takeout.

1118
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,810
I never eat takeouts.

1119
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,280
I only eat home-cooked dishes.

1120
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,400
Then cook them.

1121
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,030
I can't. My butt hurts like hell.

1122
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,580
You don't need your butt to cook.

1123
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,120
Are you alright?

1124
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,130
I can't get up.

1125
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,740
What kind of food do you have?

1126
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,190
That's what you usually eat?

1127
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,060
The residency training is tiring.

1128
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,600
I only want to lie in the bed after I get home.

1129
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,120
And I don't know how to cook other dishes.

1130
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,660
How about tomatoes with scrambled eggs?

1131
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,370
Great!

1132
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,120
Tomatoes with scrambled eggs

1133
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,990
are my favorite.

1134
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,290
How did you know

1135
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,830
I want a drink?

1136
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,080
I had this hunch.

1137
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,430
But I just remembered

1138
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,620
that I can't drink.

1139
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,490
Weiwei,

1140
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,590
what is that in your hand?

1141
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,580
Are these for me?

1142
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,380
Thank you.

1143
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,080
You can go now.

1144
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,390
Wait.

1145
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,780
What are you talking about?

1146
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,710
Last time I saw

1147
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,870
you only had instant foods in the fridge,

1148
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,150
so I asked my mother-in-law

1149
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,070
to make lots of dumplings

1150
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,740
and steamed buns for you.

1151
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,340
Put them in the fridge,

1152
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,820
and it's not hard to cook them.

1153
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:47,900
You need to eat less

1154
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,590
of those craps.

1155
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,500
Thank you, then.

1156
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,500
Drink some more.

1157
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,110
Finish it.

1158
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,410
OK, you're done.

1159
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,570
Leave.

1160
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,380
The wine is good.

1161
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,380
Fill it up for me.

1162
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,220
You can take it home.

1163
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,130
What's going on here?

1164
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:22,940
What do you mean?

1165
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,740
Why are you so impatient to ask me to leave?

1166
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,940
Liu Nianbai, you got any scallions?

1167
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,150
-What's going on?
-What's going on?

1168
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,050
I get it. I'll leave.

1169
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,360
No, you can't leave.

1170
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,480
Excuse me.

1171
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,880
I didn't know about

1172
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,100
the relationship between you two.

1173
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:51,730
See you around.

1174
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,390
No.

1175
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:52,920
You sit down.

1176
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,680
It's so delicious.

1177
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,110
You two...

1178
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,210
We ran into each other at Liuye Island.

1179
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,800
I fell down

1180
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:07,760
and broke my leg,

1181
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,570
so she brought me back home.

1182
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,570
She pitied me for not having dinner,

1183
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,640
so she cooked me

1184
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,780
-this delicious...
-Who pitied you?

1185
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,680
You forced me

1186
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,620
to cook it for you.

1187
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,410
Anyway,

1188
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,800
it's not what you think it is.

1189
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,990
I have nothing to do with him.

1190
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,230
What's the look on your face?

1191
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,600
What I said was true.

1192
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,690
What you said was not true.

1193
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,150
I didn't volunteer to stay.

1194
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:30,780
Please.

1195
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,650
Don't look at me like that.

1196
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,720
You really misunderstood us.

1197
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:33,500
Alright.

1198
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,760
Just cut it out.

1199
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,160
You've had dinner

1200
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,060
and I don't owe you anything.

1201
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:37,810
I'm out of here.

1202
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,760
No, no, no.

1203
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,270
I'll go. I'll go.

1204
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,180
Still, I have to leave.

1205
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,540
Or you can stay.

1206
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,390
I'm going now.

1207
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,010
I can't stay here.

1208
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,860
I was going to leave.

1209
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,840
You haven't finished your wine.

1210
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,310
I was wondering why these stitches

1211
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,410
looked so familiar.

1212
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,860
So it was Du Di.

1213
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,640
It's another misunderstanding.

1214
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,330
It's fine, I get it.

1215
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,970
Everything starts with misunderstandings.
