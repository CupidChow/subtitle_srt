4
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:41,890
Shut up.

5
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,960
It seems that having a drink

6
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,320
is really relaxing.

7
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,860
Dr. Huang.

8
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,250
You've recovered so well.

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,789
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,850
My puerperium is over.

11
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,940
Why can't I come here?

12
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,220
You're really a hardcore mom.

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,520
Coming to a bar soon after the puerperium?

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,470
I come

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,460
to talk to you

16
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,430
about Wang Xiaoke.

17
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,820
Don't start it.

18
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,800
I won't let a tragedy like this

19
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,700
happen again.

20
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,900
I'm not trying to persuade you.

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,300
I just want to remind you of the fact that

22
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,540
since Feng Ke passed away,

23
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,610
first,

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,890
medical science has been advancing.

25
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,730
Treatment of cervical cancer in pregnancy

26
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,220
is more precise than ever.

27
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,190
Second,

28
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,550
isn't the best way to memorize Feng Ke

29
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,560
making sure

30
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,770
Wang Xiaoke

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,690
and her baby are safe?

32
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,270
I admit I hadn't thought of

33
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,130
this possibility.

34
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,040
I believe it was also the belief

35
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,190
that she and the baby would be safe

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,020
that supported Feng Ke

37
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,260
to fight till the last moment.

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,110
Wang Xiaoke has a different type

39
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,020
of cancer cells.

40
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,320
Are you willing to rise to this challenge?

41
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,620
Lin Wei,

42
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,020
you and I came to Shengji at the same time.

43
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,140
You used to be my

44
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,329
No. 1 rival.

45
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,840
If you haven't given up

46
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,150
scientific research completely

47
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,050
after Feng Ke's death,

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,740
I believe you would be

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,090
a strong contender

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,170
for the director.

51
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,810
I feel so lonely

52
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,580
after losing a rival like you.

53
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,760
Lin Wei, pull yourself together.

54
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,690
Fight on for Feng Ke.

55
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,270
Because only if you become better,

56
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,600
can you save

57
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,579
more patients like her.

58
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,520
How are you doing lately?

59
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,220
Struggling with the divorce case.

60
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,520
He doesn't want to divorce

61
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,340
and has a strong team of lawyers.

62
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,630
Is there anything I can do for you?

63
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,380
In my absence,

64
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,900
maintain the operation of the department.

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
That'll be a great help.

66
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,170
Dr. Lin.

67
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,710
What's up?

68
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,680
Is there something wrong?

69
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,580
I hope Xiaoke

70
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,490
can be alive.

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,280
If I have to choose, I'll give up the baby.

72
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,020
I'll convince her.

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,870
If necessary,

74
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,330
we can terminate the pregnancy now.

75
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,220
I...

76
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,610
Even if she hates me,

77
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,970
I have to keep her alive.

78
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,260
Come on.

79
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,300
Sit down first.

80
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,640
Thank you

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,670
for making this decision.

82
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,100
I have thought it over these days.

83
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,850
We all hope

84
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,180
Wang Xiaoke can live,

85
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,240
but no one

86
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,180
can deprive her of her will.

87
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,460
Her greatest wish

88
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,570
is to keep the baby.

89
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,980
Then as a doctor,

90
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,620
all I can do is

91
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,380
to respect her will

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,560
and do my best to help her realize it.

93
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,420
But,

94
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,909
didn't you say before

95
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,860
it's highly risky?

96
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,540
Yes.

97
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,930
That's how my wife died.

98
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,670
And it left me with

99
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,180
a lifetime of regret and resentment.

100
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,270
But it's irresponsible

101
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,090
to determine that

102
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,630
your choice

103
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,780
would definitely

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,990
take a bad turn.

105
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,450
Dr. Lin,

106
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,690
you've been there,

107
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,520
so you can understand

108
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,300
I'm torn and in pain.

109
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,770
I'm really confused now.

110
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,140
I ask myself every day

111
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,000
if I should listen to you

112
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,900
and save Xiaoke,

113
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,300
or take the chance as Xiaoke wants

114
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,260
to save the baby.

115
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,320
I've been thinking about it for days.

116
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,630
I finally made up my mind

117
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,630
to accept your advice,

118
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,650
but now you...

119
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,260
I...

120
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,450
Actually, Director Tian and I

121
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,670
had a couple of consultations

122
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,820
with doctors from other hospitals

123
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,940
on Wang Xiaoke's condition.

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,409
We all agreed that

125
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,640
her condition

126
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,740
is cautiously optimistic.

127
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,380
For her condition,

128
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,870
the most feasible way is

129
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,000
neoadjuvant chemotherapy,

130
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,050
NACT.

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,350
But didn't you say

132
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,660
it would have a great impact on the fetus?

133
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,770
Over the years,

134
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,910
new chemotherapeutic drugs

135
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,740
have been invented.

136
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,900
Treatment and drug administration

137
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,140
are also being improved.

138
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,650
Although the data on pregnancy combined with

139
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,490
cervical cancer are not sufficient,

140
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,570
from the data available,

141
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,630
multi-drug therapy

142
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,710
with platinum-based drugs

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,940
poses little risk

144
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,630
to the development of the fetus,

145
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,160
so the effective rate

146
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,040
among pregnant women with cervical cancer

147
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,100
is 60% or more.

148
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,000
60%.

149
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,130
So, are we gonna be

150
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,230
one of the 60% fortunate survivors

151
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,990
or the 40%

152
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,580
who fail?

153
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:51,610
It's

154
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,710
still a gamble in the real sense.

155
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,850
If you think we are

156
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,150
fighting the disease,

157
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,340
then it is indeed a gamble.

158
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,790
Because there are many human diseases

159
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,470
that can't be cured by drugs,

160
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,580
such as the one we're so familiar with,

161
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,340
hypertension.

162
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,770
But if you think

163
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,880
the decision we're making

164
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,590
is gambling,

165
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,940
I don't agree

166
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,280
because this is

167
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,250
a prudent and responsible decision

168
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,240
within the limit of medical science.

169
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,890
Let me ask you.

170
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,890
Can you join me in

171
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,640
close monitoring?

172
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,950
Can you cooperate with me

173
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,510
to proceed with

174
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,300
neoadjuvant chemotherapy

175
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,200
while getting ready

176
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,510
to give up the baby when we have to?

177
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,670
Let's help her

178
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,670
keep the baby for 32 weeks.

179
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,010
If her condition deteriorates

180
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,510
before that,

181
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,220
we'll terminate the pregnancy.

182
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:41,710
Dr. Lin,

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,190
I want to ask a question that might make you uncomfortable.

184
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,340
Go ahead.

185
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,150
Will you take responsibility for this?

186
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,940
I will.

187
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,230
OK.

188
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,460
Dr. Lin,

189
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,600
my wife and baby's lives

190
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,440
are in your hands now.

191
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,540
Honey,

192
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,810
you'll have chemotherapy tomorrow.

193
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,130
It's gonna be hard for you.

194
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm willing to do anything for the baby.

195
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm just worried.

196
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,680
When I lose my hair after chemo,

197
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,070
will you give all your love

198
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,040
to the baby?

199
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,260
It's impossible.

200
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,740
I will buy you

201
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,690
the best wig,

202
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,180
exactly the same as your own hair.

203
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,900
Stay strong.

204
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:42,890
Mom.

205
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,140
I'd like to tell you something.

206
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,820
I've got a boyfriend.

207
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,110
You like him very much.

208
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,210
It's Dr. Liu,

209
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,420
Liu Nianbai.

210
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,220
He's tall and handsome.

211
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,140
And he's got the smile

212
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,940
that can lift all shadows.

213
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,060
Mom.

214
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,020
in the past,

215
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,740
if I told you I had a boyfriend,

216
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,780
you would

217
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,130
be so happy.

218
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
You'd dance

219
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,210
and hold my hands.

220
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,290
Mom.

221
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,710
Get up and listen to me.

222
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,200
Dr. Du,

223
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,990
you need to pay the medical bills this month.

224
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,960
Your deposit has run out.

225
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,280
It'd be OK if the amount is small,

226
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,220
but when the arrears are in large amount,

227
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,430
the system can't give out medicines.

228
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,020
Didn't my dad pay enough money?

229
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,470
At the time, yes.

230
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,430
But you demanded

231
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,500
the best

232
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,620
and the latest medicines.

233
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,020
They're expensive.

234
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,740
Although the hospital

235
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,000
has cut the prices in compliance

236
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,870
with some favorable policies,

237
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,540
it's still a serious cost overrun.

238
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,820
I see.

239
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,050
I'll be down to pay it in a minute.

240
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,100
Do you have the money?

241
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,210
I just went to see your mom.

242
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,540
The nurse said you're here to pay the bills.

243
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,320
I checked it out that

244
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,810
there's a lot of money to pay afterward.

245
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,170
Do you have enough money in your savings?

246
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,020
No.

247
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,860
I put together all the money I have

248
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,380
and only managed to pay the bills for a month.

249
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,780
What about the next month?

250
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,730
What if she has to have surgery?

251
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
I'll figure out something by then.

252
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,650
Let me help you.

253
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,700
No.

254
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,940
I'll get the salary next month.

255
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,060
I know how much

256
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
our salary is.

257
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,060
I really don't need your money.

258
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,290
I'll find a way.

259
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,050
Don't worry.

260
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,710
Then take it as a loan from me.

261
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,380
When your savings run out,

262
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,590
you'll have to borrow from someone.

263
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,020
Borrow from me.

264
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,710
Liu Nianbai,

265
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,610
I understand you want to help.

266
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,060
A loan?

267
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,410
You're my boyfriend.

268
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,630
I'm sure you won't let me return it later.

269
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,070
So you suggested a loan

270
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,750
only to make me

271
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,940
feel better.

272
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,910
Then how can I help you?

273
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,110
You've already helped me a lot.

274
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,620
You've been helping me take care of my mom,

275
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,540
encouraging me

276
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,410
when I was desperate,

277
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,750
staying with me all the time,

278
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,410
and trying all means to make me eat.

279
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,180
And you treated me to

280
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,230
fancy food that I'd take a second thought

281
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,180
before paying for it.

282
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,450
Really,

283
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,720
you've helped me so much.

284
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,860
I accepted all these

285
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,460
because as your girlfriend,

286
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,520
I'd do the same for you.

287
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,970
When I get a raise,

288
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,630
and you need my help,

289
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,900
I will be there for you.

290
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,140
But

291
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,860
my mom's medical bills

292
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,300
are my bottom line.

293
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,040
Let me pay them in my own way.

294
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,620
You

295
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,870
are really different

296
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,640
from other girls.

297
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,140
In fact, every girl

298
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,960
is unique.

299
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,470
The problem is in this society,

300
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,740
there are convergent values

301
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,460
that make many people feel

302
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,900
it's right to do this

303
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,100
and it's right to think that way.

304
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,700
I just don't get influenced by them.

305
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm so lucky

306
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,680
to have such a special girlfriend.

307
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,480
I'm also lucky

308
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,080
to have such a special boyfriend.

309
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,350
As a male

310
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,540
O.B.,

311
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,330
it is difficult for me not to feel for women.

312
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,280
When we were teenagers,

313
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,950
we all had physiology classes, right?

314
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,690
The school would separate boys

315
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,910
from girls.

316
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,300
A male teacher would say some

317
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,100
mysterious things to the boys,

318
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,730
and a female teacher would also say some

319
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,630
mysterious things to the girls.

320
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,950
When we grew up,

321
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,180
we talked and found that

322
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,700
those mysterious things

323
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,030
are truly mysterious.

324
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,070
The teachers

325
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,190
spent hours

326
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,270
to make things completely

327
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,900
incomprehensible.

328
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,600
Just kidding.

329
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,550
The most popular question

330
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,700
for O.B.

331
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,360
on the Internet is

332
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,750
contraception.

333
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,220
Please.

334
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,140
It's a problem we can make clear in one class.

335
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,570
Why make it so obscure?

336
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,210
Why let the girls

337
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,430
hurt their bodies

338
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,570
time and time again easily?

339
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,460
Until now,

340
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,590
there are still a lot of girls

341
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,990
who believe all kinds of strange

342
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,770
contraceptive methods.

343
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,580
I can only tell them

344
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,250
over and over again.

345
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,820
First,

346
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,940
listen to a real doctor's advice.

347
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:25,820
Second,

348
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,850
if your boyfriend

349
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,220
refuses to use protection,

350
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,560
then please make sure you refuse him.

351
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,800
And many girls say

352
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,180
"I don't want to take birth control pills.

353
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,620
I'm afraid of side effects."

354
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,780
The phrase "side effects"

355
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,960
is a monster

356
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,150
for many.

357
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,230
A number of them even turn a blind eye

358
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,620
to the positive effects.

359
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,430
I'd like to ask

360
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,530
the ladies here a question.

361
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,810
The positive effect of marriage is that

362
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,580
you'll have someone to love you.

363
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,710
The side effect is that you may find that

364
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,710
your husband

365
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,020
loves games more than he loves you.

366
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,400
Will you not marry him?

367
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,910
I don't.

368
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,330
No.

369
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,330
But it seems OK.

370
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,860
This kind of man is not worthy.

371
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,890
Another example.

372
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,180
The positive effect of eating is survival

373
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,250
and satisfaction.

374
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,980
Its side effect is obesity.

375
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,780
Will you not eat?

376
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,820
No, we have to eat.

377
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,550
Right, we all have to eat.

378
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,880
I just want to know.

379
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,590
When are we going to stop

380
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,380
feeling sorry for these girls?

381
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,620
What can we do for them

382
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,350
before they're hurt?

383
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,100
The answer is,

384
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,180
please,

385
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,430
share my talk show

386
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,380
with them.

387
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,370
That's great!

388
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,190
[Shengji Hospital]

389
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,570
This way?

390
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,960
How much longer do we have to wait?

391
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,260
That way.

392
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,020
OK.

393
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,940
Xiaojuan,

394
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,860
what are you doing here?

395
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,230
You have a medical examination?

396
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,250
What is the problem?

397
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,890
Let me take a look for you.

398
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm not trying to pry into your privacy.

399
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,500
I just

400
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,060
instinctively want to help you.

401
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,460
I'm sorry.

402
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
It's OK. Never mind.

403
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,990
I'm having a physical examination.

404
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,310
There are still several tests

405
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,900
to do.

406
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,130
See you around.

407
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,910
Can you get my report?

408
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,420
This one.

409
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,740
Do you know that woman

410
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,570
just now?

411
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,530
Why do you ask?

412
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,220
Ultrasound shows

413
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,350
suspicion of ovarian cancer.

414
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,880
After she got the report,

415
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,610
she checked it

416
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,870
and rushed over to ask me

417
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,620
if I got the wrong result.

418
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,150
And she asked what it means by suspicion

419
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,500
and the possibility

420
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,140
that it's real.

421
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,060
I explained a lot to her.

422
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,220
Excuse me.

423
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,900
It's OK.

424
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,480
Just a sec.

425
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,510
Hello, what's up?

426
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,190
Dr. Lin,

427
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,290
I'm sending a report

428
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:33,870
to your email.

429
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,740
Please take a look at it.

430
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,220
I'm with a patient. Maybe later?

431
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,520
It's urgent.

432
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,300
Take a look now.

433
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,700
Hold on.

434
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,110
What do you want to show me except for ovarian cancer?

435
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,940
Are you sure it's ovarian cancer?

436
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,720
You went to a medical school.

437
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,450
If that's not ovarian cancer,

438
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,290
then what is?

439
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,460
Arrange for hospitalization.

440
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,520
Dr. Du,

441
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,569
what's up?

442
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,300
Xiaojuan,

443
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,340
I'll get you an appointment.

444
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,400
Appointment for what?

445
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,340
Let Dr. Lin take a look at you.

446
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,210
I'm fine.

447
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,550
What do you want me to see Dr. Lin for?

448
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,300
Your ultrasound report

449
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,310
shows something wrong, doesn't it?

450
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,110
There's nothing wrong.

451
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,960
You didn't look well

452
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,670
when you got the report.

453
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,720
I wasn't allowed to eat

454
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,980
in the morning to do the tests.

455
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,830
So many of them

456
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,010
and they drew a lot of blood.

457
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,260
That's why I looked pale.

458
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,620
I'm OK.

459
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,500
Xiaojuan,

460
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,200
some diseases are not incurable.

461
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,890
If treated early, they can be cured.

462
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,680
Don't waste your time.

463
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,220
I really have nothing wrong.

464
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:02,580
Xiaojuan,

465
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,110
if you don't go,

466
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,020
I'll tell Li Junxiao.

467
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,430
Stay out of our family's business.

468
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,820
Xiaojuan!

469
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,580
What are you doing with the food?

470
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,600
Don't like the lunch?

471
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,160
I couldn't eat.

472
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,870
Still worried about Xiaojuan?

473
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,910
I'm really worried.

474
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,540
It's gonna be a problem if she drags on.

475
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,370
She refused to admit it

476
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,740
and said I cursed her.

477
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,330
I think she is too scared.

478
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,700
Is she?

479
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,640
No matter who it is,

480
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,560
when it comes to cancer,

481
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,850
their first reaction is fear.

482
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,140
People are so afraid of

483
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,290
the word "cancer".

484
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,630
Although in modern medicine,

485
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,710
a lot of cancers

486
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,860
have become chronic diseases,

487
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,290
people's fear of the word

488
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,520
has been deeply rooted.

489
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,940
So it may take some time

490
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,580
for her to accept it.

491
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
What do you think I should do?

492
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,170
Educate her about medical science,

493
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,230
but don't make it purposely.

494
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,610
Let her know that early-stage ovarian cancer

495
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,570
is not as scary as she thinks

496
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,690
and she needs treatment.

497
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,290
Good idea.

498
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,830
Take your time.

499
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,060
But I'd rather choose

500
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,590
another way,

501
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,650
the simple and brutal one.

502
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,120
Don't push her.

503
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,850
I'll go to her immediate family.

504
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:12,740
I'm not lying to you.

505
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,380
Here.

506
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,980
Here's her report.

507
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,840
I advised her to go

508
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,460
to see Dr. Lin.

509
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,400
But she didn't.

510
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,060
I don't think there's much time to waste.

511
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,240
Even if it's an invasion of her privacy

512
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,310
and against her wishes,

513
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,060
I think I should let you know.

514
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,420
Are you fighting again?

515
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,130
No.

516
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
We argued over a case.

517
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,510
Trust me.

518
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,780
Can I really?

519
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,220
Of course.

520
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,010
By the way,

521
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,680
Dr. Huang asked

522
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,030
if the patient in Bed 56

523
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,090
can be discharged today.

524
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,380
If she can,

525
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,620
you need to let her know as soon as possible.

526
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,740
OK.

527
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,740
So no fight between you?

528
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,600
-No.
-No.

529
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,660
Thank you.

530
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,250
But I hope you tell no one else

531
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,890
about this for the time being,

532
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,540
especially not Wu Congrui.

533
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,820
Why do you want to hide it from her?

534
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,100
I don't want her to worry.

535
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,020
That's nice of you.

536
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,980
Don't worry, I won't.

537
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,680
Junxiao.

538
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,630
You're back!

539
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,620
Have you had dinner?

540
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,300
I ate at the hospital.

541
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,560
Takeout.

542
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,050
That's too simple.

543
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,080
I'll get some noodles for you.

544
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,470
I need to talk to you.

545
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,220
Show me

546
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,840
all your medical reports.

547
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,100
What medical reports?

548
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,520
Wu Congrui told me

549
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,790
you went to the hospital

550
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,140
to check if you can get pregnant.

551
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,700
You did

552
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,850
all the necessary tests, didn't you?

553
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,590
Give me the reports.

554
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,420
Um...

555
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,810
I haven't got the reports yet.

556
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,140
Don't lie to a doctor.

557
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,020
Xiaojuan,

558
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,370
I have to hospitalize you.

559
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,180
No.

560
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,220
I'm fine.

561
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,470
For now, it's just

562
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,140
a cyst in one of your ovaries.

563
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,180
No pelvic or abdominal fluid is found.

564
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,660
The greater omentum hasn't thickened.

565
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,780
There is no sign of abdominal cavity metastasis either.

566
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,120
Now it seems likely that

567
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,780
it's still in the early stage.

568
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,340
Xiaojuan,

569
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,780
we still have hope.

570
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,690
Go to the hospital.

571
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,460
So,

572
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,420
it's really cancer.

573
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,940
Xiaojuan, don't be afraid.

574
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,110
Not all cancers are incurable.

575
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,330
And we found it early.

576
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,740
How did it happen?

577
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,070
I...

578
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,660
I'm just about to get married.

579
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,930
I still want to have a baby.

580
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:12,900
No.

581
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,180
Why? How did I...

582
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,520
How did I get cancer?

583
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,260
Xiaojuan,

584
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,100
don't do this.

585
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,420
It's really not serious.

586
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,910
If you go to the hospital

587
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,650
right now,

588
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,040
it's likely you'll be fine.

589
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,210
How much...

590
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,040
How much does it cost to be hospitalized?

591
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,720
Xiaojuan,

592
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,350
don't you see the severity here?

593
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,540
Forget about the money.

594
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,430
No matter how much it takes,

595
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,650
we'll get the treatment.

596
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,500
Come, let's go now.

597
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,980
Let's go, Xiaojuan.

598
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,600
No treatment.

599
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,530
I'll cancel the wedding.

600
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,570
I can't be a burden to Wang Dacheng,

601
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,400
or you.

602
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,940
I won't spend a penny of my savings.

603
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,330
They're for your wedding.

604
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,690
Xiaojuan.

605
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,290
What you said just now

606
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,580
makes me a heartless man.

607
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,100
To pay for my education,

608
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,060
you gave up too much.

609
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,730
Now you wanna give up your life

610
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,580
for my wedding?

611
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,530
Look at me.

612
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,630
We have to get the treatment.

613
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,510
Not only that,

614
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,860
we'll cure it.

615
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,680
I want you to be

616
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,800
a healthy bride.

617
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,100
And you'll have a baby boy.

618
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,540
You're back!

619
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,500
Warm welcome!

620
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,140
You look good.

621
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,240
Welcome back healthy, Director Huang!

622
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,040
Today,

623
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,220
I'll treat everyone to a nice lunch.

624
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,980
Don't.

625
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,960
I found it weird of you

626
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,070
being so nice to me all of a sudden.

627
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,170
Look,

628
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,390
you're the same,

629
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,680
always putting a damper on me.

630
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,440
How are you holding up?

631
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,540
I'm totally fine.

632
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,620
The consultation 42 days after delivery

633
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,510
finds my condition great.

634
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,560
I've seen the psychiatrist too.

635
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,520
It just takes some medications

636
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,650
and a little observation, then I'll be fine.

637
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,400
Actually, you don't have to come back now.

638
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,260
Yes, we're understaffed,

639
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,160
but look at you,

640
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,090
a working mom of two kids.

641
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,210
I'm afraid it's just too much for you.

642
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,890
That's what I came

643
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,880
to discuss with you.

644
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,900
I can balance home and work.

645
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,110
My parents are here with us.

646
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,140
We also hired a nanny.

647
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,520
I'm sure they'll take good care

648
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,480
of the kids.

649
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,020
It's just...

650
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,940
I want to

651
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,220
spend more time with the kids

652
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,780
until Sichen

653
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,300
is stable mentally.

654
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,910
And I have to fight

655
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,180
for the kids' custody.

656
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,160
So,

657
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,450
I plan

658
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,960
to hand over a research program

659
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,800
and some administrative responsibilities

660
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,430
to Lin Wei.

661
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,900
I have long wanted to let him

662
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,040
share more of the work,

663
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,980
but

664
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,330
he turned me down every time I asked.

665
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,650
You want to promote him

666
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,680
so that he can do more work.

667
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,640
He certainly does not want that.

668
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,260
But if it's to help me,

669
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,420
maybe he'll do it.

670
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,620
Good idea.

671
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,790
With this opportunity,

672
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,490
he can also make some achievements

673
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,620
and go up the ladder.

674
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,890
Then you should talk to him.

675
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:14,690
OK.

676
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,150
Then let's

677
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,290
make the ward rounds.

678
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:17,800
Let's go.

679
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,360
Make the ward rounds.

680
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,220
Welcome back, Director Huang.

681
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,170
Thank you.

682
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,210
Welcome back.

683
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,740
No matter what happens,

684
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,320
we got your back.

685
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,920
Thank you so much, Ms. Wang.

686
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,280
I'm gonna be fine.

687
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,340
Don't worry.

688
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,170
The flowers are so beautiful.

689
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,000
Will you keep them for me?

690
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,440
I'll come back to get them after the ward rounds.

691
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,900
OK.

692
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,210
Dr. Tian,

693
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,960
shall we?

694
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,340
OK.

695
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:05,690
Let's go.

696
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,630
Why did you kick me?

697
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,210
The operation is a success.

698
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,360
The baby is fine too.

699
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,790
Thank you.

700
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,090
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

701
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,420
You may not know

702
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,290
how I got through

703
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,740
the last few months.

704
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,020
I understand.

705
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,110
I really do.

706
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,080
I know.

707
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:58,950
All right.

708
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,770
What job do you want to assign me?

709
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,550
A program I applied

710
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,320
last year.

711
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,700
The research on pregnancy combined with

712
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,760
cervical cancer.

713
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,860
You know

714
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,510
I've been busy with a lawsuit

715
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,930
and my two kids.

716
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,970
So I hope

717
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,310
to cut down substantially

718
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,340
on my commitment to work.

719
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,990
Can you take over

720
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,790
this program for me

721
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,730
and publish a paper as the first author

722
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,630
on a top journal?

723
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,570
I'll take over for you temporarily.

724
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,350
No problem.

725
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,220
But to publish the result for you?

726
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,650
No, I can't do that.

727
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,940
But I can share with you

728
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,110
all the experience

729
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,000
I've gained in the years

730
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,380
in the study of pregnancy

731
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,560
combined with cervical cancer.

732
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:41,930
As for the first author,

733
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,230
no, thanks.

734
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,200
Because I don't want to be a doctor anymore.

735
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,170
Why?

736
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,280
I promised Feng Ke that

737
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,890
when I performed 8,000 operations,

738
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,050
I'd take her to Nepal.

739
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,080
So far,

740
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,780
it's only a few to go.

741
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,290
I've made up my mind.

742
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,070
When it's done,

743
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,140
I'll resign and leave the hospital.

744
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,780
I want to

745
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,120
first take Feng Ke's ashes

746
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,310
to the Annapurna,

747
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,790
and then change my career completely.

748
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,240
Do you have to do that?

749
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,760
With all those experiences in the past years

750
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,850
and a little scientific achievement,

751
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,680
you'll be a directing doctor of Shengji.

752
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,960
Do you think I care?

753
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,790
My mission has been accomplished.

754
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,210
Don't worry.

755
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,380
I'll take over your job

756
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,080
temporarily.

757
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,240
But in the long run,

758
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,430
you'll have to find a new successor.

759
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,530
Junxiao,

760
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,390
you're finally here.

761
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,100
How about I give you a tour first?

762
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,700
This way.

763
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,500
Is this a special-purpose clinic?

764
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,410
General.

765
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,070
We're a private hospital.

766
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,850
So the hardware is the same no matter in general or special-purpose clinics.

767
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,280
And the size of each consulting room

768
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,540
is bigger than that of Shengji's.

769
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,540
In addition,

770
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,600
we have 20 ultrasound rooms.

771
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,470
All are on the same floor.

772
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,630
Patients can have ultrasound tests

773
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,760
basically without waiting in lines.

774
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,320
This way.

775
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,630
Come on.

776
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,510
Sit here please.

777
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,610
How do you feel?

778
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,110
Your hospital has such good hardware.

779
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,390
Why did you go to Shengji

780
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,100
for that kind of hardship?

781
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,610
No matter how good a hospital's hardware is,

782
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,440
you still need famous doctors,

783
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,990
don't you?

784
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,420
The doctors in our own hospital

785
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,140
all have

786
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,680
formal practice licenses, though,

787
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,790
patients recognize

788
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,080
large hospitals for their fame.

789
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,980
My dad didn't want me to come back

790
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,380
until I became an attending doctor in Shengji.

791
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,860
But I couldn't hold out any longer.

792
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,020
It was too hard.

793
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,470
Instead of struggling for 6 or 7 years by myself,

794
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,110
I'd rather just

795
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,940
poach doctors from Shengji.

796
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,420
Shengji Hospital has

797
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,970
so many attending,

798
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,900
directing,

799
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,740
and deputy directing doctors.

800
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,810
Why me?

801
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,140
Because I like you, of course.

802
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,930
If the doctor I recruit

803
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,910
is also going to be my husband,

804
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,270
my dad will be so happy.

805
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,660
What do you think?

806
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,790
I have a girlfriend.

807
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,370
I know.

808
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,190
But you're not married yet.

809
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,260
I still have a chance.

810
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,490
Don't worry.

811
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,120
I will not

812
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,260
trade anything of work

813
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,520
for your love.

814
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,290
But I won't stop liking you.

815
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,890
I'll prove to you how much I love you.

816
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,610
Doctor,

817
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,000
can you look at it for me, please?

818
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,910
The doctor said that I have

819
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,680
cervical erosion.

820
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,930
You're in the wrong room.

821
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,030
The doctor in this room

822
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,850
is not working.

823
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,340
Listen to me, you need

824
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,580
to take the surgery as soon as possible.

825
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,810
Go to the next room.

826
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,440
Cervical erosion is not a disease.

827
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,450
It doesn't need surgery.

828
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,830
Who says it doesn't?

829
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,180
Go.

830
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,810
See Director Zhang in Room 6.

831
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,080
She's the best at your disease.

832
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,980
Go there.

833
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:51,620
Go, go, go!

834
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:51,960
OK.

835
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,210
What are you talking about?

836
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,170
Cervical erosion is not a disease at all.

837
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,470
And it doesn't need surgery.

838
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,800
In my hospital, it does.

839
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,790
You're cheating.

840
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,420
You know?

841
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,220
You went to a medical school.

842
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,590
Don't you know that

843
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,300
in 2008,

844
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,770
the Obstetrics and Gynecology, the 7th edition,

845
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,260
had removed it

846
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,570
from the list of diseases?

847
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,770
Cervical erosion is not a disease at all.

848
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,710
It is just a medical misconception

849
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,370
of the cervix uteri.

850
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,260
I know.

851
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,750
But it's the easiest

852
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,550
and most profitable

853
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,220
surgery to do.

854
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,960
Just a burn with a laser,

855
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,640
and you charge over 10,000.

856
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,140
The surgeon's commission is 8,000.

857
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:31,980
And there is not much risk.

858
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,010
So why not?

859
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,490
It's against medical ethics.

860
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,880
It has no impact

861
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,290
on the life of the patients.

862
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,140
It can also dispel

863
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,210
a girl's sense of shame.

864
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:39,940
How is it

865
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,780
against medical ethics?

866
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,910
Cervical surgery

867
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:43,980
may exert an impact

868
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,140
on the fertility of the patient.

869
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,380
When you were in the hospital,

870
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,710
didn't you see those patients

871
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,090
who suffered from damaged function of the cervix uteri

872
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,760
due to the surgery?

873
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,090
Didn't you see those patients

874
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,830
who, to make sure safe deliveries,

875
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,890
have to stitch their

876
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,460
loose cervix uteri

877
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,230
and lie in bed

878
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,000
for months?

879
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,300
Those doctors are so terrible.

880
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,260
Look,

881
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,810
with your skills,

882
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,730
it takes a small effort

883
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,470
as a laser burn.

884
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,580
How could it affect

885
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,530
the patients' fertility?

886
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,660
I will never

887
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,910
do such surgery.

888
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,050
For one operation,

889
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,100
you get 8,000.

890
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,380
And it has no impact

891
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,970
on the patients' life.

892
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,320
You can think of it as a dental cleaning.

893
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,450
One may bleed in a dental cleaning.

894
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,500
While surgery with laser

895
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,660
doesn't even cause bleeding.

896
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,420
Not every woman

897
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
will have a tumor.

898
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,680
The most profitable business in my hospital

899
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,210
are these

900
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,560
minor unspeakable problems.

901
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,100
They dare not go to public hospitals.

902
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
So they come to my hospital

903
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,760
and they don't care how much it costs

904
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,990
because they're too ashamed.

905
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,540
Don't you think so?

906
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,540
I don't think

907
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,940
it can lead to

908
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,140
a medical ethic crisis.

909
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,670
I will give you the best terms.

910
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,170
If in the future your family

911
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,590
needs any treatment,

912
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,300
in my hospital,

913
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,540
it's free of charge.

914
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,840
How about that?

915
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,820
I won't do anything

916
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,310
that'll hurt people.

917
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,580
It won't hurt anyone.

918
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:00,780
Let's go.

919
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,120
Let me show you the contract.

920
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:10,590
Come on.

921
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:25,949
Tell me.

922
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,179
What's wrong with your girlfriend this time?

923
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,409
How do you know it's about her?

924
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,570
Do you ever

925
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,210
ask for my help

926
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,780
for anyone else except for her?

927
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,500
I could.

928
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,100
I just want some advice,

929
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,210
President and Director Liu.

930
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,909
Is there a way in which a doctor receiving residency training

931
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,219
can get more income?

932
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,610
As a doctor receiving standardized residency training,

933
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,540
your job is to

934
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,940
practice and learn

935
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,310
so that you can pass the exam

936
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,550
and go to the next stage.

937
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,300
Forget about an increase in income.

938
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,500
Besides,

939
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,360
after a day of work,

940
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,020
you must be as tired as a dog.

941
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,580
You'd go straight home and sleep.

942
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,540
Do you have the energy to do another job?

943
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,240
We're also ordinary people.

944
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,580
We have financial problems sometimes.

945
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,840
Your mom's family

946
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,340
has a trust fund for you.

947
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,070
So you'll never

948
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,050
face financial crises.

949
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,240
I guess

950
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,780
you're not talking about you.

951
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,940
No, not me.

952
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,340
That's it then.

953
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,170
It's still about your girlfriend.

954
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,450
What?

955
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,780
You can't support your girlfriend?

956
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,660
She doesn't want my support.

957
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,150
She has some backbone,

958
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:43,700
unlike you.

959
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,260
I don't have any backbone.

961
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,740
Oh, you don't even talk back now.

962
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,440
I'm asking for your help.

963
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,050
How could I?

964
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,250
How's your girlfriend's English?

965
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:00,930
Good.

966
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,420
Very good.

967
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,460
Right now,

968
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,740
I have an international cooperation project

969
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,680
that has a lot of literature and documents

970
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,280
to be translated.

971
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,290
I was going to hire a translator

972
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,270
for 800 per thousand characters.

973
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,440
I can hire her.

974
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,340
But there's one thing.

975
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,220
Don't delay my progress.

976
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,440
If she can't do it, let me know.

977
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,330
I'll find someone else.

978
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:20,980
She can do it.

979
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,110
I'm sure she can.

980
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,850
She has to.

981
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,320
Doctor! Doctor!

982
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,120
Please help us.

983
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,330
My daughter has abdominal pain.

984
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,330
Mom.

985
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,220
Are you feeling better?

986
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,570
I don't know

987
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,760
when you're sleeping

988
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,090
and when you're awake.

989
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,340
Would I disturb you

990
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,400
if I talk to you?

991
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,140
Mom.

992
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,910
Nianbai got

993
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,200
a translation job for me lately.

994
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,710
The pay is extremely high

995
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,020
and timely too.

996
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,690
It's enough to cover your medical expenses.

997
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,100
Don't worry.

998
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,220
Are you tired?

999
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,490
I bought coffee.

1000
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,060
Not at all.

1001
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,700
Talking to my mom

1002
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,700
is the most relaxing thing in a day.

1003
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,420
Did you get the pay for the translation?

1004
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,110
Yes, I did.

1005
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,770
But I feel a little strange.

1006
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,300
About what?

1007
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,750
Actually, I think

1008
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,600
my English

1009
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,540
is not that good.

1010
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,590
When translating,

1011
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,850
I even find it quite hard.

1012
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,350
I have to look up the dictionary

1013
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,260
for some terms.

1014
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,030
But they never

1015
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,040
asked me to revise anything.

1016
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,140
They just paid me.

1017
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,880
Their requirement

1018
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,100
is so low, don't you think?

1019
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,020
No.

1020
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,260
It's because my girlfriend's English

1021
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,890
is perfect.

1022
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,850
They find no fault.

1023
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,540
Do you think I don't have

1024
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,600
a clear picture of my capabilities?

1025
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,330
Dr. Ren.

1026
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,180
Sorry.

1027
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
Could you send me

1028
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,340
the finalized documents

1029
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,520
I translated?

1030
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,800
I seem to have

1031
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,750
used a wrong term.

1032
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
I'd like to check it again.

1033
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,200
I don't think so.

1034
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,500
We've checked them.

1035
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,610
They're totally correct.

1036
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,680
I'll send them to you.

1037
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,510
[Quantitative Analysis of Microvesicle Distribution in Human Brain]

1038
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,920
Someone changed it.

1039
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,510
And his English

1040
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,020
is way better than mine.

1041
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,950
It's like a native speaker.

1042
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,700
Liu Nianbai,

1043
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,020
what's this?

1044
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,330
A gift for you.

1045
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,030
What kind of limited edition is this?

1046
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,230
I can't buy any limited edition.

1047
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,110
This is a regular pair.

1048
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,910
But I sewed your name

1049
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,140
on them with stitch thread.

1050
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,950
So it's kind of a special edition.

1051
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,490
This is the most precious

1052
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,730
custom-made sneakers I've ever seen.

1053
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,880
But you're so strapped for cash.

1054
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,820
Why did you buy me shoes?

1055
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,150
I owe you

1056
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,020
half of my translation pay, don't I?

1057
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:32,660
I...

1058
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,920
No.

1059
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,310
I didn't revise much.

1060
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,090
You didn't revise much,

1061
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,240
but I could tell the moment I read it.

1062
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,930
You spent as much time

1063
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:44,860
as I do to translate them.

1064
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,360
And you specifically asked me

1065
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,820
to forward each translation

1066
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,480
to you.

1067
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,780
Then you revised it quickly

1068
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,320
and sent them the revised version.

1069
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,560
Weren't you tired?

1070
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,240
This is the fruit of your labor.

1071
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,510
I thought you didn't have enough time.

1072
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,310
If you had the time,

1073
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,500
I'm sure you'd do a perfect job.

1074
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,050
English is easy for me.

1075
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,850
I wasn't tired.

1076
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,740
Don't be angry.

1077
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,910
I don't want you to feel embarrassed.

1078
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,240
With such a considerate boyfriend,

1079
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,300
why would I be angry?

1080
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,180
From now on, we will share the pay.

1081
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,050
By the way, I have good news for you.

1082
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,270
I've paid all my mom's medical bills

1083
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:17,930
for this month.

1084
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,100
And I have extra money.

1085
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,440
So I'll treat you to dinner.

1086
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,500
I want you to cook for me.

1087
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,550
You can cook so many dishes.

1088
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,990
Then why did you always

1089
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,200
make me scrambled eggs with tomatoes?

1090
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,470
Because tomatoes and eggs

1091
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,060
were the only ingredients I could find at your home.

1092
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,000
I went to the supermarket

1093
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,700
to buy these ingredients

1094
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,780
today.

1095
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,840
Or it would still be

1096
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,640
scrambled eggs with tomatoes tonight.

1097
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,600
And instant noodles.

1098
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,700
I can't talk right now.

1099
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,590
I gotta eat.

1100
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,290
Take your time.

1101
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,600
I can't drink.

1102
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,230
I know.

1103
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,710
So no glass for you.

1104
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,150
Don't drink too much.

1105
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,530
It's such a nice day.

1106
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,580
I certainly don't want to be beaten.

1107
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,610
Don't worry, I won't get drunk.

1108
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,100
What should I get you?

1109
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,530
A shrimp.

1110
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,840
You're really a rare kind

1111
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,590
in this world.

1112
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,330
You're tough.

1113
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,210
You seem to have no weakness.

1114
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,940
And you're good at everything.

1115
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,660
If you were not a doctor,

1116
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,880
I'm sure you'd be

1117
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,070
an elegant woman

1118
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,810
who knows how to enjoy life.

1119
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,270
Actually, I do know

1120
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,700
how to enjoy life.

1121
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,420
I just don't want to waste my time.

1122
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,260
And the pressure

1123
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,740
to become a top doctor

1124
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,560
has been propelling me.

1125
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,460
Life is only a short few decades.

1126
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,390
If I see a goal

1127
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,290
that's very high,

1128
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,140
yet I have the ability to achieve it,

1129
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,100
certainly, I have to strive for it.
