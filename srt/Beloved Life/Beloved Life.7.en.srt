00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,600
Come here.

5
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,720
After the mother gave birth,

6
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,080
hormones changed a lot.

7
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,880
It's normal that she's emotionally unstable.

8
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,350
You can't just take care of your baby.

9
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,620
Mom needs more care.

10
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,220
From now on, you need to learn

11
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,460
to say something nice .

12
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,180
Be gentle. Don't be too oblivious.

13
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,650
You need to learn to express your love.

14
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,770
No wonder

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,930
she had always cried very easily.

16
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,120
Remember, sweetness can solve everything.

17
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,060
Thank you, doctor.

18
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:10,780
Liu Nianbai.

19
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,620
What are you doing?

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,920
You made the mother cry as soon as you came in.

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:14,930
Come out.

22
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,270
Patient No. 17 has a cold and needs a sputum aspiration.

23
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,390
Patient No. 25 has the constipation that needs to be relieved.

24
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,900
The dustmen are too busy.

25
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,560
Go mop the floors

26
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,370
of the wards.

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,640
Why it doesn't sound

28
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,910
like a doctor's job.

29
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,079
That's clinical practice.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,210
Everything in the wards

31
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,960
is your practice.

32
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,180
Every intern

33
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,840
has been through this.

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,300
When can I

35
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:35,860
attend the outpatient department

36
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,440
and the operation?

37
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,100
Just do as I say.

38
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,150
Don't think too much.

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,180
Nianbai.

40
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,140
Sis Congrui,

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:42,860
let's go.

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,550
Follow me to see Dr. Huang's surgery.

43
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,460
What do you mean?

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,430
I told Dr. Huang that

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,820
some clinical tutor

46
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,740
has to make the interns

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,600
to do the carers' job.

48
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,730
Dr. Huang said that

49
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,310
Liu Nianbai is special.

50
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,220
He needs more clinical experience.

51
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,430
She happens to have a surgery.

52
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,180
I'm her assistant.

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,360
Dr. Huang said.

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,760
"bring Liu Nianbai here."

55
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,650
"I also have a surgery later,

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,390
and I need an assistant too."

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,380
Don't you want him to go do a sputum aspiration?

58
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,900
Let him finish his work as an assistant.

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,790
Come to the operating room later.

60
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,340
Thank you, Sis Congrui.

61
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,970
You're welcome.

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,570
I just can't stand

63
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,540
her bullying you.

64
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,860
What about Dr. Huang?

65
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,460
Dr. Huang didn't say anything.

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,300
I just wanted to scare her.

67
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,900
Thank you.

68
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,870
I'll buy you lunch.

69
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,510
No, I'm busy at noon.

70
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,530
You can order some takeouts. I have to thank you.

71
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,500
Wait for me.

72
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,500
I'll be friends with anyone

73
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,500
who you don't get along with.

74
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,770
I'll piss you off, Du Di!

75
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,260
Doctor.

76
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,400
What's wrong?

77
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,160
I'm so nervous.

78
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,120
Take it easy.

79
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,700
The surgery will be done soon.

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,800
Dr. Du

81
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,860
is known for being quick to perform a surgery.

82
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,800
She will bring your baby out in a few minutes.

83
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,060
But it is Dr. Lin that will do the surgery.

84
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,580
Dr. Lin is even better.

85
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,080
But my baby has cord around the neck,

86
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,470
I wonder

87
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,880
if it will affect its intelligence.

88
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,740
Don't worry.

89
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,540
The previous fetal heart monitoring shows that it's fine.

90
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,380
Although there is a cord entanglement,

91
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,399
it's not very tight.

92
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,220
Maybe the baby

93
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,329
felt cold inside,

94
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,180
and took the cord as a scarf

95
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,100
by itself.

96
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,430
Dr. Liu, you're hilarious.

97
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,820
Dr. Lin,

98
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,080
the preparations before the surgery

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,590
are all done.

100
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,380
Don't be nervous.

101
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,740
Don't be nervous. Take it easy.

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,320
I'm hungry.

103
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,930
You weren't allowed to eat before surgery,

104
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,790
indeed you'd be hungry.

105
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,860
I was the same last time.

106
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,190
But not long after it's done,

107
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,870
you can have meals.

108
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,940
What do you like to eat?

109
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,060
Crayfish.

110
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,760
I like crayfish too.

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,040
You know what?

112
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,110
When I was abroad,

113
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,160
I had crayfish too.

114
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,080
Back here

115
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,160
they just get the crayfish boiled

116
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,630
and poured it in a plastic bag.

117
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,900
Put some seasonings in, shake it

118
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,040
and pour it out finally.

119
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,260
Did that taste good?

120
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,550
I think it's okay.

121
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,820
When I came back,

122
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,780
I found out that crayfish

123
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,010
has so many ways to cook.

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,170
Last time I went to a crayfish theme food court

125
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,060
and taste all kinds of foods.

126
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,650
I can't eat spicy food.

127
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,700
So my tear and snot

128
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,260
came out together.

129
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,650
It tasted so good.

130
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,450
Liu Nianbai.

131
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,580
Stop talking and get focused.

132
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:25,940
Doctor,

133
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,780
just let him talk to me.

134
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,530
Talking with him

135
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,900
can make me relax.

136
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,310
It's okay. Let's talk.

137
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,510
I mean we are here

138
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,510
talking about the crayfish.

139
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,130
When the baby is born,

140
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,950
do you think that

141
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,170
your baby would love crayfish?

142
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,250
Of course.

143
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,350
My husband and I

144
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,620
both like crayfish.

145
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,360
The baby is coming.

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,390
So soon?

147
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,930
I told you so.

148
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,790
The baby want to eat crayfish.

149
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,140
The Apgar Score in a minute is eight.

150
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,920
Liu Nianbai, bring the baby here.

151
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,510
A boy, 3,650 grams.

152
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,370
Why are you standing there?

153
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,610
Didn't you ask me to hold the baby?

154
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,550
I told you to bring the baby

155
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,940
to the mother

156
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,030
to see if he's healthy.

157
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,260
Kiss.

158
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,920
It is said that the baby

159
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,260
will look like

160
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,300
the first person he sees after he's born.

161
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,260
You have big eyes

162
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,040
and look handsome.

163
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,580
He's wearing a mask.

164
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,720
How can you still tell he's handsome?

165
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,840
Of course. The mask can't hide

166
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,100
my extreme handsome face.

167
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,180
Shame on you.

168
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,820
Thank you, our new trainee.

169
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Thank you.

170
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,280
Nice to meet you.

171
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,190
He said he'll treat me to dinner

172
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,250
and ordered so many delicious food.

173
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:57,960
You are so generous.

174
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,790
We work so hard every day.

175
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,490
If we don't eat something good,

176
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,670
how can we have the power to save lives?

177
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,870
Nice!

178
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,960
Why our canteen

179
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,300
always provide these dishes?

180
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,050
I've just had enough of the food there.

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,300
Where is Senior Du?

182
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,300
Don’t.

183
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,030
Don’t bring your Senior Du here.

184
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,370
No one would like to eat after she comes.

185
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,820
Why?

186
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,800
You don't know why?

187
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,380
Congrui is her best friend,

188
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,240
but she hurt her as well.

189
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,530
She's annoying to everyone.

190
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,540
Don't mention it. Have some chicken wings.

191
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,080
Junxiao, come and have some pizza.

192
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,740
It's Liu Nianbai's treat.

193
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,260
Nianbai bought it.

194
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,580
Dr. Li, have a piece.

195
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,380
No, I've eaten.

196
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,940
You guys should eat quickly.

197
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,950
Otherwise, this ward will be

198
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,710
occupied by the smell of food after a while.

199
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,810
The director will blame you if she finds out.

200
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,920
Let's make it quick.

201
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,420
No way.

202
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,909
Didn't your handsome junior

203
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,780
invite you to dinner?

204
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,700
He doesn't respect you as his tutor.

205
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,290
If you have time,

206
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,500
arrange your operating room.

207
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,440
I have a headache.

208
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,100
But everything is fine.

209
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,540
Thank you, doctor.

210
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,420
Hello, doctor.

211
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,420
How do you feel?

212
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,660
Pretty good.

213
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,300
Let me see.

214
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,540
Doctors will be there during the surgery

215
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,620
in the afternoon.

216
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,289
His blood pressure is normal.

217
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,549
Listen to me. Take a deep breath.

218
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:42,940
Breathe in.

219
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,380
Hold it.

220
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,320
Push harder.

221
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,690
One more time.

222
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,720
Breathe in.

223
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,620
Hold it.

224
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:57,970
Push harder.

225
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,710
Here, replenish some energy.

226
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,860
Come on! Come on!

227
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,370
You're doing great.

228
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,880
Okay, let's do it again.

229
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,870
Breathe in, hold it and push harder.

230
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,850
Okay, it's out.

231
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,850
Great!

232
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,800
You're a mother now.

233
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,870
Time to go home.

234
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,570
Senior, let's go for a drink.

235
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,110
My treat.

236
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,250
First, don't call me senior.

237
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,880
Second, don't mention drinking anymore.

238
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,270
Don't be so serious.

239
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,700
I promise I won't mention that.

240
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,540
Shut up.

241
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,610
You go to inform

242
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,880
Director Feng Yuanhang from the neonate department .

243
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,150
Tell him that I have

244
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,030
a very important patient

245
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,650
to consult with him.

246
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,900
Why don't you just call him.

247
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,040
He is performing a surgery.

248
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,350
After he finishes,

249
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,090
you tell him yourself.

250
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,150
Why don't you just wait him to finish the surgery

251
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,130
then call him.

252
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,180
Just do what I told you.

253
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,490
What if he has other arrangements

254
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,720
after the surgery?

255
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,650
Okay. I'll go.

256
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,580
Then you will have to go grab a drink by yourself.

257
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
If you mention it again,

258
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,740
I won't be your tutor anymore.

259
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,050
Fine, fine.

260
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,040
Sis Congrui,

261
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,440
It's me, Liu Nianbai.

262
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,980
Why are you here?

263
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,230
Why are you here?

264
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,300
I'm here to see the baby.

265
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,340
Whose baby?

266
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,230
My baby.

267
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,320
No.

268
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm here to see the baby of puerpera that I take charge of.

269
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,690
I'm here to check on him.

270
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,650
I'm done. I'm leaving first.

271
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,990
Why are you still here?

272
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm here

273
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,780
waiting for Dr. Feng.

274
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,550
My senior asked me to tell him

275
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
to have a consultation tomorrow morning.

276
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,270
You don't have to wait.

277
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,500
I just need to send him a message.

278
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,540
No, my senior said

279
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,490
that he might arrange something else.

280
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,660
He's my husband.

281
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,930
I'll talk to him.

282
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,240
That's great.

283
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,180
Did you have dinner?

284
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,220
I'll treat you to dinner.

285
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,540
You've treated me

286
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,140
a few times this week.

287
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,410
It's boring to eat alone.

288
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,450
You're right. Let's go.

289
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,420
I always thought

290
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,900
this place was not good.

291
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,500
I didn't expect hamburger there to be so delicious.

292
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,420
You've never been here?

293
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,670
I got married early.

294
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,330
I'm not as playful

295
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,240
like those single ones.

296
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,740
I remember

297
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,810
when I first came to Shengji,

298
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,650
I came here once.

299
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,780
By yourself?

300
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,060
with Du Di.

301
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,540
That day she drank

302
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,740
seven shots of Long IsIand Iced Teas.

303
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,910
I heard that

304
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,170
she was the one who caused you to miscarry.

305
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,540
Can I ask you a question?

306
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,690
How long have you known each other?

307
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,380
I had been studying for my graduate, postgraduate and doctoral degree for eight years in a row.

308
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,320
Also two years in Shengji.

309
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,940
We've known each other for ten years.

310
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,860
That's too fast.

311
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,890
You should know

312
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,290
what kind of person she is.

313
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,410
Of course.

314
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,850
She worked hard at that time.

315
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,940
If she could,

316
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,980
she would just live in the library every day.

317
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,880
And she's very loyal.

318
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,900
When girls in our class were bullied,

319
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,540
She was the first one to go fight back.

320
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,600
I can't even remember

321
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,250
how many boys

322
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,290
did she fight against in our class.

323
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,960
I remember there was one time

324
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,900
a girl in our dorm

325
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,140
seemed to

326
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,320
have a fight against her boyfriend and want to break up.

327
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,160
She went back and kept crying.

328
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,510
and said that the boy bullied her.

329
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,450
Du Di took that girl with her

330
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,360
and went to find that boy

331
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,190
and beat him up.

332
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,940
And then?

333
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,280
the girl was soft-hearted

334
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,460
and turned out to help him scold her.

335
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,750
After that,

336
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,480
that girl

337
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,750
made up with that guy.

338
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,820
Both of them

339
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,770
didn't talk to Du Di anymore.

340
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,440
I told Du Di.

341
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,780
Are you silly?

342
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,360
Sometimes girls

343
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,620
they don't need loyalty.

344
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,580
but

345
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,590
a way to get your anger out.

346
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,190
From what you know about her,

347
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,610
do you think

348
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,050
she deliberately caused your miscarriage?

349
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,660
Who knows?

350
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,700
I'm sure you know.

351
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,060
Like you said,

352
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,020
sometimes women

353
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,190
is not about loyalty,

354
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,650
but

355
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,990
to get your anger out.

356
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,960
So,

357
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,540
Are you almost done expressing your anger?

358
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,910
She treated you so badly.

359
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,160
Why are you still defending her?

360
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,040
My senior treats me with

361
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,200
high standard and strict requirements.

362
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,810
But she is really good to me.

363
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,280
You are literally a masochist.

364
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,460
You two look perfect together.

365
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,350
She is a sadist,

366
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,960
and you are a masochist.

367
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,830
Please torture me.

368
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,850
Are you stupid?

369
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,240
Anyway,

370
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,140
if you can't get rid of

371
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,100
your miscarriage,

372
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,550
I suggest you

373
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,570
to see a psychiatrist

374
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,260
or psychotherapy.

375
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,410
Are you calling me sick?

376
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,930
Who can't get rid of it?

377
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,100
I've already made it.

378
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,630
It's just a suggestion.

379
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,760
I suggest you eat quickly. It's getting cold.

380
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,640
How many weeks?

381
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,450
28.

382
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,890
I've read the report.

383
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,700
The fetus

384
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,700
has the spina bifida.

385
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,010
What is that?

386
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,170
Spina bifida

387
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,680
is also known as spinal dysraphism.

388
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,420
Spina bifida is a common

389
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,390
congenital malformation.

390
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,270
that occurs when the fetus' spinal cord

391
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,680
doesn't form properly

392
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,200
during the pregnancy.

393
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,500
And spinal fracture

394
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,410
will greatly affect

395
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,480
on the ability of action.

396
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,220
For example,

397
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,460
there will be hydrocephalus, hydroencephaly,

398
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,140
life-long ecal and urine incontinence,

399
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,390
intelligence disorder and so on.

400
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,140
What?

401
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,220
Doctor,

402
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,000
You mean

403
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,790
my child

404
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,790
may be silly.

405
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,420
There's a certain chance.

406
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,730
But it depends

407
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,890
the follow-up treatment.

408
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,660
It's okay, honey.

409
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,190
It's okay.

410
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,950
I mean

411
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,490
both of us are so healthy.

412
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,560
Why the baby got sick

413
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,640
when it's still

414
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,190
in your uterus.

415
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,720
Doctor, say something.

416
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,340
Tell me.

417
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,850
whether we can have the baby or not.

418
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,540
No, that's not what I mean.

419
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,020
We can save the baby,

420
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,770
But the risk of surgery is high.

421
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,950
You mean the Hysteroscopic operation?

422
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,740
Yes.

423
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,850
What do you mean?

424
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,240
Intrauterine surgery is

425
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,710
to cut off the uterus.

426
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,760
Perform the surgery on the fetus

427
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,760
in the uterus.

428
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,120
After the surgery, close the uterus.

429
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,460
So that the fetus can live for a full-term.

430
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,530
The pulmonary function of the 28-weeks fetus

431
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,160
is not fully developed.

432
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,870
So it's best

433
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,200
to let it grow in the uterus.

434
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:19,770
No.

435
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,620
You're just making the mother and baby

436
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,350
suffer.

437
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,680
Doctor, how about this?

438
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,950
After the baby is born,

439
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,950
Just perform surgery on the baby.

440
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,660
Compared to postpartum surgery,

441
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,050
doing the lumbar spinal canal operation

442
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,530
for the fetus in the uterus

443
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,420
can improve

444
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,350
short-term and mid-term outcome.

445
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,640
It can cure the spina bifida

446
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,890
sooner,

447
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,660
so that in the late trimester of pregnancy

448
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,250
will be no more damages to the spine.

449
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,050
Can you make sure that

450
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,380
the baby will be healthy

451
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,080
after the surgery?

452
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,740
I can't guarantee that.

453
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,100
Because any operation

454
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,950
is risky.

455
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,150
Moreover, it's a intrauterine surgery.

456
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
It must be more risky.

457
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,850
But I can only tell you that

458
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,900
we will try our best

459
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,640
to make sure that tissue repair

460
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,370
and back closure of the fetus

461
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,530
are achieved through surgery.

462
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,530
But no matter how successful the surgery is,

463
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,910
the rachischisis can't be

464
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,860
completely cured.

465
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,540
So in the future,

466
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,780
Your baby will need teams from multiple departments

467
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,530
to provide continuous supportive nursing,

468
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,430
including experts in neurology, urology,

469
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,230
orthopedics, pediatrics,

470
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,740
and Neurosurgery

471
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,390
doing the nursing together.

472
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,859
I mean.

473
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,250
Dr. Lin, we don't understand

474
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,150
those professional terms you mentioned.

475
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,790
I really...

476
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,280
I don't understand

477
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,780
what you said.

478
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,050
We've put a lot of effort

479
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,930
to give birth

480
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,380
to a healthy baby.

481
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,480
Now you tell me

482
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,450
after the surgery,

483
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,940
the baby can't be healthy.

484
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
If you say so,

485
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,700
we might as well...

486
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,190
rather than induced abortion.

487
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,340
Listen.

488
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
This is the baby's heartbeat.

489
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,350
Very powerful.

490
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,260
Although it is disabled,

491
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,890
he has strong vitality.

492
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,290
You should give him a chance

493
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,100
to live.

494
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,170
But what if

495
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,330
he's an unhealthy child,

496
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,430
he or she won't be happy, right?

497
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,010
My kid will blame me when he grows up

498
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,790
to give birth to him.

499
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,270
Since Director Feng

500
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,980
proposed the treatment plan

501
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,520
to do an intrauterine surgery.

502
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,690
That means the fetus

503
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,700
could be cured.

504
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,620
Are you going to give up

505
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,440
even without a try?

506
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,550
How about this?

507
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,120
You think about it.

508
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,300
After all, it's a life.

509
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,960
But in my opinion

510
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,120
the probability of the baby being born healthy

511
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,780
is very high.

512
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,550
You shouldn't give up.

513
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,030
Okay, I got it.

514
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,130
I'll discuss with my wife.

515
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,260
Director Feng,

516
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,930
can you tell me

517
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,430
the success rate of the operation?

518
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,440
I don't want them

519
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,410
to give up their baby.

520
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,220
It's hard to say.

521
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,070
Also, there's no need to dwell on it.

522
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,870
The patients has their own demands.

523
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,260
We doctors need to get used to regrets.

524
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,360
But I don't want to

525
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,350
get used to this kind of regret.

526
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,620
Okay.

527
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,810
Tell me if you need anything.

528
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,360
Wu Congrui

529
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,500
has been abnormal lately.

530
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,400
If you have time, help me talk to her.

531
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Recently,

532
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,030
she finally

533
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,700
stopped say bad things to me.

534
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:36,720
However,

535
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
it still will take some time

536
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,980
to listen to me.

537
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,690
I hope she can get over it soon.

538
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,370
Time to go home.

539
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,700
What are you looking for?

540
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,100
I'm looking for the information for the intrauterine surgery.

541
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,420
My senior's patient?

542
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,660
Yes.

543
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,730
I want to see

544
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,490
the cure rate of the spina bifida

545
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,420
after performing the intrauterine surgery.

546
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,230
You want to persuade

547
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,110
Wunan to do the surgery?

548
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,120
Yes. I want to convince them

549
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,310
to save the baby.

550
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,380
But she's not your patient.

551
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,570
She's my senior's case.

552
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,240
You want to help her?

553
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,500
Who wants to help her?

554
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,600
I just want to tell Wunan

555
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,590
many people

556
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,640
in this world want to have kids.

557
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,780
However it's hard for them to have one.

558
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,690
Since they have a chance,

559
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,210
they should save him.

560
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,730
Senior,

561
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,060
Sis Congrui is helping you find information

562
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,890
for the intrauterine surgery.

563
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,670
No, I'm not...

564
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,300
Don't talk nonsense.

565
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,460
I just don't want to see

566
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,570
a mother to have abortion.

567
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,020
If we look up more information,

568
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,280
we can convince them to do the surgery.

569
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,520
Dr. Wu always cares about the patients.

570
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,610
I should learn from her.

571
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,700
I'm in.

572
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,700
Great. You two check together.

573
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,980
I'll prepare dinner for you.

574
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,170
I'll bring you supper, snacks and coffee

575
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,830
to give you

576
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,140
good logistics support.

577
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,820
It seems that

578
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,410
the cure rate is quite high.

579
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,760
Then...

580
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,920
Let's do it.

581
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,190
Great.

582
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,710
Dr. Tian.

583
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,810
Dr. Feng,

584
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,360
I'm counting on you.

585
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,350
Director Feng,

586
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,120
I should be the one asking you.

587
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,340
This is the first Spina bifida surgery

588
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,620
in the city.

589
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,870
After this surgery,

590
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,100
it's a huge breakthrough of Maternal-Fetal Medicine

591
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,610
in our hospital.

592
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,340
Thank you, Director Tian.

593
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,790
Dr. Feng, you are a fine young man.

594
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,340
You have your own ambition

595
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,250
in pediatric surgery.

596
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,130
You have a bright future.

597
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,660
Nianbai,

598
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,880
I heard you've searched a lot

599
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,910
about this surgery.

600
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:19,870
Tell me.

601
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,350
What should we do next?

602
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,600
First of all,

603
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,130
we should cut an incision like a C-section.

604
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,630
to expose the mother's uterus.

605
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,950
And then use ultrasound

606
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,560
to locate the placenta and fetus.

607
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,800
Good.

608
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,070
Let's begin.

609
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,070
The operation time

610
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,260
8:40.

611
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,590
Scalpel.

612
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,800
Gauze.

613
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,230
The fetus's head is out.

614
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,810
The amniotic sac is open.

615
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,350
Inject artificial amniotic fluid.

616
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,270
Connect the pulse oximeter.

617
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,330
The fetus's vital signs are stable.

618
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,100
Dr. Feng.

619
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,670
Let's begin.

620
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,700
Go for it, honey.

621
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,190
The location has changed.

622
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,850
The cord blocked the view of the surgery.

623
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,390
Maybe she rolled over

624
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,900
after she is put under anesthesia.

625
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,260
We can't operate here.

626
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,670
Is it possible to turn it around?

627
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,960
It's too difficult.

628
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,540
I think there's a way.

629
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,350
Go ahead.

630
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,910
Turn her over when she wakes up.

631
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,100
It will take two hours.

632
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:09,990
Why do I feel like that

633
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,290
you are more nervous than your husband?

634
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,090
It's like that

635
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,400
people who watch movies are nervous.

636
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,110
Have you seen a actor in a movie

637
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:17,950
came out

638
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,700
to take a breath?

639
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,300
Don't worry.

640
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,860
It's been over an hour.

641
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,110
The fetus

642
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,170
and the mother's vital signs

643
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,910
are very stable.

644
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,890
It should be fine.

645
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,860
My heart is beating so fast right now.

646
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,580
No wonder.

647
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,180
You're already nervous now,

648
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,210
besides you take

649
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,400
so much caffeine.

650
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,540
Of course your heart is beating fast.

651
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,090
You didn't drink that?

652
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,840
Don't drinking.

653
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,680
Give it to me.

654
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,180
I'm thirsty.

655
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,410
Drink slowly.

656
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,040
Next, I'll stitch up

657
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,430
the muscle membrane and repair the dura defect.

658
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,740
Also the skin

659
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,150
and several single tissues

660
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,280
to cover up the defects.

661
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,920
Pay attention.

662
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,730
Director Feng is separating

663
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,440
the fetus nerves and spine

664
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,400
to let those go back

665
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,350
into the open spinal.

666
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,220
And then cover it by the lateral compartment muscles

667
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,230
and skin.

668
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,920
This technology

669
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,790
is called myofascial closed.

670
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,530
It can fully cover the open area.

671
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,500
In this way,

672
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,930
we can create

673
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,590
a protective tube

674
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,020
made of muscles and skin

675
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,560
to prevent the cerebrospinal fluid from leaking.

676
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,950
Director Tian is really patient

677
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,050
with Liu Nianbai.

678
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,200
Do you want some music

679
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,830
to relax?

680
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,320
What kind of music do you want?

681
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,240
Serenade by Mozart.

682
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,540
It seems the fetus's spinal cord

683
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,810
got the safe protection.

684
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,550
Director Feng,

685
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,360
you've earned a valuable time

686
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,630
for the development of the brain of the fetus.

687
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,340
Great.

688
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,250
The operation is successful.

689
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,350
My mission is completed.

690
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,110
I’m counting on you, Director Tian.

691
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,780
Thank you.

692
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,010
Good luck.

693
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,470
Thank you.

694
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,820
Let's start.

695
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,430
Congrui. Congrui.

696
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,200
Are you feeling better now?

697
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:38,970
Dr. Huang,

698
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,820
What's wrong with me?

699
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,350
You fainted due to nervousness.

700
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,090
I've replenished some liquid for you.

701
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,000
You can’t go to work now.

702
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,840
Director Tian asked you

703
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,450
to come back after you rest well.

704
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,890
I'm fine. I can go to work.

705
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,350
Lie down.

706
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,930
Luckily,

707
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,120
you fainted in the observation room.

708
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,320
If you fainted in the operation room,

709
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,150
that would be huge.

710
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,040
I told Feng Yuanhang

711
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,780
your physical condition

712
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,690
is not suitable for work.

713
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,570
This is not the time for you to be stubborn.

714
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,570
I'm really fine, Director Huang.

715
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,310
I really can't rest anymore.

716
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,010
Normally, I am a trainee

717
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,400
that can't a rest.

718
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,190
I've been resting for days

719
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,230
because of miscarriage.

720
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,210
If I continue to rest,

721
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,420
let alone competing for the chief resident,

722
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm not even qualified

723
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,680
to attend the examination for residents.

724
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,650
You haven't get over it.

725
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,890
You should go back and rest.

726
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,160
Also adjust yourself.

727
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,580
I know

728
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,730
my own body.

729
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,540
I'll adjust myself as soon as possible.

730
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,870
I have to compete for the chief resident.

731
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,850
Sometimes you are

732
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,890
more stubborn than Du Di.

733
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,180
However,

734
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,180
I'm quite glad to see your ambition

735
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,980
to compete for the chief resident.

736
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,380
Are you sure

737
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,040
with your body?

738
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,120
I promise

739
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,710
there will be no problem.

740
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,230
What are those?

741
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,900
You scared me.

742
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,820
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

743
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,760
I thought you are a thief.

744
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,650
You haven't told me what these are.

745
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,020
I made it myself to practice.

746
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,310
First,

747
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,920
the stitches

748
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,460
can only be done

749
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,250
by a good surgeon.

750
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,940
I think it looks familiar.

751
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,270
But it's definitely not something

752
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,940
that you can do.

753
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,070
Second, you practice.

754
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,740
on your precious limited edition sneakers.

755
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,150
Nonsense.

756
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,750
What are you doing here?

757
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,010
Get off here if you don't tell me.

758
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,350
I'm here to see

759
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,750
how your single life

760
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,590
goes on.

761
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,020
Although he didn't tell me to do this,

762
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,070
I have to report it on time.

763
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,650
Right?

764
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,260
How is he going?

765
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,490
He's fine.

766
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,260
He's not as strong as you,

767
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,240
and stayed in the hospital for a while.

768
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,440
But he gets along well

769
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,510
with your liver.

770
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,910
I guess he can check out

771
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,670
in a week or two.

772
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,980
You haven't visited your dad lately.

773
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,010
He didn't say it,

774
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,260
he still cares about it.

775
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,380
And you didn't tell him

776
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,640
you work in the ob-gyn department in Shengji?

777
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,180
My workplace

778
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,050
is none of his business.

779
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,790
He has been waiting for you

780
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,080
to go back to your research institute.

781
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,620
If he knows

782
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,700
you gave up

783
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,010
your great scientific research career abroad

784
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,460
and went to be a residency trainee

785
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,710
even in the ob-gyn which he hates most.

786
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,330
He'll be so mad at you.

787
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,530
I want to make him angry.

788
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,680
The more he looks down on something,

789
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,450
the more I want to do it.

790
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,710
What's wrong with O.B.?

791
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,900
Neurosurgery Department is that awesome?

792
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,610
Could he be here without the ob-gyn?

793
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,410
Ob-gyn is totally great.

794
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,080
Otherwise, why did I

795
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,660
stay here for this long?

796
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,620
Then why did you blame me?

797
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,570
Fine, I'm too tired

798
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,560
to argue with you.

799
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,500
I'm exhausted, you know?

800
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,200
You exagerate.

801
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,090
I was also a resident.

802
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:57,750
Okay, I'm leaving.

803
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,890
If my dad

804
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,990
has something precious,

805
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,900
where would he hide?

806
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:07,940
You can't wait any longer

807
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,270
to get your dad's money?

808
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,780
Forget it. You're like his eldest son.

809
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,430
You're more obedient than me.

810
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,750
Go to your other dad's house.

811
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,950
I'm leaving. Bye.

812
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,390
Some girl sew those sneakers, right?

813
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,570
Get away.

814
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,940
What wrong with this lady?

815
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,980
Mom

816
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,890
Mom?

817
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,520
Hello, it's me.

818
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,300
What is it?

819
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,400
How's your work

820
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,990
recently?

821
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:04,960
Not bad.

822
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,410
Will you get promoted soon?

823
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,710
Not that fast.

824
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,620
You've been working for two years,

825
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,380
and you're still not a formal doctor?

826
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,960
It'll take at least two more years.

827
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,560
I shouldn't have let you study medicine.

828
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,340
Many of your middle school classmates

829
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,330
have been promoted.

830
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,910
They started working

831
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,640
from 22.

832
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,440
But what about you? You're 29 now

833
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,620
but you're not even a formal doctor.

834
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,970
Now look at yourself.

835
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,310
You have no career and

836
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,370
no family.

837
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,720
You'll be 30.

838
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,360
Pay more attention to yourself.

839
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,700
Your grandma

840
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,850
has a lot of complaints against me.

841
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,920
She scolds me every time she calls me.

842
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,070
Hello? Hello?

843
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,340
Why did you hang up?

844
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,670
I still have something to say.

845
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,220
Look at her.

846
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,390
It is you who spoiled her.

847
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,490
You know that

848
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,420
she will get annoyed when you mention her grandma.

849
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
Why did you have to bring it up?

850
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,750
I'm calling again. You...

851
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,320
Stop. Our daughter is tired.

852
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,550
Let her rest early.

853
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,390
As for that matter,

854
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,820
we can tell her

855
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,250
when we go there next month.

856
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,400
But

857
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,150
I'm afraid she can't accept it.

858
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,210
She is not that selfish.

859
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,120
She has to accept whatsoever.

860
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,429
Didn't the director ask you

861
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,210
to stay at home for a while?

862
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,530
I've recovered.

863
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,469
I don't need to rest.

864
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,159
I have

865
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,130
a new life goal.

866
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,110
The first step

867
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,130
is to become

868
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,100
the next chief resident.

869
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,100
Do you want to die?

870
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,440
You just fainted yesterday.

871
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,239
What?

872
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,540
Me competing with you for the chief resident,

873
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,739
do you feel threatened?

874
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,489
I'm just worried

875
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,330
about your health.

876
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,739
Dr. Huang,

877
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,239
are you alright?

878
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:47,909
I'm fine. Don't worry.

879
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,210
Good. You've made great progress.

880
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,710
It's not that hard.

881
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,740
You just didn't

882
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,400
practice hard before.

883
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,180
It's not that I didn't practice hard.

884
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,360
I just didn't practice harder than

885
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,150
Du Di.

886
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,120
No other residents

887
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,520
can do Laparotomy and close up everyday.

888
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,660
She stitches in such a fast and stable way

889
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,280
just like a chief surgeon.

890
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,050
Her life is awesome,

891
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,750
but mine is normal.

892
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,420
If you want to compete with her,

893
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,670
you have to be like her.

894
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,720
Besides,

895
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,400
young people in Shengji Hospital

896
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,150
are all

897
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,550
trying their best to be awesome.

898
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,800
They are all so talented

899
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:31,730
highly educated

900
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,190
and their mentors are so good.

901
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,190
If you don't work hard,

902
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,620
you'll definitely lose.

903
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,640
My operation level is so lower than

904
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,730
Du Di's.

905
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,530
You should catch her up as soon as possible.

906
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:42,980
Besides,

907
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,590
you have to defeat her

908
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,180
on her weaknesses.

909
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,670
She has no weaknesses.

910
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,800
Her communication ability

911
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,720
with the patient's family

912
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,170
is her biggest weakness.

913
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,730
And when she

914
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,470
sees a patient's family prefer boys to girls,

915
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,560
she will get emotional.

916
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,700
Once a doctor gets emotional,

917
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,960
she can't make calm

918
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,070
and objective judgment.

919
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:58,980
In this way,

920
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,100
her judgment will go astray.

921
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,440
As for you,

922
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,400
you make the patient feel like a spring breeze brushing

923
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,660
and take good care of the patient's family.

924
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,500
Of course,

925
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,300
you should also cooperate

926
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,270
with nurses and midwives with smiles.

927
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,940
Time reveals a person's heart.

928
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,140
Everyone has his own standard in his heart.

929
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,290
As time goes by,

930
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,410
who would want to work

931
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,580
with a chief resident like her?

932
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,480
Just show your advantage

933
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,750
where she's weak at.

934
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,840
By then,

935
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,160
your comprehensive score will be higher.

936
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,000
You were indeed the president of the student union.

937
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,620
You have clear logic and useful suggestions.

938
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,280
I have another question.

939
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,910
Logically speaking,

940
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,140
I should take

941
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,780
some complicated patients,

942
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,440
so I can gain more experience, right?

943
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,960
But every time I meet

944
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,110
a patient

945
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,330
with complicated symptoms,

946
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,050
I get cold-feet.

947
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,060
What should I do?

948
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,650
Turn to your superior doctors.

949
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,100
If you have any questions,

950
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:48,900
just ask them.

951
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,180
They won't blame you.

952
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,290
Especially your mentor, Director Huang.

953
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,720
If you always choose the easy work,

954
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,170
even if she wants to help you,

955
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,950
she has no chance.

956
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,700
It seems that it is wise to

957
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,100
ask you to practice with me.

958
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,440
Of course.

959
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,580
What happened to your nails?

960
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,120
I applied iodine on them.

961
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,270
Why did you apply that?

962
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,300
I want to change my habit of biting nails.

963
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,580
Iodine tastes bitter.

964
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,310
It's like

965
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,450
when a girl breaks up with someone,

966
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,210
she always wants to get diet or cut her hair.

967
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,240
A sense of ritual?

968
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,570
Sort of.

969
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,480
I want to overcome my weakness

970
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,450
and become stronger.

971
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,670
This is the eldest primipara

972
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,140
so far this year.

973
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,340
48 years old.

974
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,740
Is she having a spontaneous delivery or C-Section?

975
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,100
Sometimes,

976
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,200
I am scared to deliver

977
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,300
such an elderly primipara.

978
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm afraid something happens.

979
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,730
There's a great chance of that.

980
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,970
Even if she wants to have a spontaneous delivery,

981
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,970
the doctors would not say yes.

982
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
What are you talking about?

983
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,020
We just received

984
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,350
a 48-year-old primipara.

985
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,030
who breaks this year's record of the eldest labor age.

986
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,640
But this is not the most dramatic part.

987
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,200
The most dramatic thing is that

988
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,840
she's in a double room.

989
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,630
Guess who's the patient who shared the ward?

990
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,270
Her daughter-in-law.

991
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,270
Isn't this insane?

992
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,350
A mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law

993
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,690
are pregnant and wait to give birth at the same time?

994
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,310
Yes.

995
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,670
I just went in and took a look.

996
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,860
The atmosphere was very strange.

997
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,270
Only the father-in-low was smiling.

998
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,650
Everyone else has an angry face.

999
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,310
If I were him, I would be happy too.

1000
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,650
He will have his son

1001
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,790
and his grandson the same time.

1002
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,870
Of course the son and daughter-in-law

1003
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,940
are unhappy.

1004
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,820
They might think when they have the baby,

1005
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,290
the mother could help the daughter-in-law have the childbed confinement.

1006
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,110
But now the mother-in-law herself needs childbed confinement too.

1007
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,000
And the future baby is gonna take part of their parents' legacy.

1008
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,990
Anyone will be upset facing this situation.

1009
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,280
Who is in charge of

1010
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,150
the 48-year-old?

1011
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,800
I'm not sure.

1012
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,270
It should be Director Huang.

1013
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,630
Du Di and Liu Nianbai

1014
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,350
were there, too.

1015
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,520
She begins to understand now.

1016
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,060
Now she knows to fight for the work.

1017
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:55,980
Of course.

1018
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,580
She was nicer than Du Di.

1019
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,230
The position of chief resident should be hers.

1020
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,300
Don't be so arbitrary.

1021
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:01,950
Get to work.

1022
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,230
All right, put it on.

1023
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,920
Your child is healthy.

1024
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,580
Don't worry.

1025
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,580
I'm not worried about that.

1026
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,340
It's true that having a baby at your age

1027
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,050
means that you would encounter many difficulties

1028
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,080
unfamiliar for young people.

1029
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,290
But since the child is here,

1030
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,140
it's fate, right?

1031
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,060
Yes.

1032
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,360
Doctor, you're right.

1033
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,750
I also tried to persuade her.

1034
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,650
Director Huang,

1035
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,250
I'll take care of this ward.

1036
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,790
Director Huang, I can take care of it, too.

1037
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,330
Dr. Wu,

1038
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,940
You take care of this patient.

1039
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,680
Dr Du, you take care of that patient.

1040
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,810
But I think

1041
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,580
I'm more suitable

1042
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,640
to take care of the elderly one.

1043
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,070
I've decided.

1044
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,620
Hello, aunt.

1045
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,370
I'm your doctor in charge,

1046
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,640
Wu Congrui.

1047
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,580
You're waiting for the dilatation.

1048
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,260
If you feel unwell of any kind

1049
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,310
during this time,

1050
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,790
you can go to the doctor's office

1051
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,140
to look for me.

1052
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,610
Dr. Wu, right?

1053
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,220
I'll have to trouble you in the future.

1054
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,640
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

1055
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,820
It's my duty.

1056
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,360
Auntie,

1057
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,860
now that your body shape

1058
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,770
hasn't change a lot.

1059
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,190
You should eat and sleep well.

1060
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,830
This way you can have more strength when you give birth.

1061
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,410
Senior,

1062
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,900
why do you all want to take charge of

1063
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,160
that elderly primipara?

1064
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,100
Elderly primiparae

1065
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,270
have more complications.

1066
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,560
Plus, during the process of childbirth,

1067
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,620
we may encounter many problems,

1068
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,900
even the rare ones.

1069
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,280
It's very helpful

1070
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,150
to accumulate clinical experience.

1071
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,660
When a younger primipara

1072
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,820
has a spontaneous delivery,

1073
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,310
it's basically just a delivery.

1074
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,330
Midwives can handle it.

1075
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,150
Doctors don't even need to do anything.

1076
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,090
I see.

1077
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,940
But you called her an elderly primipara

1078
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,150
in front of the patient,

1079
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,220
would she be happy?

1080
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,240
Didn't they say

1081
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,790
women at all ages

1082
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,520
mind being called old?

1083
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,590
Generally speaking,

1084
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,420
women who're over 35 years old

1085
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,420
are considered as elderly primiparae.

1086
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,700
We've always said that,

1087
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,930
the patients were fine with it.

1088
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,830
But measured only by age,

1089
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,920
some people were classified

1090
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,090
as risky.

1091
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,900
Isn't that a bit unreasonable?

1092
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:14,820
For example,

1093
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,720
a 36-year-old

1094
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,220
could be very healthy,

1095
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,160
while a 34-year-old

1096
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,750
could have high blood pressure and diabetes.

1097
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,830
Just because a woman is

1098
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,230
over 35,

1099
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,380
she's classified as "elderly".

1100
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,680
Isn't that a kind of ageism?

1101
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,360
Liu Nianbai,

1102
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,320
although 80% of your words

1103
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,590
is nonsense,

1104
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,940
I think the view

1105
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,480
you just said

1106
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,740
is the the rest.

1107
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,820
Dividing only by age

1108
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,160
is a bit simple and inaccurate.

1109
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,590
And many people

1110
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,570
who try to pressure women into having babies would say,

1111
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,390
"if you don't give birth now,

1112
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,500
you would become an elderly primipara".

1113
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,620
This has become

1114
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,650
ageism.

1115
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,740
I should pay attention in the future.

1116
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,990
Senior, you've grown up.

1117
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,020
You know how to praise people now,

1118
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,120
although just twenty percent of you words is praise.

1119
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,470
Be content. Go back to work.

1120
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,720
What's going on

1121
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,500
with this stupid computer?

1122
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,260
I bear with its lagging every day,

1123
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,140
but now it's down!

1124
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,600
I’ve told Director Tian long ago

1125
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,040
to change a batch of new computers.

1126
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,660
Let me have a look.

1127
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,410
Can you do it?

1128
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,830
Have some confidence in me.

1129
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,660
What's wrong?

1130
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:32,850
Have a seat.

1131
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:48,690
Done.

1132
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,460
Pretty good, Liu Nianbai.

1133
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,110
You're quite talented.

1134
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,300
Thanks.

1135
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:55,560
Praise me more.

1136
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,080
I'll get up

1137
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:57,710
when the praises satisfy me 100%.

1138
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,510
If you don't get up, I'll kick you.

1139
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,530
I'm getting up.
