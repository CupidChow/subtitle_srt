[Episode 6]

4
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,310
Why do you want to become

5
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,180
Lin Qiaozhi?

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,690
Because...

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,539
Because my father

8
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,270
was delivered by Lin Qiaozhi.

9
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,470
I see.

10
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,610
Lin Qiaozhi...

11
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,030
She is the greatest woman

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,140
in the world.

13
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,730
She is the mother of ten thousand babies.

14
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,020
She is one of the founders of

15
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,330
gynecology and obstetrics in China.

16
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,850
Do you know?

17
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,060
In my grandma's heart,

18
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,370
only women like Lin Qiaozhi

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,360
are worthy of

20
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,120
respect.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,950
Other women...

22
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,790
My mom.

23
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,460
I...

24
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,990
We are nothing.

25
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,070
You're exaggerating.

26
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,790
Your grandma is just grateful to her.

27
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,990
Ever since I was young,

28
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,650
my grandma kept telling me this.

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,470
She said when my grandpa was a soldier in Beijing,

30
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,860
she went to my grandpa

31
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,660
and had a premature delivery.

32
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,540
It was a difficult labor too.

33
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,560
Without Lin Qiaozhi,

34
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,890
my dad wouldn't have survived.

35
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,500
So she would scold me from a young age.

36
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:01,840
She said.

37
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,660
You...

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,100
So what if you have good grades?

39
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,880
You'll never become Lin Qiaozhi.

40
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,030
You'll never become a person like her.

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,020
So that's why

42
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,300
you must become Lin Qiaozhi.

43
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,690
Don't cry.

44
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,410
I'm not crying.

45
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,240
I never cry.

46
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,180
I will never cry.

47
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,440
Have you known this Chinese character?

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,850
It's made up of the "female" character

49
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
and the "younger brother" character.

50
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,100
Have you heard of it?

51
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,420
No, what is this word?

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,940
Exactly.

53
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,150
What is this word?

54
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,750
What is it?

55
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
I also wanted to know.

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,000
So I searched for its meaning when I was young.

57
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,280
I kept searching.

58
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,020
I wanted to know its meaning.

59
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,420
Later I found out

60
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,590
that women with this character in their names

61
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,900
were children who

62
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,100
never brought joy.

63
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,470
For example, Zhaodi.

64
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,610
Daidi.

65
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,270
Laidi.

66
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,380
They

67
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,690
were all expected to be sons.

68
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,659
If not,

69
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,550
they would have to shoulder

70
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,860
the expectation of attracting a son.

71
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,890
There used to be more of such cases.

72
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,270
The situation has only improved

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,409
a little nowadays.

74
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,730
I never knew.

75
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,260
Don't laugh.

76
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm scared.

77
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
But you know what?

78
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,340
I changed my name

79
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,530
when I was 18.

80
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,520
The "di" in my name

81
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,420
now means "emperor" instead.

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,660
My grandma was so angry,

83
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,140
and she grew a big blister on her lip.

84
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,810
It took more than three months to heal.

85
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:33,940
I was so happy.

86
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,580
I was super happy.

87
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,040
I wanted her to know that

88
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,960
I was not some kind of lucky charm.

89
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,520
I could be the emperor

90
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,820
of my own destiny.

91
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,900
Do you understand?

92
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,659
The emperor.

93
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,130
I see.

94
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,900
You know what?

95
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,670
When you are drunk,

96
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,730
you're much cuter than

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,560
when you are sober.

98
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,520
Cry and smile when you want to.

99
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,220
Come on.

100
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,690
Let's sleep.

101
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,860
That's a little...

102
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,860
Come on.

103
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,060
You told me to sleep.

104
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,730
Here.

105
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,340
I mean it literally.

106
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,640
Go to sleep first.

107
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,810
I still have homework to do.

108
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,000
I haven't finished my homework.

109
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,660
My homework!

110
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,180
Where is my bag?

111
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,659
What are you doing?

112
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,980
My bag! Stop it!

113
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,520
My bag!

114
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,420
This is my bag.

115
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,700
Don't throw up inside.

116
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,659
Don't throw up on my shoes.

117
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,450
Lie down.

118
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,460
Go to bed.

119
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,090
Bed 38.

120
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,970
I need to check the patient's urine protein tomorrow.

121
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,790
Bed 49.

122
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,720
I need to remind the family members

123
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,170
to listen to the operation proposal

124
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,780
tomorrow.

125
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,850
But Li Fei

126
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,490
probably won't help me.

127
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,400
It's okay. There's still Congrui.

128
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,650
Congrui.

129
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,930
I need to remind Congrui

130
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,420
to buy a pillow like this

131
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,890
for Di the cat.

132
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,730
With this pillow,

133
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,110
Di won't have to

134
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,700
sleep on Rui's butt anymore.

135
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,260
I can't take it anymore.

136
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sleeping.

137
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,940
What is this?

138
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,180
Tell me what this is!

139
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,810
Based on the level of suturing,

140
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,970
I immediately figured out

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,790
that I operated on

142
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,500
those shoes.

143
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,710
But how can I tell him

144
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,390
I do such childish things

145
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,740
when I get drunk?

146
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,220
How would I know?

147
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,020
This...

148
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,290
Tell me what this is!

149
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,070
I used that to protect my equipment

150
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,360
from water and sand when I was

151
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,230
shooting underwater creatures last week.

152
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,309
But how can I tell her

153
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,370
I'm doing such a childish thing?

154
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,030
How would I know?

155
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,289
Then where am I?

156
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,429
Why am I here?

157
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,270
What did you do to me?

158
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,049
This is my house.

159
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,309
You were drunk last night.

160
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,730
I don't know where you live.

161
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,080
So I brought you home.

162
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,500
And then?

163
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,090
Then you performed surgery

164
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,010
on my shoes.

165
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,170
Last night, you said you were Lin Qiaozhi.

166
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,220
Then...

167
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,780
What happened?

168
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,780
You pounced on me.

169
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,830
Impossible!

170
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,990
Why not?

171
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,050
You jumped at me

172
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,010
and said

173
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,630
you were the emperor of fates.

174
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm so miserable.

175
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,370
Oh no.

176
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,140
That's what I like to say when I'm drunk.

177
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,780
Could he be telling the truth?

178
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,770
Pay for my shoes!

179
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,820
Pay for my innocence!

180
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,780
I haven't asked you to pay for my innocence!

181
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,050
You can remove the sutures

182
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,710
on the shoes yourself.

183
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,150
I can't wear damaged shoes.

184
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,420
I can't sell them on the second-hand market either.

185
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,390
You can't solve this problem

186
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,180
just by removing the sutures.

187
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,380
Don't leave.

188
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,150
These shoes are expensive.

189
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,600
My innocence is also expensive.

190
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,070
Pay me back!

191
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,740
No way.

192
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,780
I'm warning you.

193
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,470
If anyone else

194
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,400
knows about this,

195
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,060
I'll kill you.

196
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,160
What are you doing?

197
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,620
Waiting for someone.

198
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,780
Who?

199
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,500
Li Fei or Su Ye?

200
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,270
How is it going?

201
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,020
No, not them.

202
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:09,820
Then...

203
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,210
You're waiting for Du Di?

204
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,580
You young people

205
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,890
breakup and reconcile within days.

206
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,370
Don't you find it tiring?

207
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,340
Wait.

208
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,220
What is it?

209
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,760
You reek of alcohol.

210
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,300
Did you drink yesterday?

211
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,260
It's none of your business.

212
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,130
Your clothes

213
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,970
are also yesterday's clothes.

214
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,290
You didn't go home yesterday?

215
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,260
I said it's none of your business.

216
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,780
Du Di.

217
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,050
We just broke up.

218
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,170
You're already doing this?

219
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,100
Must you be this eager?

220
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,340
Already doing what?

221
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,830
Li Junxiao, watch your mouth.

222
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,500
We've broken up.

223
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,770
It's none of your business.

224
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,350
Why are you so late?

225
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,580
I didn't find a suitable pair of shoes.

226
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,930
How unruly.

227
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,340
You have no manners.

228
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,620
How rude.

229
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,460
It can't be helped.

230
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,610
I have no father to teach me since I was young.

231
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,650
You...

232
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,490
Don't start a fight

233
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,760
the moment you meet each other.

234
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,080
Liver transplant is not a small matter.

235
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,260
Don't get emotional.

236
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,220
Why do I smell alcohol?

237
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,180
You didn't drink, did you?

238
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,980
Why is your sense of smell

239
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,560
more sensitive than a dog's?

240
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,540
Don't worry. I just went to the bar.

241
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,600
Someone threw up on me.

242
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,820
I haven't had time to take a shower.

243
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,850
Where is your sense of responsibility?

244
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,690
It's hereditary.

245
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,840
I have no sense of responsibility.

246
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,200
All right.

247
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,250
Are you sure you didn't drink?

248
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,050
I'm sure.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,170
Okay, get ready to be hospitalized.

250
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,210
Your bed.

251
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,570
You'd better get me a different room.

252
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,100
I don't want to stay with him.

253
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,060
Otherwise, we might be the death of each other

254
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,340
before the surgery even begins.

255
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,000
This is the only room available.

256
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,770
You know how tight the room supply

257
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,050
is in our hospital.

258
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,510
Dr. Du.

259
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,550
What are you holding?

260
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,010
A friend of mine

261
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,120
asked me to prescribe it for her.

262
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,460
This kind of contraceptive pills

263
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,690
can be found in any pharmacy out there.

264
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,000
Who asked you to prescribe it

265
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,990
all the way from the hospital pharmacy?

266
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,100
It's just convenient for me.

267
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,650
Don't be shy, you're still young.

268
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,450
Eat up.

269
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,640
It won't work

270
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,470
after 72 hours.

271
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,950
By the way, this medicine

272
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,400
is not hundred percent effective.

273
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,220
You're a doctor. You know better than me.

274
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,670
Yes.

275
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,400
This young doctor is quite open-minded.

276
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,900
Her ex-boyfriend still

277
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,960
wants to get back together.

278
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,940
What a mess.

279
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,710
I'll get you the medicine first.

280
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,310
Go ahead.

281
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,870
Have you heard?

282
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,200
She bought contraceptive pills.

283
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,950
I heard.

284
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,040
Which doctor is she with?

285
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,590
Does she have a new boyfriend already?

286
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:04,980
Yes.

287
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,320
Have you heard?

288
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,950
She bought contraceptive pills.

289
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,260
Is that true?

290
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,090
Absolutely.

291
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,160
Isn't she single?

292
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,300
Who knows?

293
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,780
-Really, it's hard to say.
-I don't know.

294
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,540
What's going on?

295
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,320
Think about what you want to eat.

296
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,700
Really?

297
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,220
I heard that she only

298
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,730
ever dated Li Junxiao.

299
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,980
She's having fun after breaking up.

300
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,500
It's probably just a fling.

301
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,090
If she's serious about the relationship,

302
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,200
would she be in such a hurry

303
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,390
to buy contraceptive pills?

304
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,590
We've seen plenty of situations like this

305
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,390
in our department.

306
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,830
Are you still wooing Li Junxiao?

307
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,020
Of course. I must.

308
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,020
He is so pitiful.

309
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,570
He even wanted to apologize to his ex.

310
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,180
But his ex

311
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,260
is already seeing someone else.

312
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,570
Take care of yourself.

313
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,140
Rest more.

314
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,180
Dr. Li.

315
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,500
Are you free tonight?

316
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,670
Du Di went to the pharmacy this morning

317
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,590
and prescribed contraceptive pills.

318
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,220
Everyone in the department has known.

319
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,580
I'm sorry, Dr. Li.

320
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:22,970
I...

321
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,680
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

322
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,300
Wait here.

323
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,340
Su Ye.

324
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,130
See you after work.

325
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,660
Tonight, make him yours.

326
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,740
More work...

327
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,090
When will the days

328
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,350
come to an end?

329
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,540
Baby.

330
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,180
Whose poem do you want to hear?

331
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,700
Shelley.

332
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:24,670
OK.

333
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,260
After this wave of

334
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,220
uterine contractions is over,

335
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,540
I'll read it to you, okay?

336
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,140
The uterine contraction is here.

337
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,270
Come on, get ready.

338
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,720
Come on.

339
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,490
Not bad.

340
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,180
The baby's size is suitable.

341
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,550
You also know how to use your strength.

342
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,760
You're doing great.

343
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:46,900
This is

344
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,680
all thanks to my husband.

345
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,980
He accompanied me to classes.

346
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,300
My mother and mother-in-law wanted to give me tonic.

347
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,690
He insisted on nutritional balance.

348
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,340
He even exercised with me.

349
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,420
So my body

350
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,940
is always very healthy.

351
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,400
If only everyone can be

352
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,140
this rational.

353
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,040
That way, the child will be safe.

354
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,070
We don't need to worry either.

355
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,740
Honey.

356
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,050
I love you.

357
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,540
I love you too, honey.

358
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,420
I found it.

359
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,710
Let me read it to you.

360
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,160
The fountains mingle with the river,

361
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,720
and the rivers with the ocean.

362
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,490
The winds of heaven mix for ever

363
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,320
with a sweet emotion.

364
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,820
Nothing in the world is single,

365
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,630
all things by a law divine.

366
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,540
In one another's being mingle,

367
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,660
why not I with thine?

368
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,800
See the mountains kiss high heaven,

369
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,190
and the waves clasp one another.

370
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,780
No sister-flower would be forgiven,

371
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,830
if it disdained its brother.

372
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,240
And the sunlight clasps the earth,

373
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,690
and the moonbeams kiss the sea.

374
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,410
What are all these kisses worth,

375
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,280
if thou kiss not me?

376
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,680
Congratulations, it's a daughter.

377
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,950
You're a mother now.

378
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,700
Honey, you're great.

379
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,290
3,150 grams.

380
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,210
So fat.

381
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,569
More than three kilograms.

382
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,300
Here, contact.

383
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,880
So cute.

384
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:17,940
I'll pass her to the family members.

385
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,380
Honey.

386
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,069
Thank you

387
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,260
for giving me a little lover.

388
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,760
In the future,

389
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,760
you will give your love for me

390
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,860
to her instead.

391
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,060
That's impossible.

392
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,220
She will receive the extra love.

393
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,420
The love for you

394
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,930
will never change.

395
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,650
You two are so sweet.

396
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,620
You two are the sweetest couple today.

397
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,120
You just got married, right?

398
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,580
We've been married for ten years

399
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,980
since we graduated from university.

400
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,280
You've been together since university.

401
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,810
You must have faced

402
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,520
a lot of difficulties.

403
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,140
Yes.

404
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,980
After graduation,

405
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,620
we didn't know which city to go to.

406
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,090
It took us a long time.

407
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,590
But

408
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,180
we persisted through it all.

409
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,650
Do you have any secret?

410
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,340
Be firm.

411
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
No matter what happens,

412
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,900
you must be with her.

413
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,900
Under this premise,

414
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,670
nothing will be a problem.

415
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,620
When we fought, we never broke up.

416
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,990
During cold wars,

417
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,340
we never considered other people's pursuits.

418
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,900
In summary,

419
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,180
love needs faith.

420
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:33,890
Dr. Li.

421
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,730
Your phone has been vibrating for a long time.

422
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,450
Is someone looking for you urgently?

423
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,270
Hello, sister.

424
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,370
Hey, my brother.

425
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,100
Why did you answer the phone so late?

426
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,410
I'm outside the train station.

427
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,530
I got lost.

428
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,150
Come in.

429
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,240
It's so small.

430
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,460
How do you stand it?

431
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,530
You city people

432
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,730
are so pitiful.

433
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,810
It's fine if it's so high up

434
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,080
and doesn't come with a yard.

435
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:15,910
But it's so small here,

436
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,080
I can't even move freely.

437
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:17,970
Sister, even a place like this

438
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,890
costs 3,000 yuan a month.

439
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,550
3,000 yuan?

440
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,120
Isn't your monthly salary only

441
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,140
7 to 8 thousand per month?

442
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,540
3,000 yuan is half of your salary.

443
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,150
What do you have left for food,

444
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,690
drinks, and clothing?

445
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,020
Come, have a seat.

446
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,300
Let's not talk about that first.

447
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,540
Why are you suddenly here?

448
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,750
Where is brother-in-law?

449
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,720
I...

450
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,320
I'm here to tour the place.

451
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,980
Your brother-in-law is busy.

452
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,280
He's working.

453
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,540
You've been here for many years.

454
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,250
But this is my first time in the city.

455
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,270
Let me tell you.

456
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,210
The moment I got off the train,

457
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,600
gosh, I got lost immediately.

458
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,060
I've never seen so many people

459
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,890
and so many cars.

460
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,630
But it was a good thing I got lost

461
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,620
and you came to pick me up.

462
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,580
Otherwise,

463
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,060
I only have your old address.

464
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,080
I might end up at the wrong place.

465
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:08,980
Tour the place?

466
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,110
In all my years of knowing you,

467
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,340
I have never seen you go on a tour.

468
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,900
You're always hard at work.

469
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,340
Be honest.

470
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,990
My last job is over.

471
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,560
I haven't found a new one yet.

472
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,400
I heard you broke up with Du Di.

473
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,170
I was worried.

474
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,260
I thought about it.

475
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,780
You're clumsy and straightforward with words.

476
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:31,970
Did you say something wrong

477
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,810
to offend her?

478
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,780
I thought I could come help with mediation.

479
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,630
Maybe the two of you can reconcile again.

480
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,660
It's impossible for us.

481
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,910
Why not?

482
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,030
Li Junxiao, you have to be responsible.

483
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,490
She's been with you for years.

484
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,010
Marriage is just around the corner.

485
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,580
Why did you break up all of a sudden?

486
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,980
Are you seeing someone else?

487
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,380
We don't condone that in this family.

488
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,100
[Su Ye]

489
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,820
Oh no.

490
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,900
I forgot.

491
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,350
Hello.

492
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,390
I'm sorry.

493
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,160
My sister came suddenly.

494
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,700
I just picked her up.

495
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,030
I can't join you

496
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,100
for dinner tonight.

497
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,410
Yes.

498
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,730
How about another day?

499
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,110
I'm really sorry about today.

500
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,650
Who is this woman?

501
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,780
Sister.

502
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,360
It's not like that.

503
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,330
You just arrived.

504
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,330
Let's talk about it later.

505
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,330
Are you hungry?

506
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,390
I know some restaurants

507
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,000
with great food.

508
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,740
Let's go out to eat.

509
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,180
No need for that.

510
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:31,950
Restaurants will charge 20 yuan

511
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,540
for 1 yuan worth of vegetables.

512
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,980
Let me see what you have.

513
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,150
I'll cook for you.

514
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,580
Sister.

515
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,740
Okay.

516
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,140
Don't worry. Listen.

517
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,530
The dishes will be ready in 20 minutes.

518
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,450
Sister,

519
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,750
how about I go out

520
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,730
and book a room for you

521
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,850
at an economy hotel?

522
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,290
Why are you wasting money?

523
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,010
I don't need a hotel room.

524
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,080
I'll just sleep on the floor.

525
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,640
You can't do that.

526
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,670
Why not?

527
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,060
I'm used to hardships.

528
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,580
At least there's a roof here.

529
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,920
I've even slept without a roof before.

530
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,710
It's okay.

531
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:15,750
Coming.

532
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,620
These?

533
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,770
You're back, Dr. Wu.

534
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,640
Darlings, I'm back.

535
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,260
Congrui, you're back.

536
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,130
Shouldn't you take a month off

537
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,700
for your minor postpartum confinement?

538
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,980
Why are you back here

539
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,860
after just a week?

540
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,340
If I don't come back,

541
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,180
others will take credit for my work.

542
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,640
Congrui.

543
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,980
I'm glad you're back.

544
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,000
You don't know.

545
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:37,930
Someone was sent

546
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,090
to the Family Planning Department ward.

547
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,340
She has surgeries to perform every day

548
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,320
and her attitude is terrible.

549
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,270
The patient's families complained

550
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,670
about her several times.

551
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,860
I also heard that

552
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,990
her salary bonus will be deducted.

553
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,870
This is called going for wool and coming home shorn.

554
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,500
Really?

555
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,050
He has signed the consent form.

556
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,820
Do you have anything to tell me?

557
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,930
What do you mean?

558
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,930
Just in case...

559
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,020
In case I die on the operating table?

560
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,020
If I die, so be it.

561
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,610
Then I can finally

562
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,710
see your mom again.

563
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,430
Are you sure my mom wants to see you?

564
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,270
Are you sure

565
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,180
you have nothing to tell me?

566
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,350
Your mother has something....

567
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,140
What is it?

568
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,360
Nothing.

569
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Tell me.

570
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,950
How could I decide

571
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,500
if I want you to live or not

572
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,500
unless you tell me?

573
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,330
Director Liu, we can start now.

574
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,730
Wait. I'm not done here.

575
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,440
We cannot wait.

576
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,810
The operation time is fixed.

577
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,530
We can't wait.

578
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,890
Let's push it in.

579
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,210
Why are you still here?

580
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,810
I just sent the newborn here.

581
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,910
That happened an hour ago.

582
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,610
You've been standing here for an hour.

583
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,900
It's been an hour?

584
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,510
Didn't I just come here?

585
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,300
Go back, Congrui.

586
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,970
Go back.

587
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,420
If our

588
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,560
baby was born,

589
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,140
he would have been so cute.

590
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,550
Do you think he would be

591
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,500
chubby like this baby,

592
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,420
or thin like this one?

593
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,440
Do you think he will have single eyelids

594
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,380
or double eyelids?

595
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,600
I have double eyelids.

596
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,900
But you have single eyelids.

597
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,210
But your parents have double eyelids.

598
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,970
Will the trait skip a generation?

599
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,290
How much hair do you think he'll have?

600
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,510
When I was young,

601
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,500
I had a lot of hair.

602
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,850
Congrui.

603
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,460
Do you know that

604
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,980
you're in a very abnormal state?

605
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,730
You're a doctor.

606
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,680
It's working time.

607
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,680
But you stood here,

608
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,620
staring at others' babies

609
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,100
and fantasized for an hour.

610
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,030
It's very unprofessional.

611
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,260
You're professional.

612
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,060
The child is gone but

613
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,360
you act like nothing happened.

614
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,880
I really suspect that one day,

615
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,020
if I die,

616
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,050
you will continue to work

617
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,390
and perform surgery

618
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,940
as if nothing happens.

619
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,160
Don't you think

620
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,830
the abnormal one is you?

621
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,010
Okay.

622
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,360
I admit I'm abnormal.

623
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,580
Can you admit

624
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,460
that you're abnormal too?

625
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,750
Can we just

626
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,660
forget about the child?

627
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,060
How could I?

628
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,820
Have you ever had a miscarriage?

629
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,760
Have you ever experienced the feeling

630
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,860
of your child falling from your body?

631
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,390
Because you've never experienced it,

632
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,720
you can easily forget it.

633
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,950
Or could it be that you've never loved me,

634
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,480
nor our child?

635
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,140
How could I not love you?

636
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,190
Of course I love you.

637
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,060
But I don't like when you're

638
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,080
being unreasonable.

639
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,840
Go back to work.

640
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm not being unreasonable.

641
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,990
You are being cold-blooded and heartless!

642
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,340
Here.

643
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,560
Have some milk tea.

644
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,300
Thank you, Director Huang.

645
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,450
Weren't you always telling me to drink less of this?

646
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,440
If drinking it

647
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,820
will make you feel better,

648
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,190
go ahead.

649
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,260
You knew?

650
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,420
Yuanhang called me.

651
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,090
He asked me to talk to you.

652
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,380
He's overreacting.

653
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,380
It's no big deal.

654
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,330
He didn't have to call you.

655
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,050
Congrui.

656
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,890
As a mother,

657
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,510
I understand how you feel.

658
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,570
Before I was pregnant with my second child,

659
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,430
I had a miscarriage too.

660
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,370
When?

661
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,430
Why didn't you

662
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,420
tell us?

663
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,330
It was an accident.

664
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,040
Back then, the moment I realized

665
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,880
my baby was gone,

666
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,360
my heart wouldn't stop aching.

667
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,970
It's hard for people to understand

668
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,780
this feeling if they

669
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,650
have never been a mother before.

670
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,050
Although

671
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,100
I returned to work soon after,

672
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,390
I remember

673
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,550
I took a long time

674
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,240
to adjust to things.

675
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,180
Congrui.

676
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,380
You have to let it go.

677
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,440
Only fate can determine

678
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,060
if such a small embryo

679
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,780
can become our child.

680
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,610
If the child leaves,

681
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,560
it means it's not the right time.

682
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,660
What we can do

683
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,560
is adjust

684
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,840
our mood

685
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,620
and bodies.

686
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,030
I know that. I know all of that.

687
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,100
But I can't help it.

688
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,820
You know how long

689
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,610
I have hoped for this child.

690
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,440
Congrui.

691
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,650
Life is long.

692
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,950
And the focus of life

693
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,950
will eventually shift.

694
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,520
I think the most important thing now

695
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,640
for you is to become

696
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,560
the chief resident.

697
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:45,520
Understand?

698
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,560
I'm not interested in that.

699
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:52,720
You...

700
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,160
How could you

701
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,950
say that?

702
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,700
Now that your child is gone,

703
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,170
you want to abandon your career too?

704
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,620
Is this what my student

705
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,460
should say?

706
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,620
I'm sorry.

707
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,090
You studied for eight years for this.

708
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,310
Now that your child is gone,

709
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,060
are you just going to watch

710
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,610
as other people

711
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,450
overtake you?

712
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,100
This is not the only obstacle in life.

713
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,280
If you can't get over this one,

714
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,860
how will you get over the others?

715
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,100
You're awake.

716
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,500
The surgery went well.

717
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,660
You're all awake.

718
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,540
Director Liu, how do you feel?

719
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,860
Not bad.

720
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,420
Take some anti-rejection medicine first.

721
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,660
I think it'll be fine.

722
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,440
After all, he's your son.

723
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,050
Your compatibility

724
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,840
is quite high.

725
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,510
Thank you.

726
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,810
It is my honor to operate on

727
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,640
the famous specialist of

728
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,210
Shengji's Neurosurgery Department.

729
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,350
However,

730
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,000
everyone knows you drink a lot.

731
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,390
From now on,

732
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,040
no more drinking.

733
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,990
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

734
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,890
Dr. Lin.

735
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,990
You're like the eldest son

736
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,980
of the family.

737
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,870
You're always looking out for them.

738
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,510
Luckily, it's our own hospital.

739
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,030
When something happens here,

740
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,880
I'll come and check.

741
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,540
Otherwise, I'm still doing my work.

742
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,220
In fact, I have a surgery to do later.

743
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,110
We all have it hard.

744
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,790
I'll be on my way, then.

745
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,220
They'll be fine. Don't worry.

746
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,820
I'll go with you.

747
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,400
-Let the father and son talk.
-Alright.

748
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,340
Be nice.

749
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,310
How much did you drink before?

750
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,820
It's none of your business.

751
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,910
I used to think

752
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,790
you were just irresponsible

753
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,890
towards mom and me.

754
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,340
I thought you were still responsible towards your patients.

755
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,180
Now I know you're a surgeon

756
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,560
who drank to the point of liver cancer.

757
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,850
Who knows how many patients

758
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,260
have died by your hands.

759
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,250
You can insult me,

760
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,700
but don't

761
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,420
insult my profession.

762
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,040
What's wrong?

763
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,640
My goodness.

764
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,670
Why is your blood pressure so high?

765
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,090
I'll call the doctor.

766
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,700
Scram back to your lab.

767
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,810
Never come into my sight again.

768
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,020
I refuse.

769
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,500
Di.

770
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,210
Congratulations on being discharged.

771
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,870
You can go back

772
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,980
to your friends.

773
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,060
I promise

774
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,140
I'll visit you often.

775
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,390
But I have to

776
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,490
apologize to you.

777
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,520
I can't support you.

778
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,600
Your cat food and canned food

779
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,790
are more expensive

780
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,870
than my usual meals.

781
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,300
I don't have the energy to support you either.

782
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,980
I'm a resident.

783
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,140
I'm always on duty

784
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,210
24 hours a day.

785
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,750
It'll be lonely and boring

786
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,590
for you to stay at home alone.

787
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,990
I'm not a good owner.

788
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,040
So you know

789
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,060
you are not a good owner.

790
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,389
I was just wondering why

791
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,600
you would so kindly adopt it.

792
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,750
I almost changed my view on you.

793
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,830
I didn't expect you to send it back

794
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,020
as soon as it was discharged.

795
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,300
Are you abandoning it?

796
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,420
I'm not abandoning it.

797
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,020
This is its home.

798
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,139
It just enjoyed a few days

799
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,940
of good food and lodging.

800
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:29,980
But you sent it back here

801
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,100
before it could fully recover.

802
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,580
You don't even know how to raise

803
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,389
or love a cat.

804
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,260
Is your heart made of steel?

805
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,570
If you don't adopt it, I will.

806
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,260
Wait.

807
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,070
Will you never

808
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,170
forgive me?

809
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,120
Looks like Di and Rui

810
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,590
can never

811
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,610
play together again.

812
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:19,840
Du Di.

813
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,020
Where are you going?

814
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,960
You don't have to go to

815
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,730
the Family Planning Department today.

816
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,630
Why not?

817
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,640
Director Huang said so.

818
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
She wants you to wait here.

819
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,550
Director Tian has something

820
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,790
important to tell everyone later.

821
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,550
Whatever it is,

822
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,740
it should have nothing to do with me.

823
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,830
I specialize

824
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,980
in abortion surgeries.

825
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,020
In the past month, my abortion

826
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,130
surgery techniques have improved greatly.

827
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,150
I can even perform abortions

828
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,940
with my eyes closed now.

829
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,580
You sound very resentful.

830
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,450
Where is Du Di?

831
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm here.

832
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,640
Go back to your ward from today.

833
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,390
No need to go to the Family Planning Department anymore.

834
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,140
Thank you, Director Tian.

835
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,170
Also, I would like to introduce everyone

836
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,150
to the new intern doctor of our

837
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,190
Obstetric and Gynecologic Department,

838
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,060
Liu Nianbai.

839
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,990
Liu is a medical doctor

840
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,780
from Johns Hopnews University.

841
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,270
He has also just passed

842
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,100
the admission examinations.

843
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,850
Liu's area of expertise

844
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,870
was not in the OB-GYN department.

845
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,860
But now,

846
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,540
he volunteered to come to our department.

847
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,350
So I have decided

848
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,500
to be his clinical teacher.

849
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,140
I will also let Du Di,

850
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,300
our best clinical resident,

851
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,470
carry out one on one

852
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,700
tutoring with him.

853
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,100
Director Tian, I don’t want to.

854
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,510
I’m not asking for your opinion.

855
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,460
From now on,

856
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,270
get along and learn from each other.

857
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,620
Let's go check the wards.

858
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,120
Hello, Senior.

859
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,340
Go away.

860
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,860
Who is he?

861
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,810
I don't know. He must be a big shot.

862
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,760
Don’t offend him.

863
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,190
Director Tian, I don’t want to be his tutor.

864
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,910
Why don't you transfer me back to

865
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,340
the Family Planning Department instead?

866
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:52,860
Take a look.

867
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,380
Six complaints in a month.

868
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,650
The medical department asked me

869
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,070
whether this doctor named Du Di

870
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,430
still wanted to be a doctor.

871
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,880
If you don't,

872
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,020
I'm told to get rid of you.

873
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,940
Do you have an explanation?

874
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:04,850
Some of those people

875
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,580
are irresponsible to their girlfriends.

876
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,290
Some treat their wives badly.

877
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,750
Some don't care

878
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,540
about women's bodies at all.

879
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,340
Some of them also...

880
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,300
Are you a police officer?

881
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,640
What does that have to do with you?

882
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,380
I'm a female doctor.

883
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,770
I can't let a man

884
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,480
damage women's body and interests,

885
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,250
and pretend it's nothing wrong.

886
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,260
You are a doctor first

887
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,950
and female doctor second.

888
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
All major hospitals are trying to tackle

889
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,950
communication problems between doctors and patients.

890
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,260
What is your duty?

891
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,790
What is your duty as a doctor?

892
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,180
It's to heal the patients

893
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,620
instead of criticizing them.

894
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,930
In order to heal them,

895
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,780
we should

896
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,210
better communicate with them

897
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,310
and make them understand

898
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,410
what doctors are doing

899
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,610
instead of criticizing their

900
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,470
attitude, character, and private life.

901
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,620
It's useless just healing their bodies.

902
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,330
Their corrupted souls

903
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,650
will only let them

904
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,700
hurt another person's body

905
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,540
again and again.

906
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,500
Recite the oath we told you

907
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,660
to memorize in school.

908
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,340
Recite it.

909
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,870
I will respect and learn

910
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,410
from the scientific achievements

911
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,550
and medical knowledge that our

912
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,080
medical predecessors have

913
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,420
obtained through hardship.

914
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,940
I shall be willing to

915
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,980
teach these knowledge

916
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,990
to the future doctors

917
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,250
who come after me.

918
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,020
For the benefit of the patient,

919
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,150
I will take all

920
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,180
necessary diagnosis

921
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,260
and treatment measures.

922
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,210
At the same time,

923
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,850
I must avoid

924
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,270
two unjust tendencies.

925
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,380
They are excessive treatment

926
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,620
and useless treatment.

927
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,580
I will remember that

928
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,460
although medicine

929
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,890
is a serious science,

930
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,290
the doctor's love, compassion,

931
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,740
and understanding for the patient

932
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,740
is sometimes

933
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,520
more important than

934
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,970
the scalpel and medicine.

935
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,240
Go on.

936
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,040
When I don't know,

937
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,990
I must say I don't know.

938
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,030
I shouldn't be ashamed of it.

939
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,720
If other professionals

940
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,280
can help my patients,

941
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,220
I will ask for their help.

942
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,180
I will respect the patient's privacy.

943
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,180
I know that

944
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,620
no one else should know

945
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,080
about the information they tell me

946
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,220
about their sickness.

947
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,660
Most importantly,

948
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,470
my job

949
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,220
is often related to the patient's life and death.

950
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,220
If my treatment

951
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,080
could save a life,

952
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,420
I will thank those

953
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,580
who have helped me.

954
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:11,630
If the patient dies from my

955
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,650
ineffective treatment,

956
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,540
the heavy responsibility

957
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,580
shall convince me to humbly reflect on myself

958
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,510
and my shortcomings.

959
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,330
At the same time, I have to remember

960
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,860
I am a doctor,

961
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,220
not God.

962
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,540
I...

963
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,880
What?

964
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,720
I must not delay

965
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,580
a patient's treatment

966
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,230
because of his sins.

967
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,410
This oath

968
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,180
went through many alterations.

969
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,800
Do you know why?

970
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,640
It's to help doctors

971
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,510
firmly remember their missions.

972
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,070
You are the last doctor

973
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,490
under Director Zhang's mentorship.

974
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,690
I have great hopes for you.

975
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,910
If you can't learn

976
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,020
how to be calm and objective,

977
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,190
and if you can't learn

978
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,420
how to communicate with patients' families,

979
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,670
no matter how good your surgery skills are,

980
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,530
I can't let you stay.

981
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:54,860
Du Di.

982
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,360
This is the first time

983
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,460
I'm being so strict with you.

984
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,850
If there is a second time,

985
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,760
it will be your time to go.

986
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,330
You may go now.

987
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,400
Take care of Liu Nianbai.

988
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,540
He's very important to our OB-GYN department.

989
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,780
You are very important

990
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,050
to our OB-GYN department, you know?

991
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:16,740
I don't know.

992
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,750
You can bring us

993
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,430
many new scientific research projects.

994
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,240
When the research project is developed,

995
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,770
we can

996
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,140
get more beds.

997
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,130
Sister Head Nurse,

998
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,820
your script is pretty good.

999
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,580
I'll do my best to follow your script.

1000
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,290
What did you call me?

1001
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,720
I'm your aunt.

1002
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,870
Calling you that sounds too old.

1003
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,210
"Sister" sounds younger.

1004
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,880
Besides, you are so young and beautiful.

1005
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,020
I should call you sister.

1006
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,680
Why do your words

1007
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,740
sound so comfortable?

1008
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,420
By the way,

1009
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,050
you must keep it a secret

1010
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,410
that my dad is Liu Zhenghua.

1011
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,540
You want me to keep it a secret?

1012
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,450
Let me put it this way.

1013
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,500
You should be asking

1014
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,230
how many people I can tell that to.

1015
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,900
Please, Sister Head Nurse.

1016
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,120
I'm not good at clinical practice.

1017
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,640
I just want to study hard.

1018
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,990
If the others know that

1019
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,180
my dad is the chief director,

1020
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,230
people will look down on me

1021
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,110
for being a rookie.

1022
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,650
And if I don't do well,

1023
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,630
no one will tell me either.

1024
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,030
Don't worry.

1025
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,380
Think about it.

1026
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,460
Who is your teacher?

1027
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,720
Du Di.

1028
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,980
She will always look down on you.

1029
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,480
She will always tell you that

1030
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,950
you have done a terrible job.

1031
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,260
Thank you, Sister Head Nurse.

1032
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,230
Please keep it a secret.

1033
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,460
I'll buy milk tea for you every day.

1034
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,430
You're bribing me now?

1035
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,420
That works for me.

1036
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,220
Fine, I won't say it.

1037
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,830
But you can't hide it forever.

1038
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,910
They will know sooner or later.

1039
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,920
The later the better.

1040
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,140
Liu Nianbai.

1041
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,400
Senior, I'm here.

1042
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,490
Bed 8 is leaking pee and poop.

1043
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,260
Clean it up.

1044
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,460
Isn't that the nurse's job?

1045
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,000
Who said it's the nurse's job?

1046
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,140
Doctors do it too.

1047
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:48,900
Miss,

1048
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,310
you're still drinking my milk tea.

1049
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,510
I'm going to distribute the milk tea.

1050
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,330
Learn from your teacher.

1051
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,290
Go.

1052
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,630
Yes, Senior.

1053
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,540
Doctor,

1054
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,920
I'm so sorry.

1055
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,000
You're a doctor,

1056
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,380
yet you're cleaning my mess.

1057
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,310
It's okay. It's my duty.

1058
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,470
Don't feel too burdened.

1059
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,650
Doctor, I have another question.

1060
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,710
When will I recover

1061
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,280
from this condition?

1062
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,810
Don't tell me

1063
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,360
I'll be like this from now on?

1064
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,580
Your perineal tear is quite severe

1065
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,770
and injured the anus.

1066
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,280
But it's okay.

1067
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,710
In a few days,

1068
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,660
we will give you a minor surgery.

1069
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,060
You'll feel much better after the surgery.

1070
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,680
Giving birth is too hard.

1071
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,180
Thank you.

1072
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,620
You're a great mother.

1073
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,340
Did I say something wrong?

1074
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,480
I've been in pain for days.

1075
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,230
But he not once thanked me

1076
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:53,900
for my efforts.

1077
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,060
I'm...

1078
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,370
I'm busy taking care of the kid!

1079
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,090
Come here.
