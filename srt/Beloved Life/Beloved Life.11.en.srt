4
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,300
Aunt and Uncle.

5
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,160
How is the food in our canteen?

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,979
Great. Great.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,729
Quite good. Not bad.

8
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,979
All of you are very nice.

9
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,240
You helped us,

10
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,400
and paid our meal.

11
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,660
You're even nicer than my daughter.

12
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,500
We're good now.

13
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
We wanna go back to the hotel and have a break.

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,320
We'll leave you to it.

15
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,950
Aunt,

16
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,040
the antenatal care is at 2 pm.

17
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,540
I'll take you there.

18
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,780
Okay. Sure.

19
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,130
Sorry for the trouble I caused,

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,880
Dr. Wu.

21
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,490
It's okay.

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,260
Shall we?

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you.

24
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,720
Thank you.

25
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,530
Bye, Aunt and Uncle.

26
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,300
Bye.

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,150
Du Di, I have something to ask you.

28
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,750
Did they tell you something?

29
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,640
Nothing. Just some small talk.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,329
But I think

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,340
her dad

32
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,720
was very unhappy with her.

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,230
You two look so upset.

34
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,970
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,840
Director Huang.

36
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,010
I think I did something wrong again.

37
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,380
I took

38
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,060
Du Di's mom.

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,460
She is pregnant.

40
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,340
Pregnant at this age?

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,430
Too lonely at this age

42
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,420
or just want a son?

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,290
Any difference?

44
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,610
That's a lot.

45
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,160
If she's just lonely,

46
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,829
even if Du Di is angry now,

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,820
this baby will make no difference

48
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,450
in the future.

49
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,140
If they want a son,

50
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,500
the gender of the child

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,450
will determine

52
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,860
everything.

53
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,570
It also matters

54
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,680
how to have the child.

55
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,330
Not only Du Di,

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,620
you will not have a good time either.

57
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,340
No. No.

58
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,820
God's gonna bless

59
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,730
our friendship.

60
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,110
Tell me.

61
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:33,970
Go to the ultrasonic inspection

62
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,579
this afternoon,

63
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,860
and find out

64
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,160
it's a boy or a girl.

65
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,579
What?

66
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,940
You're a doctor.

67
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,750
You must know how to tell.

68
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,300
Do you know

69
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,210
it's illegal?

70
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,820
It's illegal if

71
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,370
the doctor tells the patient,

72
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,460
but not if a daughter tells her dad.

73
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,329
You are crazy about having a son.

74
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,690
I'm not going to do it.

75
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,460
Give it up!

76
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,340
I just want you to have a look,

77
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,230
nothing else.

78
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,270
After all these years of raising you,

79
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,420
you don't even want to

80
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,130
help your family once.

81
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,300
You are my only child.

82
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,170
You can't even help me with this.

83
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,660
Don't blame me for having another one.

84
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,590
If you raise a child

85
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,170
just because you want her

86
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,100
to help you break the law,

87
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,020
then you should not have any kids at all.

88
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,630
Stop!

89
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,140
I've raised you for nothing!

90
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,680
If I'd known you are so heartless,

91
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,740
I should never have begged you!

92
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,740
What are you saying?

93
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,339
How can you say that

94
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,160
to your daughter?

95
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,040
Am I wrong?

96
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,480
I have no choice.

97
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,820
We are gonna have a son

98
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,700
at this age,

99
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,530
but you need to suffer.

100
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,150
If we'd known before that our daughter would be like this,

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,110
we shouldn't have raised her.

102
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,020
Many things in my life

103
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,060
can be chosen by myself,

104
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,500
except the family

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,000
I was born into.

106
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,790
If I can choose,

107
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,310
I would prefer to be

108
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,050
a puppy or a cat

109
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,540
instead of

110
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,340
being your daughter.

111
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,540
You!

112
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,940
Stop!

113
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,909
Come back!

114
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,040
You just leave your mom and me here?

115
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,950
What are you so proud of yourself?

116
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,990
What are you saying?

117
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,140
I am so mad at her!

118
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,210
Senior.

119
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,040
Have a cup of bubble tea.

120
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,270
Leave me alone.

121
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,550
I've raised you for nothing!

122
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,060
If I'd known you are so heartless,

123
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,030
I should never have begged you!

124
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,410
If we'd known before that our daughter would be like this,

125
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,450
we shouldn't have raised her.

126
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,280
What are you doing?

127
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,400
Overseas student's hobby is really special.

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm waiting for my senior.

129
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,060
She is in there for a long time.

130
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,460
And then?

131
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,630
I'm worried about her.

132
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,550
Maybe she

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,790
suffers from constipation.

134
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,870
Since you're so worried,

135
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,260
why don't you

136
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,020
take some enema for her?

137
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,040
May I?

138
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,300
Are you really stupid or just pretend to be?

139
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,990
Your sis is an iron woman.

140
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,210
Her gut is definitely straight.

141
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,220
Don't worry.

142
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,750
You should leave,

143
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,210
or you're gonna scare

144
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,300
pregnant women from inside.

145
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,890
Go. Go. Go.

146
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,390
You finally come out.

147
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,920
Are you okay?

148
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,600
What did they tell you?

149
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,870
I need to know

150
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,909
the defecation status

151
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,600
of all newborns today.

152
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,420
Go to collect

153
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,190
their diapers and

154
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,659
assess their feeding

155
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,240
from the color,

156
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,159
shape and smell.

157
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,900
And write a report to me.

158
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,840
Senior, please.

159
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,620
Senior.

160
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,880
How many words?

161
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,060
Okay.

162
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,380
It seems all good.

163
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,860
But still too small.

164
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,810
Boy or girl?

165
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,860
Aunt,

166
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,700
we can't answer that.

167
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,500
There's no other people here.

168
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,140
Neither you or I

169
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,000
would tell others.

170
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,790
I can't do it.

171
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,260
This is illegal.

172
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,690
What matters is

173
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,520
the baby's health.

174
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,170
I'll take

175
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,909
the report

176
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,020
to Director Tian.

177
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,150
He'll make a plan for you

178
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,580
to cut down on sugar.

179
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,270
You must strictly stick to the plan.

180
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,430
Or the baby

181
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,790
may be deformed.

182
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,050
You must be cautious.

183
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,470
Sure. I'll follow what you say.

184
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,490
How's that? Can you tell?

185
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,250
Yes, the examination is over.

186
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,820
The baby is quite healthy.

187
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,820
When I get the report,

188
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,730
I'll let you know.

189
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,710
Aunt, I know that

190
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,380
your home is far away from here.

191
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,300
But you must come for regular maternity visits.

192
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,400
You must be more careful

193
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,820
at your age.

194
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,170
We'll come on time.

195
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,730
Then I am leaving.

196
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,880
I'll let you go.

197
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,880
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

198
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,790
You've accompanied us for a long time.

199
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,740
My pleasure.

200
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,010
Excuse me, then.

201
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,080
Bye, Aunt and Uncle.

202
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,150
-Bye.
-See you.

203
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,580
Boy or girl?

204
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,460
She couldn't say.

205
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,470
How can you be so useless?

206
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,710
You should beg them.

207
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,700
I did. They couldn't tell me.

208
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,580
You're

209
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,740
as useless as your daughter.

210
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,950
What can we do?

211
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,929
We came all this way for filing

212
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,340
just for this.

213
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,940
How can it be a wasted trip?

214
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,730
I said before that we should not come.

215
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,690
And you didn't listen.

216
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,140
Whether it's a boy or a girl,

217
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,360
it's in God's hands.

218
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,420
If we accept every decision from God,

219
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,820
we can only suffer losses.

220
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,670
No, I have to go and talk with Du Di again.

221
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,170
Li Fei!

222
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,500
What are you doing with this?

223
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,610
Meconium is not stinky. Stop nipping your nose.

224
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,710
I have a big question

225
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,390
for you.

226
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,720
Just say it! Say it!

227
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,750
Is it abnormal for a baby

228
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,430
to poop so much

229
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,580
when the baby is only five days old?

230
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,950
It is too much.

231
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,350
It's possible that he was constipated

232
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,190
two days ago,

233
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,290
and suddenly he recovered

234
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,120
to release.

235
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
Why are you suddenly looking into this?

236
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,790
My senior wants me to have a report on

237
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,850
parents' scientific feeding

238
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,530
by observing the stools

239
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,590
of their newborn babies.

240
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,540
Are you joking?

241
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,820
I think she's

242
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,070
just making fun of you.

243
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,550
Even though I haven't worked here for a long time,

244
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,550
I've never seen

245
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,500
any gynecologist

246
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,080
studying this.

247
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,550
Just take it away.

248
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,180
So disgusting.

249
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,060
Mom,

250
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,300
I'm on night shift overnight.

251
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,380
You should go now.

252
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,380
Don't wait for me.

253
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,050
Waiting doesn't help.

254
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,450
Senior, you can leave.

255
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,810
I'll take your night shift.

256
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,870
I'm not on night shift today.

257
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,110
So you lied.

258
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,100
Is this your business?

259
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,260
You don't welcome

260
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,860
your brother or sister?

261
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,510
Yeah. Why?

262
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,960
But only the children care

263
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,050
whether their parents have a second child or not.

264
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,940
I think you just worry about

265
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,360
your mom, right?

266
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,150
I think you are talking too much.

267
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,580
Not busy?

268
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,510
Report finished?

269
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,930
I also have other subjects

270
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,650
to be discussed.

271
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,340
It's a good thing that you leave so fast.

272
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,700
Cheers!

273
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,150
Are you girlish to have coke?

274
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,680
Try saying that to me

275
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,870
a year ago.

276
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,590
All the staff in O&G

277
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,750
can't drink as much as I can.

278
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,680
Bragging!

279
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,790
You don't need to spit to brag anyway.

280
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,740
Just say it.

281
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,060
Why did you invite me for BBQ?

282
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,130
You're my senior's bestie for 10 years.

283
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,440
I just wanna ask,

284
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,820
what can I do so that she would stop messing with me?

285
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,880
If I knew you paid me for this,

286
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,670
I would not come.

287
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,420
Why?

288
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,700
Because there is no answer.

289
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,560
No way.

290
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,780
You've eaten

291
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,390
and drunk everything,

292
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,260
you have to give me an answer.

293
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,140
I said no answer.

294
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,290
You just let her mess with you

295
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,390
for a while.

296
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,700
When she finishes her rotation

297
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,780
after a year

298
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,510
you're gonna be free anyway.

299
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,820
You should do well in your training.

300
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,870
After three years,

301
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,140
and after you pass all the exams and leave the department,

302
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,000
you can go and follow Director Tian

303
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
to do research.

304
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,450
You two will go separate ways.

305
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,620
Clinical and research do not meet each other.

306
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,510
This answer isn't

307
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,390
for me.

308
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,810
I just think

309
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,900
she is having a tough life.

310
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,520
She is like a durian.

311
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,420
Durian?

312
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,900
Full of thorns.

313
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,790
Nobody can touch.

314
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,020
But the core

315
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,380
of a durian is soft

316
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,340
and sweet.

317
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,020
Why couldn't she make people

318
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,020
fall in love with her

319
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,820
like they fell in love with a durian?

320
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,340
Liu Nianbai!

321
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,610
You are so talented!

322
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,150
The more I think about Du Di,

323
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,720
the more she is like a durian.

324
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,440
Right?

325
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,410
Do you think she is like a Musang King

326
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,090
or a Monthong?

327
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,120
-Black thorn.
-Black thorn.

328
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,740
Well, I think

329
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,350
you are truly worrying

330
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,380
for your senior.

331
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,430
So I tell you only.

332
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
Du Di has been looked down upon

333
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,230
by the elders of her entire family

334
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,100
since she was a kid.

335
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,750
It's because her father

336
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,870
is the only son in his generation.

337
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,210
Then it came to the time of

338
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,070
family planning.

339
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,450
Her parents had a hard time

340
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,760
to get a good job,

341
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,870
so they were afraid to have one more child.

342
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,600
The whole family hoped

343
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,440
she was a boy.

344
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,850
You were raised abroad

345
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,780
and you're the only child.

346
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,440
You may not be able to see how much she suffered.

347
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,410
She has to work

348
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,790
dozens of times harder and better

349
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,500
than an average boy

350
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,670
to make some sound

351
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,100
in her family.

352
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,820
Otherwise,

353
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,140
everyone would just ignore her.

354
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,340
It's been ten years.

355
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,850
And I haven't been able to find an answer for her.

356
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,100
How can you find the answer

357
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,060
in several months?

358
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,120
It's like

359
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,510
the Goldbach conjecture.

360
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,660
Any even number greater than two

361
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,260
is the sum of two prime numbers.

362
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,030
You may think you've got the answer.

363
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,250
But you just couldn't

364
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,000
solve the problem.

365
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,210
If you

366
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,310
want to spend your life

367
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,380
getting the answer,

368
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,240
you need to think about it every day.

369
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,260
You can devote yourself to it.

370
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,200
However,

371
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,140
if you just think about it for fun,

372
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,440
how on earth can you get the answer?

373
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,320
I didn't drink.

374
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,720
Why can't I understand what you just said?

375
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,270
In short words,

376
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,060
there's no answer.

377
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,100
I am full now.

378
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,940
I have to work tomorrow.

379
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,630
I am leaving.

380
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,290
I am going to get the answer.

381
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,770
I think you have a little

382
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,290
Stockholm Syndrome

383
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,240
in you.

384
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,880
Let yourself go.

385
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,810
The hospital has already made the decision

386
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,060
to fire them.

387
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,840
As the chief nurse,

388
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,180
I have been neglectful

389
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,890
in the mental training of the nurses,

390
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,970
which caused severe consequences.

391
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,450
I ask the department

392
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,310
to give me severe punishments as well.

393
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,580
Non-medically relevant

394
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,680
fetal gender identification

395
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,130
has never been performed

396
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,990
at Sheng Ji Hospital.

397
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,550
What a surprise!

398
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,440
Chief Nurse Wang Ying.

399
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,230
All those years

400
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,970
of our secure operation

401
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,750
were ended by a nurse

402
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,470
under your supervision.

403
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,810
It also got the radiology involved

404
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,580
and an ultrasonographer was fired.

405
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,170
It's my dereliction.

406
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,920
It's my fault.

407
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,750
I will definitely start

408
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,180
a serious discipline training among nurses

409
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,630
to prevent similar things

410
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,260
from happening again.

411
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:28,970
All of you.

412
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,500
Don't think that

413
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,810
most people share the idea that

414
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,280
gender doesn't matter,

415
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,120
and that telling friends in private

416
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,120
about the baby's gender

417
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,460
is not a big deal.

418
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:37,970
I am telling you.

419
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,510
The one who knew

420
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,550
the gender of the baby

421
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,400
is a social celebrity.

422
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,850
She knew it two days ago.

423
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,800
Then she showed off on the internet

424
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,390
that she had a boy.

425
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,620
Today she was fleshed out by netizens

426
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,900
that she had the examination

427
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,700
in our hospital.

428
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,740
Sheng Ji's century-old reputation

429
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,100
and strict management

430
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,810
has become a joke now.

431
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,860
From today,

432
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,210
if there is somebody

433
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,350
telling friends or families in private

434
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,380
about the gender of the baby,

435
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,260
the whole department is gonna be punished.

436
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,390
It's up to yourselves.

437
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,670
Over.

438
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,230
What do you want to say again?

439
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,480
I am not competent as Director Zhang?

440
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,780
Or make a joke on me?

441
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,740
Is this funny?

442
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,180
I wanna say,

443
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,280
I just know it now that

444
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,970
being a director

445
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,970
is so terrible.

446
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,670
Thank your for your effort.

447
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,960
Everyone! Attention!

448
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,510
A week of training

449
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,040
on the rules and regulations

450
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,830
starting today

451
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,780
and an exam would be carried after.

452
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,040
If you fail, your bonus will be deducted.

453
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,620
So mean! Bite off her own head.

454
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,350
Go to work!

455
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,400
Wait a second.

456
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,420
I have something to tell you.

457
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,700
Are you stupid?

458
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,590
I want to talk with her about

459
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,130
cyclic metrorrhagia.

460
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,630
Irregular metrorrhagia?

461
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,060
Take your time.

462
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,290
I wanna tell you.

463
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,900
Don't make the

464
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,130
fetal gender identification for your mum.

465
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,220
She told you?

466
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,390
She asked me when she had the

467
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,830
ultrasonic inspection yesterday. But I didn't say.

468
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,630
Don't tell her.

469
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,140
You'd break the rules if you say it.

470
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,540
And don't tell me either.

471
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,620
I don't want to know.

472
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,420
I didn't see it clearly.

473
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,250
Girl,

474
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,800
how many months?

475
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,940
Looks quite big.

476
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,970
7 months.

477
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,720
Only 7?

478
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,190
I thought

479
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,109
it's full term.

480
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,180
Twins.

481
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,900
That's great!

482
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,339
Two at once. Congratulations!

483
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,160
But since it's only 7 months ,

484
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,339
why are you here?

485
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,329
The doctor said there is something wrong.

486
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,960
They may come early.

487
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,730
Then you should have the C-section soon.

488
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,339
There is a saying that

489
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,500
babies may live after seven months, but not after eight months.

490
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,040
If you wait until 8 months...

491
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,300
I don't think it's a good idea.

492
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,050
Bullshit!

493
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,510
Come on,

494
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,400
this is a hospital.

495
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,800
A place of science.

496
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,120
How can you say the old saying to a pregnant woman?

497
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,800
Stop saying that to patients.

498
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,640
Sure. Sure.

499
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,420
But I have to tell you that

500
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,810
the saying is true in my hometown.

501
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,440
And my brother-in-law's daughter.

502
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,040
Her baby was...

503
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,550
Stop.

504
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,940
Did I say stop?

505
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:51,740
What's wrong?

506
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,660
She talked nonsense with the patient.

507
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,930
Leave now.

508
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,870
I'll come back later to clean then.

509
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,660
Xiao Lili, right?

510
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,460
Yes.

511
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,090
What do you think now?

512
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,840
Reduction or wait?

513
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,290
Both of them are my children.

514
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,620
I want both.

515
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,750
Here it is.

516
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,950
It's not up to me

517
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
to decide

518
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,970
whether both of them

519
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,720
could survive.

520
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,040
The bigger one is already

521
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,960
40% bigger

522
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,070
than the smaller one.

523
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,180
They are

524
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,370
the MCDA twins.

525
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,830
They share the same placenta.

526
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,990
The umbilical cord of the bigger one

527
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,000
is inserted in the middle of the placenta.

528
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,800
But the smaller one's is at the edge,

529
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,980
which means that

530
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,140
the bigger one

531
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,630
has more nutritious blood,

532
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,660
while the smaller one

533
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,340
can only absorb a little.

534
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:42,930
You've been under observation

535
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,220
at Shengji since the 18th week.

536
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,390
Now it's the 28th week.

537
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,860
The small one is

538
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,730
in a bad state of growth.

539
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,470
The blood in the umbilical cord

540
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,710
has now started to be abnormal.

541
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,630
There is a risk of intrauterine death.

542
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,020
The spontaneous death of the small fetus

543
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,540
may induce contractions

544
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,770
that can endanger the bigger one.

545
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,540
We suggest the artificial reduction.

546
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,050
The bigger foetus will be less risky.

547
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,620
Doctor, which solution

548
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,420
do you suggest most?

549
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,950
If you want a

550
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,090
relatively healthy baby,

551
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,790
don't waste time on waiting anymore.

552
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,070
Having the reduction as early as possible

553
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,770
is the best answer.

554
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,670
I won't kill my little baby.

555
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,140
I don't agree.

556
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,340
If you still wait,

557
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,630
both of them would be dangerous.

558
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,550
If we take the C-section now,

559
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,550
will both babies

560
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,410
survive?

561
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,830
If you take the C-section now,

562
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,990
both of them are premature.

563
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,590
Both are risky,

564
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,250
especially the smaller one,

565
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,860
since its growth is not as mature as

566
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,520
the bigger one.

567
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,640
Well, we'll think about it.

568
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,260
Sure.

569
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,020
Let me know as soon as you can.

570
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,440
Let's go to the office

571
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,130
to discuss about this case.

572
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,870
This selective intrauterine

573
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,210
fetal growth restriction

574
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,110
is quite unusual indeed.

575
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,380
May I join you?

576
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,440
Of course.

577
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,260
If they choose reduction,

578
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,310
we're gonna need your help

579
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,060
during parturition.

580
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,120
Thanks, Dr. Lin.

581
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,530
And,

582
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,780
why did you

583
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,030
argue with the carer

584
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,690
at the door before?

585
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,300
The carer really

586
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,600
blew me away.

587
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,500
It's common for pregnant women

588
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,100
to listen to others and believe

589
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,260
these rumors and superstitions

590
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,090
since they're in a state of confusion.

591
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,080
As a carer,

592
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,420
she told the patient that

593
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,230
babies may live after seven months, but not after eight months.

594
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,230
I would have reported her for this

595
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,350
if I didn't know she was new here

596
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,400
and she didn't know the rules.

597
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,640
These people don't know anything.

598
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,300
These people?

599
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,820
What do you mean with "these people"?

600
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,500
People who are from countryside

601
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,630
and didn't receive any education.

602
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,780
What's wrong with people from the countryside?

603
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,730
You shouldn't look down

604
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,490
on these people.

605
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,690
Many of them have succeeded

606
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,460
and turned the table

607
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,390
by working very hard.

608
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,010
I admit that.

609
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,660
But only a few made it.

610
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,520
Otherwise,

611
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,650
why would

612
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,430
people say

613
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,630
"Something from the original family

614
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,260
is deeply rooted in you"?

615
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,000
Dr. Li,

616
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,140
perhaps you didn't know

617
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,780
too much

618
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,830
about people like that,

619
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,260
You can' tell from the surface,

620
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,750
but after further interactions,

621
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,860
he'll soon give himself away.

622
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,060
Su Ye.

623
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
I think you are biased.

624
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,070
Many excellent doctors

625
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,630
who work at our hospital

626
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,870
are from the rural areas.

627
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,860
Not only do they have great expertise

628
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,160
but their moral quality is also applaudable.

629
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,400
And actually,

630
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,870
was your family

631
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,480
not in the countryside generations ago?

632
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,360
Fine.

633
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,320
My bad.

634
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,010
I'm sorry.

635
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:12,450
Come on.

636
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,940
They're here.

637
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,900
So, embryo-reduction then?

638
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,940
When will she have the operation?

639
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,180
You're all well-informed, aren't you?

640
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,350
Tell us about it.

641
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,310
Yeah. Tell us.

642
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:28,940
Just tell us.

643
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,460
Well, I'm happy

644
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,030
that you young people

645
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,570
are studious.

646
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,830
All right, I'll talk to you about it.

647
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,570
Please sit.

648
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,570
There's a huge size difference.

649
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,700
One is

650
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,660
40% larger than the other.

651
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,920
Several weeks later,

652
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,300
it'll increase to 60%.

653
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,770
The big one will need more nutrition

654
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,200
and the small one will shrink little by little.

655
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,550
Is there a chance

656
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,610
to keep them both?

657
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,490
Yeah.

658
00:21:59,170 --> 00:21:59,770
It depends on

659
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,290
whether you

660
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,390
want a healthy child

661
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,380
or two

662
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,600
not-so-healthy children.

663
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,400
The small one has

664
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,030
severe maldevelopment.

665
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,530
Way worse

666
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,460
than any regular fetuses.

667
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,780
The result of the cesarean

668
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,060
will be two premature infants.

669
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,840
The small one may not fully develop,

670
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,140
and the big one will be staying

671
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,810
in the ICU for several months.

672
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,740
If you ask me,

673
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,490
I would keep both.

674
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,780
Yes, it is a risk,

675
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,200
but I'd have two babies.

676
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,030
Du Di, what about you?

677
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,260
Keep the healthy one.

678
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,660
It's stronger already.

679
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,680
It's natural selection.

680
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,360
This is a choice

681
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,060
that I have no right to make.

682
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,140
It is a tough one.

683
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,340
Actually,

684
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,140
it's not that difficult

685
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,840
for some people.

686
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,680
If these were two boys,

687
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,440
they'd go with the embryo-reduction.

688
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,460
If the big one was a boy,

689
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,270
and the small one was a girl,

690
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,520
they'd go with the embryo-reduction.

691
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,890
They can't make up their mind

692
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,690
because the big one is a girl

693
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,470
and the small one is a boy.

694
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,150
Don't get so sensitive

695
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,100
about the gender,

696
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,020
please?

697
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,210
Any parent

698
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,690
would hate to

699
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,350
lose a child

700
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,570
that has taken shape.

701
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm not being sensitive.
This is reality.

702
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,430
Not every family is like yours.

703
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,140
What did you say?

704
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,630
Please do not

705
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,680
presume that everybody is like you.

706
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,430
Please be objective

707
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,100
with every case.

708
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,140
Me being objective?

709
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,960
Have you been objective

710
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,820
with yourself?

711
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,440
This has become personal.

712
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
Is this all you can do?

713
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,660
What are you

714
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,300
doing here?

715
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,460
Do you want me to continue or not?

716
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,110
We are talking about this case.

717
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,020
What,

718
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,800
are you going to have a fight?

719
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,220
I have been told about the case.

720
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,400
I've got some family stuff to deal with. I'm off.

721
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,400
Let's get back to where we were.

722
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,620
I shouldn't have praised you.

723
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,160
Sister.

724
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,800
You pay extra 1,500

725
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,910
for the living room.

726
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,010
I don't think you have

727
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,150
much of your wage left, right?

728
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,220
I think it's quite cheap.

729
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,490
It took me so long to find this place.

730
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,350
Look, it comes with an elevator.

731
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,740
Most importantly,

732
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,740
it's only five bus stations away from the hospital.

733
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,720
So, you get to

734
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,160
extend your sleep by 40 minutes.

735
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,110
I thought

736
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,550
your job would be easier

737
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,060
now that you're an attending physician.

738
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,990
But look,

739
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,830
you're still

740
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,390
doing what you did before.

741
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,350
You still

742
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,250
have to be on 24-hour duty from time to time.

743
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,180
What is the point?

744
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,470
In most lines of business,

745
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,780
women have to work harder than men.

746
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,620
Because women

747
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,080
will get pregnant.

748
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,860
So it's harder for women

749
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,020
to get a job, a promotion, or a pay raise.

750
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,460
But only in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department,

751
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,530
the work is hard for men.

752
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,080
Even harder for the young dudes.

753
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,080
Those eyes

754
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,390
with a hint of exploration,

755
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,800
and shyness,

756
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,550
and fright,

757
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,760
and despise.

758
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,680
Yes.

759
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,150
That's how the ladies

760
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,750
see the young male doctors

761
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,810
as soon as they walk into the room.

762
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,390
How hard can the work be

763
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,370
for the male doctors?

764
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,790
Well, let me tell you

765
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,850
the story of Director Tian

766
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,780
when he just took the job.

767
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,390
There's this one time,

768
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,010
a not-so-young lady

769
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,480
walks in, sees him,

770
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,630
gets shocked,

771
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,700
and bounces out.

772
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,340
Like she just saw a ghost.

773
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,660
Director Tian doesn't get mad.

774
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,740
Because he's used to it.

775
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,230
Several minutes later,

776
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,640
the lady opens the door and walks in for the second time.

777
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,580
Director Tian asks,

778
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,030
"I see you have come back".

779
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,910
The lady says,

780
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,070
"It'll cost me

781
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,670
50 to see

782
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,860
a female expert doctor,

783
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,710
whereas you only cost me 15".

784
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,520
To prove himself,

785
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,820
Director Tian does all he can

786
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,160
to patiently

787
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,510
explain to the lady.

788
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,340
And she finally calms down.

789
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,940
But before Director Tian

790
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,680
tries to do a gynecologic examination,

791
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,040
the lady decides she still can't accept it.

792
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,380
She goes, "Forget it.

793
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,950
I'll go see the doctor who will cost me 50".

794
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,630
So Director Tian

795
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,890
has to walk her out of the door.

796
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,700
Before the lady walks out,

797
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,780
she looks back at him and says

798
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,500
in a sorry tone,

799
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,860
"Young man, you have good manners.

800
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,250
You look like a decent man,

801
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,310
what makes you want to do this?"

802
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,810
"Do this?"

803
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,460
Do what?

804
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,430
That's like the most offensive thing to say

805
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,780
to a male obstetrics and gynecology doctor without the swears.

806
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,770
Now, time for my story.

807
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,170
And things are different right now.

808
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm at work one day.

809
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,710
A 40-some-year-old lady

810
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,800
comes to

811
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,420
see the doctor.

812
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,340
She opens the door

813
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,210
and is surprised to see me.

814
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,030
But she still comes in

815
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,780
after a brief hesitation.

816
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,870
Now, I heard about

817
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,660
Director Tian's story,

818
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,350
so I know

819
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,400
how to handle

820
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,500
patients like her.

821
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,930
I'm super gentle and patient.

822
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,570
After the examination, she leaves.

823
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,150
Right before she walks out of the door, she looks back at me

824
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,960
and says in a sorry tone,

825
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,960
"Young man, you have a pretty face.

826
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,240
You look like a decent man,

827
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,380
what makes you want to do this?

828
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,100
How about

829
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,460
you come and work for us as an actor?"

830
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,220
Come on.

831
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,830
I only want

832
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,480
to be a doctor.

833
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,910
A good-looking,

834
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,940
young, and likeable male doctor.

835
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,190
What's wrong with that?

836
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,120
The tumor is here.

837
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,400
Not very serious.

838
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,210
If it's removed,

839
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,340
Part of the speech ability

840
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,430
may be lost.

841
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,430
Come in.

842
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,250
You go back to your office

843
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,270
and work on it.

844
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,880
On the tomorrow's morning meeting,

845
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,810
we'll talk about it.

846
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,130
OK, I'm off.

847
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,270
What do you want to talk about?

848
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,280
I'm not here to catch up with you, obviously.

849
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,870
I have evidence of you taking bribery.

850
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,650
If you don't give

851
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,960
me my mother's legacy,

852
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,790
I'll report you to the hospital administration.

853
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,090
Here's a clue, check your mailbox.

854
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,790
You conclude that I was taking bribery?

855
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,080
If something

856
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,180
needs to be done with cash,

857
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,850
I say

858
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,950
it's a shady business.

859
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,490
This is all that you have learned

860
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,660
in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department?

861
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,360
Get out!

862
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,900
I will.

863
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,170
But

864
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,160
you'll have one week.

865
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,330
Or I'll send the video.

866
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,450
See you a week later.

867
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,050
You bastard.

868
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,280
Morning.

869
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,670
You finished your breakfast?

870
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,220
I have smartened up.

871
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,490
I ate it outside.

872
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,810
Morning, Mr. and Mrs. Du.

873
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,140
Stop there.

874
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,530
Take one more step

875
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,920
and I'll let the entire hospital know

876
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,580
that you are an ungrateful daughter.

877
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,750
I know clearly why you came.

878
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,830
I won't do it.

879
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,180
If so,

880
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,210
I'll be standing here until you do.

881
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,640
I won't leave.

882
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,440
Is there anything that I can help with?

883
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,870
Shut up.

884
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,660
Bed No. 36 is calling.

885
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,890
The twins. Come on.

886
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:11,940
You can't go.

887
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,210
Dad, what are you doing?

888
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,790
My dear,

889
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,730
get up.

890
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,230
You are a heartless daughter.

891
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,670
You aren't qualified to be a doctor.

892
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,170
Mr. Du, please get up.

893
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,460
Go check things out.

894
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,500
Let me know if there's any problem.

895
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,020
OK.

896
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,490
Can you please get up first?

897
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,030
No.

898
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,200
This is illegal.

899
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,100
I can't tell.

900
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,280
Du Di,

901
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,220
just help your dad.

902
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,150
I don't want to see you humiliated.

903
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,160
If it continues,

904
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,600
you can't work here at Shengji Hospital anymore.

905
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,030
Mom, you, too?

906
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,370
I only wish

907
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,440
to live an ordinary life with your dad.

908
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,360
You know

909
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,660
your dad treats me well.

910
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,610
I don't want this thing

911
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,040
to ruin our family.

912
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,470
I don't want us to fight.

913
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,640
Du Di.

914
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,340
Please.

915
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,870
One of the fetuses

916
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,930
has low heart rate.

917
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:06,760
Who's there?

918
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,990
The doctor from the last shift.

919
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,220
Dr. Lin will be there soon.

920
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,250
Get up.

921
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:12,880
I have got work to do.

922
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,100
I must go.

923
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:17,980
You go there first.

924
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
I'll be there right after this is over.

925
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,500
Mom, please get up.

926
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,040
Mom.

927
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,650
A boy.

928
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,050
What?

929
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,940
Say that again?

930
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,130
She's pregnant with a boy.

931
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,380
A boy?

932
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,480
Great. Perfect.

933
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,010
It is a boy.

934
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,700
We… We're finished here.

935
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,340
We'll leave.

936
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,740
Take care.

937
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,530
Go, go, go.

938
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,450
Let's go.

939
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,470
Come on.

940
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,610
The small one's heart rate is not looking good.

941
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,980
Very low heart rate.

942
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,660
You need to make a choice.

943
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,850
Embryo reduction or cesarean?

944
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,380
Cesarean.

945
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,480
No.

946
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,250
Keep the big one.

947
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,610
We'll respect

948
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,430
the choice of her family made.

949
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,060
I'll keep both.

950
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,230
Cesarean is my decision.

951
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,220
Sure.

952
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,370
Get the operation room ready.

953
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,570
Will you watch the operation with us?

954
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:47,730
You go first.

955
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,370
I'll join you later.

956
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,460
Senior, are you feeling unwell?

957
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,480
Tell me,

958
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,790
what's wrong with being a girl?

959
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,260
I don't think

960
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,630
it's necessarily the case

961
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,450
that they chose cesarean

962
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,350
because the big one is a girl

963
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,580
and the small one is a boy.

964
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,120
Maybe they

965
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,390
simply want to keep both babies.

966
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:17,730
Whatever.

967
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,360
Get the small one out first.

968
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,580
Dr. Lin's skills

969
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,850
are amazing.

970
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,150
The small one is out.

971
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,100
It's a girl.

972
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,750
No autonomous respiration.

973
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:03,830
Neonatology department.

974
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,020
Tracheal intubation.

975
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,090
Positive airway pressure.

976
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,949
Adrenaline,

977
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,590
intratracheal injection.

978
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,909
It's an important operation.

979
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,949
How come I don't see

980
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,050
the up-and-coming Director Feng here?

981
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,449
Heart rate, 80.

982
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,550
The big one is a boy.

983
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,530
One-minute rating, 3 points.

984
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,230
Emergency treatment.

985
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,429
Only 3 points.

986
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,659
I wish the best

987
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:47,790
for those two kids.

988
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,120
placental separation normal.

989
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,320
Heart rate, 100.

990
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,340
Chest compression, stop.

991
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,130
The girl is breathing.

992
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,080
Less than 800 grams.

993
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,320
She has no strength to cry.

994
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,360
Send her to the ICU.

995
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,140
Dr. Li, you complete the abdomen closure.

996
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,110
Dr. Li, how are my babies?

997
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,270
The operation was a success.

998
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,620
We got both babies out.

999
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,140
The small one is a girl,
the big one is a boy.

1000
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,030
Are they healthy?

1001
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,160
Due to fetal intrauterine distress,

1002
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,960
the girl had no autonomous respiration when she was born,

1003
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,560
but after tracheal intubation,

1004
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,630
she's now having faint heartbeats.

1005
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,240
The big one is slightly better.

1006
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,250
But

1007
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,860
because his lungs aren't fully developed,

1008
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,080
he needs respiratory support.

1009
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,480
Both babies

1010
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,380
need to go to the ICU.

1011
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,390
Your wife will be

1012
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:10,900
pushed out soon.

1013
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,700
Both babies

1014
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,990
have been sent to the ICU.

1015
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
You can't go see them later.

1016
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,540
OK.

1017
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,700
Thank you, doctor.

1018
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,070
My love.

1019
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,120
My love, how do you feel?

1020
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,100
Children… My children…

1021
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,250
They are alive.

1022
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,030
Let's go to the ward first.

1023
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,130
I love you, my dear.

1024
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,470
What?

1025
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,930
Are you depressed

1026
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,670
because you didn't make the right prediction,

1027
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,210
therefore, failing to

1028
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:47,710
prove that ugliness of human nature?

1029
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,340
When you have the guts

1030
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,380
to introduce your sister to everybody,

1031
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,820
you can come and mock me.

1032
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,970
This is enough.

1033
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,530
When will we stop

1034
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,350
attacking each other?

1035
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,390
You came to see Director Feng?

1036
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,750
No, I'm here

1037
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,770
to check up

1038
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,590
the newborn babies.

1039
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,410
No need to be stealthy.

1040
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,160
Director Feng is out for a meeting,

1041
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,570
and he won't be here in the ward anymore.

1042
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,590
Why hasn't he

1043
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,820
been sitting in on our operations lately?

1044
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,190
Because of

1045
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:44,810
your divorce.

1046
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,000
In the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department,

1047
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,820
no one

1048
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,460
is on his side.

1049
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,230
I have worked

1050
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,300
under him for ages.

1051
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,890
He's a good, honest man.

1052
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,090
You are divorced, we get it.

1053
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,760
But why did you turn

1054
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,800
the entire department against him?

1055
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,820
Whatever.

1056
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:00,660
I'll shut up.

1057
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,020
It's none of my business.

1058
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,470
Who's crying?

1059
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,140
The one who gave birth to two premature babies.

1060
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,470
I don't care!

1061
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,820
You chose a cesarean!

1062
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,490
And now,

1063
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,240
both babies are in danger.

1064
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,780
Dr. Li,

1065
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,620
the big one

1066
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,600
has to stay that much time

1067
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,600
in the ICU, too?

1068
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,390
It's nearly 10,000 a day.

1069
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,280
Two babies,

1070
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,510
that's 600,000 a month.

1071
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,270
I can't afford that.

1072
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,830
The big one

1073
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,570
is in a slightly better condition than the small one.

1074
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,830
But he's a premature baby,

1075
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,260
he's not well developed.

1076
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,260
He needs to be observed

1077
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,290
in the ICU for some more time.

1078
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,970
But we really don't have that much money.

1079
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,790
What's going on?

1080
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,510
Your wife just had the operation.

1081
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,380
She needs to rest.

1082
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,650
Keep her calm.

1083
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,240
I don't mean to upset her,

1084
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,450
but we really can't

1085
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,040
afford it.

1086
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,860
How about one child

1087
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
in the ICU,

1088
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,480
the other in a regular ward?

1089
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,320
A regular ward

1090
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,140
means you're basically

1091
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:11,990
giving the baby up.

1092
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,140
Please think it over.

1093
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,450
Doctor,

1094
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,560
they are both my children.

1095
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,470
I don't intend to give up either of them.

1096
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,610
I just have no choice.

1097
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,380
You are.

1098
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,650
Stop pretending.

1099
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,180
It's on you.

1100
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,370
You took me to this southeast Asian doctor,

1101
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,560
who told us that the big one was a girl,

1102
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,900
and the small one was a boy.

1103
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,450
You insisted on a cesarean.

1104
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,950
Now, both of my babies

1105
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,430
are in danger.

1106
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,830
You said that we'd keep both.

1107
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,320
Now, I'm keeping both.

1108
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,720
You had a fetal

1109
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,280
sex diagnosis abroad?

1110
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,230
It's completely legal.

1111
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,870
I told you not to go.

1112
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,870
You said he didn't cost much.

1113
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,220
Now, you're killing

1114
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,750
both of our children.

1115
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,410
We've still got our boy.

1116
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,600
We can only afford one.

1117
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,520
My love,

1118
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,430
let's keep our son alive.

1119
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,810
The small one has a weak body,

1120
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,080
she'll be ill all the time.

1121
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,910
Think about the future.

1122
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,810
When our son grows up,

1123
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,680
we'll need to prepare a house for him.

1124
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,170
If we're a huge debt now,

1125
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,240
how do we sustain our life anymore?

1126
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,650
I gave birth

1127
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,150
to both of them.

1128
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,390
I'll keep both.

1129
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,940
You'll borrow more money.

1130
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,730
Lili,

1131
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,490
look at us.

1132
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,630
Who would lend us money?

1133
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,240
Doctor, you see.

1134
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,310
We don't have that much money.

1135
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,420
The small one won't stay in the ICU.

1136
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
No ICU?

1137
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,680
This is murder, you know?

1138
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,840
Doctor,

1139
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,390
please watch your language.

1140
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,700
Murder?

1141
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,220
If I had the money,

1142
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,440
why would I do that?

1143
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,470
Don't you talk to me

1144
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,140
on the moral high ground.

1145
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,860
All right, all right.

1146
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,890
Sir, you have the right

1147
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,910
to make your decision.

1148
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,960
As long as you have thought it through,

1149
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,360
there won't be a problem, okay?

1150
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,420
Li Junxiao,

1151
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
are you helping him commit murder?

1152
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,260
What did you say?

1153
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,780
I'm the chief resident

1154
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,260
I'm in charge here.

1155
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,130
Please leave.

1156
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,660
I remember someone mocked me

1157
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,650
for making the wrong prediction.

1158
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,840
It turns out

1159
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,280
they got the genders wrong.

1160
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,710
They're now giving up

1161
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,570
the girl.

1162
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,830
Was I wrong?

1163
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,170
They have the right

1164
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,100
to make a choice

1165
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,220
You'll be the accomplice of a murder.

1166
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,790
Get out. Out!

1167
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,430
Li Junxiao,

1168
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,290
you put your mom

1169
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,070
and sister to shame.

1170
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,240
She was terrifying.

1171
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,070
Doctor,

1172
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,520
I'm not giving up

1173
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,040
the small one

1174
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,170
because she's a girl.

1175
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,100
I really can't afford

1176
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,070
the bills of ICU

1177
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,350
for both kids.

1178
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,490
I know.

1179
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,770
We respect the decision you made.

1180
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,550
What are you doing?

1181
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,590
Why are you hiding here?

1182
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,150
Are you crying?

1183
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,060
What's that?

1184
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,430
A primipara's family gave it to me.

1185
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,840
Can I have one?

1186
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,490
Sure.

1187
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,790
The chocolate

1188
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,350
is quite nice.

1189
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,380
Who bullied you?

1190
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,340
No one bullied me.

1191
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,230
I wanted to see how Feng Yuanhang was doing

1192
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,820
in the neonatology department,

1193
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,390
but the head nurse told me

1194
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,870
that he

1195
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,510
was ruled out by our department,

1196
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,200
and that he'd been transferred to another department.

1197
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,060
I don't know

1198
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,120
why you got a divorce,

1199
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,330
but shouldn't you be happy

1200
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,670
that everybody's on your side?

1201
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,260
No, I'm not.

1202
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,450
I didn't divorce him

1203
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,090
because I don't love him anymore.

1204
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,700
I don't want you guys to treat him like that.

1205
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,070
I'm confused.

1206
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,590
Since you still love him,

1207
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,960
you shouldn't have divorced him.
