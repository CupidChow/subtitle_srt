[Episode 23]

4
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,020
She's not a permanent doctor yet.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,650
After so many years of study,

6
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,259
she's still not a permanent doctor?

7
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,820
Du Mendan's daughter

8
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,960
went to a nursing school for a few years.

9
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,590
Now she's been working for years.

10
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,880
Nursing school is better.

11
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,210
Yes.

12
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,180
They work earlier.

13
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,289
It's useless for a girl

14
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,340
to get much education.

15
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,280
How many people who are barely educated

16
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,660
have a better career in the end?

17
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,600
Du Di

18
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,220
will be promoted.

19
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,700
Right.

20
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,070
Promoted and more promising.

21
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,940
Right.

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,330
What does your husband do?

23
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,460
I'm not married yet.

24
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,980
You're almost 30, right?

25
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,660
Still not married?

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,680
Yongfu.

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,329
What were you doing as a father?

28
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,140
A lot of her colleagues aren't married, either.

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,740
Well, don't wait until you're 30.

30
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,579
People will laugh at you,

31
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,770
guessing you might have something wrong.

32
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,030
Who knows?

33
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,700
Maybe I won't get married until 40.

34
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,970
Don't talk

35
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,930
such nonsense.

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,590
Granny, you don't know.

37
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,140
Well-educated young girls

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,410
are career-oriented.

39
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,520
They don't want to get married early.

40
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,060
Yes.

41
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,579
Du Di, you have to find someone

42
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,130
worthy of you.

43
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,050
Don't worry.

44
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,780
You're such a crybaby.

45
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,660
I just wanted you

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,240
to speak English with your cousin.

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,550
Why are you crying?

48
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,950
My boy

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,840
failed English test

50
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,200
every time.

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,050
If you don't

52
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,850
do your best at school,

53
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,410
you'll grow up a loser.

54
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,470
All right. Stop it.

55
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,510
Come on, darling, come here.

56
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,580
It's OK. Dry your tears.

57
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:03,980
Gee.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,870
Grandma will give you some pocket money.

59
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,940
Dry your tears, my boy.

60
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,540
Look, here is some pocket money.

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,180
Buy yourself some snacks.

62
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,060
Let's give you 10 yuan.

63
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,140
OK?

64
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,420
Thank you, Grandma.

65
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,020
You're welcome.

66
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,100
Buy some snacks.

67
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,940
Darling.

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,260
What's so good about English?

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,140
English can't get you in the genealogy.

70
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,660
The one who can get in

71
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,700
is soon to be born.

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,980
The Du family

73
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,500
will finally have an heir.

74
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,100
Exactly.

75
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,230
My mom and I

76
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,740
have been praying for that for years.

77
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,620
Du Di,

78
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,050
we're building a house.

79
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,829
We're still short of 80,000 yuan.

80
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,690
Look,

81
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,420
you're not married and don't plan to buy a house.

82
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,500
Lend me the money.

83
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,020
Wait, a few days ago,

84
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,500
we just lent you 20,000, didn't we?

85
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,540
That's not enough.

86
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,060
Not enough?

87
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,530
Du Di, help your cousin.

88
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,050
Sure.

89
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,270
I have 8 yuan.

90
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,210
Why don't I buy you dinner?

91
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,960
What do you mean?

92
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,220
All right.

93
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,180
Look, Du Di just came back today.

94
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,620
Whatever it is,

95
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,810
let's talk later.

96
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,910
Let her rest, OK?

97
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:24,940
Why don't we

98
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,030
just call it a day?

99
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,860
It's getting late.

100
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,060
In a few days,

101
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,400
Du Di will treat us to dinner, OK?

102
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,980
OK?

103
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,620
OK, let's go.

104
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,700
Thank you, Grandma. Goodbye.

105
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,150
Bye. Good night.

106
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,380
Let me do it.

107
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,010
Don't hurt the baby.

108
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,800
Mom, I can do it.

109
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,620
You sit down.

110
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,180
Which man does cleaning?

111
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,220
This is a woman's job.

112
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,500
Mom,

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,570
I'll go unpack.

114
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,660
Look how you've spoiled her.

115
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,670
Are you there yet?

116
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,980
Reply to me if you are.

117
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,230
Have you arrived?

118
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,050
Didn't you say it takes 3, 4 hours?

119
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,290
It's been 10 hours now.

120
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,380
Are you angry?

121
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,610
You thought I didn't go because I wasn't ready.

122
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,940
I'm at the airport now.

123
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,300
I have to go back to the lab immediately.

124
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,020
They suddenly said

125
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,980
the experimental technology cannot be exported.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,090
The project runs into a little trouble.

127
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,680
Give me a reply, Du Di.

128
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,770
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,170
I should have gone to see you first.

130
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,560
Du Di, Du Di.

131
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
Du Di, if you don't reply,

132
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,280
I'm going to cry.

133
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,700
I'm boarding the plane.

134
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,060
I'll contact you

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,000
in 12 hours.

136
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,190
Are you too busy

137
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,410
taking care of your parents?

138
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,180
Or is something wrong?

139
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,370
Answer me.

140
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,420
Dad's asleep?

141
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,320
Yeah.

142
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,220
Mom, tell me the truth.

143
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Why did you want me to come back

144
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,190
so urgently?

145
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,980
I just miss you.

146
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,120
Tell me the truth.

147
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,650
Later, now go to sleep.

148
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,680
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

149
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,740
OK, I'm leaving.

150
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:42,740
Don't.

151
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,730
You're so bossy.

152
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,290
You know your grandma

153
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,260
insisted that we came back,

154
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,830
saying that she'd take care of me

155
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,690
until her grandson is born.

156
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,980
And your dad

157
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,860
said your grandma was old

158
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,310
and didn't have much time to live.

159
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,660
We didn't have a son before.

160
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,780
But soon we will.

161
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,850
Your dad wanted to find his dignity back,

162
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,180
so we came back.

163
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,440
But

164
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,180
a few days after we came back,

165
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,820
your grandma wouldn't let me take the medicine.

166
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,140
What medicine?

167
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,980
Hypotensor.

168
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,460
They don't let you take hypotensor?

169
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Are they crazy?

170
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,940
Don't they know how dangerous

171
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,920
hypotension is to a pregnant woman?

172
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,420
She said too much hypotensor

173
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,050
would have a bad effect on her grandson.

174
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,060
But I remember you told me

175
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,840
I have to keep the blood pressure stable.

176
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,820
Your dad didn't want me to tell you.

177
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,770
So I could only

178
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,260
tried my best to call you back.

179
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,060
Why do I feel that

180
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,180
your mom is asking for your help?

181
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,480
Why didn't I notice it earlier?

182
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,900
As a daughter,

183
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,540
I'm not as sensitive as an outsider.

184
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,380
You what?

185
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,740
Nothing.

186
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,490
I'll talk to the benighted mom and son

187
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,670
tomorrow morning.

188
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,910
If they don't agree,

189
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,650
I'll argue with them.

190
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,290
I'll make a scene.

191
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,550
Don't. Your grandma is turning 80.

192
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,570
She can't stand it.

193
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
You think of a plan,

194
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,500
or make up an excuse.

195
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,180
Tell them something is wrong with me.

196
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,090
You need to take your dad and I

197
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,360
back to the city.

198
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,370
OK.

199
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,370
Mom,

200
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,500
grandma has high hopes for the baby to be a boy.

201
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,200
The relatives

202
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,350
are not helping.

203
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,580
Have you ever thought

204
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,220
what to do

205
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,539
if, I mean if,

206
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,280
we find the baby is not a boy

207
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:40,950
when it's born?

208
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,539
How could it be?

209
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,220
We did the ultrasound test, didn't we?

210
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,320
It says it's a son.

211
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,420
Ultrasound

212
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,350
is not 100% accurate.

213
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,780
There will be a chance of error.

214
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,710
Ultrasound is not accurate?

215
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,340
But you were there.

216
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,580
How about

217
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,380
we do another when we go back?

218
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,140
No need.

219
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,160
It should not be wrong.

220
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,650
Stop thinking about it. Go to sleep.

221
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,940
Tomorrow we will work out something

222
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,220
to make your grandma believe

223
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,320
I have to go back.

224
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,110
See a dentist.

225
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,070
What is going on here?

226
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,960
A doctor from the city is back.

227
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,670
The relatives

228
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,740
all come to you for advice.

229
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:54,890
I can't.

230
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,470
I went shopping in the county.

231
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,560
There was a free medical checkup on the street.

232
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,580
After the checkup, they said

233
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,220
I have eccyclomastopathy.

234
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,770
It's going to develop into breast cancer.

235
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,360
They told me to go for surgery.

236
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,620
It will cost more than 8,000.

237
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,570
I don't have that much money!

238
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,720
Don't cry.

239
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,830
First,

240
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,030
not all eccyclomastopathy

241
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,340
will develop into breast cancer.

242
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,580
It's a complete lie

243
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,440
it'll turn to cancer immediately.

244
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,260
You're fooled.

245
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,560
If you're still worried,

246
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,430
go to a public hospital,

247
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,750
have another breast examination

248
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,860
and listen to a real doctor's advice.

249
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,740
This child

250
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,230
poops once every 3 days

251
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,510
and it stinks.

252
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,950
My neighbor's child

253
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,860
is the same age

254
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,210
and he poops every day.

255
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,860
It's OK.

256
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,900
As long as

257
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,220
he keeps the frequency.

258
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
He's fine.

259
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,320
-Go home.
-OK.

260
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,690
-Eat more vegetables and fruit.
-Thank you.

261
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,980
Cousin,

262
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,520
please tell me.

263
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,250
Is this baby a boy or a girl?

264
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,910
Cousin,

265
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,020
my eyes do not

266
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,880
have the function of ultrasound.

267
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,630
Go home.

268
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,450
The tooth won't come out.

269
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,450
I don't know how to pull out teeth. Go home.

270
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,750
Do I have prostate cancer?

271
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,190
I'm not an andrologist.

272
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,030
Please go back.

273
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,980
This is not over.

274
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,700
Let me tell you something.

275
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,820
It's gonna drive them away.

276
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,660
Everyone, your prescriptions

277
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,980
will be

278
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,310
posted at the entrance of the village.

279
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,620
Go and see for yourselves.

280
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,850
Let's go.

281
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,140
Let's go home.

282
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,580
Mom, you're great. Genius.

283
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,680
I learned it

284
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,950
from rich experience in dealing with them.

285
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,130
Mom, why don't you eat?

286
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,260
Why are you just sighing?

287
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,210
You see our relatives

288
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,860
all have a lot of grandchildren.

289
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,620
Look at our family.

290
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,800
Barely any members.

291
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,600
Just 4.

292
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,980
If we were a big flourishing family,

293
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,070
women wouldn't have been allowed to eat at the table.

294
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,920
In the days I'm back,

295
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,140
I've heard a lot of stories.

296
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,540
I heard my aunt had a son.

297
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,060
It's the one crying last night, right?

298
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,950
My uncle works in the city

299
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,240
and he met another woman.

300
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,480
Recently, he's trying

301
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,310
to divorce my aunt.

302
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,860
The second cousin who always took my toys

303
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,950
when we were young

304
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,540
works honestly.

305
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,980
But he's addicted to video games

306
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,750
while working.

307
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,580
Even now, he is still asking his family

308
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,370
for living expenses.

309
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,970
Yesterday, my oldest cousin borrowed money from me.

310
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,440
The money you lent him

311
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,400
to build the house

312
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,500
was lost in gambling again.

313
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,710
His girlfriend

314
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,050
and her family said

315
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,230
no house,

316
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,260
no wedding.

317
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,990
The grandchildren you mentioned

318
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,090
are all terrible, rotten ones.

319
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,330
Men like them

320
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,320
can do little contribution

321
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,130
to the society

322
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,410
except for the purpose of breeding.

323
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,140
Grandma,

324
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,860
if you like them,

325
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,100
just adopt them.

326
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,310
But I'm just afraid that

327
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,910
you won't keep your pension money in the end.

328
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,180
Hey,

329
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,670
don't be rude to your grandma.

330
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,820
You're good.

331
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,260
You're a PhD.

332
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,740
Yet you have no manners.

333
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,010
Can you say something nice?

334
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,740
What I just said

335
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,540
is nice.

336
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,830
Come with me!

337
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,660
What?

338
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,500
You want to execute me here?

339
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,740
Look at this piece of land.

340
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,390
This is the best land

341
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,580
in Dujia Village.

342
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,660
It belonged to our family.

343
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,060
It doesn't now?

344
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,740
When your grandpa passed away,

345
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,930
I was only 3 years old.

346
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,540
It were just your grandma and me.

347
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,030
My uncles

348
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,180
wanted this piece of land.

349
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,670
So they insisted

350
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,620
the land to be reallocated

351
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,060
according to headcount.

352
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
They had 5 brothers.

353
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,180
Whoever disagreed, they would beat them up.

354
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,740
Your grandma had no choice but to watch them

355
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,480
take the land.

356
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,140
This is the saddest thing

357
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,700
in your grandma's life.

358
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,010
She thought she didn't

359
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,150
protect our family's ancestral property.

360
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,860
In our village,

361
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,450
if a family doesn't have a son,

362
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,320
they'll be ridiculed.

363
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,860
If there are not

364
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,710
strong men,

365
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,140
they'll be bullied.

366
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,380
In the family council,

367
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,690
women

368
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,500
don't have a voice.

369
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,260
You were born and raised in the city.

370
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,620
You don't know how difficult

371
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,780
women's life is here in the country.

372
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,340
So,

373
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,110
I hope you don't

374
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,180
scold your grandma.

375
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,060
She has had a hard life.

376
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,260
Then you can take her to the city

377
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,500
and don't ever come back.

378
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,760
It's not that easy.

379
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
Our root is here.

380
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,670
When your grandma passes away,

381
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,410
she will be buried in our ancestral cemetery.

382
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,460
Root.

383
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,500
Dad, you've been away for years.

384
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,850
Are you suffering from lack of water or oxygen?

385
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,780
You've been kidnapped by tradition,

386
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,050
the shadow of your childhood,

387
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,210
and the so-called relatives.

388
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,590
You turn a blind eye to the fact

389
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,260
that the modern society

390
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,220
is decades more advanced than here.

391
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,630
No, for first-tier cities,

392
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,120
it's hundreds of years more advanced.

393
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,670
You never told me before

394
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,870
why exactly

395
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,140
you always wanted to have a son.

396
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,380
Now I know the answer.

397
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,260
I get it,

398
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,100
but I don't understand.

399
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,390
I don't understand why you people

400
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,750
always look backwards

401
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,980
when you should look forward.

402
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,850
I don't expect

403
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,360
you to understand.

404
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,340
I just hope that

405
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,240
you can stop pissing off your grandma

406
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,500
and take good care of your mom.

407
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,110
If you really care about my mom,

408
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,060
take her back as soon as possible.

409
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,180
My mom is...

410
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,800
What's wrong with her?

411
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,700
What happened?

412
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,890
I touched her bulge last night.

413
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,030
The fetus is too small.

414
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,480
And my mom keeps saying she's not feeling well.

415
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,180
If it stops growing,

416
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,300
your son will be gone.

417
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,290
Wasn't everything fine

418
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,210
after the last checkup?

419
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,340
How could it stop growing?

420
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,320
It's normal.

421
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,020
And my mom is not young.

422
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,580
If you don't take her away quickly,

423
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,650
I can't guarantee

424
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,640
your son's safety.

425
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,790
OK, we'll go right away.

426
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,580
Right now.

427
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,580
Why are you looking at me?

428
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,640
These are dirty sheets from the labor room.

429
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,580
Do you wanna check them?

430
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,570
Knock it off. Don't get cocky.

431
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,200
If your brother hadn't begged me,

432
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,000
I would have sued you.

433
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,710
Don't feel good about it.

434
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,230
I am feeling good right now.

435
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,540
My brother is in love.

436
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,210
She has a PhD and is a local registered resident.

437
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,460
A female doctor

438
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,880
who has a house and a promising future.

439
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm feeling good.

440
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,140
Oh,

441
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,060
is that why you like her? Her registered residence

442
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,820
and the house?

443
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,540
Right, those are the things

444
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,810
you people like

445
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,050
because they save you decades of hard work.

446
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,250
My brother will become more and more sought-after.

447
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,390
As long as he's not with you

448
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,800
who will only drag him behind,

449
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,369
his life will be better and better.

450
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,310
I drag him behind?

451
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,849
At least I've never been married before.

452
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,859
What about Wu Congrui?

453
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,140
She lost a child.

454
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,460
What?

455
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,569
Forget it.

456
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,490
Have you eaten?

457
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,770
Yeah, with Congrui.

458
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,680
Xiaojuan, you're still up?

459
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,860
I'm going to bed.

460
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,520
Xiaojuan, what is this?

461
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,600
Don't you recognize dad and mom?

462
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,450
Dad, mom, it's been a long time.

463
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,860
I've been busy lately.

464
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,740
After a while,

465
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,840
I'll definitely go back home to see you.

466
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,370
Do you have the nerve to?

467
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,420
You haven't handled your things well.

468
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:21,940
Now,

469
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,040
you and I swear to dad and mom.

470
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,700
Swear what?

471
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,870
You have to swear

472
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
that you'll marry a virgin

473
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,250
who's never been divorced

474
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,120
or had a miscarriage.

475
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,780
Xiaojuan, stop it.

476
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,580
I've liked Wu Congrui for long.

477
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,490
And we both

478
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,450
want to have more than one kid.

479
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,790
We will be very happy together.

480
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,410
I don't think so.

481
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,220
Can she be pregnant again after the miscarriage?

482
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,900
If she could, why the divorce?

483
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,020
Xiaojuan, not every woman

484
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,540
is like you

485
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,340
who's divorced

486
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,050
because they can't have a baby.

487
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,540
I'm sorry.

488
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,620
I didn't mean it.

489
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,690
If you have to interfere

490
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,710
with my love relationship,

491
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,380
you have to swear

492
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,380
to dad and mom today

493
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,420
that you won't marry a courier.

494
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,660
Why should I swear?

495
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,250
Wang Dacheng and I

496
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,530
are perfect in every way.

497
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,400
Why can't I marry him?

498
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,500
Do you think dad and mom

499
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,620
will be happy about what you said?

500
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,620
All I know is

501
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,840
if they knew

502
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,820
you're gonna marry Wu Congrui,

503
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,350
they'd be unhappy for sure.

504
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,480
All right.

505
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,690
Let's stop this conversation.

506
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,140
OK?

507
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,580
Neither of us can persuade the other.

508
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,640
I can't sleep here

509
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,280
in front the pictures

510
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,110
of dad and mom.

511
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,500
So I'm going back to work in the hospital.

512
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,760
I won't come back

513
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,540
until you put them away.

514
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,690
You're back.

515
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,130
Don't you have one more day off?

516
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,010
You don't have to come to the ward.

517
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,790
Yes.

518
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,530
Liu Nianbai is coming back, I guess.

519
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,260
What's up? Did you have a fight?

520
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,580
Whether he's coming back or not,

521
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,780
it has nothing to do with me.

522
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,420
By the way, big event.

523
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,200
Now that you're back,

524
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,880
you can't miss it.

525
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,390
Super consultation

526
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,210
by over 20 professors from our hospital.

527
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,180
Come with me now.

528
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,760
Come on.

529
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,140
You're back!

530
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,630
What's going on?

531
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,920
It's about an Internet celebrity lawyer,

532
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,190
the one who wrote Broken Love,

533
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,210
Gao Ying, you know her?

534
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,660
Yes.

535
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,030
She has a post on Weibo

536
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,630
about her congenital heart disease.

537
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,730
-What about her?
-Congenital heart disease

538
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,380
combined with pulmonary aortic hypertension.

539
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,800
And she's pregnant.

540
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,030
She's now in our hospital.

541
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,260
It's already 25 weeks.

542
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,260
That's crazy.

543
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,620
She went to other hospitals.

544
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,900
They didn't want her

545
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,410
and told her to terminate her pregnancy.

546
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,520
Now she's our patient.

547
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,850
The purpose of this meeting

548
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,150
is to discuss whether she should keep the child

549
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,900
or not.

550
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,390
The mortality rate of pregnant patients

551
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,140
with pulmonary aortic hypertension

552
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,420
is 30% to 50%.

553
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,650
How can she have a baby?

554
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,390
Definitely not!

555
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,470
But she said

556
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,270
the child is the best gift

557
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,700
from God.

558
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,740
She's definitely going to give birth

559
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,500
to this child.

560
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,740
And how do you know that?

561
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,290
I've been reading her Weibo posts.

562
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,270
Everyone be quiet.

563
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,540
I wanna say something.

564
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,140
The patient's condition is very serious.

565
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,140
Pulmonary artery pressure

566
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,980
has reached 150.

567
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,270
She's 25 weeks pregnant.

568
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,720
Let's discuss today

569
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,630
if she can

570
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,220
keep this child or not.

571
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,170
It is no longer a question of

572
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,460
whether she can have it.

573
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,900
Congenital heart disease combined with pregnancy

574
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,170
and pulmonary aortic hypertension,

575
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,560
without exaggeration,

576
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,060
means she's

577
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,140
already at the doorway to death.

578
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,460
The baby is big.

579
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,850
Even if the pregnancy is terminated,

580
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,730
once the baby is born,

581
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,010
the circulation load of the body increases.

582
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,030
Her heart won't be able to handle it.

583
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,290
Dr. Tian, in Shengji Hospital,

584
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,550
we always tell

585
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,620
women with such diseases

586
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,070
that pregnancy is a taboo.

587
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,430
The patient

588
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,580
coming to us

589
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,440
in such a situation

590
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,660
is simply putting us in a hot pan.

591
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
The patient is a lawyer

592
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,590
and has many fans.

593
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,350
Patients like her

594
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,580
are hot potatoes.

595
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,060
We could get into medical disputes.

596
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,960
Of course I know that.

597
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,350
But it's too late.

598
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,900
She already posted on Weibo

599
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,270
that she'd give birth to this child

600
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,180
in Shengji Hospital.

601
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Shengji Hospital is known as

602
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,690
the best Obstetric and Gynecologic Department in China.

603
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,810
The time has come to verify

604
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,940
this.

605
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,420
This is kidnapping.

606
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,290
Given the conditions of her heart and lungs,

607
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,140
she could die

608
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,380
right after the operation.

609
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,540
The baby would be a premature infant

610
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,090
and can hardly survive.

611
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,180
This is a risk

612
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,140
I don't think the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department can take.

613
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,020
Neither can the Cardiac Department.

614
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,720
But if we refuse to admit her now,

615
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,190
the patient's treatment will be delayed.

616
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,530
The patient's life is the most important thing.

617
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,500
She has no other

618
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,700
better hospital to go to.

619
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:52,940
I believe

620
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,740
other hospitals

621
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,020
must have the same concerns.

622
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,420
Their software and hardware

623
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,260
are not as good as Shengji.

624
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,540
Because our hospital

625
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,700
is already the top of the line.

626
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,090
Why are you shouting?

627
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,060
Sorry, everyone.

628
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,030
I found Gao Ying

629
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,940
already posted on Weibo

630
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,540
the diary of our treatment

631
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,180
and she made a clear comparison

632
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,940
of successful cases abroad

633
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,340
and the medical competence

634
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,460
of Shengji Hospital.

635
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,180
She said the success rate of pregnancy

636
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,510
under her situation is not low.

637
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,030
She mentioned my name.

638
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,900
Not only did she mention your name,

639
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,920
she also posted your CV.

640
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,000
They say it's hard to ride a tiger.

641
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,900
This time

642
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,020
you're riding a saber-toothed tiger.

643
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,310
Look,

644
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,430
many people commented that

645
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,250
Shengji's Obstetric and Gynecologic Department is the best.

646
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,330
It looks like you're not gambling your life

647
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,460
to have this baby.

648
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,790
That makes me feel much better.

649
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,020
I've looked up so much information.

650
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,620
I can have a baby in my condition.

651
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,700
Those hospitals just don't want to take the responsibility.

652
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,070
They're afraid of pregnancy death review.

653
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Pregnancy death review?

654
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,240
The scrutiny

655
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,700
to find the cause of a pregnant woman

656
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,310
by at least the hospital itself,

657
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,930
the district and municipal authorities.

658
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,640
All parties including the doctor, head of the department

659
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,770
and intern nurses

660
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,260
will be questioned

661
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,940
to review every detail.

662
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,980
Three conclusions can be drawn in the end,

663
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,770
unavoidable,

664
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,200
avoidable on certain conditions,

665
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,700
and avoidable.

666
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,540
If the latter two conclusions are reached,

667
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,070
the president could be relieved of his post.

668
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,930
OK, don't jinx it.

669
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,660
You're not going to die.

670
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,820
You're a lawyer.

671
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,500
I agree on your pregnancy

672
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,060
because I trust your judgment, right?

673
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,620
Don't say anything about death.

674
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,040
It's unlucky.

675
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,350
OK.

676
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,030
You know what, honey?

677
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,560
When I was young

678
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,990
I was also an ambitious

679
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,680
Company Law attorney

680
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,940
with a lot of dreams.

681
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,950
But I never thought

682
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,870
I found out I had congenital heart disease

683
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,360
when I was 30 years old.

684
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,240
I could no longer be a lawyer

685
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,780
and my husband divorced me.

686
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,180
That year I learned

687
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,340
what heartbreak was.

688
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,710
It's the pain

689
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,300
you suffer both physically and mentally.

690
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,070
I told my ex-husband at the time

691
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,760
I could have children,

692
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,080
but he insisted on divorcing me.

693
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,830
Later I learned that

694
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,940
at that time

695
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,650
he had fallen in love with another woman.

696
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
He left you so we could meet.

697
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,180
And then, you came into my life.

698
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,740
I have to give birth to a child

699
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,700
for you

700
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,180
and make up for the life I lost.

701
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,580
As long as you're healthy,

702
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,100
I don't care

703
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,990
if we have children or not.

704
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,910
What worries me the most

705
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,150
is your health.

706
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,950
Don't worry.

707
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,550
I've looked up so much information

708
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,420
about similar cases abroad.

709
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,250
The mortality rate of this disease

710
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,210
is not as high as they said.

711
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,700
It's tiring to talk, right?

712
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,580
I'm OK.

713
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,290
OK, stop.

714
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,230
Have some rest.

715
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,620
Congrui, do you have a minute?

716
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,930
I want to talk to you.

717
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,300
How did you find me here, Xiaojuan?

718
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,120
Wait for me a minute.

719
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,600
I have two more stitches to finish.

720
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,060
Let's talk when I'm done.

721
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:31,740
OK.

722
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,730
You need to take pictures of the stitches?

723
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,370
Junxiao told me to send pictures

724
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,440
after each practice.

725
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,670
He wants to see

726
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,930
if I have improved.

727
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,680
What can I do for you, Xiaojuan?

728
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,070
Let's sit down and talk.

729
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,320
Sit.

730
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,570
Here, take this.

731
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,740
What's this?

732
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,760
Breakup fee.

733
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,850
For who?

734
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,380
You and Junxiao.

735
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,790
Please break up with him.

736
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,220
Why do you want me to break up with him?

737
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,240
Please don't hate me.

738
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,410
I know you're a good girl.

739
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:26,980
And I like you.

740
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,620
But you're divorced

741
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,060
and had a miscarriage.

742
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,340
But my brother has never been married.

743
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,640
If people know

744
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,900
he's dating a divorced woman,

745
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,260
they'll laugh at him.

746
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,230
Xiaojuan,

747
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,050
Junxiao and I are adults.

748
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,660
We've made

749
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,800
a mature and serious judgment

750
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,110
of this relationship.

751
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,340
We don't care

752
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,610
about the reasons you said.

753
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,360
As for others,

754
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,760
if they mock us,

755
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,070
we'll stay away from them.

756
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,610
Those who have those ideas

757
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,780
don't deserve to be our friends.

758
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,740
Wait, you mean

759
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,800
no breakup?

760
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,660
No.

761
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,910
Unless Li Junxiao

762
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,650
comes to tell me he wants to break up.

763
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,380
Xiaojuan, I'm sorry.

764
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,720
The relationship between me and Junxiao

765
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,100
has nothing to do with anyone else,

766
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,450
including his sister.

767
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,650
I will not tell Junxiao

768
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,300
you came to talk to me.

769
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,860
Xiaojuan, Junxiao told me

770
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,320
he had a fight with you

771
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,420
and left home.

772
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,550
He won't go home today.

773
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,470
I'll talk to him for you.

774
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,280
You must talk to him for me.

776
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,270
Listen,

777
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,260
I don't know

778
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,170
what's on his mind every day.

779
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,340
We're family.

780
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,400
Yet he often

781
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,500
runs away from home.

782
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,510
Why?

783
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,580
It's been a long time.

784
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,190
I just came back from my hometown.

785
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,890
And you came straight to the bar.

786
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,350
Too many things

787
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,450
that make you happy or sad?

788
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,680
You're too noisy.

789
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,140
Long Island Iced Tea.

790
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,740
Hey,

791
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,760
are you so stingy

792
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,820
with alcohol now?

793
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,660
It's like water.

794
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,930
Du Di wants something strong tonight.

795
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,500
OK.

796
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,910
I will make you a strong one.

Yes.

I'm really the best bartender in China.

I even have your address saved.

5 minutes. I'll wait with you for the car.

836

Hi, ya.

837

-Thank you.
-I'm going in. Bye.

Are you drunk?

841
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,190
I think it's a hallucination.

842
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,140
It's not against law to punch a phantom, right?

843
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,870
What did I do last night?

844
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,110
You have to take responsibility.

845
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,540
What happened?

846
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,060
I did this to you?

847
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,240
It's a hallucination.

848
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,930
Is it a hallucination?

849
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,670
Liu Nianbai,

850
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,090
do you know that I really

851
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,880
really miss you?

852
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,620
Do you?

853
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,260
Do you?

854
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:20,290
So do I.

855
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,520
Sorry, I drank too much last night.

856
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,889
Let's go to the hospital.

857
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,040
I'm injured badly. I can't get up.

858
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,969
Come on.

859
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:41,920
You...

860
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,570
Liu Nianbai, do you want to die?

861
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,150
You almost killed me.

862
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,139
I'm sorry.

863
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:54,580
It hurts.

864
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,560
Then I'll apply some ointment to you.

865
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,400
No ointment, I want a kiss.

866
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,140
No.

867
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,760
I want a kiss.

868
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,460
My mouth hurts.

869
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,680
Kiss me on the lips.

870
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,890
We kissed so many times and you still blush.

871
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,600
Cute.

872
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,810
Liu Nianbai!

873
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,460
Get up!

874
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,240
I haven't forgiven you

875
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,500
for lying to me.

876
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,940
How dare you ask me to make noodles for you?

877
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,570
Either you forgive me or not, I have to eat.

878
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,380
Tell me.

879
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,850
What happened last night?

880
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,970
You beat me up.

881
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,650
Look how bad it is.

882
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,150
You pulled my shirt off

883
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,500
and broke my ears.

884
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,640
The stuffings are showing.

885
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,470
Liu Nianbai,

886
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,610
you're so dead.

887
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,610
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

888
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,560
Stop! Don't hide! Don't hide!

889
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,830
You must love me so much

890
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,630
that you diverted the target

891
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,710
of your violence, right?

892
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,660
OK, knock it off.

893
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,250
I have to go.

894
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,400
You don't have to work today.

895
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,010
Why?

896
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,060
I asked Dr. Tian to give you leave.

897
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,050
You're abusing your power.

898
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,700
No, it's an abuse of favor.

899
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,890
I'm going to work.

900
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,280
You're not working today.

901
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,840
You're going to watch a movie with me.

902
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,920
Who said that?

903
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,150
My shoes said so.

904
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,990
I sewed your shoes again.

905
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,790
And these two pairs are more expensive.

906
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,120
Why did you pick a cartoon

907
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,680
out of all the movies?

908
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,290
This one got a high rating.

909
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,110
Let's watch it.

910
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,160
Why are you staring at me?

911
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,620
You're so attentive

912
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,560
even when watching a movie.

913
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,840
I come to watch the movie,

914
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,870
of course I have to focus.

915
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,940
But we don't come to the cinema

916
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,450
simply to watch the movie.

917
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
They hug

918
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,330
while watching a cartoon?

919
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,200
If they watch the anatomy,

920
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,140
are they gonna kiss?

921
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,440
I should have taken you

922
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,520
to watch the anatomy.

923
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,730
The effect is the same anyway.

924
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,780
Are you a dog?

925
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,830
How do you feel about it?

926
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,110
I talked to my dad

927
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,020
when I went back this time.

928
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,980
How was the conversation?

929
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,820
Not good.

930
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,700
Although I finally found out

931
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,480
why he had to

932
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,660
have a son,

933
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,530
I can hardly

934
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,580
understand the reason.

935
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,180
The dad

936
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,260
in the movie

937
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,760
has his own

938
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,070
values and tradition,

939
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,180
but deep down inside,

940
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,530
he loves his children.

941
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,380
My dad

942
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,870
also has his

943
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:51,770
values and tradition,

944
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,200
but he'll never

945
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,390
do anything for me.

946
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,530
There is no father who doesn't love his children.

947
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,970
Maybe he just

948
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,320
hasn't expressed it yet.

949
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,690
The words are particularly unconvincing

950
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,170
from you.

951
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,260
Right.

952
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,580
I don't even want

953
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,820
to see my father again.

954
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,500
We're in the same boat.

955
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,220
I really did not lie to you.

956
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,750
When I was in college,

957
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
I did volunteer work

958
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,060
in this mall.

959
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,600
I was wearing the bear costume

960
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,970
and it was hot.

961
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,010
I was soaked in sweat.

962
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:33,960
So hard?

963
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,390
That's right.

964
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,030
It's not any easier than doing surgery.

965
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,870
Are we going to watch the movie now?

966
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,220
They're gone.

967
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,010
I want to ask you

968
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,950
a serious question.

969
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,030
I'm very very serious.

970
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,930
I'm listening.

971
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,290
Do you still love him?

972
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,340
Do you still have him in your heart?

973
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,230
When you asked me last time,

974
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,470
I didn't have time to answer you.

975
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,750
Now I can tell you

976
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,680
for sure

977
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,340
that I have let him go.

978
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,580
Maybe in the eyes of many people,

979
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:08,860
an ex-girlfriend

980
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,310
constantly blocking

981
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,720
her ex from dating her best friend

982
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,100
means she's still not over him

983
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,110
or even jealous.

984
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,990
But I know Li Junxiao too well.

985
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,040
I know the inferiority

986
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,330
he feels deep down to his core,

987
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,250
and I know his view

988
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:20,980
of women

989
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,800
is the deeply rooted contempt.

990
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,670
And Congrui

991
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,220
just got a divorce

992
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:26,890
and a miscarriage.

993
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,310
I'm afraid

994
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,630
when she realizes

995
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,260
who Li Junxiao really is,

996
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,690
she'll be hurt again.

997
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,420
I'm really afraid that she won't be able to bear it.

998
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,010
But people in love

999
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,930
are all blind,

1000
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,090
not to mention that you are his ex.

1001
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,930
Whatever you say

1002
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,820
will end up being misinterpreted.

1003
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,540
It doesn't matter.

1004
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,700
I don't mind being misunderstood.

1005
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,910
Wu Congrui is my best friend.

1006
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,120
If I have to choose

1007
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,960
between being promoted

1008
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,860
to a chief resident and Wu Congrui,

1009
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,540
I will definitely choose her.

1010
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,500
I hope Congrui

1011
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,780
can understand you one day.

1012
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,040
Let's not talk about it.

1013
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,010
Thank you for inviting me to the movie today.

1014
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,520
It's been a long time

1015
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,860
since the last time I watched one.

1016
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,510
I'm very happy.

1017
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,140
Let's go home.

1018
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,450
Your home or mine?

1019
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,540
You go yours and I go mine.

1020
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,610
So unromantic.

1021
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,380
Your place?

1022
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,450
Really?

1023
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,590
You have many pairs

1024
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,020
of limited sneakers, right?

1025
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,940
I'll send you home.

1026
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,860
Can I give you a kiss?

1027
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:25,910
No.

1028
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:33,760
♫Maybe someone is thinking of you♫

1029
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,610
♫Maybe he never mentions it♫

1030
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:48,390
♫You don't think you're unique in the crowd♫

1031
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,950
It feels weird,

1032
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,590
but I'm happy.

1033
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,580
♫But you are in his heart♫

1034
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,820
♫Sometimes happiness is small♫
