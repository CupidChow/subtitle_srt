[Episode 24]

4
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,850
You ordered the food?

5
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,340
Where's Wang Dacheng?

6
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,660
He was fired this morning.

7
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,340
What?

8
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,520
He said someone from the hospital

9
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,620
filed a complaint about him

10
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,390
doing food delivery and garbage collection at the same time.

11
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,390
The manager thought it was unhygienic.

12
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,150
What?

13
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,790
He does his garbage collection

14
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,630
after work.

15
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,020
It's irrelevant to what he does at work.

16
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,180
Well, you know what bosses are like.

17
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,870
They don't like that.

18
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,420
Where is he?

19
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,150
I don't know.

20
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,400
He's on a job hunt, maybe.

21
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,130
Good review, please.

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,630
Thank you.

23
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,540
It wasn't me.

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm busy.

25
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,460
I don't even know

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,530
which company he worked at.

27
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,610
Who was it then?

28
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,070
Is it only me who knows it?

29
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,780
C-Could it be…

30
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,910
What a strong bond between you.

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,140
Junxiao,

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,230
wait.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,760
Hold on. I need to say something to you.

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,579
That won't be necessary.

35
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,170
I'm going to a meeting in a hurry.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,460
I reported Wang Dacheng.

37
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,940
I just wanted you to know

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,050
he's a man

39
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,470
who can't keep such a simple job.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,380
Are you still going to be together with him?

41
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,280
You…

42
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,780
You can't do this.

43
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,210
Of course I can.

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,620
You go home and ask Dad and Mom

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
if they are willing

46
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,590
to let you live

47
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,530
together with a man

48
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,160
who can't provide a stable life.

49
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,640
Ruthless.

50
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,510
How come I feel like

51
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,730
I dodged a bullet?

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,860
About the plan for Gao Ying's operation,

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,079
there have been multiple discussions

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,070
between related departments.

55
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,700
I hope today

56
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,930
we can draw a conclusion.

57
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,280
The most important problem is

58
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,140
when to do the cesarean.

59
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,670
By principle,

60
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
the earlier, the better.

61
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,130
If the child

62
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,090
is lost,

63
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,220
it'll be a huge blow

64
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,380
to Gao Ying.

65
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,680
It may even nip

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,300
her hope of living.

67
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,050
There are two options.

68
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,690
One, perform the operation immediately

69
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,910
to keep

70
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,340
the mother alive.

71
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,950
Two, keep her under watch.

72
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,240
Stall as much as we can

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,560
until it reaches the capacity of her heart

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,510
so the fetus

75
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,550
gets to grow in the womb as much as possible.

76
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,250
It'll benefit the baby.

77
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
From the perspective

78
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,960
of the baby,

79
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,750
it's best that we stall

80
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,290
until it's after 27 weeks.

81
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,710
Gao Ying wishes

82
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,950
to keep

83
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,750
the baby.

84
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:57,860
In this case,

85
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,630
we'll wait and see

86
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,660
about the operation plan.

87
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,490
I don't see any chance of labor.

88
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,270
Her heart cannot take the regurgitation of blood

89
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,570
after the cesarean.

90
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,940
The operation can be extremely risky.

91
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,740
Putting the uterine hemorrhage aside,

92
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,940
most importantly, the anesthesiology department

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,120
will have to keep the cardiopulmonary circulation going.

94
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,350
It means

95
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,720
the operation cannot be done

96
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,030
without the extracorporeal circulation.

97
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,990
We suggest

98
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,899
the operation is performed

99
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:18,970
with the support of extracorporeal circulation.

100
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,019
When she's in the ICU after the operation,

101
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,910
it'll be highly difficult for ECOM

102
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,740
to sustain both her heart and lungs.

103
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,260
There's a 100% chance

104
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,800
of right-sided heart failure after the operation.

105
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,700
And ECOM

106
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,460
won't be able to fundamentally

107
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,380
relieve her right-sided heart failure

108
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,700
and lower the risk of infection.

109
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,700
Massive hemorrhage must be avoided

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,680
during the operation.

111
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,210
And precautions against postpartum hemorrhage have to be taken as well.

112
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,080
The extracorporeal circulation

113
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,690
and ECOM

114
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,390
must be performed

115
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,120
under the circumstance of absolute anticoagulation.

116
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,120
Hemorrhage is difficult to be avoided.

117
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,700
She may even be dead

118
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,780
during the operation

119
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,880
before the removal of uterus

120
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,260
because of the failure

121
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,940
to stop the bleeding.

122
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,970
Even if she's barely kept alive,

123
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,270
there will be no reverse

124
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,180
for her heart failure.

125
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,030
The causes

126
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,630
for her pulmonary arterial hypertension are

127
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,750
her right-sided heart failure

128
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,800
and pulmonary circulatory disturbance.

129
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,830
The only solution

130
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,940
is the combined heart-lung transplant.

131
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,720
But for the transplant,

132
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,590
both the timing

133
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,050
and the donors

134
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,300
are huge headaches.

135
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,940
An operation at this level of difficulty

136
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,140
for the O.B. department?

137
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,300
I'm so excited.

138
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,650
What a poor child.

139
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,520
It's only twenty-some weeks.

140
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,030
Everyone.

141
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,440
Please be quiet.

142
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,460
We'll do our best

143
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,830
to avoid the worst situation possible.

144
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,720
But first, we'll have to make sure

145
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,040
the fetus stays a few more weeks in the womb.

146
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,660
And the patient has to be informed

147
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,530
of the application of extracorporeal circulation

148
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,000
during the operation,

149
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,820
and after-operation using

150
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,100
of the ECOM.

151
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
It may last until she's in the condition

152
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,340
for the organ transplant.

153
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,900
In light of the patient's nature,

154
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,040
I suggest we designate

155
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,810
a cautious resident to this case.

156
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,990
Considering the fact that Gao Ying

157
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,580
is good at exaggerating doctors' speech

158
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,420
via the press…

159
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,540
Junxiao,

160
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,340
I know that your

161
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,620
workload is heavy at the moment,

162
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,760
but you're always careful with your words and actions.

163
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,820
I think you're the best option.

164
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,350
You'll be in charge of this.

165
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,860
OK.

166
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,210
This is a good thing.

167
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,560
It means Director Tian trusts you.

168
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,850
How can it be a good thing?

169
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,470
There's a big chance

170
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,570
that it turns into a medical accident.

171
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,900
A good thing?

172
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,150
If it's a good thing,

173
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,990
why didn't he give it to Liu Nianbai?

174
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,990
Every department of the hospital

175
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,350
will join hands in Gao Ying's operation.

176
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,740
Even if it does turn into a medical accident,

177
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,150
all the directors and deans

178
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,380
will take responsibility.

179
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,520
Don't worry about it.

180
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,440
I don't want to be the scapegoat.

181
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,659
Gao Ying keeps

182
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,290
a record of every move

183
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,500
of the doctors.

184
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,990
You won't be the scapegoat.

185
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,940
Also,

186
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,060
it's a rare opportunity

187
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
to join with Director Tian

188
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,630
in a major operation like this.

189
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,810
I'll ask Director Huang

190
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,800
to give you some help.

191
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,750
Thank you.

192
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,890
I'm going to the ward.

193
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,510
Director Tian wants to talk

194
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,180
to her about the operation plan.

195
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,020
Good luck.

196
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,600
Is being overly cautious a good quality?

197
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,450
Gao Ying is a lawyer.

198
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,340
It's said that she keeps a record

199
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,210
every day.

200
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,190
Every doctor and nurse

201
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,900
is being extra careful.

202
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,860
It's good that you aren't involved

203
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,930
in case you mess her up.

204
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,870
I don't like

205
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,220
coaxing the patient and the family,

206
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,870
but it doesn't mean

207
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,060
I'm a trouble-making idiot.

208
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:37,820
Right.

209
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,470
Director Tian is an idiot then?

210
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,320
He's a complete idiot.

211
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:45,840
No.

212
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,090
I need to talk to him.

213
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,620
Want some milk tea?

214
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,780
I need a large cup to calm myself.

215
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,090
I don't accept the extracorporeal circulation.

216
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,950
Why?

217
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,630
Extracorporeal circulation requires general anesthesia.

218
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,700
Otherwise, it'll be regional anesthesia.

219
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,550
What if I don't wake up again

220
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,810
from the general anesthesia?

221
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,040
I will never be able to see my baby again.

222
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,180
See?

223
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
You're very aware

224
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,130
that even with the extracorporeal circulation,

225
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,110
you'll have a chance

226
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,590
to die during the operation,

227
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,070
then why

228
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,980
do you insist on having the baby?

229
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,770
The baby is a godsend.

230
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,530
It's the souvenir of our love.

231
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,530
Because of my heart disease,

232
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,470
I lost my job,

233
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,510
my marriage.

234
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,890
Now, God has given me another chance

235
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,670
to start over.

236
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,670
So I mustn't give up.

237
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,370
God has given you many gifts.

238
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,169
If you weren't around,

239
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,429
what would be the point

240
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,720
of this souvenir?

241
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,059
Get out.

242
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,179
Please, don't talk to the doctor that way.

243
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,179
Director Tian,

244
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,900
what's the difference in her chance of survival

245
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,910
between with and without

246
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,860
the extracorporeal circulation?

247
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,440
Without the extracorporeal circulation,

248
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,530
90% death rate,

249
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,660
or even higher.

250
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,010
With it, 10%.

251
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,690
Just accept it, my love.

252
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,880
Since the baby

253
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,760
is a godsend,

254
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,230
we'll accept it

255
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,060
with our greatest sincerity.

256
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,060
Am I right?

257
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,630
Since it'll be general anesthesia,

258
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,070
since I'll have to take the risk,

259
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,860
let me ask you,

260
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,810
can the organ transplant

261
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,910
and the cesarean

262
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,420
be operated at the same time?

263
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,790
I have done

264
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,910
full research.

265
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,300
Even with the extracorporeal circulation,

266
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,310
cardio-pulmonary function

267
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,410
will be eternally damaged.

268
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,040
I will be relying on

269
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,910
the extracorporeal circulation.

270
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,020
What, I'm going to live

271
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,860
the rest of my life

272
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,460
with the ECOM?

273
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,700
I don't think the organ transplant

274
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,510
and the cesarean

275
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,240
can be operated at the same time.

276
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,320
Because each operation

277
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,420
is highly risky on their own.

278
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,790
If they're operated at the same time,

279
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,020
the risks

280
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,890
will only multiply.

281
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,030
I'm afraid your body

282
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,850
can't take that much.

283
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,670
Also,

284
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,190
we're not able

285
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,420
to find the matching donors

286
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,830
for you

287
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,460
at the optimal time.

288
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,580
Fine.

289
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,470
I agree with your proposal

290
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,410
of the extracorporeal circulation and ECOM.

291
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,460
But after the operation,

292
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,900
you'll do the heart-lung transplant as quickly as possible.

293
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,510
I'll exert my utmost effort

294
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,580
to welcome my baby.

295
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,580
If you don't do that,

296
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,700
I'll stop

297
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,300
using the ECOM.

298
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,420
And you won't get away

299
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,130
with it.

300
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,810
All right. All right.

301
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,830
Calm down.

302
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,460
[Gao Ying's Surgical Plan]

303
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
It's so good

304
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,160
to be rich, isn't it?

305
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,270
The imported medication

306
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,350
for the reduction of pulmonary arterial pressure

307
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,100
that Gao Ying took before

308
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,740
cost her 10 grands a month.

309
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,390
A heart-lung transplant

310
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,910
sounds as easy as

311
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,570
a change of hairdo for her.

312
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,270
She can't challenge the limit

313
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,260
of medicine no matter how rich she is.

314
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,250
She's risking her life.

315
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,490
And the reputation of Shengji.

316
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,590
It's like show-hand in a card game.

317
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,810
Winner takes all,

318
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,060
or loser loses all.

319
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,460
Winner takes all?

320
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,120
Even the sound of it is painful.

321
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,300
Think about it.

322
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,530
A cesarean and a heart-lung transplant?

323
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,320
Every organ of hers

324
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,750
will be in a huge risk.

325
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,410
Any error

326
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,340
could be a fatal one.

327
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,760
And there's anti-rejection.

328
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,870
Right now, Gao Ying

329
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,700
and the hospital are on the same boat.

330
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,280
Shengji has to make concentrated efforts

331
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:01,800
to keep her life

332
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,670
despite her selfishness

333
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,540
and her indifference to persuasions.

334
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,750
Every one who needs a heart-lung transplant

335
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,900
wants to stay alive.

336
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,400
Some would wait for months

337
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,480
or even years.

338
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,390
I suspect

339
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,460
she got pregnant

340
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,990
for her heart-lung transplant operation.

341
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,340
Let me.

342
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:19,780
OK.

343
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,470
Thank you.

344
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,940
Honey,

345
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,140
let's come up with a name for our baby.

346
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,300
That's huge responsibility.

347
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,900
How about you take it?

348
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,520
Is it a boy

349
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,630
or a girl, you think?

350
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
Well, we prepare two names then.

351
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,740
A boy's name and a girl's name.

352
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,350
You'll give the girl's name.

353
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,620
I'll give the boy's name.

354
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,520
If it's a girl,

355
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,360
how about Aiying?

356
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,420
Can you be creative?

357
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,700
And if it's a boy?

358
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,970
Aiyong?

359
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,710
Works for me.

360
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,690
Get out of here.

361
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,360
Well, a child

362
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,380
is the legacy of a couple.

363
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,710
If it's a girl,

364
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,860
I hope she is brave and strong,

365
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,350
like her mother.

366
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,840
I only hope

367
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,270
she doesn't get a heart disease from me.

368
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,730
Oh, I tell you what,

369
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,600
you'll take her to the hospital

370
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,790
for a full examination every year.

371
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,600
Do you hear me?

372
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Look at me.

373
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,450
I didn't learn about my heart disease

374
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,500
until I was 30.

375
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,000
Didn't the doctor say

376
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,350
the crevice on your heart

377
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,500
widens as you

378
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,120
grow older?

379
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,570
So at a young age,

380
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,870
even an annual regular examination

381
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,300
couldn't necessarily find the problem.

382
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,730
Well, that's true.

383
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,620
Unlucky me.

384
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,770
But later,

385
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,080
I met you,

386
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,730
and I got pregnant,

387
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,260
I found myself

388
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,340
quite lucky.

389
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,340
All right.

390
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,620
Get some rest.

391
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,190
I'll go buy some fruits for you.

392
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,480
Come back soon.

393
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:42,890
OK.

394
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,100
You got anything to say to me?

395
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,740
You got me.

396
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:55,580
Yeah, I did.

397
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,640
Not a single doctor in any tertiary a-level hospital

398
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,950
lingers after the routine check.

399
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,110
And you don't need to do

400
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,900
the fetal heart rate monitoring personally.

401
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,140
I'd like to ask you

402
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,540
if you decided to have a heart transplant

403
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,940
when you learned that you were pregnant.

404
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,130
No, I didn't.

405
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:09,870
I just found this

406
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,210
once-and-for-all

407
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,790
solution after a series of

408
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,940
refusals of the hospitals.

409
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,670
But a heart-lung transplant

410
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,860
isn't a once-and-for-all solution.

411
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:17,610
I know that.

412
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,730
I'm striving for

413
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,400
the highest survival chance

414
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,270
for myself now.

415
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,060
You tell me then.

416
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,510
If I don't get a heart transplant, how much longer can I live?

417
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,240
My meaning is,

418
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,600
you can wait.

419
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,790
You don't have to have your heart transplanted

420
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,020
right after

421
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:37,890
the cesarean operation.

422
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,200
What if I can't make it?

423
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,000
You're my monitoring doctor,

424
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,470
if my operations turn out a success,

425
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,580
it'll at least provide the material

426
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,500
for you to write one SCI, no?

427
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,710
And by then, all the doctors

428
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,370
participated in my operations will share the credit.

429
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,020
I don't understand why you try to persuade me.

430
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,900
If I die of the cesarean,

431
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,810
you won't benefit from it.

432
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,630
All right.

433
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,370
Best of luck.

434
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,830
Director Tian,

435
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,340
let me.

436
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,300
No, I'll do it.

437
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,270
Nothing can go wrong

438
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,570
in this operation.

439
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,980
If anything goes wrong,

440
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,460
I'll take responsibility.

441
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,210
I don't want it to affect you.

442
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,890
All the previous information

443
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,970
and numbers,

444
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,910
you'll do a re-organization.

445
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,020
Let's not worry about the heart transplant for now,

446
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,110
at least the cesarean operation on this pregnancy

447
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,780
with pulmonary arterial hypertension case

448
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,690
was a success.

449
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,300
OK.

450
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,690
You did well.

451
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,570
The patient's family

452
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,530
didn't complain.

453
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,890
Your name will be added

454
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,580
to the SCI.

455
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,820
Thank you, Director Tian.

456
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,980
Both

457
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,620
Gao Ying

458
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,590
and Shengji are blessed by God.

459
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,810
Right before a total failure,

460
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,420
a matching heart was found.

461
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,100
This heart

462
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,260
is priceless.

463
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,730
Operation time, 8:10.

464
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,750
Breastbone saw.

465
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,040
Stop her breathing.

466
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,420
Hand saw.

467
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,880
Ready?

468
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:50,540
Yes.

469
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,819
Precaval and postcava plugged in.

470
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,619
Turn it on.

471
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,540
Turn it on.

472
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,710
Postcava plugged in

473
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,859
Cut the flow.

474
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,339
Ready for the heart transplant.

475
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,600
Stitching.

476
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,160
Expand the lung.

477
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,850
Reduce the flow.

478
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,260
Reduce the flow.

479
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,730
Open the ascending aorta

480
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,350
You protect

481
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,180
the heart well.

482
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,550
I don't think

483
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
there will be a major problem.

484
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,660
But do your best to stop the bleeding.

485
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,340
OK.

486
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:54,890
Got it.

487
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,730
Director Tian,

488
00:18:59,170 --> 00:18:59,740
congratulations.

489
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,390
You have set a new record in the hospital.

490
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,740
Prepare your SCI.

491
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,860
Let it be over soon.

492
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,230
Or else,

493
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,530
I'll get a heart disease as well.

494
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,100
I can't believe I saved her!

495
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,880
It's my new cell phone.

496
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,920
What am I going to say to my wife?

497
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,650
I'm sorry.

498
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,380
I got too agitated.

499
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,770
I'll buy a new one for you.

500
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,340
The new life

501
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,900
of a mother with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

502
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,300
This is madness.

503
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,740
She's mad.

504
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,360
She's still in rejection period.

505
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,970
I can't believe she wrote it.

506
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,140
She's instigating people into killing themselves.

507
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,470
You have no idea

508
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,120
how many people called us

509
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,510
to ask about the cardiac operation

510
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,610
for pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.

511
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,330
I thought,

512
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,310
the O.B. department received Gao Ying,

513
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,300
so they should

514
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,580
be pretty close.

515
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,340
Can they talk her

516
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,770
into deleting the article?

517
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,560
The operation was a success,

518
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,960
but it's hard to say

519
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,020
how long she can survive.

520
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
Patients with similar conditions

521
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,810
are watching her closely.

522
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,820
If this article gets widely spread,

523
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,380
they will be inspired

524
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,470
and get pregnant,

525
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,560
and all the pressure

526
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,690
will be on the hospital

527
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,550
and us doctors.

528
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,040
If that happens,

529
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,870
it'll kill thousands of lives.

530
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,470
Ask Li Junxiao to talk

531
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,790
her into deleting the article.

532
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,070
Ask everybody in the O.B. department

533
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,890
to open an account

534
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,730
and leave comments under the article

535
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,880
to tell her fans

536
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,560
that patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension

537
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,780
are not supposed to get pregnant.

538
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,610
Like this?

539
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,720
This is what you want, right?

540
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,530
Please delete the article.

541
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,510
You've tried to convince me for days.

542
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,460
But no matter what you say,

543
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,810
my stance remains the same.

544
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,380
No.

545
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,010
The Shengji Hospital

546
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,970
risked so much

547
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,620
for you.

548
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,670
Can't you just

549
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,620
do us a favor and delete the article?

550
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,610
But everything in the article

551
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,520
is nothing but the truth.

552
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,470
Why should I delete it?

553
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,500
Miss Gao,

554
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,660
not everyone

555
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,820
is as lucky as you are

556
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,060
to receive

557
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,660
ECOM treatment

558
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,620
here at Shengji

559
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,240
and find a matching heart

560
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,680
in such a short time.

561
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,770
Your fans

562
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,870
are all over the country.

563
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,490
What if they are inspired by you

564
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,390
and choose to do the same operation?

565
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,350
The death rate

566
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,300
is very high.

567
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,280
I was very clear in my article

568
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,060
that my experience was in Shengji Hospital.

569
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,580
If she insists on getting pregnant

570
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,370
where there is no such a hospital

571
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,470
and there're no such conditions,

572
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
she would be out of her mind.

573
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,700
You really can't think that way.

574
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,740
Many women

575
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,120
are living in remote areas.

576
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,080
They are not

577
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,870
well educated.

578
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,240
How can they distinguish

579
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,590
the conditions stated in your article?

580
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,660
Then post another article,

581
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,220
saying that

582
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,300
all cases like me

583
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,610
could come to

584
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,620
Shengji.

585
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,460
OK?

586
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,060
You…

587
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,890
Tell you what?

588
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,260
Don't get carried away now.

589
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,630
I'm now having acute rejection.

590
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,100
I've been having a slight fever.

591
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,270
You tell me the truth.

592
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,050
Were you

593
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,060
in a hurry to perform the surgery

594
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,860
and gave me

595
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,800
an inappropriate heart?

596
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,350
There's no way

597
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,020
to use an inappropriate heart for the surgery.

598
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,860
OK.

599
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,060
You call Director Tian here

600
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,610
and tell him that the heart in me

601
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,040
is too old.

602
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,860
I want a new one.

603
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,660
What did you say?

604
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,340
Do you really mean that?

605
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,310
Yes.

606
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,730
Are you out of your mind?

607
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,820
Look at your body now.

608
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,550
On your chest and abdomen

609
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,540
are all surgical scars.

610
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,860
The doctor said

611
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,100
the current rejection

612
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,700
is normal.

613
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,450
You just need to take the meds on time.

614
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,580
How can you go through

615
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,980
another transplant?

616
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,620
I'm sorry.

617
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,860
I'm sorry, Gao Ying.

618
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,040
I've never been

619
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,150
so mad at you.

620
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,940
But looking at you

621
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
like this,

622
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,020
I really regret supporting you

623
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,490
to get pregnant.

624
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,870
I've always believed in you

625
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,970
because you're a lawyer.

626
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,110
You studied many papers

627
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
and legal provisions,

628
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,150
so I thought you were right.

629
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,010
But after coming to the hospital,

630
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,900
I realized that in foreign countries

631
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,050
patients like you would never be advised

632
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,820
to get pregnant.

633
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,110
The heart transplant would help you live

634
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,160
for ten more years at most.

635
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,070
But what follows

636
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,210
will be rejections of all sorts

637
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,280
and lifelong medication.

638
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,470
So, what's the point?

639
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,250
But we have a baby now.

640
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,210
I don't care.

641
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,540
Did I fall in love with you

642
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,450
for having a baby

643
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,490
with you?

644
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,360
I love you.

645
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,440
You are the one I love.

646
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,320
If you were gone,

647
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,360
what's the point of having the baby?

648
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,230
But the baby is important to me.

649
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,300
I know I wouldn't live to eighty years old

650
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,010
without a heart transplant.

651
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,140
But if I could

652
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,300
leave you with the baby,

653
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,780
I would feel better.

654
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,100
The surgery is successful.

655
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,620
But

656
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,290
this heart…

657
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,110
It…

658
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,630
It's not good!

659
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
If this is

660
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,650
a young heart,

661
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,070
if I could have a new heart,

662
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,900
I would surely

663
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,880
live a very very long life.

664
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,730
I wouldn't just live for a dozen years.

665
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,490
OK.

666
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,470
OK.

667
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,410
I know

668
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,310
you know more about medicine than I do.

669
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,160
But in your condition,

670
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,900
can you

671
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,530
really do it again

672
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,690
and keep hurting yourself?

673
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,890
This is

674
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,280
the case.

675
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,870
I'm so tired.

676
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,510
It has been really a mess these days

677
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,450
in terms of public opinion.

678
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,590
Shengji Hospital

679
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,850
has so many doctors

680
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,260
posting articles and popularizing knowledge.

681
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,370
But there're still patients with

682
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
pulmonary arterial hypertension coming here.

683
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,260
Even she said so,

684
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,560
can she go through another surgery?

685
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,660
She is right that

686
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,070
a young donor's heart

687
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,060
is indeed better.

688
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,300
But she's wrong on one point.

689
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,540
The donor of her heart

690
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,430
was a brain-dead young person,

691
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,820
about twenty years old.

692
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,670
There could be

693
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,550
no younger and stronger heart than this.

694
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,020
There are limitations in medicine.

695
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,850
Even she could go through that again,

696
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,760
we couldn't.

697
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,780
Excuse me.

698
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,470
It's from the ward. I have to take this.

699
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,120
Hello?

700
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,540
What?

701
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,180
I'll be right there.

702
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,910
Gao Ying's having heart failure.

703
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,760
The acute rejection is exacerbated.

704
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,700
Hello, methylprednisolone pulse therapy,

705
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,300
500mg.

706
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,060
Yes.

707
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,000
Right now.

708
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,160
This isn't supposed to happen.

709
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,160
Did you give her anti-rejection meds on time?

710
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,090
We did,

711
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,500
but we don't know if she took the meds.

712
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,760
What do you mean?

713
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,210
Would we not take the meds on purpose?

714
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,190
She has been crying for a new heart.

715
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,170
Who knows whether she would

716
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,360
do it on purpose.

717
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,350
Nonsense.

718
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,580
Don't say that without evidence.

719
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,330
You may leave.

720
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,250
The high-dose hormone pulse therapy

721
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,440
will last for a while.

722
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,080
Then we'll see how it goes.

723
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,380
Director,

724
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,410
maybe there's something wrong

725
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,280
with the heart,

726
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,100
so she's having

727
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,770
such an acute rejection.

728
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,760
This is really

729
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,710
a good heart.

730
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,220
I assure you that.

731
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,950
It's been hard for you too.

732
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,940
Your premature baby is still in an incubator.

733
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,330
And she just underwent a heart transplant.

734
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
I regret it.

735
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,240
I really regret it.

736
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,170
Mr. Lin,

737
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,780
I sincerely beg you this.

738
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,370
Listen to me.

739
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,510
She can't go through another heart transplant.

740
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,110
She won't make it.

741
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,100
And we don't

742
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,250
have a better heart for her.

743
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,370
You got to persuade her

744
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,940
to cooperate with the treatment.

745
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,770
I will.

746
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,550
I'll do it.

747
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:30,930
I'll do it.

748
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,830
We also hope

749
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,310
she could watch your baby grow up.

750
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,280
But medicine is not a panacea.

751
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,210
How are you feeling now?

752
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,050
I'm OK.

753
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Did you tell them

754
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,240
that this heart doesn't work

755
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,200
and I need a new one?

756
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,120
I did.

757
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,150
But they told me

758
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,870
this is the best heart

759
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,020
and there's no one available.

760
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,210
They're lying.

761
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,100
Call the director here.

762
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,510
The director

763
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,410
had been here

764
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,810
and didn't leave until you're stable.

765
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,260
Let's not bother him anymore.

766
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,740
OK?

767
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,490
What meds did they give me today?

768
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,900
Some hormones.

769
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,150
Methylprednisolone.

770
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,340
Yes.

771
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,160
I didn't take anti-rejection meds on purpose

772
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,110
to scare them.

773
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,530
But

774
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,380
they gave me hormones directly.

775
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,620
What did you say?

776
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,820
You didn't take the anti-rejection meds?

777
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,860
No.

778
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,130
Gao Ying, are you out of your mind?

779
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,020
You are completely out of your mind.

780
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,590
You're not scared of death.

781
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,620
But can you just think about our kid,

782
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,440
and think about me?

783
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,620
I won't die.

784
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,980
I'm a lawyer.

785
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,030
Do people die

786
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:03,860
due to their occupations?

787
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
Even if you're a lawyer,

788
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,910
you'd die if you go on like this.

789
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,800
Gao Ying,

790
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:13,990
I'm sorry.

791
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:14,780
I'm sorry.

792
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,560
I shouldn't have said that to you.

793
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,210
But you must stay well.

794
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,120
I…

795
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,700
I really can't take

796
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,620
anything bad to happen again.

797
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,020
You can't do this

798
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,020
at the risk of your life.

799
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,110
But I'm doing all these

800
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,950
just because

801
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,610
I want to live a better life.

802
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,790
I can also feel pain.

803
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,140
Okay, okay.

804
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,980
Give me my laptop.

805
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,050
Hurry.

806
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,770
You just woke up.

807
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,190
You need rest.

808
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,850
No.

809
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,720
You write down what I will say.

810
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,730
I'll record

811
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,470
all doubts on every link of my treatment

812
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,300
since I was hospitalized.

813
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,260
Then you show it to their leaders.

814
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,590
If they don't want me to post it online,

815
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,710
they must treat me well.

816
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,060
Gao Ying.

817
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,760
I beg you,

818
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,520
stop doing this, okay?

819
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,860
Enough.

820
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,080
Go get the laptop.

821
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,850
Come on.

822
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,220
Go ahead.

823
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,340
I

824
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,580
have the following doubts

825
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,940
about my treatment

826
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,680
since I was admitted to the hospital.

827
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,200
First…

828
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:39,860
First…

829
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,630
Gao Ying, are you okay?

830
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,530
I'm fine.

831
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,860
Don't talk. I'll go get the doctor.

832
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,640
I'll go get the doctor.

833
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,720
Get me some water.

834
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,660
I'm okay.

835
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,000
Water.

836
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

837
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,780
Come on, take it easy.

838
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,980
Slowly.

839
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,720
Slowly.

840
00:30:59,130 --> 00:30:59,620
Gao Ying.

841
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,120
Gao Ying, are you all right?

842
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,620
Gao Ying, don't scare me.

843
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,920
Don't scare me.

844
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,370
Doctor, doctor!

845
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,550
Where's the doctor?

846
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,590
Doctor?

847
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,980
Hurry, hurry.

848
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,540
Heart rate is dropping down.

849
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,410
Get the defibrillator.

850
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,600
You gave her MP.

851
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,540
What's going on?

852
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,860
Go call Line 2.

853
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,060
No, Line 3.

854
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,840
Yes.

855
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,550
Press.

856
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,560
Defibrillation again.

857
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,310
Step aside.

858
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,630
Stop.

859
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,210
She's gone.

860
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,050
No, Director.

861
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,010
Please try again.

862
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,270
Please try again!

863
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,010
Please, please.

864
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,060
Please.

865
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,700
Gao Ying!

866
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,530
Gao Ying!

867
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,730
Please.

868
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
Please save her.

869
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,530
Gao Ying.

870
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,910
Gao Ying.

871
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,040
Gao Ying didn't take the anti-rejection meds

872
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,800
in order to

873
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,340
urge us to change a new heart for her.

874
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,480
The MP pulse therapy

875
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,680
was given timely.

876
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,600
But her lungs

877
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,380
were still seriously infected,

878
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,560
resulting in heart infection.

879
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,170
She died despite the rescue efforts.

880
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,880
Next, the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department…

881
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,010
No.

882
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,670
Shengji Hospital

883
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,490
will face a big challenge.

884
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,920
This family is really picky.

885
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,470
As far as I know,

886
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,880
before her death,

887
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,780
Gao Ying was still writing negative articles about Shengji.

888
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,790
We can't stop them from making troubles.

889
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,770
But we must

890
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,010
do our own job well

891
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,560
and do what we need to do.

892
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,270
We must not add fuel to the flames.

893
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,080
Therefore,

894
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,650
you must be very careful with your patients.

895
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,590
We can't let someone

896
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,940
get something on us.

897
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,900
For them,

898
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,690
Shengji already contributed

899
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,040
the best medical resources.

900
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,320
You're a girl. Sit down.

901
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,690
Mr. Lin,

902
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:31,670
if you have any questions,

903
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,460
you may talk to me…

904
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,590
Director Tian,

905
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,239
thank you!

906
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,370
Dr. Li,

907
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,699
thank you!

908
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,150
Thank you

909
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,550
all.

910
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,410
I'm Lin Yong, Gao Ying's husband.

911
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,570
Thank you

912
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,420
for what you've done these days.

913
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,800
As her husband,

914
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,090
I knew that she wasn't physically conditioned

915
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,880
to get pregnant.

916
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,880
But I still supported her choice.

917
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,550
We've caused many troubles

918
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,130
to all doctors of Shengji.

919
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,630
About what Gao Ying did,

920
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,580
you were

921
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,130
all very angry.

922
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,670
But, you all

923
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,470
tried to treat her

924
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,860
and treat my baby

925
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,690
with a professional attitude.

926
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,250
Hereby,

927
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,760
let me, on behalf of Gao Ying,

928
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,850
express our sincere apology

929
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,070
to all the doctors here.

930
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,550
I hope to get your understanding.

931
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,980
And

932
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,500
I'd like to thank you again.

933
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,050
It's very kind of you

934
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,450
to understand us.

935
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,410
She's gone.

936
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,370
There is no use to regret.

937
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,260
Thankfully,

938
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,220
my baby is in good condition.

939
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:07,740
Director Tian,

940
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,460
Dr. Li,

941
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,850
I'm going to call my baby

942
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,310
Xiaosheng.

943
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,780
I want him to know

944
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,140
that his life was given by

945
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,460
doctors of Shengji.

946
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:19,990
Besides,

947
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,840
tomorrow

948
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,230
I'll use Gao Ying's social account

949
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,600
to post an article.

950
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,060
On the one hand, I'll announce his death.

951
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,700
On the other hand,

952
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,020
I'll tell

953
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,740
all women in the same conditions as her

954
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,140
not to get pregnant

955
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,660
and not to risk their lives

956
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,300
for having a baby.

957
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,280
Thank you.

958
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,050
If all patients have families like you,

959
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,650
we're not afraid to be wronged.

960
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,500
Thank you!

961
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,630
Thanks!

962
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,800
Kevin.

963
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,930
Indoorsy Tian,

964
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:14,860
what brings you here?

965
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,580
Come on,

966
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,750
don't call me that way.

967
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,690
I'm a director now.

968
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,340
You can't let my staff hear that.

969
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,290
Fine, Indoorsy Director.

970
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,180
I've forgotten

971
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
that there's no director

972
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,040
in your dictionary.

973
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,500
Please.

974
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,840
Just call me Tian, OK?

975
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,430
OK. Works for me.

976
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,560
What would you like to drink?

977
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,230
Well,

978
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,530
Mo…Mohi…Mohito.

979
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,120
First,

980
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,450
Director Zhang told you last time.

981
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,770
It's not Mohito.

982
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,030
It's Mojito.

983
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,740
Second,

984
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,760
you're the director now.

985
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,620
Don't you drink something strong?

986
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,530
Fine.

987
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,090
Jito. Mojito.

988
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,500
But

989
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,340
why do I need to drink something strong

990
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,490
after being a director?

991
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,390
I've been suffering strong challenges every day.

992
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,480
I don't want a strong drink.

993
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,290
I just want something

994
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,660
fresh and a bit sweet.

995
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,260
OK?

996
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,820
Sure.

997
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,570
Wait a second.

998
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,260
Since Director Zhang's death,

999
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,330
you've only had this, right?

1000
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,130
I didn't drink at all.

1001
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,170
Director Zhang

1002
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,820
always took our colleagues out.

1003
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,220
Every time,

1004
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,220
I would just have a coke and go home.

1005
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,510
That's why

1006
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,510
Director Zhang called you Indoorsy Tian.

1007
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,140
He suggested you drink this,

1008
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,940
Mojito.

1009
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,170
It's the ladies' favorite drink.

1010
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,230
You'd surely like this.

1011
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,300
Well, is it fun to be the director?

1012
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,140
It is fun.

1013
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,760
It's been less than a year.

1014
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,510
But look.

1015
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,020
My hair is half grey.

1016
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,230
Is it fun?

1017
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,650
No?

1018
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,660
If it's not,

1019
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,810
why so many people covet the position?

1020
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,120
In a hospital,

1021
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,540
being a director

1022
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,520
means a higher position

1023
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,930
and payment.

1024
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,630
But what comes

1025
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,290
with it?

1026
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,410
It's pressure.

1027
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,990
There're pressures from departmental development,

1028
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,180
from scientific research.

1029
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,570
and from public opinions.

1030
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,470
There're also pressures

1031
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,500
from all kinds of patients.

1032
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,620
Isn't it tiring?

1033
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,960
And you can't tell others about that.

1034
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,710
Right?

1035
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,920
After Director Zhang's sudden death,

1036
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,700
I took over her position.

1037
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,110
Many people say that

1038
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,330
I'm really lucky.

1039
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,740
If I complain about this,

1040
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,050
they would say I'm taking my undeserved gains for granted.

1041
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,690
Adult loneliness

1042
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,380
is just like this.

1043
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,830
Everything you say would be considered wrong.

1044
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,960
So, you choose not to say anything.

1045
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,580
Are they

1046
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,570
your staff?

1047
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,660
Du Di, this way.

1048
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,110
I promise not to call you Indoorsy Tian.

1049
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,360
Director Tian.

1050
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,650
Director Tian.

1051
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,360
Why are you here alone in a daze?

1052
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,680
No.

1053
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,710
An old friend asked me here.

1054
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,330
I told him that this is not the right place

1055
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,560
for people of our age.

1056
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,710
He insisted on asking me to come here for an experience.

1057
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,640
Well, are you here to relax?

1058
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,980
Today,

1059
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,220
Gao Ying's case is over.

1060
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,690
We're here to relax.

1061
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,450
The others are all over there.

1062
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,290
Would you like to join us?

1063
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,110
No, no.

1064
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,850
Their drinks are on me.

1065
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,500
Are you sure?

1066
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,820
A dozen is only enough to gargle for Du Di.

1067
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,550
Yeah?

1068
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,400
Then,

1069
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,420
one drink for each.

1070
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,390
No, Director Tian,

1071
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,150
we'll buy you a drink.

1072
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,930
Yeah, we'll buy you a drink.

1073
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,750
Director Tian,

1074
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,650
the one you just had

1075
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,550
is mango-flavored.

1076
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,460
Now, just try this one,

1077
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,660
apple-flavored.

1078
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,130
Drink…

1079
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,020
I can't drink more.

1080
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,910
Are you a man or not?

1081
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,190
Drink it.

1082
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,620
Don't use this

1083
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,330
to judge a man.

1084
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,580
I said that I can't drink more. So, no more.

1085
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,250
Am I a man?

1086
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,180
Director.

1087
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,790
Are you playing the woman?

1088
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,180
Shut up.

1089
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
You're so cute.

1090
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,830
Director,

1091
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,370
if I, Du Di,

1092
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,320
win the first place

1093
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,090
at the competition,

1094
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,950
how are you going to do as encouragement?

1095
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,890
I'll promote you to chief resident.

1096
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,570
Really?

1097
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:22,860
Record it.

1098
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,800
Director,

1099
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,120
if I win

1100
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,180
the first place

1101
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,410
at the competition,

1102
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,900
you promise me

1103
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,960
to promote me and Wu Congrui

1104
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,120
to chief resident.

1105
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:38,970
OK?

1106
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,730
No.

1107
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,740
We already have

1108
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,990
one chief resident.

1109
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,380
If the two of you get promoted,

1110
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,390
there would be three chief residents.

1111
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,060
Two chief residents

1112
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,730
are not enough.

1113
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,350
Think about this.

1114
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,150
If I could win the first place,

1115
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,010
Wu Congrui must be the second.

1116
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,500
That would be OK.

1117
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,040
Then Wu Congrui and I

1118
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,180
would both get promoted to chief resident.

1119
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,870
If you win the first place,

1120
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,690
I'll promote the two of you

1121
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,050
to chief resident.

1122
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,890
Director, it's very nice of you.

1123
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,460
That's good.

1124
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,120
Director, come on,

1125
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,420
challenge the apple-flavored one.

1126
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:36,900
Bill, please.

1127
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,190
I put you in this situation.

1128
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,800
It's okay.

1129
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,210
I'm trying to

1130
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,000
find a new job.

1131
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,490
You worked well as a delivery man.

1132
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,290
But you lost your job.

1133
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,370
How can you find a job

1134
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,410
with more free time and better payment?

1135
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,100
Nowadays,

1136
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,960
there would be a job as long as I work hard.
