4
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,060
Is her pulse stable?

5
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,670
She's out of danger now.

6
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,380
The pulse is stable for now.

7
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,580
Do a CT scan

8
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,420
and invite a neurologist

9
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,010
over for consultation.

10
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,770
OK.

11
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,860
Doctor,

12
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,900
how's my daughter-in-law?

13
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,070
It looks like

14
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,370
brain hemorrhage caused by the crash.

15
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,710
It's all your fault.

16
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,300
It's all your fault!

17
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,000
Please calm down.

18
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,530
-Get out of my way.
-Mom.

19
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,829
Grandma, please calm down.

20
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,829
I'm gonna kill

21
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,050
this ungrateful girl.

22
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,320
She's never spoken properly since she was a child.

23
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,590
And now she treats her parents poorly.

24
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,250
She wants to hurt people.

25
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,310
Though I'm old

26
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:38,840
and I could die,

27
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,750
I'll beat this girl.

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,990
-I'm gonna kill her.
-All right, calm down.

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,670
-Please control your mood, ma'am.
-I'm gonna kill her.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,280
Do not affect the rescue.

31
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,170
Mom,

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,800
your heart is fragile.

33
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,620
You shouldn't be angry.

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,720
Let's go out

35
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,240
so the doctors can do their job.

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,820
OK?

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,100
Mom, mom!

38
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:02,850
Let's go.

39
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,940
It's not your fault.

40
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,770
What should we do?

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,880
Will my mom die?

42
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,340
And my sister, too?

43
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,470
Du Di,

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
Du Di, Du Di!

45
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,970
-Don't grab me! Don't grab me!
-Mom.

46
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,370
Who can calm her down?

47
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,770
I can't do the scan if she keeps moving.

48
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,350
She had a shot of valium just now.

49
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,020
We pulled her over

50
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,980
-after she calmed down.
-Du Di, Du Di!

51
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,870
Mom, I'm here.

52
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,060
Du Di, Du Di!

53
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,290
Mom, I'm here, I'm here.

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,170
Mom, I'm here, I'm with you.

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,900
Du Di!

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,820
I'm here, I'm here.

57
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,660
Du Di!

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,730
Mom, I'm here.

59
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,980
We're doing

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,700
a CT scan for you.

61
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,610
Then,

62
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,510
you'll be able to have the surgery.

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,920
I'll be here with you all the time.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,640
That's a large amount of blood.

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,970
What happened?

66
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,510
How could the car crash

67
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,790
lead to such heavy bleeding?

68
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,680
I need to call the director.

69
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,260
We need the neurologist's consultation now.

70
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,760
It's important for the pregnant patient.

71
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,780
Mom,

72
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,270
you should go home and rest.

73
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,180
I need to hear what the doctor has to say.

74
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,030
Dr. Tian.

75
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,370
Sit, don't get up!

76
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,409
Here's her condition.

77
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,890
As I told you before,

78
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,150
the patient has many

79
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:53,860
underlying conditions, such as

80
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,940
hypertension,

81
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,960
diabetes,

82
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,860
and the previously diagnosed

83
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,670
severe pre-eclampsia.

84
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,920
Hypertension

85
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,260
causes bleeding in the fundus of the eye,

86
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,620
which blurs her vision.

87
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,110
Considering your

88
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,580
strong request to keep the baby,

89
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,300
we controlled her blood pressure.

90
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,900
But the image shows

91
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,000
massive intracranial hemorrhage,

92
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,020
which might have begun

93
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,220
before the car crash.

94
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,230
It's very dangerous.

95
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,060
What about the baby?

96
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,030
Don't worry.

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,510
For the time being,

98
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,310
there's nothing wrong with the baby.

99
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,620
But the baby had been

100
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,890
on the verge of fetal distress

101
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,100
and needed to be closely monitored.

102
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,930
The pregnancy could be terminated at any time.

103
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,380
Dr. Tian,

104
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,860
are you suggesting craniotomy?

105
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,050
You got the point.

106
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,680
Dr. Lin

107
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,450
recently has been working closely

108
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,260
with the Neurosurgery Department on combined surgery.

109
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,900
So in this respect,

110
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,860
Dr. Lin,

111
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,010
please explain it.

112
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,659
Here's the thing.

113
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,380
You have two options now.

114
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,600
First, conservative treatment.

115
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,890
Use drugs

116
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,970
to control the bleeding

117
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,630
until the blood mass is gradually absorbed.

118
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,520
In the meantime, monitor

119
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,300
the baby's conditions.

120
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,130
But due to the unknown cause

121
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,340
of the patient's intracranial bleeding

122
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,470
and the underlying conditions,

123
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,990
the patient's situation could

124
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,010
see dangerous changes.

125
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,800
The second option

126
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,060
is active treatment.

127
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,610
Remove the clot fast

128
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,480
and stitch the bleeding spot

129
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,980
through craniotomy.

130
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:13,850
Likewise,

131
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,620
due to the underlying conditions,

132
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,630
the surgery

133
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
could take

134
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,500
a dangerous turn.

135
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,670
In both options,

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,910
the mother and the baby

137
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,290
could be in danger.

138
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,970
The only difference is how soon

139
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,910
the danger comes.

140
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,020
The conservative.

141
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,420
The conservative treatment.

142
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,200
The conservative.

143
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,540
Don't you say

144
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,909
the longer the baby stays in the womb,

145
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,900
the better?

146
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,020
Let's maintain this for more weeks.

147
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,940
Maybe the baby can survive.

148
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,750
If we go into a surgery,

149
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,940
the anesthesia

150
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,330
and all the shots you mentioned

151
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,970
would probably make the baby retard.

152
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,940
If anything goes wrong

153
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,620
in the surgery,

154
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,900
we'll lose both the mother and the baby.

155
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,680
No.

156
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,350
She needs surgery.

157
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,020
Dr. Tian,

158
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,820
do everything you can to save my mom.

159
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,140
If the massive bleeding

160
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,110
isn't put to a stop,

161
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,050
it will kill both.

162
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,290
Even if the bleeding is under control,

163
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,100
there will be subsequent brain hemorrhages.

164
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,460
A craniotomy must be performed

165
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,920
to remove the extravasated blood as soon as possible.

166
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,980
You're so cruel.

167
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,870
We'll do

168
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,340
the opposite of what you said.

169
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,460
No surgery.

170
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
The conservative treatment.

171
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,650
All you care about is your future grandson.

172
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,800
Have you thought about my mom's life?

173
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,060
Let me tell you something.

174
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,950
I want my mom to wake up safely

175
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,210
and have a healthy life.

176
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,220
All right.

177
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,220
Stop arguing.

178
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,180
It's not the right time to do that.

179
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:35,890
Let's all calm down.

180
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,090
Mr. Du,

181
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,070
what's your decision?

182
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,020
I...

183
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,730
Tell him.

184
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,540
She's so close to delivery.

185
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,540
Save the baby.

186
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,470
Save my mom.

187
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,840
Save the baby.

188
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,720
Save my mom.

189
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,260
Save the baby.

190
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,659
Why don't you

191
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,290
take more time to discuss it?

192
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,240
Once you have an agreement,

193
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,170
let us know.

194
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,300
Save my grandson.

195
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,820
What's my dad struggling with?

196
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,420
It's a life-saving moment.

197
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,060
I'll help him wake up.

198
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
Calm down now.

199
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,330
Let's observe

200
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,280
the amount of intracranial bleeding.

201
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,860
If there's no significant increase,

202
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,730
the conservative treatment

203
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,460
is feasible.

204
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,570
But now we don't know

205
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,740
which blood vessel is broken,

206
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,430
Or

207
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
if there are other damages.

208
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,190
I don't want my mom

209
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,220
to die of giving birth to the baby.

210
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,610
I can't lose my mom.

211
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,320
Then talk to your dad.

212
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,500
Don't fight.

213
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,409
It won't solve the problem.

214
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,340
The longer we wait, my mom...

215
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,180
OK.

216
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,700
I'll sign it if you don't.

217
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,090
You're killing the last heir of our family.

218
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,700
I will not allow it.

219
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:04,930
Dad!

220
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,260
Are you going to watch

221
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,290
my mom die?

222
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,880
My mom went through the rough days with you.

223
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,470
Have you forgotten?

224
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,180
Do you love her or not?

225
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,040
I'll sign it.

226
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,480
I'll sign it.

227
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,440
Give it to me.

228
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,780
Grandma.

229
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
Grandma, are you OK?

230
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,940
Don't you help your girlfriend?

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,280
Such a difficult operation

232
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,500
without your dad's help

233
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,110
is quite unsettling.

234
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,780
By the way,

235
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,700
I forgot to tell you that

236
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,210
none of the other directing neurologists

237
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,470
wants to do this surgery.

238
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,360
They're afraid the patient will die on the operating table.

239
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,940
I came to ask Director Liu

240
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
whether he is willing

241
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,170
to lead this surgery.

242
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,600
If he knows

243
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,860
this is your girlfriend's mom,

244
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,700
will he take it over or not?

245
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,670
Don't tell him.

246
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,640
You don't trust him?

247
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,780
Even if you don't tell him,

248
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,580
he will find out.

249
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,860
Now that you're at his door,

250
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,170
just go in and talk to him.

251
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
And save me the trouble.

252
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,100
Lin Wei,

253
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,220
help me.

254
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,580
I didn't expect you to yield so fast

255
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,380
for Du Di's sake.

256
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,780
OK.

257
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,660
What an honor!

258
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,180
What can I do for you?

259
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,910
Given the bleeding spot

260
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,670
and area,

261
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,100
it's a bit tricky.

262
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,100
It's a pregnant woman.

263
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,150
When you need my help,

264
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,580
it's always about pregnant women.

265
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,940
She's 50 years old.

266
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,860
No one dares to help her?

267
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,140
What's he doing here?

268
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,620
To learn?

269
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,480
Speak for yourself.

270
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,940
I need your help.

271
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,400
This is Du Di's mom.

272
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,770
It seems

273
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,010
you still have a little human touch.

274
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,720
I'm asking for your help.

275
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,580
Do you really want my help?

276
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,710
Or are you going to set me a trap?

277
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,140
Do you know

278
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,030
how high a risk I have to take

279
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,820
if the pregnant woman dies on the operating table?

280
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,950
I know.

281
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:36,990
So do you want

282
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,210
the surgery to be a success

283
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,980
or a failure?

284
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,310
All the patients sing your praises.

285
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,300
All the students love you.

286
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,940
You won't screw it up.

287
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,500
The only thing

288
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,680
you screwed up is your family.

289
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,060
Watch your tone.

290
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,190
I hope the person I love

291
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,120
can save the person she loves.

292
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,490
Please

293
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,140
help me.

294
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,330
Please

295
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,070
help me.

296
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,600
Wait a minute.

297
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,220
May I do it?

298
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:22,930
Can you?

299
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,270
I'm a doctor.

300
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,140
I know how to do it.

301
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,180
Mom,

302
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,100
don't be afraid.

303
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
You're going to take surgery later.

304
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,700
When it's done,

305
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,140
you'll be fine.

306
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,300
Don't worry.

307
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,590
This time

308
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,400
I'll make sure you're OK.

309
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,060
Mom,

310
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,410
you have to be strong.

311
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,770
Keep fighting.

312
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,300
I haven't become a great doctor

313
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,630
like Lin Qiaozhi.

314
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,020
And I haven't

315
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,020
made you proud

316
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,080
in front of my grandma.

317
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,380
You must be well.

318
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:29,980
Mom,

319
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,740
come on.

320
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,020
I'm so nervous.

321
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,170
I can't imagine

322
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,540
he's retiring soon.

323
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,920
Another textbook

324
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,700
surgery.

325
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,110
Director Liu,

326
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,040
no, President Liu.

327
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,390
That was incredible.

328
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,140
I've seen so many of your surgeries.

329
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,560
Nothing went wrong

330
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,060
with this seriously ill pregnant woman.

331
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,610
Perfect control of the bleeding.

332
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,860
Amazing!

333
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,460
You're the best of the best.

334
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,300
Amazing.

335
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,950
This surgery is so intense.

336
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,600
President Liu completed it with excellence.

337
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,800
Look,

338
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,940
he's almost exhausted.

339
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,030
It's so difficult.

340
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,730
The surgery is successful.

341
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,860
The baby is fine.

342
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,100
Thank you, Director.

343
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:33,700
Thank you.

344
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,020
Thank God.

345
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,490
But

346
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,700
the patient is suffering from perennial hypertension,

347
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,860
congenital

348
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,380
cerebrovascular malformation

349
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,260
and high blood lipids.

350
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,130
Possibly, before pregnancy,

351
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,960
hemangioma had already existed in her brain

352
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,710
and pregnancy made her hypertension

353
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,530
difficult to control.

354
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
So the tumor swelled up rapidly.

355
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,710
This time, it seems like

356
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,620
the car accident

357
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,890
caused brain trauma,

358
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,300
but in fact, there's not only bleeding in her brain

359
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,530
caused by trauma,

360
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,700
but also the fracture

361
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,130
of some hemangiomata,

362
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,550
causing diffuse damage

363
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,880
to both hemispheres.

364
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,580
The surgery is successful, right?

365
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,230
It's a complete success.

366
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,140
But the patient might not be able to gain consciousness.

367
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:11,980
No.

368
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,950
From the degree of damage

369
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,900
to the patient's brain,

370
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,400
if she can't wake up

371
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,410
in 48 hours,

372
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,880
well,

373
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,540
she'll end up in a vegetative state.

374
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,930
Vege...

375
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,350
Vegetative?

376
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,250
Get up.

377
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,180
Take a seat.

378
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,820
Grandma.

379
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,360
It's not her fault.

380
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,400
Why did you do this?

381
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,550
It's all your fault.

382
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,620
It's all your fault.

383
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,460
Your mom became like this.

384
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,460
You...

385
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,300
You...

386
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,950
Grandma! Grandma!

387
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,500
Grandma.

388
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,110
Mom.

389
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,770
Let go!

390
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,400
Mom, mom!

391
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,020
Take it easy, Grandma.

392
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,650
You forced your dad

393
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,160
to sign for the surgery.

394
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,340
Now your mom is vegetative.

395
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,770
Mom.

396
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,940
Grandma, please calm down.

397
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,700
I'll kill you!

398
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,020
I hate you.

399
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,510
I hate you!

400
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,840
Sit down, sit down.

401
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,800
Take a seat.

402
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,160
Oh my God!

403
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,180
Mom, mom!

404
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,670
Sit down.

405
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,250
It's not your fault.

406
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,710
Your mom has too many underlying conditions.

407
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,370
Pregnancy has put all her organs

408
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,730
under more pressure.

409
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,670
She has headaches all the time,

410
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,470
but she had never checked

411
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,520
for cerebrovascular diseases.

412
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,810
We all thought it was

413
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,850
a temporary symptom caused by hypertension.

414
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,460
Even if there were no trauma,

415
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,020
cerebral blood vessels would burst

416
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,590
due to severe pre-eclampsia.

417
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,920
So surgery

418
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,940
is definitely the right choice.

419
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,230
The neurologists said,

420
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,380
fortunately, the surgery was done,

421
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,870
otherwise, with such big damage,

422
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,970
the patient would die soon.

423
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
At least she's still alive now.

424
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,290
They said 48 hours, right?

425
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,390
Then maybe

426
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,310
48 hours later,

427
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,190
your mom will wake up.

428
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,690
Right?

429
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,080
So you have to be strong.

430
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,750
You need to eat something.

431
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,120
You haven't eaten or drunk anything for two days.

432
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,660
So if you collapse,

433
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,710
who will make the right decision

434
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,320
for your mom?

435
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,800
Say something.

436
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,270
I need some time alone.

437
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,060
Good girl.

438
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,380
Then I'll go out.

439
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,270
Remember to eat.

440
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,740
OK?

441
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,260
Why are you back?

442
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,680
It's me.

443
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,860
I came to see your mom.

444
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,860
I know

445
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,360
you're sad now.

446
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,500
I...I want to make you feel better.

447
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,480
Shengji's medical competence is elevated.

448
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,430
They won't let your mom

449
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,300
become a vegetable.

450
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,180
Elevated medical competence?

451
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,560
Can they cure brain damage?

452
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,620
Your mom is blessed by God.

453
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,340
Blessed?

454
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,590
By God?

455
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,030
Just because she had a daughter,

456
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,230
she has to risk her life

457
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,380
to carry another baby.

458
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,300
If God blessed her,

459
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,810
he shouldn't have led her to this family.

460
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,440
It's you

461
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,830
who ignored my objections

462
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,500
and set up a file for them

463
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,570
which gave them hope.

464
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,140
I tried desperately to keep my mom alive.

465
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:49,860
And in the end,

466
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,860
a blood vessel in her brain burst.

467
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,220
Wu Congrui,

468
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,940
it's you

469
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,990
and your hypocritical love

470
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,870
drove my mom step by step

471
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,910
to this dead end.

472
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,910
If you want to have a baby,

473
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,550
go ahead.

474
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,460
No one cares how many you have.

475
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,370
Why do you have to force

476
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,250
all women to have children?

477
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
I just gave her my advice

478
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,630
from a doctor's professional

479
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,510
point of view.

480
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,570
I didn't force her.

481
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,950
No, you didn't force her.

482
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,460
But you don't know anything about

483
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,220
my family.

484
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,380
Neither do you know

485
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,410
how serious a consequence

486
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,180
your so-called professional advice

487
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,020
would cause to my mom.

488
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,700
Now you win.

489
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,830
You win completely.

490
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,820
You won the competition.

491
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,950
You won love.

492
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,940
Wu Congrui,

493
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,540
to win,

494
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,420
you can be so cruel.

495
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,000
I've never gone against my professional ethics

496
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,380
and conscience

497
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,010
-to defeat you.
-Don't give me the high-sounding words.

498
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,420
From today onwards,

499
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,720
we're not friends.

500
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:43,930
Please

501
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,100
stay away from me and my family.

502
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,020
Get out.

503
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,340
Get out.

504
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,360
Let's get out.

505
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,830
I'm not going out.

506
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,710
I can't let her feel so bad.

507
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,100
I want to make her feel better.

508
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,400
You'd better go.

509
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,030
Give her some time to calm down.

510
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,130
She's not in a good mood.

511
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,590
Mom.

512
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,370
Mom,

513
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,880
wake up, please.

514
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,880
In this world,

515
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,120
you're the only one who loves me.

516
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,690
Mom, I beg you to wake up quickly.

517
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:51,830
Mom,

518
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,180
be careful.

519
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,710
As I suggested, when I'm on leave,

520
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,780
I'll send you back.

521
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,300
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

522
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,740
My mom is sick.

523
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,420
She yelled about going back every day.

524
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,000
She can't eat or sleep well here.

525
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,350
And she's distressed about the high medical bills.

526
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,700
If I don't take her back home,

527
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,430
I'm afraid she'll collapse too.

528
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,420
After I settle her down,

529
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,140
I'll come back.

530
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,780
Du Di,

531
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,260
how is she holding up these days?

532
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,180
She's fine.

533
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,100
She goes to work as usual.

534
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,250
As soon as I entered the ward,

535
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,880
she left.

536
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,700
She didn't reply to my WeChat messages

537
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,240
or answer my calls.

538
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,010
Please take care of her for me.

539
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,240
She stayed with Mrs. Du for days

540
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,280
and Mrs. Du didn't wake up.

541
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,390
She just couldn't accept the fact

542
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,730
Mrs. Du might not wake up.

543
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,690
Maybe she will get better after a while.

544
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,420
If anything happens to my wife,

545
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,560
you must tell me.

546
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,240
Don't worry.

547
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,860
I will text you every day.

548
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,100
Thank you, Liu.

549
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,980
We owe you a great deal this time.

550
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,460
You helped us

551
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,860
and asked your dad

552
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,260
to do the surgery.

553
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,700
It's my pleasure.

554
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,420
But Mr. Du,

555
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
please don't blame Du Di.

556
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,910
She didn't do anything wrong.

557
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,890
You delivered another baby?

558
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,020
Are you tired?

559
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,060
Let's have dinner tonight, OK?

560
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
You look thin lately.

561
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,220
Congrui,

562
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,220
stop trying to talk to her.

563
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,280
It's too difficult.

564
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,890
Anyone who comes across something like this

565
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,300
will feel bad.

566
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,450
I understand her.

567
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,180
I just don't want to see her

568
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
keep going like this,

569
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,380
tormenting herself.

570
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,260
She'll fall apart.

571
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,790
It's not a matter

572
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,740
of what you want.

573
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,350
Now except for

574
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,700
necessary communication with patients,

575
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,380
in the rest of the time,

576
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,430
she never utters a word.

577
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,790
She even ignored

578
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,620
Dr. Tian.

579
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,940
If this keeps up,

580
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,770
will she be sick?

581
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,620
Did you have lunch today?

582
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,160
Come with me.

583
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,540
Don't worry about her.

584
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,540
Eat, I'll watch you eat.

585
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,860
Eat.

586
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,570
Good girl.

587
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:24,980
Mom,

588
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,030
how are you feeling today?

589
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,460
I had a good day at work.

590
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,930
I delivered 3 babies.

591
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,480
They're all healthy.

592
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,980
Two of them are girls.

593
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,630
Their families

594
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,640
all embraced the newborn girls.

595
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,490
I'm so happy for them

596
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,740
and I'm also glad

597
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,590
that they were not born

598
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,840
in a family like ours.

599
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,880
Although you're not awake yet,

600
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,610
your blood pressure is stable.

601
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,220
The baby can stay longer

602
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,420
in your womb.

603
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,840
But you must wake up soon.

604
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,620
When you wake up,

605
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,790
you'll have to take good care of the baby.

606
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,590
Because only you

607
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,430
can give her love and respect.

608
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,060
Since I was little,

609
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,510
whoever in the family

610
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,530
said girls were useless and bad,

611
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,860
I would beat them up

612
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:27,980
and scold them.

613
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,960
I always thought I was cool.

614
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,020
Now I realize

615
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,740
I took it out on them,

616
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,230
but it was you who faced all the anger.

617
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,550
By the way, mom,

618
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,130
I heard

619
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,610
talking to vegetative patients

620
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
can stimulate their brain

621
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,580
and wake them up.

622
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,520
Today, I'll tell you about...

623
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,930
About how

624
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,590
I beat the boys in the class

625
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,580
when I was little.

626
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
I've got all the information about

627
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,820
your girlfriend's mother

628
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,640
and spoken to the best experts

629
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,790
here in the university.

630
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,920
Thank you.

631
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,420
Your father was right.

632
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,990
There's no treatment at present.

633
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,340
All you can do is hoping for a miracle.

634
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,740
Thank you, Laurence.

635
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,860
Bye.

636
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,700
Doctor,

637
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,660
wake up. Time to work.

638
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,980
And the...

639
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,370
You mean the female doctor?

640
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,420
She left half an hour ago,

641
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,700
saying she's going to work

642
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,500
and asking me to wake you up later.

643
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,190
Thank you.

644
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,270
What happened last night?

645
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,220
Five babies were born.

646
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,070
One of them was difficult to deliver because it was too big.

647
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,630
A lateral incision was made

648
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,940
to pull out the baby with forceps.

649
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,460
The fetus showed slightly asphyxia

650
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,430
but an hour later,

651
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,540
it got a good grade.

652
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,750
The patient's name is Guo Lin,

653
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,480
24 years old.

654
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,510
Her main problem

655
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,500
is her blood sugar

656
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,260
is not well controlled.

657
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,040
Now her blood sugar is too high.

658
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,350
We need to tell her

659
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,540
she needs diet control.

660
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,350
This patient

661
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,620
just had a surgery

662
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,250
and is still recuperating.

663
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,150
Do you have

664
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,990
any other medical advice?

665
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,680
You can tell me.

666
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,370
She's standing next to Dr. Tian now.

667
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,770
She's never been better than Du Di.

668
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,900
Look what a surprise overtaking

669
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,620
she's made.

670
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,400
Exactly.

671
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,500
The first in the country is so glorious.

672
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,930
Now she totally crushed Du Di.

673
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,150
Director Tian is here to check on you.

674
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:48,900
Director.

675
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,420
The baby has a fair complexion.

676
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,230
How's the mother?

677
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:52,890
She's good.

678
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,040
We were a few days

679
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,670
pass the expected date.

680
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,510
After they gave her oxytocin,

681
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,460
the laboring started quickly.

682
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,380
Good, good.

683
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,100
Have some rest.

684
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,940
Yeah, OK.

685
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,800
This patient is still waiting, right?

686
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,340
Right.

687
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,060
She just came in.

688
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,180
She's Director Huang's patient

689
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,620
with gestational diabetes.

690
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,060
Her blood sugar has been well controlled.

691
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,220
Director Huang's patient.

692
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,020
Congrui, you take over.

693
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,620
OK.

694
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,580
Is your blood sugar stable?

695
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,870
Dr. Huang is about to give birth.

696
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,070
So before she comes back,

697
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,500
her student will be in charge.

698
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:18,950
If you need help,

699
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,580
you can also come to me.

700
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,890
Make the ward round, right, Director?

701
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,820
Is Director Huang here?

702
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,780
Duan Tingting, right?

703
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,940
Director Huang is due soon.

704
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,670
From now on,

705
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,940
Dr. Wu Congrui

706
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,060
will be your doctor in charge.

707
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,450
Have some rest.

708
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,620
Duan Tingting.

709
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,190
She's the same age as me.

710
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,560
Is she my

711
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,660
high school classmate?

712
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,340
Doesn't look like her.

713
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,060
In high school,

714
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,410
she was the campus belle.

715
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,420
She's pregnant

716
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,860
and becomes plump.

717
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,300
It's quite normal.

718
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,570
But she changed so much.

719
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,720
I haven't changed.

720
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,780
Then why didn't she recognize me?

721
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,500
You don't look well.

722
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,900
Didn't you sleep well?

723
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,660
None of your business.

724
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,840
Soy milk.

725
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,850
I didn't touch it.

726
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,910
Where's Du Di?

727
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
She went out just now.

728
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,140
Already?

729
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,510
I just went out to buy breakfast.

730
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,660
And now she's gone.

731
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,360
She can't skip breakfast!

732
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,040
Just now I saw her staggered a little

733
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,790
in the ward.

734
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,030
She must be suffering from low blood sugar.

735
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,890
She seems to have gone back to the ward area.

736
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,310
Let me go with you to see her.

737
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,820
Don't.

738
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,330
You'd better not go.

739
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,420
She can eat some if you don't go.

740
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,480
But if you go...

741
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,100
Nianbai,

742
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,610
take good care of her for me

743
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,430
in these days.

744
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,620
For you?

745
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,500
No, I take care of her for myself.

746
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,720
If you want to take care of her, do it yourself.

747
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,570
But now once she sees me,

748
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,510
she hates me.

749
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,460
Mom becoming vegetative,

750
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,320
whoever it is,

751
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,860
it takes time to accept the fact.

752
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,330
She might also vent her resentment

753
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,300
on someone

754
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,580
to ease her guilt.

755
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,219
Give her some time.

756
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,380
She'll come around.

757
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,780
Let me show you something.

758
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,590
Chief,

759
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,659
if I win

760
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,500
the first place in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Competition,

761
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,010
promise me

762
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,790
to promote both Wu Congrui and me

763
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,940
to chief residents,

764
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:42,780
will you?

765
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,760
Two chief residents

766
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,020
are just not enough.

767
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,630
We're short of chief residents.

768
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,100
Think about it.

769
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,060
If I'm first,

770
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,770
I'm sure Wu Congrui will be second.

771
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,290
That means Wu Congrui and I

772
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,730
can both be promoted to chief residents.

773
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,730
Now you're first,

774
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,720
will you leave Shengji

775
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,690
for Du Di?

776
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,420
I've been so proud

777
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,220
and so happy

778
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,470
for myself winning the first place

779
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,980
for so many days,

780
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,890
thinking I've overtaken Du Di.

781
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,050
Wu Congrui,

782
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,680
you're such an idiot.

783
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,730
You didn't win at all.

784
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,490
You have lost from the beginning.

785
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:42,910
What kind of

786
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,940
friend are you?

787
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,740
You think I were Du Di?

788
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,620
She won't come.

789
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,760
She doesn't want to see you.

790
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,060
She'll come.

791
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,100
This is the base of our friendship.

792
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:14,970
Congrui,

793
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,180
like I told you before,

794
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,820
the friendship between you two is fragile.

795
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,520
Look how much she hates you

796
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,940
after you won first place.

797
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,020
Junxiao,

798
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,820
Du Di is not that kind of person.

799
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,330
She's devastated

800
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,270
by her mom's condition.

801
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,740
Or she'd send me her congratulations.

802
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,330
I must be with her

803
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,980
when she's experiencing

804
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,150
the hardest moment,

805
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,490
no matter how she treats me.

806
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,540
I think you're wasting your efforts.

807
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,130
Even if it's a waste,

808
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,660
I still have to try.

809
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:41,780
OK.

810
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,460
If that's what you want,

811
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,300
then give it a try.

812
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,390
But now,

813
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,220
you have to go back now.

814
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,500
Duan Tingting has a fever.

815
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,660
When did the fever start?

816
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,550
I just found it.

817
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,540
She cried out in pain.

818
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,500
You're deaf and mute?

819
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,710
I can hear you.

820
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,380
All right.

821
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,680
What about her blood sugar?

822
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,620
It's very well controlled.

823
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,090
But gestational diabetes

824
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,780
can easily cause infections.

825
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,270
Is her urine normal?

826
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
What's the discomfort?

827
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,040
It could be a urinary tract infection.

828
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,780
It happened several times.

829
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,260
I'm very uncomfortable now.

830
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,770
Then let's do a test first.

831
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,110
I'll go back to the office

832
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,020
to prescribe it.

833
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,260
Now,

834
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,340
you're with gestational diabetes.

835
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,820
And the baby is a little big.

836
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,180
As soon as the infection is under control,

837
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,170
you'd better have a c-section.

838
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,420
Director Huang said I could have a natural labor.

839
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,660
She said that?

840
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,750
When?

841
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,780
During the last pregnancy test.

842
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,420
Well, she doesn't know

843
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,360
your current condition.

844
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,340
How about this?

845
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,580
I'll consult her in a while.

846
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,910
Did you go to No.14 Middle School?

847
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,240
No.

848
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,250
You did.

849
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,020
I'm tired.

850
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,260
I don't want to meet my former schoolmate.

851
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,220
Hello,

852
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,780
the user you dialed

853
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,170
is unavailable.

854
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,820
Call again from the landline.

855
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,390
OK.

856
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,620
What's going on with Director Huang?

857
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,610
She has no reason not to answer the phone.

858
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,590
She was busy all day before.

859
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,170
Maybe she just wants

860
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,020
to take a break.

861
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,470
She can take a break.

862
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,880
But she has to do antenatal care.

863
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,530
She's due soon.

864
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,590
How can she not answer the phone?

865
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,280
Then send a message telling her

866
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:33,790
the patient's condition.

867
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,050
Once she sees it's urgent,

868
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,370
maybe she'll reply.

869
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,580
OK.

870
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,460
Dr. Huang,

871
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,810
you have a diabetic patient,

872
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,560
Duan Tingting.

873
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,890
She has an infection now.

874
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,910
We don't know

875
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,630
if it's a urinary tract infection,

876
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,620
a vaginal infection,

877
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,770
or a huge baby.

878
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,990
I suggested a c-section,

879
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,260
but she said you promised her natural labor.

880
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,550
Do you want to come and take a look?

881
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,580
She replied.

882
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,860
You'll perform the surgery tomorrow.

883
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,580
Look,

884
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,760
she leaves you in charge.

885
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,670
If anything happens

886
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,820
and you feel dangerous,

887
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,600
send me a code,

888
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,260
OK?

889
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,400
What's the code?

890
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,700
You'll perform the surgery tomorrow.

891
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,890
Oh, no!

892
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,680
Something's wrong.

893
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,360
Who is it?

894
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,300
It's me,

895
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,660
Wu Congrui,

896
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
Dr. Huang's student.

897
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,300
What can I do for you?

898
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,110
One of her patients

899
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,100
has a little problem.

900
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,430
So I kind of need

901
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,740
Director Huang's advice.

902
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,270
But she's on vacation.

903
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,380
I know Director Huang is on vacation.

904
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,790
But the situation now

905
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,740
is critical.

906
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,100
The patient's

907
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,390
conditions are complicated.

908
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,110
The judgment made by Director Huang

909
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,390
is different from the judgment

910
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,050
we made recently.

911
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,830
So the patient

912
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,300
doesn't trust us.

913
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,450
You have other directing doctors.

914
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,860
Ask someone else.

915
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,540
But...

916
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,180
He hanged up?

917
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,810
We're all going to bed.

918
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Please go.

919
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,180
I need to talk to Director Huang.

920
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,770
If she can't see me,

921
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,250
I can talk to her on the intercom.

922
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,820
She's already asleep.

923
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,290
Director Huang has never

924
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,390
slept so early.

925
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,630
She often replied to my emails

926
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,980
at 2, 3 in the morning.

927
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,610
If I don't

928
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,760
hear her voice today,

929
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,740
I'll keep ringing till dawn.

930
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,850
OK.

931
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,090
Just a moment.

932
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,600
Congrui, right?

933
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,630
I was a bit tired so I turned in early.

934
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,100
Whatever it is,

935
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,590
ask other directing doctors for help.

936
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,550
Director Huang, what's wrong with you?

937
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,260
I'm really worried about you.

938
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,340
What could be wrong with me?

939
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,660
I'm fine.

940
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,540
Go.

941
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,540
There must be something wrong with Director Huang.

942
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,650
What should I do?

943
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,680
I need to talk to Du Di.

944
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,020
But Du Di has

945
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,740
her own problem to worry about now.

946
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,220
It seems

947
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,790
I'm on my own this time.
