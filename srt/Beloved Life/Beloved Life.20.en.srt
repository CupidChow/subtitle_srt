4
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,900
Hi, Dr. Li.

5
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,600
-How do you feel today?
-What are you doing?

6
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,030
It's fine if you don't listen to me.

7
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,500
But why don't you listen to the doctor?

8
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,560
What do you think you are doing?

9
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,890
What's wrong with you?

10
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,080
My grandson can't be born prematurely.

11
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,590
You have to do as the doctors say.

12
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,340
Do you understand?

13
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,310
I know, Mom.

14
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,460
Nothing happened, didn't it?

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,150
We're all good.

16
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,560
Aunt,

17
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,540
keep it down.

18
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,020
The soundproofing is not very good.

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,780
And it's late.

20
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,009
Sorry. Sorry.

21
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,670
My voice goes up

22
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
once I get excited.

23
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,930
Doctor, I have something to ask you.

24
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,450
Tell me the truth,

25
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,720
my daughter-in-law,

26
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,920
has she done abortions before?

27
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,770
Aunt, no.

28
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,900
My son paid you to say that, right?

29
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,660
You're being funny.

30
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,829
If he did,

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,110
how much would he pay

32
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,130
for the entire department?

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,050
Don't worry,

34
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,700
She hasn't.

35
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,140
My son is a muddlehead.

36
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,540
I don't want to see him deceived.

37
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,300
Good if you say so.

38
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,980
Sorry.

39
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,140
We're sorry, doctor.

40
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,790
We'll keep it down.

41
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,140
Oh right.

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,090
I need your help with something.

43
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,130
What is it? Tell me.

44
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,310
The doctor working for our ward,

45
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,840
Dr. Wu,

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,420
is required by the hospital to have

47
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,350
more than 100,000 followers

48
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,730
on AKN (live broadcast platform).

49
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,330
Do you know how to

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,470
make it happen?

51
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,400
This…

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,370
This is simple.

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,400
There was one time when a friend of mine

54
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,310
connected mic with me,

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,470
then she got hundreds of

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,570
thousand fans in one night.

57
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,730
A lot.

58
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,000
How about

59
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,829
you ask her to connect mic

60
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,740
with me tomorrow?

61
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,220
Thank you.

62
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,050
You're welcome.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,910
No problem.

64
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,700
Take a rest.

65
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,500
We'll do a fetal heart rate

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,090
monitoring in a while.

67
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,180
Thanks.

68
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,100
Thanks.

69
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,970
Hey, babies.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,590
I'm Angel Naomi.

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,250
Yesterday some people said

72
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,110
Dr. Wu looks solemn,

73
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,030
right?

74
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,120
But it's not like that.

75
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,340
My doctor is very beautiful,

76
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,250
professional and responsible.

77
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,840
I like her very much.

78
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,860
I believe you will like her too.

79
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,220
-Pretty and kind-hearted doctor.
-Dr. Wu has

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,180
an account too.

81
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,170
I will connect the mic

82
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,010
with her today.

83
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,350
So you can get to know

84
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,330
this beautiful doctor.

85
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,090
Okay, great.

86
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,870
I like her.

87
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,550
Do it.

88
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,840
Welcome, Dr. Wu.

89
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,930
I'm new.

90
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,820
Who is this Doctor Wu?

91
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,420
Can't wait to see her.

92
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,500
I didn't see her clearly yesterday.

93
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,390
Hello everyone, I'm Dr. Wu.

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,899
Hello, Dr. Wu.

95
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,470
-Look, guys.
-The prettiest doctor ever!

96
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,790
Isn't Dr. Wu pretty?

97
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,340
Type 1 if you say yes.

98
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,600
No, thanks.

99
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,500
Seems you all

100
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,620
have good taste.

101
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,260
It's true that you all

102
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,260
have sharp eyes.

103
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,320
Awesome.

104
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,320
Thanks.

105
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm a doctor.

106
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,500
If you guys have any questions,

107
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,490
you can ask Dr. Wu.

108
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,230
Especially those who want a baby,

109
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,900
or who already

110
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,600
have a baby.

111
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,110
Yeah.

112
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,360
What do so many models do?

113
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,590
Which is better, cesarean section

114
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,520
or vaginal birth?

115
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,580
Whether to choose cesarean section

116
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,840
or vaginal birth,

117
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,860
it depends on personal constitution.

118
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,310
In the case that

119
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,130
all aspects of your

120
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,120
obstetric examination are very good,

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,060
better give birth naturally.

122
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,500
Is Angel Naomi's situation

123
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,610
caused by cervical erosion?

124
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,500
I gotta tell you,

125
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,710
don't be

126
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,780
so mean.

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,570
Angel Naomi's situation

128
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,080
is caused by a congenitally short cervix.

129
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,100
So the baby

130
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,710
has to grow up in the mother's

131
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,390
belly…

132
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,830
Dr. Wu,

133
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,470
are you hiding

134
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,130
something for her?

135
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,940
Yeah.

136
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,340
I've never heard of that.

137
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,640
What the heck are you talking about?

138
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,390
I'm a doctor.

139
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,550
I'm just stating facts

140
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,470
objectively.

141
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,500
Babies,

142
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,780
it's the first time

143
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,470
for Dr. Wu to connect with me.

144
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,300
Guys…

145
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,740
Guys, you have to…

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
Don't scare her, okay?

147
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,220
I'm out.

148
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,110
So boring. Bye.

149
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,659
Boring.

150
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,180
Boring.

151
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,780
You think I want to see you?

152
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,060
See?

153
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,150
Dr. Wu is quite

154
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,490
a personality, isn't she?

155
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,470
She really is.

156
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,460
Naomi, if you do this again,

157
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,840
I will unfollow you.

158
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,580
How about…

159
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,130
Guys, please.

160
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,140
Follow Dr. Wu, okay?

161
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,180
Think about it,

162
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,150
who doesn't

163
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,110
have a baby in their family?

164
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,160
Everyone does.

165
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,860
How nice to know

166
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,790
such a doctor?

167
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,620
You can ask her

168
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
if you have any questions.

169
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,780
She might

170
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,950
save lives sometimes.

171
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,630
Right?

172
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,180
We will follow her if you dance.

173
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,810
Get up and dance.

174
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,700
Music on and keep dancing.

175
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,170
You will follow her if I dance?

176
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,500
Dance. Dance.

177
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:12,980
Dance.

178
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,200
Okay, show me.

179
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,150
Let me see how many of you

180
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,830
will follow her if I dance. Type 2.

181
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,940
So many 2s.

182
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,500
Okay.

183
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,220
Thanks. Thanks.

184
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,670
Thanks for your support.

185
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,620
So many of you want to

186
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,530
follow Dr. Wu.

187
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,310
Thanks.

188
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,409
Music.

189
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,740
She's going to dance.

190
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,659
She's going to dance.

191
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,600
Get off.

192
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,540
She is really dancing.

193
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,790
You look great with a big belly.

194
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,570
Who says pregnant women can't dance?

195
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,130
Beautiful. So beautiful.

196
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,770
Naomi, you're the best.

197
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,620
I love you so much.

198
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,200
All right.

199
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,150
That's all

200
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,110
for today.

201
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,610
Okay?

202
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,060
See you tomorrow.

203
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,820
Love you. Bye.

204
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,820
See you.

205
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,430
Bye.

206
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,090
Don't move.

207
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,450
What's wrong, honey?

208
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:26,980
What's wrong?

209
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,100
I…

210
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,930
I think I'm bleeding.

211
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,260
It… it's okay, honey.

212
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,480
Doctor!

213
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,320
Dr. Wu!

214
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,000
Doctor!

215
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,420
Dr. Wu!

216
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,060
Ouch!

217
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,659
Doctor. Dr. Wu!

218
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,520
Dr. Wu! Doctor!

219
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,450
Dr. Wu!

220
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,350
Doctor!

221
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,880
[Delivery Room 1]

222
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,270
Luckily, you're a dancer.

223
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,780
You have a better physical constitution.

224
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,640
The only regret is

225
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,510
it's a premature baby.

226
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,700
Only 1,500 grams.

227
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,590
If I knew

228
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,780
they were so mean,

229
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,460
I wouldn't let you do it.

230
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,260
I wanted to do it.

231
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,460
It was because of my negligence.

232
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:25,930
Honey,

233
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,480
look how cute our baby is.

234
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,050
I have a son.

235
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,679
I have a son.

236
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,890
I love you, honey.

237
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,179
Too bad that I can't

238
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,710
let them know about us.

239
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
Or I would broadcast the good news now.

240
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,530
Thank you, doctors. Thank you.

241
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,460
Mom, don't be upset.

242
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,100
Premature babies are smart.

243
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,060
Besides,

244
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,510
the baby would come out

245
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,180
of the incubator soon.

246
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,760
It's okay.

247
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,700
God.

248
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,620
Why are you so happy?

249
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,980
So dim-witted.

250
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,220
I told you to listen to the doctors,

251
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,380
but you…

252
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,150
You got the doctors

253
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,380
to do live streams with you!

254
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,050
Look at my grandson,

255
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,510
how little he is!

256
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,690
Like a cat.

257
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,540
How can he grow up big?

258
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,140
Mom.

259
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,740
He's got the genes of our family.

260
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,940
Don't worry.

261
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:24,880
Mom.

262
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,140
Um…

263
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,840
He doesn't have a pet name yet.

264
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,430
Can you give him one?

265
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,860
Yeah, Mom.

266
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,780
Get him a pet name.

267
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,200
Pet name?

268
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,210
Zaozao then.

269
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,860
Born several weeks earlier.

270
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,470
He should remember

271
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,860
how unreliable his parents are.

272
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,480
Zao… Zaozao.

273
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,220
Zaozao. Sounds great.

274
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,170
Sounds great.

275
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,380
The fans will like it.

276
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,990
-Right?
-Okay.

277
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,150
The fans?

278
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,030
What about the freezers?

279
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,770
Why do you care about them?

280
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,140
No live stream today.

281
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,310
Don't worry about money. I have money.

282
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,140
I can support you two and my grandson.

283
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,190
No, Mom…

284
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:02,800
Mom,

285
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,650
this is my job.

286
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,470
I can't stop if I want to.

287
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,270
Besides,

288
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,380
I have many fans

289
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,510
who care about me.

290
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,950
I have to go tell them the good news,

291
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,510
right?

292
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,900
Why tell them?

293
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,950
We're having a grandson,

294
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,060
why do we have to tell them?

295
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,210
Mom,

296
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,500
here is the thing.

297
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,910
Her whole team

298
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,410
are counting on her.

299
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,860
If she falls off the number one place

300
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,380
on the list,

301
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,700
she would lose a lot of money.

302
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,820
This is what we do.

303
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,510
Okay, fine.

304
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,920
If anything else happens,

305
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,270
I'll see how you do with it.

306
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,340
Mom.

307
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,740
Mom.

308
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,730
Come, honey.

309
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,530
Honey.

310
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,900
Mom is actually soft-hearted.

311
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,070
She's worried about you.

312
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,270
Don't take it to heart.

313
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,630
I know.

314
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,990
I just think

315
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,220
I'm such a loser.

316
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,890
The baby is not a month old yet,

317
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,830
and the anti-fans come to say

318
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,850
all these

319
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,480
harsh words.

320
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,080
My mom got so mad at me.

321
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,210
She used to have a good temper.

322
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,010
If that's the case,

323
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,230
what's the point of

324
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,190
being the chief streamer?

325
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,060
Honey,

326
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,080
think it in a good way.

327
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,570
You have to

328
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,270
be confident that most of

329
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,800
your fans still care about you.

330
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,960
Why do you care for the anti-fans?

331
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:24,750
Did you see

332
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,820
them diss me again?

333
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,820
No… I didn't.

334
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,690
Give me the phone.

335
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,540
Give you what?

336
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,700
Just some

337
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,290
vulgar public accounts.

338
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,110
Nothing to see.

339
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,620
Show me.

340
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,780
Don't take it seriously.

341
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,060
They wrote that to draw attention.

342
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,850
Stop looking.

343
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,240
Nothing to see in these

344
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,150
pulp media.

345
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,380
I have to gather up

346
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,860
and keep a good state.

347
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,760
I can do it!

348
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,580
I can do it!

349
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,440
Get up.

350
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,050
Let me.

351
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,940
Action.

352
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,660
Hey, babes.

353
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,090
Good afternoon.

354
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,340
What's wrong?

355
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,390
Looking for a doctor or a nurse?

356
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,500
Neither.

357
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
I just can't sleep.

358
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,070
I'm out for a walk.

359
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,040
I've just finished my work.

360
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,070
Do you want to go with me

361
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,340
to the doctor's office for a chat?

362
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,050
No, thanks.

363
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,990
I'm good by myself.

364
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,820
I'll be back soon.

365
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,940
Don't go too far.

366
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,500
Or your family would be worried.

367
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,680
I always get people worried.

368
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,230
You are the internet celebrity.

369
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,300
Hello, I'm Angel Naomi.

370
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,060
Sorry.

371
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,130
I shouldn't call you an internet celebrity.

372
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,350
It's fine.

373
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,070
No need to feel sorry.

374
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,080
I am an internet celebrity.

375
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,210
I watched your live stream.

376
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,680
I don't think it's good for you

377
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,230
to see negative things after delivery.

378
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,190
I'm fine.

379
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm nothing

380
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,390
without my fans.

381
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,230
It's my job to make

382
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,420
them happy.

383
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,000
If they're unhappy

384
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,300
because of me,

385
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,790
that would be my problem.

386
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,670
Because I let them down.

387
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,760
You…

388
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,260
How did you become a streamer?

389
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,030
I…

390
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,110
Maybe it's because I failed the exam

391
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,540
and didn't go to a good college.

392
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,890
Because I let my parents down.

393
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,800
They blamed me

394
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,650
for that every day

395
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,430
even after I graduated

396
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,220
and got a job.

397
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,990
I've never seen

398
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,730
them laugh.

399
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,610
But later

400
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,420
I found that

401
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,140
I can make people happy

402
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:12,890
when I tell jokes

403
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,940
and dance to people on the Internet.

404
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,810
So I started streaming.

405
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,340
Are your parents happy for you?

406
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,900
They said I'm a shame

407
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,850
because I dance on the internet

408
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,170
and beg for rewards,

409
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,780
and that I'm no different

410
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,650
from the dance girls in the club.

411
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,490
They don't talk to me anymore.

412
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,950
Are you afraid that

413
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,810
you make people unhappy?

414
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,010
Yes.

415
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,070
Because bringing happiness

416
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,690
to others is my value of existence.

417
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,270
If I can't

418
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,340
bring happiness to others,

419
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,340
it's no different

420
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
from the loser

421
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,990
who didn't

422
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,940
get into college.

423
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,290
Then there is no point…

424
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,480
There is no value in my existence.

425
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,830
Don't you want to cry

426
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,700
for such a sad thing?

427
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,610
I can't cry out.

428
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,340
If you can't sleep,

429
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,680
you are welcome to talk to me.

430
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,930
You see,

431
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,560
I'm disabled now.

432
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,540
There won't be anything

433
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
important for me.

434
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,460
What…

435
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,900
What happened to you?

436
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,090
It's a long story.

437
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,990
Wake up

438
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,000
for breakfast.

439
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,980
Are you a savior sent from heaven?

440
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,300
I'm sleepy and hungry.

441
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,050
I just dreamed of meat buns.

442
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,670
Taste it.

443
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,540
Smells so good.

444
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,180
Where did you buy this?

445
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,910
So delicious.

446
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:45,860
I…

447
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,940
I made it.

448
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,580
You have this skill?

449
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,590
Why become a doctor

450
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,740
if you have this skill?

451
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,610
You can get a breakfast stand

452
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,390
in front of the hospital.

453
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,050
In a few years,

454
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,240
you will be able to buy a flat in Beijing.

455
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,840
Trust me.

456
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,380
I have been studying

457
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,380
in the hospital for so many years,

458
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,520
just to get a breakfast stand

459
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,410
in front of the hospital?

460
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,500
Why not?

461
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,180
You hang a sign

462
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,220
with "M.D. Buns" on it.

463
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,359
You can get a camera

464
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,310
and do live streams too.

465
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,640
It won't take long for you

466
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,730
to become an internet celebrity.

467
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,040
I can be your agent.

468
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,740
Choked?

469
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,490
Come.

470
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,960
Soy milk?

471
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,500
Thank you.

472
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,990
You're done chatting with the streamer?

473
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,390
Pay attention to her.

474
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,110
She might have postpartum depression.

475
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,440
You got a merit because of it,

476
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,650
so now everyone is depressed to you?

477
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,320
There are 15 to 30 percent

478
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,960
of women have

479
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,780
postpartum depression.

480
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,910
It's a common disease.

481
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,990
But I don't think she has.

482
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,940
She has been doing live streams for years,

483
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,870
and she saw too many

484
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,860
vicious comments.

485
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,460
She always smiles it over.

486
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,530
And, I checked it online.

487
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,610
This is also the reason

488
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,960
why she has so many followers.

489
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,130
Because they think she is

490
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,940
very optimistic

491
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,900
and positive.

492
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,720
Not being angry doesn't mean not caring.

493
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,020
Have you heard of

494
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,250
Smiling Depression?

495
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,580
Some people are clearly unhappy in their hearts,

496
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,390
but out of work,

497
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,260
reputation,

498
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,470
protocol,

499
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,940
dignity and responsibility,

500
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,210
they smile

501
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,350
in most cases.

502
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,710
But they smile

503
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,900
not from the heart.

504
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,060
It's a burden

505
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,060
and will become depression

506
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,950
over time.

507
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,370
Really?

508
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,270
So abstruse.

509
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,660
Don't listen to him.

510
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,220
He's not a psychiatrist.

511
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,540
If you like depression so much,

512
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,030
why don't you be a psychiatry intern?

513
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,930
You don't understand

514
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,720
clinic anyway.

515
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,030
I suggest you talk

516
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,460
to Naomi's family.

517
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,830
Ask them to pay attention to it.

518
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,100
Her mother-in-law dislikes me.

519
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,710
She thought I got her daughter

520
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,010
give birth prematurely because of live stream.

521
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,620
Now you want me to talk with her

522
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,420
about postpartum depression?

523
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,410
I don't have any evidence either.

524
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,730
If you think she's sick,

525
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,720
you go talk to her.

526
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,790
Li Junxiao,

527
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,500
you are an attending doctor

528
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,290
and chief resident,

529
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,620
is that something you can say?

530
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,610
It can't be.

531
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,500
How could my wife be depressed?

532
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,400
You don't know

533
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,340
how strong she is

534
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,340
inside.

535
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,210
Postpartum depression

536
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,800
is not about strong or weak inside.

537
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,190
It has a biological reason.

538
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,300
Hormone level soars

539
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,910
to keep a woman happy

540
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,020
when she is pregnant.

541
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,360
After giving birth,

542
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,380
it will drop sharply

543
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,050
like a roller coaster

544
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,620
from the highest

545
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,050
to the lowest point.

546
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,940
For an extreme change

547
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,280
like this in hormones,

548
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,560
if it's a man,

549
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,230
he could never withstand it at all.

550
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,860
He might just kill himself.

551
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,400
Seriously?

552
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,590
Have you had a surgery before?

553
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,290
I… got my appendix cut.

554
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,420
Think about it,

555
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,990
if you've just had your appendix removed,

556
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,780
and you're dragging along a sick body

557
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,060
that hasn't healed yet

558
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,210
to get into

559
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,840
a 24-hour on-call job

560
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,080
that you have

561
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,310
no experience at all.

562
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,650
Once you make

563
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,600
a mistake in doing it,

564
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,290
even it's a very small mistake,

565
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,650
you will be blamed by your family

566
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,760
and by strangers.

567
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,130
And in this job,

568
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,580
you got no salary,

569
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:10,980
will you be happy?

570
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,670
Of course I won't.

571
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,040
I'll just quit.

572
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,660
But you can't quit

573
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,510
being a mother.

574
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,730
For what I just said,

575
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,450
if it were a man,

576
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,730
I believe that no one

577
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,550
would bear it.

578
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,760
But when women are titled

579
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,540
with the name of "mother",

580
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,990
they are required to accept it with a smile.

581
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,010
Statistics show that

582
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,800
1 in 10 mothers will suffer

583
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,460
from postpartum depression.

584
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,430
Half of them

585
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,830
experience depression.

586
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,780
It's quite special for Naomi.

587
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,190
Her job requires her

588
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,660
to bring joy to others,

589
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,830
so her real feelings must be hidden

590
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
behind a smile.

591
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
In addition to her body condition,

592
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,830
the influence of people around,

593
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,380
and the remarks of people online,

594
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,300
are hard for her to digest with her

595
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,330
current emotional state.

596
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,730
So I ask you

597
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,840
to pay more attention to her.

598
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,580
She didn't sleep last night.

599
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,340
If her insomnia

600
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,540
continues,

601
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,500
she should seek professional

602
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:14,970
medical help.

603
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:18,890
I understand.

604
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,020
Doctor.

605
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,180
Can I…

606
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,580
friend you in WeChat?

607
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,850
If I find something

608
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,540
wrong with her,

609
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,290
I'll ask you

610
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,460
to see what can I do

611
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,940
to take care of her.

612
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,940
Thank you.

613
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,870
Why thank me?

614
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,880
I should thank you.

615
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,380
Thank you for trusting me.

616
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,780
I believe that

617
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,400
with a good husband like you,

618
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,160
she will definitely get through it.

619
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,130
Baby, baby, you're so pretty.

620
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,470
Aren't you?

621
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,220
You're the prettiest, right?

622
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,980
Baby.

623
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,090
My precious.

624
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,180
You're so cute.

625
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,490
Honey.

626
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,600
He's grown a lot.

627
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,530
Yeah.

628
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,770
He's bigger.

629
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,360
The doctor said,

630
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,770
he is good at eating and sleeping.

631
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,770
Preterm birth doesn't matter at all.

632
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,300
Don't worry.

633
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,660
Yeah.

634
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,990
You're growing up healthy.

635
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,740
Honey,

636
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,730
do you do live stream today?

637
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,820
Yeah.

638
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,530
Of course.

639
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,290
I did it last two days when I

640
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,870
was so sick.

641
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,820
Now our baby

642
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,660
comes out

643
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,880
of the NICU in a good state.

644
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,690
I'll surely do it. Right?

645
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,380
Right, baby?

646
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,460
Do it.

647
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,970
-Okay.
-Do it.

648
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,060
Um…

649
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,280
When they

650
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,620
see our baby is so healthy,

651
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,740
they will shut up their mouths.

652
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,020
Right?

653
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,050
Do it then.

654
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,130
We are growing up healthy.

655
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,110
Hello, everyone!

656
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,290
Glad to see you again.

657
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,920
Today, I'd like you to meet

658
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,310
a new friend.

659
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,820
This is my baby.

660
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,200
We're now at the postnatal ward

661
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,970
in good and healthy condition.

662
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,640
Let's say hello to everyone.

663
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,100
Come on.

664
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,010
Hello.

665
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,110
Show them your hand.

666
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,890
Let's wave and say hello.

667
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,970
Look at his small hand.

668
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,430
Yeah.

669
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,930
His hands are too small.

670
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,040
He might be underdeveloped.

671
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,180
Preemies are definitely not healthy.

672
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,110
And he's not good-looking either.

673
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,750
Dears, my dears,

674
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,220
you may comment on me.

675
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,030
I'm okay with that.

676
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,900
But please don't say that about my baby, OK?

677
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,500
After all, he's just come to

678
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,590
this beautiful world.

679
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,420
And it's his first time meeting you.

680
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,270
Please don't be so mean.

681
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,090
Please!

682
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,200
OK?

683
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,720
OK?

684
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,390
Isn't that light harmful to the baby?

685
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,690
Thank you!

686
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,620
The baby's skin looks yellow.

687
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,100
Did Angle Naomi

688
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,070
have plastic surgery?

689
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,810
The baby looks cute.

690
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,490
A newborn baby

691
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,280
looks just like this.

692
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,620
Look at the way she's holding the baby.

693
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,820
She's not a good mother.

694
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,240
What a poor baby!

695
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,390
Didn't your mother tell you how to talk?

696
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,330
How can you talk that way?

697
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:09,940
Mother…

698
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,710
Aren't you ugly?

699
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,980
If you're not ugly,

700
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,150
you wouldn't say that behind the screen.

701
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,050
Let me tell you this.

702
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,370
All your families are ugly.

703
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,280
My daughter-in-law is the most beautiful.

704
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,100
I can do nothing.

705
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,200
My grandson is the cutest.

706
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,360
My daughter-in-law is too good to you.

707
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,090
She's been trying to make you happy

708
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,740
so that you've forgotten how to talk like a person.

709
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,960
Look at yourself.

710
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,460
Why didn't your mother discipline you?

711
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,300
The mother-in-law is cool.

712
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,060
Mother-in-law is awesome.

713
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,180
Those trolls

714
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:35,890
have been so disgusting.

715
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,660
Biao,

716
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,200
come over.

717
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,340
Do you have another unmarried son?

718
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,820
Come over.

719
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,690
Hello, Mother-in-law.

720
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,140
Look! Look!

721
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,470
This is my son.

722
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,700
My daughter-in-law is so beautiful.

723
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,100
We're so lucky

724
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,070
to have her in our family.

725
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,000
We can't be happier.

726
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,310
Why didn't they admit

727
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,490
they're a couple in front of you?

728
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,310
Because they're afraid of

729
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,220
losing followers.

730
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,090
As for those brutal followers,

731
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,350
we don't care about losing you.

732
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,340
It's OK.

733
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,190
It doesn't matter.

734
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,980
Just get out of here.

735
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,090
Don't show yourself off here.

736
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,980
How mean you are!

737
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,770
If you dare to stand in front of me,

738
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,760
I'll slap you right on your face.

739
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,470
I'll tell you

740
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,660
what the real world is.

741
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,190
Everyone,

742
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,420
my wife

743
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,570
has been very tolerant to her followers.

744
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,270
Even in her postpartum confinement,

745
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,330
she hasn't suspended live streaming.

746
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,210
She has just become a mother

747
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,320
and her hormone levels are still unstable.

748
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,820
It's easy to have postpartum depression.

749
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,300
In front of you,

750
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,570
she always seems happy.

751
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,380
But she actually feels depressed.

752
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,550
She can't tell you that.

753
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,640
My wife, my kid and my family

754
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,660
are the most import

755
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,610
to me.

756
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,780
Even if we don't have followers,

757
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,330
not even one,

758
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,580
I could still

759
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,050
drive a taxi.

760
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,070
It's not a big deal.

761
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,640
Don't be so kind to them.

762
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,390
I've clearly got it.

763
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,450
They are just

764
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
playing the bully.

765
00:25:59,050 --> 00:25:59,920
They dare to do this

766
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,440
only to a new mother

767
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,300
and only do this online.

768
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,260
If it's offline,

769
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,660
they dare not say that at all.

770
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,410
They're all trolls.

771
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,650
Well,

772
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,660
let me give you two words: go to hell.

773
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,880
Mother, that's three words.

774
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,190
Enough, that's all for today.

775
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,400
I'm sorry,

776
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:21,940
Daughter-in-law.

777
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,540
I messed it up.

778
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,770
I was so angry

779
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,940
that I lost my temper.

780
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,340
Mother.

781
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,720
Just talk to her.

782
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,570
Thank you, Mother.

783
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,210
Really, thank you, Mother.

784
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,740
Biao's mother,

785
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,580
you're so famous now.

786
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,100
You're even in the news.

787
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,070
There're many reports on you,

788
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,590
saying that Angle Naomi's mother-in-law

789
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,660
inveighed against cyber violence,

790
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,240
and they all support you.

791
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,550
Really?

792
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,140
Dr. Liu,

793
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,140
I really want to thank you.

794
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,660
Thank me?

795
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,340
The other day, you told me about

796
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,720
postpartum depression.

797
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,470
After hearing what you said,

798
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,910
I realized that

799
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,100
I had postpartum depression.

800
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,570
After I gave birth to Biao,

801
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,300
my relatives

802
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,740
came to visit me.

803
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,830
They all judged me

804
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,940
for not being good at dressing the baby,

805
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,730
not having enough breastmilk

806
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,640
and for everything.

807
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,630
Whatever I did was wrong in their eyes.

808
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,000
That made me

809
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,410
so sad.

810
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,560
Then his father blamed me

811
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,890
for looking unhappy every day.

812
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,170
I was in that state for over a year.

813
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,160
I wondered

814
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,020
why other new mothers

815
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,960
were all fine

816
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,860
and why I was so useless.

817
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,710
If I knew you back then,

818
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,390
I would understand why I was like that

819
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,130
and I wouldn't suffer so much.

820
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,690
He was not born yet back then.

821
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:46,950
Dr. Liu,

822
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,040
I should thank you too.

823
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,340
I'm now consulting

824
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,620
some postpartum depression specialists.

825
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,950
To be honest,

826
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,840
if it weren't for you

827
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,910
who spent the night to talk me through,

828
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,510
I really don't know

829
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,690
what would happen to me.

830
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:57,980
Besides,

831
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,160
I've suspended live streaming.

832
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,920
Right now,

833
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,980
I'm not yet emotionally stable.

834
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,140
So, I'm done trying to please others.

835
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,610
That's good.

836
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,240
It's OK.

837
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:08,740
Don't worry.

838
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,490

the biggest online celebrity in our family.

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,020
I'll call you in.

863
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,510
No, no, no.

864
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,090
I'm not ready yet.

865
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,730
I'll improve the content.

866
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,680
So next time

867
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,780
when we talk online,

868
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,610
I won't make you feel embarrassed.

869
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,120
Then that's a deal.

870
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,480
I wish you

871
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,110
to have over 100,000 followers soon.

872
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,010
Thank you!

873
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,410
Thank you!

874
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,510
We're leaving then.

875
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,900
Congratulations!

876
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,620
Thank you!

877
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,900
-Bye.
-Thank you!

878
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,840
Bye-bye.

879
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,570
Bye-bye.

880
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,670
Bye-bye.

881
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,390
Let's go.

882
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,420
Bye-bye.

883
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,910
Take care.

884
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,470
Bye-bye.

885
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,740
Nianbai,

886
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,340
I want to apologize to you

887
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,860
for my ignorance.

888
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,350
That's not ignorance.

889
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,580
That's senseless.

890
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,780
I'm kidding.

891
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,430
In fact,

892
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,080
postpartum depression is not taken seriously by many people,

893
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,190
including

894
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,060
many men.

895
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,830
I know

896
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,740
you never say something bad about others.

897
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,190
But this time,

898
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,370
thank you for reminding me of that.

899
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,430
I'll surely pay more attention to

900
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,850
postpartum depression.

901
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,820
Thank you!

902
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,820
I got to go.

903
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,760
Bye-bye.

904
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,380
Bye-bye.

905
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:06,690
-Come on.
-Come on.

906
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:07,880
Bai.

907
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,730
Dr. Bai.

908
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,120
Did you miss me?

909
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,540
Yes.

910
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,490
But today

911
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,290
I might let you down.

912
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,630
What I'm going to talk about today

913
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,100
may not be that funny.

914
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,120
Today, I'd like to say something about

915
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,860
perinatal depression.

916
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,450
Men and women are different

917
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,400
in an incredible way.

918
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,100
Boys don't like to

919
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,420
play with girls,

920
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,690
because most of them think

921
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,690
girls cry a lot,

922
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,780
are afraid of getting dirty,

923
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,930
and like to tattle.

924
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,380
Women are weak

925
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,590
and men are strong

926
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,770
both physically

927
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,450
and psychologically.

928
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,930
That's what we thought.

929
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,380
Right?

930
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,350
The first time I saw a girl

931
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,570
doing manicures,

932
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,980
I thought she was just like a porcelain doll.

933
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,980
It's simply a small nail,

934
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,430
but she so carefully cut the agnails

935
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,970
and polished the nails.

936
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,500
Then, she applied protective liquids

937
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,890
layer by layer

938
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,360
before applying the nail polish in various colors.

939
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,710
But after working as an O.B.,

940
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,470
I realized that

941
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,510
those girls who can't stand

942
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,500
so small agnails

943
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,830
usually have to

944
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,260
undergo episiotomy

945
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,870
without anesthesia.

946
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,920
Do you know what is episiotomy?

947
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,210
No.

948
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,430
It happens

949
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,690
in a difficult delivery.

950
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,220
It's to use big scissors

951
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,620
to make a surgical cut

952
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,380
on the parturient woman's body

953
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,160
to get the baby out safely.

954
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,340
I don't suggest you watch such a video.

955
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,250
That's

956
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,910
one of the top ten horrible videos.

957
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,580
Disobeying medical advice can be fatal.

958
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,230
Women care about their appearance,

959
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,020
and are afraid of pain and sensitive about reputation.

960
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,880
But when a woman

961
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,110
get such a big cut on her body,

962
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,530
what do you think

963
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,790
would happen to her?

964
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,510
Would she be cared

965
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,170
and loved more?

966
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,820
No.

967
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,840
Everyone would think

968
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,460
that's what a mother must go through

969
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,530
and it's nothing unusual.

970
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,780
At this point,

971
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,050
everyone would focus on

972
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,730
who the baby looks like,

973
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,790
what is the baby's name,

974
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,180
or whether the baby is healthy.

975
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,740
But this new mother

976
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,950
is also a precious daughter

977
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,270
who has been loved

978
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,060
by her parents.

979
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,790
Everyone expects her

980
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,700
to become a stronger mother overnight,

981
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,150
and not to

982
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,740
cry out in pain,

983
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,580
and not to complain.

984
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,780
Otherwise,

985
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,400
she would

986
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,600
be called

987
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,860
too fussy.

988
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,460
Some people usually say

989
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
a woman would become stronger after being a mother.

990
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,480
I don't like that saying.

991
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,300
What about fathers?

992
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,820
Do they just need to go home?

993
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,750
Why can't mothers be weak?

994
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,450
After getting pregnant,

995
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
a woman would be out of shape

996
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,180
and looks totally different from before.

997
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,870
Her hormone levels would change,

998
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,650
making her feel so low in mood.

999
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,450
This is the least change.

1000
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,650
If it's a difficult delivery,

1001
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,620
or a cesarean section,

1002
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,490
she would get a scar.

1003
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,560
Her breasts would be as hard as stones.

1004
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,140
At the time of breastfeeding,

1005
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,740
the baby would bite her breasts to bleed.

1006
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,350
Why couldn't she show her weakness?

1007
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,850
There's only one reason for her to be strong.

1008
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,750
That is her husband is too weak.

1009
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1010
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,080
That's right.

1011
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,980
Good point.

1012
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,560
That's right.

1013
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,340
Even so,

1014
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,410
those great women who clearly know

1015
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,940
what they're going to go through

1016
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,810
would still choose to give birth to

1017
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,100
one or more babies.

1018
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,580
They still choose to become stronger.

1019
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,620
At this time,

1020
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,370
men,

1021
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,420
please don't be so weak.

1022
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,450
Please tell your wife

1023
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,570
with your tolerance

1024
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,310
and your unconditional love

1025
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,340
that what she has done is worth it.

1026
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1027
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,260
Yeah.

1028
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,110
If I could be as talkative as him,

1029
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,460
it would be so helpful

1030
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,160
for my live stream on popular science.

1031
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,140
That's really great.

1032
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,470
When could I

1033
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,900
meet such a strong man

1034
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,090
and have a baby with him?

1035
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,140
Haven't you given up yet?

1036
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,000
Of course not.

1037
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,590
What a blessing it is

1038
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,260
to be a mother!

1039
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,470
If it's possible,

1040
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,340
I want to have more than one child.

1041
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:04,890
Thank you.

1042
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,100
Thank you.

1043
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:05,620
Thank you. Thank you.

1044
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,180
Thank you.

1045
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,060
Du Di,

1046
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,719
what are you thinking?

1047
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,500
Why have you been so quiet?

1048
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,460
I'm thinking

1049
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,409
that in a family,

1050
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,139
the husband's understanding and support

1051
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,150
should be the basis for a woman

1052
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,929
to give birth to a baby happily.

1053
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,380
Yes.

1054
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:29,820
That's also the basis

1055
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,210
for starting a happy family.

1056
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,659
But Li Junxiao is not that kind of person.

1057
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:37,980
What do you mean?

1058
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,380
Do you have a crush on him?

1059
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,730
No.

1060
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,020
Congrui,

1061
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,830
Li Junxiao

1062
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,630
is not a man who can

1063
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,900
understand and support his woman.

1064
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,070
That's because

1065
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,980
you were too tough.

1066
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,190
So, he thought

1067
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,380
you didn't need his understanding or support.

1068
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,560
Yeah?

1069
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,100
But he won't change

1070
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,010
many of his views

1071
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,970
on women.

1072
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,930
Like…

1073
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,660
Oh,

1074
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,030
I suddenly remember

1075
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,020
Director Huang gave me a lot of assignments

1076
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,140
that I haven't done yet.

1077
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,390
Well, you have to wait for him alone.

1078
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,100
I got to go.

1079
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,780
Thank you. Thank you.

1080
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,380
Thank you.

1081
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,140
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1082
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,180
Where are they?

1083
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,020
They're gone.

1084
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,530
Then let me send you home.

1085
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,340
You did great today.

1086
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,860
Not before?

1087
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,850
You start to talk back.

1088
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,500
You care about me.

1089
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,880
I don't.

1090
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,020
You do.

1091
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,890
I want to

1092
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,190
do something practical

1093
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,210
for women like my mother

1094
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,540
who suffer from postpartum depression.

1095
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,560
Can you help me?

1096
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,500
OK.

1097
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,210
And teach me clinically,

1098
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:13,980
OK?

1099
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:14,860
OK.

1100
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,270
Let's be together, OK?

1101
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:16,850
OK.

1102
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,110
What?

1103
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,060
I don't care. You said yes.

1104
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,000
No.

1105
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,220
I didn't focus on what you said.

1106
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,820
As an excellent doctor,

1107
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,080
how could you lose your focus?

1108
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,590
That's

1109
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,130
the serious clinical consequence of inattention.

1110
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,730
You,

1111
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,350
Du Di,

1112
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,580
is my girlfriend now.

1113
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,640
It's not up to you.

1114
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,750
Whatever.

1115
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,020
You said yes.

1116
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,920
Objection is overruled.

1117
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:47,990
Here I am.

1118
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,590
Wait a second.

1119
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,590
I have a gift for you.

1120
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,330
Why do you give me this?

1121
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,040
This is the first silk banner

1122
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,150
I've ever received in my life.

1123
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,870
I want to give it

1124
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,820
to the one I love the most.

1125
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,870
Wouldn't you give me a good-bye kiss?

1126
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,150
You're lucky that I'm not giving you a punch.

1127
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,910
Wouldn't you give me a good-bye kiss?

1128
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,160
Please take a look at this.

1129
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,390
Perinatal depression

1130
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,780
has received more attention domestically.

1131
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,460
But it's mostly the pregnant or parturient woman

1132
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,350
who goes to see a specialist

1133
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,060
after being aware that she has postpartum depression.

1134
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,080
And it belongs to the psychiatry department.

1135
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,060
But I found through surveys

1136
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,980
that few pregnant and parturient women

1137
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,240
could be aware of having postpartum depression

1138
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,870
and they rarely go to see a doctor even they're aware of that.

1139
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,630
The first reason is that

1140
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,420
they might think seeing a psychiatrist

1141
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,700
is disreputable and shameful.

1142
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,750
Second,

1143
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,590
postpartum depression

1144
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,700
is not covered by the medical insurance.

1145
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,800
Besides, there is limited knowledge

1146
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,160
of postpartum depression.

1147
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,410
Therefore,

1148
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,140
only a small part of the patients

1149
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,140
go to see a doctor.

1150
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,010
So?

1151
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,260
So, I think

1152
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,570
we should integrate postpartum depression

1153
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,510
into the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

1154
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,150
And the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department

1155
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,020
should put more effort into related knowledge popularization

1156
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
and scale screening.

1157
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,360
How much effort?

1158
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,020
As much as possible.

1159
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,910
And we also need to develop

1160
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,270
a perfect general examination process

1161
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,990
and take perinatal depression examination

1162
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,220
as part of the obstetric examination.

1163
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,330
Have a seat.

1164
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,170
That sounds good.

1165
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,480
But it's difficult in operation.

1166
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,550
In general,

1167
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,610
the examination and treatment

1168
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,010
are not covered by the medical insurance.

1169
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,940
So, for the patients,

1170
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,550
it's an extra expense.

1171
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,500
You know it.

1172
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,300
Many people are sensitive to money.

1173
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,240
And it's more difficult in terms of clinical classification.

1174
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,060
We can't just

1175
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,210
transfer some psychologists here

1176
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,390
and cultivate them

1177
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,080
as obstetricians and gynecologists.

1178
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,800
We don't belong to the same system.

1179
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,880
That would make it more difficult.

1180
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,030
If it's in other hospitals,

1181
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,190
I don't think

1182
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,340
it's an easy job.

1183
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,330
But Shengji

1184
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,060
is known for obstetrics and gynecology.

1185
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,700
I think we should be a pioneer

1186
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,460
in this aspect.

1187
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,540
Or we can refer to

1188
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,450
the models adopted in some foreign hospitals.

1189
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,750
We can strengthen the training

1190
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,540
on identifying postpartum depression.

1191
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,830
Once there's a sign,

1192
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,390
we can propose

1193
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,380
a joint consultation

1194
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,300
with the psychiatric department.

1195
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:22,980
It's difficult.

1196
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,740
Some patients and their families

1197
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,000
may call us psychos.

1198
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,020
But we can't just do nothing.

1199
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,580
Nianbai,

1200
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,730
your energy is limited.

1201
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,110
You can't always focus on

1202
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,810
these trifling things.

1203
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,840
You're an assistant researcher of

1204
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,650
a world's leading genetic scientist.

1205
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,330
Spending most of your energy

1206
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,190
on diagnosing

1207
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,900
postpartum depression

1208
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,750
would be a waste of your talent.

1209
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,820
I don't agree.

1210
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,150
These are not trifling things.

1211
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,630
If I can't work on

1212
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,790
increasing the attention of

1213
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,510
pregnant and parturient women and their families

1214
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
to postpartum depression,

1215
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,470
I wouldn't have the mood

1216
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,100
in doing anything else.

1217
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,300
Fine.

1218
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,900
What about this?

1219
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:00,980
You may

1220
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,420
design a process first

1221
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,740
and include it into

1222
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,820
the antenatal care,

1223
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,360
not a required item of course.

1224
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,160
That's the first step.

1225
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,140
If I could have some more wards

1226
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,790
and more funds

1227
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,810
for the Obstetric and Gynecological Department,

1228
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,190
I would consider

1229
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,230
discussing this

1230
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,940
with the psychiatrists

1231
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,630
and see if we can

1232
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,340
start a joint outpatient.

1233
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,250
What do you think?

1234
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:20,690
OK.

1235
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,190
Thank you, Director Tian.

1236
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,500
I'll go and design the process

1237
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,020
right away.

1238
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,060
People do have

1239
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,130
different dreams.

1240
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,860
This is the IOU I wrote

1241
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,010
when I borrowed money from my advisor.

1242
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,300
That day,

1243
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,290
I paid my advisor back.

1244
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,500
I didn't expect

1245
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,740
to cause such a misunderstanding.

1246
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:41,660
Hereby,

1247
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,650
I'd like to

1248
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,270
make it clear.

1249
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,300
This is all about

1250
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,340
the so-called bribery.

1251
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,340
Today,

1252
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,640
I've invited

1253
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,400
Dr. Tian here.

1254
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,230
I just want to tell you

1255
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:55,730
that my son Liu Nianbai

1256
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,330
has just returned to China.

1257
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,660
He was a researcher

1258
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,470
in a foreign lab,

1259
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,100
and is now working at Shengji Hospital

1260
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,580
as a resident.

1261
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,660
There might be no problem

1262
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,620
with the appointment procedure.

1263
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,830
But,

1264
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,550
I'm wondering

1265
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,530
whether Dr. Tian's purpose of taking him in

1266
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,210
is simple enough.

1267
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,260
Senior, you're bringing me lunch.

1268
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,350
I had leftovers,

1269
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,580
so I'm bringing you these.

1270
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,610
These are so good leftovers.

1271
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,470
Would you have these or not?

1272
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,430
If not, I'll dump these.

1273
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,680
You bought these especially for me.

1274
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,590
How can you dump these?

1275
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,750
I look very handsome while eating, right?

1276
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,020
I see. You want to feed me.

1277
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,320
You look too thin lately.

1278
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,790
Otherwise, I'll beat you till you throw up.

1279
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,280
Believe it or not?

1280
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:17,660
I do believe.

1281
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,960
But beat me on my ass but not face?

1282
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,510
What is it?

1283
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,220
It's the scale I asked from

1284
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,980
my former schoolmate at the Psychiatry Department.

1285
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,260
After learning that you need this,

1286
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,030
he reported it

1287
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,740
to his director.

1288
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,530
The director of the Psychiatry Department

1289
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,590
thought it's a good idea

1290
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:36,420
and gave you this

1291
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,470
together with

1292
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,170
his unfinished paper.

1293
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,200
It contains some cases

1294
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,730
about early and late interventions

1295
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,080
in perinatal depression

1296
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,510
and comparisons in maternal recovery.

1297
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,150
This is great.

1298
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,420
It will just provide a theoretical basis

1299
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,420
for what I'm doing.

1300
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,390
He also said

1301
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,820
he'd like to invite you

1302
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,380
to be the corresponding author

1303
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,270
and finish this paper with him.

1304
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,980
This will surely work.

1305
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,000
I can gather some cases

1306
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,030
from the obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

1307
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,810
Or based on his research direction,

1308
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,010
I can persuade some pregnant or parturient women

1309
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,300
to accept early interventions

1310
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,350
so as to provide more concrete evidence

1311
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,620
for his research.
