[Episode 34]

4
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,250
Look at this.

5
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,220
The figure is not right.

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:43,940
You know?

7
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:44,710
Yeah.

8
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,460
Give us a minute, please.

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,280
Dr. Du,

10
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,620
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,120
Your mom

12
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,290
is brain dead.

13
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,350
What did you say?

14
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,130
Dr. Du,

15
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,700
as you know,

16
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,020
the brain stem of vegetative people is still functional.

17
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,540
They have heartbeats

18
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,880
and usually reflex actions, too.

19
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,140
This is why

20
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,780
some vegetative patients

21
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,840
can wake up.

22
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,620
But brain death

23
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,380
means

24
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,320
the brain stem has lost all its functions,

25
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,090
which is indicative of death.

26
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,680
You must have been so heart-broken

27
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,650
that you chose

28
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
to leave without hesitation.

29
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,460
I have been hoping

30
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,360
maybe you'd wake up some time.

31
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,190
I wish you could talk to me

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,950
once again at least.

33
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,100
Mom.

34
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,490
Now I'm motherless.

35
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,030
So is my sister.

36
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,460
Mom.

37
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,460
I'm sorry, mom.

38
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,680
Life has been so hard for you.

39
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,460
If you feel tired,

40
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,710
just take a good rest.

41
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,610
I'll take good care of my sister.

42
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,100
Don't worry.

43
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,890
I don't want you to go.

44
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,620
Don't go.

45
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,110
Du Di, have you arranged everything

46
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,380
for your mom's funeral?

47
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,380
I guess you already know

48
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,100
what I'm about to say.

49
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,030
I hate

50
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,240
to talk about this

51
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,310
at such a difficult time.

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,590
But what your dad did

53
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,570
has stirred up a storm.

54
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,970
Unfortunately,

55
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,500
the higher-ups all saw it.

56
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,100
Dr. Tian,

57
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,260
I swear.

58
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,690
I swear I didn't

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,250
do any fetal gender identification against the rules.

60
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,800
He's your dad.

61
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,240
You're reported by your own father.

62
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,170
Who do you think the administration trusts more?

63
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,750
We have strict rules

64
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,130
that forbid

65
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,380
non-medically necessary

66
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,380
fetal gender identification.

67
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,290
This practice, once found, will never be tolerated.

68
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,910
At such a critical time

69
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,020
as you compete for the chief resident,

70
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,870
it's quite a scandal.

71
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,020
You tell me,

72
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,659
what should I do?

73
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,820
Are you gonna

74
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,240
deny me the chance

75
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
to contend for the chief resident?

76
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,980
That's the lenient punishment.

77
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,300
To put it more seriously,

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,070
you might not only

79
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,820
lose the chance to compete for the chief resident,

80
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,940
but your career as a doctor

81
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,400
could also be ruined.

82
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,890
I can hardly tell

83
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,330
if you can stay or not.

84
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,860
Come in.

85
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,290
Director Huang, you wanted to see me?

86
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,210
Close the door.

87
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,420
Sit.

88
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,070
Now it's the worst time

89
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,240
for our department.

90
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,020
Lin Wei is on leave.

91
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,100
We don't know if he'll come back.

92
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,409
And Du Di is suspended.

93
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,520
So,

94
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:45,960
you have to hang tough.

95
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,040
Dr. Huang.

96
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,390
Don't worry.

97
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,520
I know you've been a little gloomy

98
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,760
due to your physical conditions

99
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,020
lately.

100
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,320
Is there something wrong

101
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,840
between you and Junxiao too?

102
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,730
I'm kind of lost right now.

103
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,020
When God closes a door, he opens a window.

104
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,660
If everything goes as expected,

105
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,060
the next chief resident

106
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,900
will be you.

107
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,220
What about Du Di?

108
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,860
Du Di is suspended,

109
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,220
which means

110
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,200
she's disqualified from the competition.

111
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,650
It's not a fair win.

112
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,190
Dr. Huang.

113
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,500
I can't take this quota.

114
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,860
At the moment,

115
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,860
there's an acute shortage of O.B.s.

116
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,780
When the chief resident's tenure is over,

117
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,700
soon, there'll be an attending position

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,670
open for you.

119
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,800
This is a very rare opportunity.

120
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,990
Don't be swayed by your feelings.

121
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,180
I've been there.

122
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Here's my advice,

123
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,240
women have so many roles in life.

124
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,860
We're wives who want a happy marriage.

125
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,270
We're moms.

126
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,130
And we're professional women

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,540
who want to climb up the ladder.

128
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,150
But in life,

129
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,860
we can't get everything we want.

130
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,180
So if, for the time being,

131
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,409
you can't have it all,

132
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,620
then grab whatever you can.

133
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,700
Something is better than nothing,

134
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,480
isn't it?

135
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,190
When Du Di

136
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,570
was still my rival for the chief resident,

137
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,540
I imagined many times

138
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,010
how happy I would be

139
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,070
if I won.

140
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,810
But now,

141
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,560
I'm not happy at all.

142
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,300
Dr. Huang.

143
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,830
Could you talk to Director Tian,

144
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,780
please?

145
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,370
The accusation that Du Di

146
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,930
identified the fetal gender against the rules

147
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,660
is completely a fabrication.

148
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,620
There is no such thing.

149
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,700
Du Di's infraction

150
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,460
is no longer in the hands of Director Tian

151
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,450
and me.

152
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,309
Suspension

153
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,070
is the best result

154
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,110
Direct Tian could get for her

155
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,190
after an arduous talk with the administration.

156
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,679
But Du Di was disqualified

157
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,919
for family reasons.

158
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,850
It's so unfair

159
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,220
to her.

160
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,940
Maybe everyone has

161
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,140
their fate.

162
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,290
Take me as an example.

163
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,190
Over the past years,

164
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,810
you know how much

165
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,830
I devoted myself to work.

166
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,420
In the eyes of others,

167
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,950
I'm the lucky one

168
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,040
who wins both in family and career.

169
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,870
I became a director

170
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,130
at a young age.

171
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,610
So many doctors

172
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,060
envy me.

173
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,740
But when it comes

174
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,370
to a divorce lawsuit

175
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,270
concerning the kids' custody,

176
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,960
all this becomes a negative impact.

177
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,380
Because I'm too busy to balance

178
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,760
work and family.

179
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,580
I almost gave up my two kids

180
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,100
to their

181
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,680
violent dad.

182
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,840
Fortunately,

183
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,530
Sichen tried so hard to persuade the judge.

184
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,400
And I got the kids.

185
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,380
Do you think

186
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,540
this is fair to me?

187
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,670
Dr. Huang.

188
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,260
In fact, in this world,

189
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,410
there is no such thing as

190
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,200
fairness.

191
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,700
I seem to have lost a lot,

192
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,570
but I still feel

193
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,110
relieved.

194
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,350
You thought it would be difficult

195
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,910
to take one step forward.

196
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,440
In fact, you should have taken it a long time ago.

197
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,310
And for you right now,

198
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,140
you need to seize the opportunity

199
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,820
to be the chief resident.

200
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,220
Don't let go of it.

201
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:18,900
Wait a minute.

202
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,360
Let me put the beanie on her.

203
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,220
When did you buy the beanie?

204
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,210
The beanie is not all.

205
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,600
I consulted with the Head Nurse

206
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,070
and bought a full set of

207
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,750
baby products.

208
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,190
Crib, diapers,

209
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,100
formula, rash powder,

210
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,460
and baby sleep helpers.

211
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,190
These might have been

212
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,100
delivered to your home right now.

213
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,260
Your baby can go home?

214
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,200
Yes.

215
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,160
I envy you.

216
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,750
My baby has been in there

217
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,670
for more than 10 days.

218
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,180
We still don't know

219
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,920
when we can leave.

220
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,900
You should believe that

221
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,290
they must also want

222
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,730
to see their parents sooner.

223
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,450
Your husband is so sweet.

224
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,430
When I was pregnant,

225
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,650
I prepared the baby's stuff

226
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,130
all by myself.

227
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,950
Such things never came to my husband's mind.

228
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,430
Sorry, I'm a different man now.

229
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,660
Stop complaining.

230
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,490
What are you looking at?

231
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,110
I think we are

232
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,530
like a family of three right now.

233
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,300
Are we?

234
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,430
Unfortunately, her dad

235
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,600
is so busy suing her sister

236
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,340
that he can't come to get her out of the hospital.

237
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,360
Du Di,

238
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,990
no matter what happens in the future,

239
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,150
I'll be there for you.

240
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,610
We'll take care of your sister together.

241
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,460
In the past, I was always on my own.

242
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,790
I thought I could

243
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,220
solve every problem all by myself.

244
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,100
But today,

245
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,870
I feel for the first time that in my life,

246
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,060
there's someone I can count on

247
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,930
and I'm no longer alone.

248
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,360
Thank you.

249
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,860
You're welcome.

250
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,790
How many times do we have to go through this in a night?

251
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,530
You peed.

252
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,430
I see.

253
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,160
OK.

254
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,190
Don't those moms

255
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,710
sleep at night?

256
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,910
Now that you mentioned it,

257
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,910
the moms

258
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,910
of newborns in our wards

259
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,790
seem to barely

260
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,630
sleep at night.

261
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,790
How long is this

262
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,060
gonna last?

263
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,200
I don't know.

264
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,160
Let's get up.

265
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,240
Get up for milk.

266
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,560
All right.

267
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,540
Here you go.

268
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,390
What did you do last night?

269
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,190
You're totally whacked out.

270
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,380
Taking care of the baby..

271
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,580
You helped Du Di take care of the baby?

272
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,820
Great, consider it as practice.

273
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,100
Human babies

274
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,380
are so inhumane.

275
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,950
It's retrograde.

276
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,490
Dads and moms

277
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,470
both need rest.

278
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,220
But the baby is

279
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,300
either eating, crying, peeing, or pooping,

280
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,320
except for sleeping.

281
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,220
I googled it.

282
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,490
They'll remain this way

283
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,460
for one to three years.

284
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,570
It's so devastating.

285
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,310
You took care of a baby for one day

286
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,180
and you're already whining.

287
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,620
I suggest you

288
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,920
convince Du Di to give the baby

289
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,570
back.

290
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,490
You're both receiving standardized residency training.

291
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,710
This is too much a burden for you

292
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,720
both mentally and physically.

293
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,500
I know you want to help her,

294
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,310
but you could end up

295
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,090
turning on each other.

296
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,720
That's certainly not what you want.

297
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,480
Give the baby back?

298
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,620
No way.

299
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,470
I'd miss her.

300
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,890
You don't know

301
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,700
how cute her sister is.

302
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,650
Especially

303
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,760
when I feed her milk,

304
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,480
her big eyes

305
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,900
would look at me.

306
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,050
She's super cute.

307
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,740
Yeah, she's cute, but also a poor girl.

308
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,000
Her dad just took off.

309
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,630
Is she her sister's liability now?

310
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,230
Two young doctors still in the residency program

311
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,250
who are not married yet

312
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,040
have to raise a kid.

313
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,790
Is this gonna work?

314
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,840
It is not impossible.

315
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,680
Slick man.

316
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,850
I'll admire your good conscience

317
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,110
if you stick to the end.

318
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,550
Why hasn't Director Tian come yet?

319
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,840
Are you waiting for him?

320
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,380
Why?

321
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,700
I have a favor to ask.

322
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,140
He has an administrative meeting.

323
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,810
I'm sure he'll be here.

324
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,520
There's a consultation today.

325
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,640
Director Tian.

326
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,350
Director Tian, about Du Di...

327
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,060
Save it.

328
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,530
The decision is made.

329
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,700
But there are not many

330
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,390
residents.

331
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,330
Now the department is seriously short of staff.

332
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,410
Can't you try

333
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,270
to talk to the administration?

334
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,700
You think I didn't?

335
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,260
I kept speaking for Du Di

336
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,450
at the administrative meeting.

337
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,260
But in the end,

338
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,130
things didn't get any better.

339
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,030
Instead, the president

340
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,020
gave me quite a reprimand.

341
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
You kids

342
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,510
have never taken the rules seriously.

343
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,010
You always thought you could make up

344
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,760
for the mistakes.

345
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,540
Not all mistakes

346
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,170
can be blamed on being young.

347
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,660
Some of them are just stupid.

348
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,210
He's so burned up.

349
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,710
Looks like he's taken

350
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,610
a hell of reprimands from the administration.

351
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,840
Don't worry.

352
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,030
When the scandal quiets down,

353
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,260
let's see what we can do.

354
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,370
I can't wait.

355
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,460
It's a critical time for Du Di

356
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,200
to compete for the chief resident.

357
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,730
This is gonna

358
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,210
blow up her chance.

359
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,150
Two outstanding doctors,

360
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,490
one is reported by her father

361
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,760
and the other is troubled by love.

362
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,100
If Congrui can't pull herself together,

363
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,100
she won't be able to become the chief resident, either.

364
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,750
It's not that bad.

365
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,180
We can focus on the baby then.

366
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,960
Thank you for helping me find this cemetery.

367
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,300
It's the...

368
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,700
It's the first time I held a funeral.

369
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,540
I didn't know what to do.

370
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,060
I didn't know, either.

371
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,140
I came here

372
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,100
to mourn my mom.

373
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,230
Now I'm also

374
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,220
a motherless person.

375
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,850
Did you tell your dad?

376
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,310
I don't have a dad either.

377
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,020
I think your dad

378
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,370
is just too sad.

379
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,990
He'll come back.

380
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,740
I don't care if he comes back or not.

381
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,350
It has nothing to do with me.

382
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,250
I just feel sorry for my mom.

383
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,790
I always thought

384
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,450
when I became the most successful woman

385
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,390
with a career

386
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,630
and a lot of money,

387
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,990
I could return with my mom

388
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,270
to our hometown with pride

389
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,000
so that those who ridiculed her

390
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,340
for not being able

391
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,450
to have a son could see.

392
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,630
I thought I could bring her

393
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,260
happiness.

394
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,380
But eventually,

395
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,130
I watched her

396
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,660
become

397
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,670
a breeding tool.

398
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,750
She was only 50 years old.

399
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,400
All my efforts

400
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,890
have lost their meaning.

401
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,300
You work hard for yourself.

402
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,869
We don't work hard

403
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,500
to prove anything to anyone.

404
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,869
We work hard

405
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,810
so that when we're alive,

406
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,540
we can enjoy life

407
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,099
and do whatever we want to do.

408
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,280
That's for people like you

409
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,390
who face no financial problems

410
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,250
to say.

411
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,700
Enjoy life.

412
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,900
It's exhausting for many people

413
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,610
to simply make a living.

414
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,570
Du Di,

415
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,660
we have to pull ourselves together.

416
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,030
Didn't you

417
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,020
encourage me like that before?

418
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,180
Time.

419
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,950
Time can overcome all.

420
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,470
There's nothing

421
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,330
we can't get through.

422
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:43,820
That's right.

423
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,650
Think about your role model, Lin Qiaozhi.

424
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,900
She's a legendary woman.

425
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,620
Compared to her,

426
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,220
I'm plain and lowly.

427
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,820
You are not plain

428
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,780
or lowly at all.

429
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,750
You're just

430
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,040
a little lost now.

431
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,510
I don't know if I can

432
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,160
find my purpose back.

433
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,500
But I'm afraid we have to go back

434
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,180
to pick up the baby.

435
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,390
The Head Nurse didn't promise

436
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,470
to help me take care of her for a day.

437
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,260
I'm glad you're back.

438
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,460
But I'm also confused.

439
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,850
You were so determined

440
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,710
when you left.

441
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,250
What makes you change your mind?

442
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,620
My sister is in a very serious condition.

443
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,020
I need a lot of money.

444
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,790
And Shengji fired me.

445
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,790
I can't just watch

446
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,180
my sister's condition deteriorate, can I?

447
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,330
So are you going to stay in Kaiming

448
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,190
permanently?

449
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,360
I don't want to go to any Grade-A tertiary hospitals

450
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,830
except for Shengji.

451
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,260
OK then.

452
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,290
Let's work together

453
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,360
and create the future.

454
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,060
Sign it.

455
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,300
Thank you, Huang,

456
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,410
for taking care of my daughter.

457
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,500
We'll be relieved to have you here.

458
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,640
You're welcome, Mrs. Zhang.

459
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,200
You're due?

460
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,220
Yeah.

461
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,360
Her fetus is in a late transverse lie position.

462
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,760
Arrange for C-section for her tomorrow.

463
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,610
Caiting.

464
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,000
Welcome!

465
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,560
You two are sharing a ward?

466
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,710
Yeah.

467
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:36,850
Zhang Ying,

468
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,660
I didn't expect that

469
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,940
we could go through childbirth together.

470
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,700
We came to

471
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,120
do antenatal check-ups together.

472
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,010
And

473
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,250
we both have some problems.

474
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,220
So we're both hospitalized

475
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,040
by Director Huang.

476
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,200
Caiting,

477
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,690
do you know when

478
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,320
your labor is due?

479
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,100
The doctor said the fetal heart rate was not up to standard

480
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,800
and put me under monitoring.

481
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,950
I don't know yet.

482
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,610
Congrui, ask the nurse

483
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,460
to get prepared

484
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,930
for tomorrow's surgery.

485
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,030
You'll be my first assistant.

486
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:01,970
Thank you, Director Huang.

487
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,870
You two have a good rest.

488
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,800
See you tomorrow.

489
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,180
Bye-bye!

490
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:07,980
Bye-bye!

491
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,430
Zhang Ying.

492
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,260
Dr. Huang.

493
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,310
Wait a minute.

494
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,580
Mrs. Zhang.

495
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,480
Do you have any single ward?

496
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,290
Zhang Ying sleeps lightly at night.

497
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,900
I'm afraid that sharing a ward with someone else,

498
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,670
she'll have trouble falling asleep.

499
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,680
Is that so?

500
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,250
Zhang Ying requested

501
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,810
to share a ward with Guo Caiting.

502
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,810
Huang,

503
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,140
to be honest with you,

504
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,700
my daughter is an unsophisticated person.

505
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,660
We may know a person's exterior, but not her heart.

506
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,750
I'm afraid that Guo Caiting

507
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,720
would hurt my daughter

508
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,650
and her baby.

509
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,800
I don't think so.

510
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,040
They teamed up

511
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,660
against Zhang Zilu before.

512
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,410
And they became close friends later.

513
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,660
Women like her are unethical.

514
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,140
I feel uneasy.

515
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,020
And I heard that her child is not well.

516
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,490
When Zhang Ying's baby

517
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,290
turns out to be healthy

518
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,200
and hers doesn't,

519
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,580
will she do something bad?

520
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,280
Mrs. Zhang, don't worry.

521
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,860
Zhang Ying will have a C-section tomorrow.

522
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,000
The recovery period will be short.

523
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,380
As for Guo Caiting,

524
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,530
her baby is not stable.

525
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,310
But it's possible

526
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,230
it'll be a while until she gives birth.

527
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,790
Maybe when you leave the hospital,

528
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,660
she hasn't given birth yet.

529
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,230
What if she could?

530
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,380
How about this?

531
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,740
I'll tell the nurses

532
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,940
to keep a close eye

533
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,010
on your daughter and her baby.

534
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,990
You're in a hospital.

535
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,420
She can't do anything bad.

536
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,710
I'm still worried.

537
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,050
But the wards are all occupied now.

538
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,410
If you're still worried,

539
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,640
when there's an available bed,

540
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,780
I'll find an excuse

541
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,370
to move Zhang Ying out.

542
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,720
Oh, that'll be great.

543
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,680
Thank you.

544
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,790
I have to go back.

545
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,510
While talking to you,

546
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,690
I'm anxious

547
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,790
to leave them alone.

548
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,030
Thank you.

549
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,960
Is she kind of overprotective?

550
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,260
It's normal for a mother to worry

551
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,340
under this situation.

552
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,850
Did he try to look for you?

553
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,100
Yes, every day.

554
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,410
He even went to my hometown.

555
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,370
Luckily I listened to your advice

556
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,200
and moved.

557
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,830
But I'm still a little worried

558
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,020
that he'll take revenge on me.

559
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,470
I don't think he knows

560
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,750
we've become allies.

561
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,490
He only knows that you've disappeared.

562
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,290
He wouldn't dare to come to me.

563
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,560
In addition,

564
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,250
he wouldn't have thought

565
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,150
we're now

566
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,900
in the same ward,

567
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,590
expecting the babies.

568
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,180
Zhang Ying,

569
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,070
shall we tell

570
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,120
the kids

571
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,290
their kinship?

572
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,420
It won't hurt them to know.

573
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,260
It won't?

574
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,540
What are you doing, mom?

575
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,890
What are you going to tell the kids?

576
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,710
One's mom

577
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,390
wrecked another's mom's

578
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,400
marriage.

579
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,900
You expect them to go to school

580
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,470
hand in hand?

581
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,380
You wrecked another woman's marriage.

582
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,510
It's shameless of you

583
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,990
to ask such a question.

584
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,230
Mom, it's not fair.

585
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,230
She was cheated.

586
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,350
She was not!

587
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,610
How could you believe everything she said?

588
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,650
You're such a fool,

589
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,970
my silly daughter.

590
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,600
All right, mom.

591
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,550
Will you stop?

592
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,740
I'll get angry if you don't stop.

593
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,660
You're angry?

594
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,750
So am I.

595
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,480
Your baby won't have a dad when it's born.

596
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,590
You don't care.

597
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,160
Could the baby be happy?

598
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,150
Enough.

599
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,730
My baby doesn't need that kind of dad.

600
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,510
I'm sorry.

601
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,580
Welcome back.

602
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,380
Good wine.

603
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,010
I can't celebrate your return with bad wine.

604
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,820
This is from

605
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,650
one of Burgundy Grand Crus.

606
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,500
It's rare.

607
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,020
It's expensive, isn't it?

608
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,990
You can't put a price

609
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,220
on my feelings for you.

610
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,450
How many cervical surgeries

611
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,390
do you have to perform to buy a bottle?

612
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,860
I don't mean to be rude.

613
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,020
I just want to express my feelings.

614
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,660
When I realize that I have to

615
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,000
do many surgeries

616
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,500
to afford this bottle of wine,

617
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,010
I want to drink more.

618
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
As long as you are with me,

619
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,580
you can have as much good wine as you want.

620
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,670
I've always wanted to ask you.

621
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,040
Why do you like me?

622
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,350
Because your talent

623
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,220
is plain for all to see.

624
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,850
Many female residents

625
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,030
and interns like you.

626
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,410
If you were not

627
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,440
with Du Di,

628
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,300
they would fight so badly over you.

629
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,750
And you have this

630
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,670
perseverance

631
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,970
and a strong sense of responsibility,

632
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,030
like a pure white lily

633
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,460
hanging above the mire.

634
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,620
It is particularly attractive.

635
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:00,990
You almost made me

636
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,690
blush.

637
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,370
Du Di doesn't understand you.

638
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,800
Neither does Wu Congrui.

639
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,850
If not chained

640
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,560
to a destitute family,

641
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,830
you'd soar in the sky

642
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,200
like a hawk.

643
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,340
I never thought that the one who knows me the best

644
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,900
is you.

645
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,010
Junxiao.

646
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,660
You need to be liberated

647
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,020
and fight without scruples.

648
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,570
And I

649
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,680
am your ideal partner.

650
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,880
Here's to your appreciation.

651
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,290
Cheers.

652
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,540
I'm going out to unpack.

653
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,570
You're finally asleep.

654
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,410
I'm exhausted.

655
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,630
Oh my God.

656
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,830
I need to take a break.

657
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,420
Thank you

658
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,910
for letting us

659
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,100
move in with you.

660
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,930
Your place is too small

661
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,870
for the three of us.

662
00:26:59,250 --> 00:26:59,950
The apartment

663
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,040
is flooded by baby products.

664
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,420
I can't even put my foot in.

665
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,020
I feel so tired.

666
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,660
I used to stay up so many nights

667
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,570
to prepare for exams,

668
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,440
yet I didn't feel tired at all.

669
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,140
This week,

670
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,400
I feel like I'm dying.

671
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,630
You were holding Mengmeng for most of the day.

672
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,580
Let me give you a massage.

673
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,830
I'm fine. You have a rest.

674
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,690
It's OK.

675
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,420
I think I forgot to feed her.

676
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,040
You rest, I'll go.

677
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,190
I'll take a nap then.

678
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,260
All right.

679
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,660
Liu Nianbai.

680
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,950
The bottle is broken.

681
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,740
Do you have another bottle?

682
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,890
I suppose. Let me see.

683
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,420
Liu Nianbai, she pooped.

684
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,730
I need a diaper.

685
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,010
A diaper, OK.

686
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,880
Who is it?

687
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,550
[Medical Devices Procurement]

688
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,440
These are all substandard devices.

689
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,580
Yet they purchased so many.

690
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,210
This hospital has no regard for patients' lives.

691
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,390
You're both

692
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,780
intelligent people.

693
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,510
And you've been taking care of her for a few days.

694
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,680
Yet you still don't get the hang of it.

695
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,270
She fell asleep already.

696
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,000
Give up.

697
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,260
I say

698
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,570
you'd better send her

699
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,490
to my parents.

700
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,100
They have nothing to do anyway.

701
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,950
If this keeps up,

702
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,700
the baby wouldn't feel comfortable

703
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,660
and you would collapse.

704
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,040
Thank you for saving us.

705
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,580
I have to take a leave in a few days

706
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,640
to visit Mr. Du.

707
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,470
Will he meet you?

708
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,940
I think he will.

709
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,610
He's always liked me.

710
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,540
As long as he's willing to withdraw his complaint,

711
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,960
Du Di will be able to go back to the hospital.

712
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,420
I have a hunch

713
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,720
that he will forgive Du Di.

714
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,540
If he can,

715
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,840
that'll be great.

716
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,630
If only Li Junxiao

717
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,990
could come back too.

718
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,900
Li Junxiao is still avoiding you?

719
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,300
He's not answering his phone.

720
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,240
It seems there's something

721
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:13,990
he doesn't want to tell.

722
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,160
I have a hunch that

723
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,780
he will come back to you.

724
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,210
Has the baby driven you mad?

725
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,530
You seem to have a hunch about everything.

726
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,530
Sometimes we have a hunch

727
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,950
because we believe in human nature.

728
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:28,900
We believe in human nature?

729
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,730
I believe that in their hearts

730
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,780
there must be love.

731
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,400
So,

732
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
we both need to try harder.

733
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,920
Tomorrow I will visit Mr. Du.

734
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,290
You'll go to see Li Junxiao.

735
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,480
We'll split up

736
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,570
and do our best.

737
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,340
OK.

738
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,020
Wait a minute.

739
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,440
Sit down and take a rest.

740
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,390
Wait a minute.

741
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,950
Have you seen Dr. Li?

742
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,730
He didn't even show up for work today.

743
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,220
And he didn't answer his phone.

744
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,480
He has so many appointments.

745
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,170
But he's not even here.

746
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,470
I'm busy assigning these patients

747
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,940
to other doctors.

748
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,070
He didn't drink much yesterday.

749
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,890
My contracts.

750
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,160
Mr. Du,

751
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,320
thank you for seeing me.

752
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,550
How is the baby?

753
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:45,760
She's fine.

754
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,700
She eats and sleeps well, and seldom cries.

755
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,080
Let me show you her photos.

756
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,380
She looks a lot like her mom.

757
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,390
You must miss her a lot.

758
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,250
Liu,

759
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,400
you must hate me so much.

760
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,620
Do you think

761
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,480
I killed my wife

762
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,280
and destroyed my daughter?

763
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,659
I spent a lot of time

764
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,940
gathering tons of information

765
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,070
and trying to understand

766
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,620
why you want so much to have a son.

767
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,460
I can understand a little now.

768
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,159
But I still can't accept it.

769
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,790
My older generation taught me that.

770
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,219
From the time when I could understand things,

771
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,179
I've known how important

772
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,210
boys are to a family.

773
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,310
Sooner or later, a girl has to marry into another family.

774
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,659
Although after I went to school,

775
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,580
I learned from the textbooks that men and women are equal.

776
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,449
But I have to admit

777
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,020
that I was a bad student.

778
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,940
Pride and dignity mean everything to me.

779
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,500
But

780
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,050
now,

781
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,280
it's too late.

782
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,340
I don't think so.

783
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,020
You have two daughters.

784
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,220
One is already excellent.

785
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:13,950
She will become

786
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
one of the best doctors.

787
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,460
The other one needs your love

788
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,050
so that she won't have a childhood

789
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,350
like her sister's

790
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,290
which was full of hardship and pain.

791
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,300
When I see them,

792
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,270
I'm reminded

793
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,490
of their poor mother.

794
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,460
I hate them

795
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,410
and I hate myself, too.

796
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,910
It's easy to hate.

797
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,060
But what good does that do?

798
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,580
Mr. Du,

799
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,390
please forgive Du Di

800
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,610
and yourself, too.

801
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,000
Go back.

802
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,610
Please withdraw the complaint against Du Di.

803
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,600
I won't leave until you withdraw it.

804
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,500
Du D's grandma is dying.

805
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,520
I haven't told her this yet.

806
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,710
She said she wouldn't die

807
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,560
until she sees her grandson.

808
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,080
Go back.

809
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,390
When my mom rests in peace,

810
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,160
I'll think about other things.

811
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,490
You may not have seen

812
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,270
how hard your daughter worked

813
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,700
over the years before.

814
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,150
I heard that since she went to college,

815
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,320
she hasn't slept for more than 6 hours

816
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,390
in a single day.

817
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,770
She's known as the school's

818
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,660
crazy nerd.

819
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,820
To gain your respect,

820
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,070
she's never been

821
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,020
like a girl.

822
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,140
This complaint

823
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,820
is devastating to her.

824
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,140
You're her father.

825
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,180
You haven't done your job

826
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,780
as a father.

827
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,190
You never loved her

828
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,090
or encouraged her.

829
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,350
I don't expect you

830
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,150
to make up for her in the future.

831
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,750
But

832
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,550
I hope you can withdraw the complaint.

833
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,910
Because you'll ruin

834
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,260
what she's been fighting for over a decade.

835
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,790
Even a stranger

836
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,110
would feel sorry for her,

837
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,000
let alone her family.

838
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,420
Li Fei! Li Fei! Li Fei!

839
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,440
I just witnessed

840
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,780
the spontaneous delivery of boy-girl twins.

841
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,320
They're so cute.

842
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,680
When one cries,

843
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,770
the other follows immediately.

844
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,100
So, telepathy is true.

845
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,700
They're for you.

846
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,180
Did you make a fortune?

847
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,690
Or did the Head Nurse complement you?

848
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,080
You bought so many.

849
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:20,620
They're for you, too.

850
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,710
Are you insane?

851
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,070
Li Junxiao was here.

852
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,700
He bought these for you.

853
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,280
And he asked me to tell you this,

854
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:29,900
"I'm sorry.

855
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,430
I'll do what I have to do.

856
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,580
Bye."

857
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,070
What does that mean?

858
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,800
He said he had to go away.

859
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,410
He'll send you details by WeChat.

860
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,710
How long has he been gone?

861
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,020
Five or six minutes.

862
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,180
[Congrui]

863
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,740
Hello?

864
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,670
Li Junxiao,

865
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,290
let's talk face to face.

866
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,350
Come back.

867
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,010
I'm sorry, Congrui.

868
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,530
I was going to say it in person.

869
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,810
But the twin babies

870
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,270
you were delivering took too long.

871
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,630
I was going to be late for a train.

872
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,580
Where are you going?

873
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,750
To my hometown.

874
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,350
Congrui.

875
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,640
In the last few days,

876
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,330
I figured out one thing.

877
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,490
I'm not good enough for you

878
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,580
or Shengji.

879
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,110
I want to apologize to you.

880
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,060
When I learned

881
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,050
you had a fertility problem,

882
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,590
my first thought

883
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,930
wasn't to go through the hard times with you.

884
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,320
Instead, I hesitated.

885
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,180
I love you so much

886
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,390
but I didn't stand firmly

887
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,250
by your side.

888
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,500
In fact,

889
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,500
Congrui,

890
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,780
rather than worrying over

891
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,140
if you could have a baby,

892
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,140
I'm worrying that

893
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,270
I'd be a burden to you

894
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,480
when we stay together.

895
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,510
What Shengji has taught me

896
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,420
in the past years,

897
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,980
medical skills or ethics,

898
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,150
were trampled down under my feet.

899
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,540
I can no longer let you

900
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,400
do more for my family

901
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,340
unconditionally.

902
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,800
I'm really ashamed of it.

903
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,460
But we love each other.

904
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,380
We'll get through this.

905
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,540
Come back.

906
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,010
I've made up my mind

907
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,080
to work for a hospital in my hometown.

908
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,630
Don't be impulsive.

909
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,130
You'll have no future there.

910
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,700
If not Shengji,

911
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,790
we can go to another

912
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,750
Grade A Class 3 hospital.

913
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,110
You come back first.

914
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,860
Come back right now!

915
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,180
I'm not being impulsive.

916
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,990
I have worked so hard for so many years

917
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,300
just to

918
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,440
leave the small town where I came from.

919
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,250
But during my time in Kaiming,

920
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,500
I found that

921
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,770
many women in remote areas

922
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,180
are so easily fooled.

923
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,400
They barely have

924
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,270
any medical knowledge.

925
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,750
♫Behind this door♫

926
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,500
For example,

927
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,710
the county hospital of my home

928
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,110
is in acute shortage of medical resources.

929
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,140
♫It's bustling people day and night♫

930
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,600
Its doctors

931
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,460
also need to improve their skills.

932
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,680
I think

933
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,680
if I can

934
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,890
contribute the medical skills I've learned

935
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,790
to the people in my hometown,

936
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,740
♫They're waiting for miracles♫

937
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,440
all the efforts it took me

938
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,400
will be worthy.

939
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,770
Are you sure

940
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,130
♫They shoulder pressure and lives♫

941
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,640
this is the result

942
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,250
of your careful consideration?

943
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,380
♫The warmest hands in the world♫

944

Yes, I am.

945
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,620
Then what about me?

946
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,130
♫Always by your side with care♫

947
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,460
I'm sorry.

♫You make it easy to be happy♫

949

♫Every soul is different now and dreaming about the distance♫

951

952

00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,660
♫Luckily I have an angel like you♫

954
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm sorry.

955
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,620
I don't want to hear you say you're sorry.

956
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,300
♫Who gives me hope♫

957
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,450
Li Junxiao.

958
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,190
Now I know

959
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,870
how hard you feel inside.

960
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,030
I know that you're leaving

961
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,190
for a reason.

962
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,780
And I also know that

963
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,800
you'll forever keep Shengji

964
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,180
in your heart.

965
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,050
But you have to remember what I'm about to say.

966
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,670
You're a good doctor,

967

an excellent one.

968
