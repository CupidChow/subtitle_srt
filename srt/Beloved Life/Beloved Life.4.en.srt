4
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,690
Honey.

5
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,950
I've only been pregnant for over fifty days.

6
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,110
I'm constantly sleepy and exhausted.

7
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,140
Those mothers

8
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,710
have been pregnant for such a long time.

9
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,070
How did they make it?

10
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,680
From conception to delivery,

11
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,850
this is only the first phase.

12
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,740
There's still a long way to go.

13
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,150
I don't want to

14
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,300
care about other things.

15
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,380
I just want to have

16
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,790
my baby safely.

17
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,710
What paper are you reading?

18
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,479
Are you going to publish a book again?

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
No, just casual reading.

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,450
Poor Chen Ping.

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,310
Her previous two babies

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,260
were born,

23
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,260
and somehow died.

24
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,270
She must be devastated.

25
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,870
If anything goes wrong

26
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,140
with this baby,

27
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,579
I'll be crushed,

28
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,780
let alone her.

29
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,170
No.

30
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,290
I have to persuade them

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,990
to take a genetic compatibility test tomorrow.

32
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,780
OK.

33
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,780
Why don't you care?

34
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,860
Don't you want to save that child?

35
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,140
Don't overthink.

36
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,940
Go to sleep.

37
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,860
Baby.

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,360
I must save

39
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,500
that child.

40
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:13,950
Is it here?

41
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,460
Here. Very sore.

42
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,390
Hang in there.

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,650
The baby is due soon.

44
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,860
Honey,

45
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,140
when Dr. Huang was checking up on me,

46
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,980
we didn't tell her the truth.

47
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,610
I was really scared.

48
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,140
Should I tell her

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,240
about everything?

50
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,710
As for the genetic compatibility test

51
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,060
they mentioned,

52
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,990
should we also

53
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,010
take it?

54
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,820
I've discussed it with mom.

55
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,650
But for the previous two times,

56
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,329
the check-up results were good

57
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,570
when the baby was born.

58
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,180
If something went wrong with the child,

59
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,610
it should be diagnosed.

60
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,900
But if you had told the doctor

61
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:49,890
about your miscarriage,

62
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,620
the doctor would say

63
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,850
you had recurrent miscarriage.

64
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,300
If there's something wrong with the baby,

65
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,890
they would blame it on you.

66
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,340
Did you forget the last time

67
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,550
when mom made a scene?

68
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,910
It's because

69
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,660
the doctor insisted

70
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,560
you have recurrent miscarriage.

71
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,710
The baby couldn't survive.

72
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,060
We're at Shengji.

73
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,140
We spent so much money

74
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,740
and stayed in the city for months.

75
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,620
Isn't it because we trust Shengji?

76
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,750
Since we're here,

77
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,370
if we don't tell the doctor the truth,

78
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,980
it's to no avail.

79
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:18,980
Well said.

80
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,960
This is our family matter.

81
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,130
You have to take control of your own fate.

82
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,170
When some people do bad things,

83
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,970
they will use family as an excuse.

84
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,220
For example,

85
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,740
women oppression,

86
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,940
domestic violence.

87
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,580
They all say it's their family matter.

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,650
But if something happens to their family,

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,210
they'll blame others.

90
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,440
The doctor is wrong.

91
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,700
The hospital is wrong too.

92
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,980
But they overlook their own problems.

93
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,690
In this big world,

94
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,100
people like you are the boss.

95
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,780
I won't argue with you.

96
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,700
But if everyone is like you,

97
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,150
it'll be the same with or without a family.

98
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,770
It'll be the same with or without a husband.

99
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,570
What will the society be like?

100
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
The society will be better.

101
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,730
Did you get the item?

102
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,420
Yes.

103
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,040
How is the project going?

104
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,910
Not bad.

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,130
But you didn't attend today.

106
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,980
The bosses

107
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,650
were a bit upset.

108
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,220
They said that

109
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,990
all their executives were there.

110
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,970
We only sent the middle managers.

111
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,180
It wasn't respectful to them.

112
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,180
Didn't you tell them

113
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,220
I was hospitalized?

114
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,040
I did.

115
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,930
But they just agreed casually.

116
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,150
At the negotiation table,

117
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,110
they still asked for a large sum of money.

118
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,920
They put the bite on us.

119
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,270
In the end, there was no other way.

120
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,420
The chairman negotiated in person

121
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,060
and settled

122
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,940
the matter slightly.

123
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,030
Alright.

124
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,900
You can go back if there’s nothing else.

125
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,080
OK, Ms. Yuan.

126
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,220
How are you feeling today?

127
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,370
Pretty good.

128
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,990
Me too.

129
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,120
My hip is sore.

130
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,050
It's okay.

131
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,070
The doctor will check up on you soon.

132
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,140
Let me take your temperature first.

133
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,550
It's normal.

134
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,310
It's normal.

135
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,810
Have a rest first.

136
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,000
What's that?

137
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,540
Is it insulin?

138
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,700
No.

139
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,100
Could it be heroin?

140
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,320
Nonsense.

141
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,150
This is oxytocin.

142
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,230
You're using oxytocin.

143
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,370
You can't do that.

144
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,530
If I stay here

145
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,850
for another three days,

146
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,540
and the uterine contraction begins, I'm lucky.

147
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,610
If it doesn't begin,

148
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,510
in the end,

149
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,470
they will still administer oxytocin to me.

150
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,060
It's a waste of time.

151
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,670
I got some

152
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,460
from a private hospital.

153
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,140
I'll inject it on my own.

154
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,409
When the contractions begin,

155
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,430
they have to deliver my baby.

156
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,210
Will it be dangerous?

157
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,659
The dosage is written clearly.

158
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,820
It won't be dangerous.

159
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,010
See?

160
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,230
This is about taking control of

161
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,190
your own fate.

162
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,890
She's crazy.

163
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,600
Don't imitate her.

164
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,270
Here.

165
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,750
Did he give me

166
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,280
counterfeit medicine?

167
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,050
Why is there no response?

168
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,180
Anything changed?

169
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,740
No.

170
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,250
This bastard

171
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,310
must be afraid of getting into trouble,

172
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,220
and gave me counterfeit medicine.

173
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,470
Don't you know the director?

174
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,330
Why don’t you find him?

175
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,200
My husband is a friend of Director Tian.

176
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,870
But Director Tian

177
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,940
told me to listen to front-line doctors.

178
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,920
So,

179
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,060
you do have a husband?

180
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,020
Of course.

181
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,460
Why didn't he visit you?

182
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,840
I'm very healthy. I don't need his company.

183
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,470
When we got married,

184
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,330
we already made a deal.

185
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,450
We can't let family affairs

186
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,900
affect our careers.

187
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,050
When I was hospitalized,

188
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,700
his company got purchased.

189
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,140
They offered a good price.

190
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,350
During this time,

191
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,460
if he stays with me,

192
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,370
and doesn't go to negotiate,

193
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,549
he'll miss the optimal negotiation time.

194
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,909
We need to understand and support each other.

195
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,679
This is a win-win marriage.

196
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:41,700
Your

197
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,580
traditional marriage

198
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,260
doesn't suit me.

199
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,540
But

200
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,350
it's not a family matter.

201
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,030
We're having a baby.

202
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,660
So what?

203
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,320
It hurts!

204
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,470
You're having contractions.

205
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,390
It hurts so bad!

206
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,540
I'll call a doctor.

207
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,710
It hurts!

208
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,650
Are you okay?

209
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,500
It hurts!

210
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,460
What's wrong?

211
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,900
Her stomach hurts.

212
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,700
It hurts so bad!

213
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,760
Did the contractions start?

214
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,110
Here.

215
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,770
Be careful.

216
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,980
She injected herself with oxytocin.

217
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,260
-Stop. -What?

218
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,910
You said

219
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,530
to tell the doctor the truth.

220
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,830
Where did you get the oxytocin?

221
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,130
I heard it was from a private hospital.

222
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,050
Nonsense.

223
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,040
When will you

224
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,670
tell the doctor the truth?

225
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,730
The bed is here.

226
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,160
It hurts!

227
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,400
Get up.

228
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,160
Slowly.

229
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,180
It hurts.

230
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:48,960
Be careful.

231
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,520
Lie down.

232
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,710
Head to the operating room.

233
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,010
It hurts so bad.

234
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,250
Baby.

235
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,730
Why are you coming out now?

236
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,390
I haven't told the doctor

237
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,620
the truth.

238
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,880
I don't want a C-section.

239
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,620
I want natural birth.

240
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,110
The overly excessive uterine contraction

241
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,620
has caused the pre rupture of the uterus.

242
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,480
Natural childbirth is impossible.

243
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,280
No way.

244
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,980
I used it according to the dosage.

245
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,220
Who told you oxytocin

246
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,060
is administered by intramuscular injection?

247
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,280
Were you crazy?

248
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,150
Given your current condition,

249
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,100
you must undergo surgery immediately.

250
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,140
Your husband has signed

251
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:39,780
the consent form.

252
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,880
I'll anesthetize you now.

253
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,870
No!

254
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,540
Harder!

255
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,870
Harder!

256
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,700
Yes. Good.

257
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,280
Harder.

258
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,190
Breathe.

259
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,770
Use your contractions.

260
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,420
Use your strength regularly.

261
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,740
Come on.

262
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,680
It's okay. Let's do it again.

263
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,720
One more time.

264
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,380
Harder!

265
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,950
-Harder. -She can't deliver naturally.

266
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,550
Doctor.

267
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,350
Don't deliver the baby naturally.

268
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,030
The baby will be squeezed to death.

269
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,050
According to the rules of the labour ward,

270
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,850
there can only be one family member.

271
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,870
Please tell her

272
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,870
to wait outside.

273
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,390
Mom.

274
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,360
Wait outside.

275
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,040
Stop making a scene.

276
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,900
Son,

277
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,280
tell the doctor

278
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,220
that she really can't have a natural birth.

279
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,630
If the baby can't survive this time,

280
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,630
I don't want to

281
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,420
live anymore.

282
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,110
I know, mom.

283
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,990
I'll tell the doctor later.

284
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,900
It's okay.

285
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,710
Tell the doctor.

286
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,000
Sorry, doctor.

287
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,170
My mother-in-law is too anxious.

288
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,840
Normally,

289
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,810
the fetus is in good condition.

290
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,890
You're undergoing natural childbirth.

291
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,790
The pediatrician

292
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,810
doesn't need to be here.

293
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,630
But

294
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,470
I saw you were too worried.

295
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,230
I asked my husband

296
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:47,990
to be here.

297
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,120
Don't worry.

298
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,050
He saved many children.

299
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,000
He will do his best

300
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,900
to save your child.

301
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,320
Let's do it again, okay?

302
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,250
What's wrong?

303
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,780
Is it too painful?

304
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,270
Don't waste your energy

305
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,630
on crying.

306
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,210
I'm sorry, Dr. Wu.

307
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,130
You're such a nice person.

308
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,230
You want to save my child.

309
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,960
Actually, not only I had two babies

310
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,430
who died after birth,

311
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,630
I also had two miscarriages.

312
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,180
I didn't tell you.

313
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
If it's a genetic disease,

314
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,300
it's not only about two babies dying,

315
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,370
it's possible that recurrent miscarriage happens.

316
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,430
Honey.

317
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,100
I got it.

318
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,510
I asked them

319
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,020
for an incubator.

320
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,720
Okay, the baby's here.

321
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,330
Don't worry.

322
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,380
3,200 grams.

323
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,830
Doctor.

324
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,630
How's the baby?

325
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,090
Congratulations, you have a son.

326
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,750
3,200 grams.

327
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,590
Now,

328
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,390
we suspect that

329
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,940
the baby has a genomic imprinting disorder.

330
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,950
So we need to send him

331
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,140
to the pediatrics for observation.

332
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,190
There's no need.

333
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,430
He's already crying.

334
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,420
What do you mean no need?

335
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,190
It's because

336
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,340
you refused to take a genetic compatibility test,

337
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,230
your wife suffered

338
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,420
again and again.

339
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,950
You will do whatever I say now.

340
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,700
Shut your mouth!

341
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,500
Go!

342
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,610
Doctor.

343
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,180
I beg you.

344
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,890
Please save my child.

345
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,700
Honey, you're awake.

346
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,490
How's the baby?

347
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,180
I'm really afraid when you wake up,

348
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,270
you first

349
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,330
ask about the company.

350
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,210
Don't worry.

351
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,560
The baby's in good condition

352
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,060
and strong.

353
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,290
It's not like I don't love the baby.

354
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,630
The company?

355
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,020
Your chairman

356
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,010
called me.

357
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,240
He asked the vice president

358
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,320
to take up your work.

359
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,270
You should rest and recover.

360
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,300
That guy...

361
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,150
He had his eyes on the role.

362
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,100
I've been working hard for a year.

363
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,430
I still lost the role.

364
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,030
But your chairman also said

365
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,210
when you would be discharged,

366
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,880
after the postpartum confinement

367
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,110
and recovery,

368
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,180
he would send you to expand the overseas market.

369
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,840
Didn't you always want to

370
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,780
work abroad?

371
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,130
Really?

372
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:37,410
Yes.

373
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,860
He said he'd keep the role

374
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,900
for you.

375
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,620
You don't need to worry.

376
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,630
Then...

377
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,230
What about you?

378
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,550
I...

379
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,530
I'll go with you.

380
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,620
The company

381
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,690
has been sold.

382
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,590
I have plenty of time now.

383
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,440
If you think pursuing a career

384
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,170
is your greatest happiness,

385
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,340
I've thought about it.

386
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,840
I'm willing to take care of our child at home.

387
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,680
To be living off you.

388
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,660
However,

389
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,640
if I don't do well,

390
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,790
don't turn your back on me.

391
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,990
Can I feed the baby?

392
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,100
The doctor said

393
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,180
the baby can't be breastfed now.

394
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,590
Honey,

395
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,190
there's another bad news.

396
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,520
I have to tell you.

397
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,830
Because you used

398
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,730
an overdose of oxytocin,

399
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,180
the excessive contraction

400
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,630
caused uterine rupture.

401
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,670
The bleeding was severe.

402
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,410
To save your life,

403
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,360
the doctor had to remove your uterus.

404
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,700
So,

405
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,380
you'll need to rely on antibiotics

406
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,980
for a long time

407
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,080
to prevent infection.

408
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,120
It's okay, honey.

409
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,180
This only child

410
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,870
is enough.

411
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,060
Don't be upset.

412
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,630
I'd better resign.

413
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,570
If I hadn't been too aggressive,

414
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,730
my baby would've at least

415
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,420
have breastmilk.

416
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,830
I feel so sorry for our child.

417
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,520
It's okay.

418
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,100
Let's not talk about this.

419
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,200
Let's talk tomorrow.

420
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,570
We'll talk about it after you recover.

421
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,700
Do you want to touch him?

422
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,530
Can I?

423
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,340
Sure.

424
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,050
So cute.

425
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:34,860
Honey,

426
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,980
are we worrying too much?

427
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,310
Such a healthy baby.

428
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,660
It has only been 12 hours.

429
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,660
If the baby

430
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,820
really has a genomic imprinting disorder,

431
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,080
based on my research,

432
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,860
the baby may still die after a week.

433
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,260
All right, I'm here.

434
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:46,990
You can go back.

435
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,900
I don't want to go back.

436
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,720
I can only think about Chen Ping's crying

437
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,680
when I go back.

438
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,930
Even if you stay here,

439
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,300
you can't stay here for long.

440
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,120
You might as well go back.

441
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,610
Let's go.

442
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,930
I'll wait outside then.

443
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,220
There's no need.

444
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,960
Besides, the longer

445
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,820
you stay with him,

446
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,540
the more frustrated you'll be

447
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,540
if anything happens to him.

448
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,630
Go.

449
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,390
If you don't leave,

450
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
I'll ask the security to take you away.

451
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,819
Shortness of breath. He needs emergency treatment.

452
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,720
Leave now.

453
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,960
Heart rate lowering. Breathing weakening.

454
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,589
Resuscitation immediately.

455
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,440
CPR.

456
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,940
One, two, three.

457
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,740
One, two, three.

458
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,970
One, two, three.

459
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,260
One, two, three.

460
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,780
Intubation.

461
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,220
Access the vein.

462
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,380
One, two, three.

463
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,070
Adrenaline.

464
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,370
Adrenaline administered.

465
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,340
BP dropping. BP dropping.

466
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,260
Vitals lost.

467
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,350
The patient died.

468
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,030
That's all

469
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,770
for the Gynecology Department.

470
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,070
As for Obstetrics Department,

471
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,990
three caesarean section operations were performed.

472
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,940
One of them was excessive uterine contraction

473
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,990
due to oxytocin.

474
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,220
Uterine rupture. Postpartum bleeding.

475
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,050
In the end, we couldn't keep the uterus,

476
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,620
and performed a hysterectomy.

477
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,650
I know that.

478
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,670
The patient got oxytocin

479
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,900
from a private hospital.

480
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,310
And the improper injection

481
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,510
caused uterine rupture.

482
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,410
Who's the doctor in charge?

483
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,250
It's me.

484
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,890
If the doctor in charge

485
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,310
realized that the patient

486
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,990
had a strong will to give birth,

487
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,740
the doctor should communicate with her

488
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,150
in a detailed manner.

489
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,700
If you were more careful,

490
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,250
and knew more about

491
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,310
the patient's personality and

492
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,460
emotions,

493
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,630
this type of event could've be avoided.

494
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,820
Learn your lesson.

495
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,420
Yes.

496
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,180
Dr. Huang, please continue.

497
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,950
As for the other two cases,

498
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,870
caesarean sections were normal.

499
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,350
Ten patients had natural childbirth.

500
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,890
Nine babies were in normal condition.

501
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,820
What about the other one?

502
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,140
As for the other patient,

503
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,970
she previously had two babies.

504
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,110
They all died within twelve hours

505
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,660
after birth.

506
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,340
This patient also admitted

507
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,230
she had two miscarriage before.

508
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,630
We suspect

509
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,800
she has a genomic imprinting disease.

510
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,300
The couple

511
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,880
agreed to do a genetic compatibility test.

512
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,460
The pediatrics

513
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
is carrying out an autopsy.

514
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,460
This report

515
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,930
will be ready in a couple days.

516
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,070
Dr. Wu discussed with me

517
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,260
about this matter.

518
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,070
From a medical point of view,

519
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,540
our treatment

520
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,250
didn't have any problem.

521
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,630
Dr. Wu's judgment was also timely.

522
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,900
Unfortunately,

523
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,770
her family didn't take it seriously.

524
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,770
It's my fault.

525
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,900
If I had convinced her family

526
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,300
to do the genetic test,

527
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:11,980
maybe...

528
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You still couldn't save him.

529
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,690
Don't blame yourself.

530
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,070
If we stopped her before she got pregnant,

531
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,510
we might be able to prevent

532
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,130
this tragedy.

533
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,880
There's nothing we can do now.

534
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,880
Congrui, as a doctor,

535
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,500
especially as a gynecologist,

536
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,810
we have to bear in mind that

537
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,800
we shouldn't be proud of achievements.

538
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,170
We should also respect failures.

539
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,510
What we can do is

540
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,110
to put in all our efforts.

541
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,940
Are you clear?

542
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,380
Dr. Huang is right.

543
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,880
Dr. Wu

544
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,900
did very well.

545
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,420
She was attention to details at work.

546
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,520
As a reward,

547
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,770
I will operate the first surgical delivery

548
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,340
of a HIV patient's baby

549
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,800
at our hospital tomorrow.

550
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,080
You can be my assistant.

551
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,180
-Great. -No, she can't.

552
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,720
Why not?

553
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,680
She...

554
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,860
She's not capable enough.

555
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,810
I'm afraid she can't handle it.

556
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,750
I can.

557
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,220
No.

558
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,270
You can't go.

559
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,390
This is a great chance.

560
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,020
I must go.

561
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,010
Du Di,

562
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,890
are you also interested in

563
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,750
this opportunity?

564
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
OK. You two can join.

565
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,150
But Director Tian...

566
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,080
That’s all for today.

567
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:10,610
Dismiss.

568
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,380
I can go.

569
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,690
We'll listen to the director.

570
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,520
Let's go home.

571
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:17,820
OK.

572
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,420
What are you doing?

573
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,020
You've gone too far.

574
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,360
How could you do this?

575
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,550
Why are you so angry?

576
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,460
Do you know

577
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,400
I have translated materials

578
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,630
for Director Tian for a month

579
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,070
just for this opportunity?

580
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,260
This surgery needs two assistants.

581
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,220
If you are one of them,

582
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,430
it means I don't have a chance.

583
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,500
Do you understand?

584
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,480
I really didn’t know.

585
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,710
I'll ask Director Tian

586
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,950
to replace Wu Congrui with you.

587
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,070
She's not suitable to participate anyway.

588
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,190
Are you crazy?

589
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,980
Are you out of your mind

590
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,080
for this job?

591
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:52,950
This opportunity is rewarded by Director Tian

592
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,550
for Wu Congrui.

593
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,230
Can’t you give up this chance

594
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,180
and let me participate?

595
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:56,810
No.

596
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,130
I really didn't expect that.

597
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,990
I thought

598
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,160
you only despised love.

599
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,040
I didn't expect you to neglect friendship.

600
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,700
By the way,

601
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,300
you don't have a family.

602
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,380
Now you family don't acknowledge you.

603
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,640
Aren't you afraid

604
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,440
you'll end up alone?

605
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,110
Li Junxiao.

606
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,940
I wanted to talk to you yesterday

607
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,660
because there was a moment

608
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,860
I thought maybe

609
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,060
communication can allow us

610
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,690
to understand

611
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,580
and support each other.

612
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,680
But now I realize I was wrong.

613
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,070
I didn't want Wu Congrui

614
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,830
to participate in this operation

615
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,940
because she was pregnant.

616
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,520
She didn't tell everyone.

617
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,150
How could I let a pregnant mother

618
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,340
participate in such a dangerous surgery?

619
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,180
Am I that despicable

620
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,260
in your eyes?

621
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,740
Aren't I?

622
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,180
Hello, sister.

623
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,470
I...

624
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,720
I broke up with Du Di.

625
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:16,860
Let's go.

626
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,420
Let's go home.

627
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,460
I want a divorce.

628
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,740
Stop messing around.

629
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,900
What divorce?

630
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,170
Let's go home.

631
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,840
I'm not messing around.

632
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,420
I don't want to have babies anymore.

633
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,290
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

634
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,060
Let's get a divorce.

635
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,560
I think it's good for everyone.

636
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,250
We won't have another baby.

637
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,270
If God doesn't want

638
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,570
us to have compatible genes,

639
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,560
and a healthy child.

640
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Then let's not have any babies.

641
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,080
Just the two of us

642
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,790
can spend the rest of our lives together.

643
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,780
It's good enough.

644
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,180
But mother...

645
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,020
Your mother...

646
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,530
I won't listen to her.

647
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,180
I'm already 40.

648
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,860
I can be a responsible man.

649
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,420
Honey.

650
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,250
But I want to have a child.

651
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,530
We are so close.

652
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,140
If we had a child,

653
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,870
we would be so happy.

654
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,100
Why didn't God

655
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,060
make our genes compatible?

656
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,500
Don't be too stressed.

657
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,180
I've figured it out.

658
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,170
I feel complete with you.

659
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,740
When I retire,

660
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,650
let's go travelling.

661
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,740
Didn't you always want to go to Yunnan

662
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,120
and Xinjiang?

663
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,760
I'll take you there.

664
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:09,940
What's wrong?

665
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,140
What's wrong?

666
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,890
Dr. Wu, we're okay.

667
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,980
Don't cry.

668
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,270
If we have the result,

669
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,340
I will give it to you

670
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,340
as soon as possible.

671
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,780
Dr. Wu,

672
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,620
if we really have

673
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,900
a genomic imprinting disease,

674
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,610
am I unable to

675
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,020
have children for the rest of my life?

676
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,730
The genomic imprinting disease

677
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,600
is known as the

678
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,000
Schaaf-Yang Syndrome.

679
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,910
It is a rare genetic disorder where

680
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,780
imprinted genes cause pathological variation.

681
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,830
But for now,

682
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,150
we just suspect that

683
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,700
it's a genomic imprinting disease.

684
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,110
We cannot confirm

685
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,560
you have the disease.

686
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,260
Because the diagnosis

687
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,570
of a genomic imprinting disease

688
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,460
is very complicated.

689
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,650
Even if unfortunately you're diagnosed with it,

690
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,440
in fact,

691
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,550
you don't need to worry too much.

692
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,710
Because in 2016,

693
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,210
there was a confirmed case in Shanghai.

694
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,030
Experts used

695
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,700
preimplantation genetic screening

696
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,130
to prevent this disease.

697
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,340
Really?

698
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,850
Can we really prevent it?

699
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,660
When we get the results of the diagnosis,

700
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,160
if you still want to have a baby,

701
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,230
Director Tian will book a consultation

702
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,100
with the experts in this field

703
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,080
for you.

704
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,580
I believe your next baby

705
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,760
will be very healthy.

706
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,300
We won't have any babies.

707
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,700
Honey.

708
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,300
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

709
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,060
Honey,

710
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,620
I've been pregnant so many times.

711
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,660
It's not all because of mother.

712
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,930
I really want

713
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,290
a child of our own.

714
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,080
Let's try again.

715
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,610
I promise

716
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,310
I’ll do exercise

717
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,530
to become as strong

718
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,100
as Yuan Ya,

719
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,850
OK?

720
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,540
Remember,

721
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,550
you must wear protective equipment.

722
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,170
Don't get blood stained.

723
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,310
When something goes wrong,

724
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,940
step back first.

725
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,060
Are you kidding?

726
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,310
If something goes wrong,

727
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,530
I have to step forward.

728
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,760
This is a doctor's natural instinct.

729
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,790
I just want to remind you

730
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,540
to control your instinct.

731
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,460
For the sake of the baby.

732
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,250
Okay, I got it.

733
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,810
The patient has a special condition.

734
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,100
Stage four HIV.

735
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,620
And her lungs...

736
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,820
The director of the Respiratory Department,

737
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,750
the surgeon director,

738
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,090
and the directors of Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

739
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,460
Three directors.

740
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,510
It's a big deal.

741
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,720
The stage four of HIV.

742
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,980
With a severe disease

743
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,160
and severe lung infection,

744
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,250
we don't even know

745
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:32,950
if she can get out alive.

746
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,900
Remember,

747
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,470
no matter what happens,

748
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,040
step back first.

749
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,940
Fine, got it.

750
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,650
Hurry. It's about to start.

751
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,050
Hurry.

752
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,930
Ready.

753
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:40,940
Keep it in mind.

754
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,020
This is a rare opportunity.

755
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,170
Is the Anesthesiology Department ready?

756
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,580
Yes.

757
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,740
The pediatrics stand in to save the newborn.

758
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:50,970
The operation begins.

759
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,620
The operation starts at 8:57 p.m.

760
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,100
This patient

761
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,090
knew she had HIV.

762
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,540
After she got pregnant,

763
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,650
she refused to do check-ups

764
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,780
and kept hiding.

765
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,870
She came to the Emergency Department

766
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,730
only when her fever wasn't brought down.

767
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,860
She should've been transferred to

768
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,660
the hospital for infectious diseases.

769
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,710
But she was in critical condition.

770
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,020
After stabilizing her vitals,

771
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,350
we had to perform the operation immediately.

772
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,800
Pregnancy with HIV.

773
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,460
In the early stage of pregnancy,

774
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,130
the patient needs to take prevention drugs.

775
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,870
During the delivery,

776
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,050
it's not very difficult.

777
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,890
It's like any other caesarean section.

778
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,150
But her HIV

779
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,030
is in the fourth stage.

780
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,710
Now she has contracted

781
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,730
severe bacterial pneumonia.

782
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,860
The Respiratory, Surgical, Anesthesiology Department

783
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,110
conducted a joint consultation

784
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,720
and decided to carry out the operation.

785
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,030
As you can see,

786
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,420
both directors are here.

787
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,790
It's hard to predict what will happen

788
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,540
during the surgery.

789
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,410
You must stay protected.

790
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,390
Blood suction. Intubate the patient.

791
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,900
Director, it's impossible to suction all.

792
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,500
BP is dropping rapidly.

793
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,900
The infection caused

794
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,540
vasculitis in the abdomen,

795
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,800
resulting in bleeding in the great vessels.

796
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,740
Open her chest.

797
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,700
Congrui, careful.

798
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:40,940
Du Di.

799
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,180
What are you doing?

800
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,740
She's pregnant.

801
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:58,800
Congrui.

802
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,920
It's fine.

803
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,730
There's not much bleeding.

804
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,970
Dilation and curettage is done.

805
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,380
Dr. Huang.

806
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,890
Little gourd.

807
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,090
Don’t go.

808
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,610
Give her some time.

809
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,730
After all,

810
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,470
she wanted a baby for so long.

811
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,280
She can't take it all of a sudden.

812
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,950
Her body...

813
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,370
It's fine.

814
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,060
Director Huang performed a dilation and curettage.

815
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,310
Although there was a little bleeding,

816
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,780
it was within normal range.

817
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,150
She'll be discharged tomorrow.

818
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:51,900
I'm sorry.

819
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,840
I didn't mean it.

820
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,700
Congrui should understand.

821
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,600
Given her current condition,

822
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,080
she needs a good rest.

823
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,020
Don't worry.

824
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:06,910
Her mother has bought

825
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,330
a complete set of items for confinement month.

826
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,040
I think she will

827
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,710
have a good rest.

828
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:12,940
Okay.

829
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,690
Take good care of her.

830
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:46,860
Congrui.

831
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,300
I know you're frustrated.

832
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,780
But as a doctor,

833
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,490
especially a gynecologist,

834
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,080
you should know

835
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,140
there are many reasons

836
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,810
to cause miscarriages.

837
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,250
If it was a healthy fetus,

838
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,590
you wouldn't have a miscarriage

839
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,100
just because Du Di pushed you.

840
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:06,640
Right?

841
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,550
What do you mean?

842
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,970
You mean my baby is gone

843
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,080
because he was not healthy.

844
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,200
Miscarriage

845
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,930
sometimes suggests

846
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,740
a natural selection.

847
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,660
The mother will choose to eliminate

848
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,160
the baby with chromosome abnormalities.

849
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,400
Feng Yuanhang.

850
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,740
Our child is gone.

851
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,510
We could've met him

852
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,020
eight months later.

853
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,520
But now he's gone.

854
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,320
How can you be so calm?

855
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,150
Congrui.

856
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,990
Don't be sad.

857
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,340
We are doctors.

858
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,750
Being calm and objective

859
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,310
is what a doctor should be.

860
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,480
I'm a doctor

861
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,100
but first I'm a mother.

862
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,020
Aren't doctors also human?

863
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:25,840
Hello?

864
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,159
Okay, I got it.

865
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,120
A newborn baby is infected.

866
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,320
I have to get there now.

867
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:34,880
Take a rest.

868
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,500
Call the nurse if you need anything.

869
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,940
Honey, are you going to leave me alone?

870
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,179
Take a rest.

871
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,530
I'll come to see you when I'm done.

872
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,159
OK?

873
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,150
You...

874
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,710
Wait for me.

875
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,790
Are you really leaving me alone?

876
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,889
Don't you care about me anymore?

877
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,820
Happy birthday.

878
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,430
My dear best friend.

879
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,130
I know it's not entirely Du Di's fault.

880
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,100
But my child is gone.

881
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,710
Who can I blame?

882
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,650
Little gourd.

883
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,210
I love you.

884
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,280
Hurry up.

885
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,290
The director only comes for ward round once a week.

886
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,410
Don't make any mistakes.

887
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,690
Put all these away.

888
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,820
That's enough.

889
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,380
Where is the shift schedule?

890
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,610
Careful.

891
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,670
You did it on purpose.

892
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,170
To get a promotion,

893
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,600
you even harmed your best friend.

894
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,620
I thought

895
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,350
such a cruel plot

896
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,560
could only be fabricated.

897
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,030
I haven't returned to the hospital for years.

898
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,020
The competition is really fierce.

899
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:20,850
They know their games.

900
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,510
Luckily,

901
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,580
I'll go back after the standardized training.

902
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,530
You two are doctor trainees.

903
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,390
You should learn

904
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,130
to help and support each other.

905
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:26,940
If you are too selfish,

906
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,070
you'll become a street rat.

907
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,780
How are you?

908
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,510
It has been hurting for a whole day.

909
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,630
I'm only 1cm dilated.

910
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,270
It's normal.

911
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,510
Leave it for observation first.

912
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,530
If the labour takes too long,

913
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,290
you can administer some oxytocin.

914
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,620
Okay, I can wait.

915
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,580
This has two loops of nuchal cords.

916
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,620
Contractions just started causing irregular fetal heartbeat.

917
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,860
Caesarean section is needed.

918
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,200
You're in charge of this ward?

919
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,680
Yes.

920
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,530
Then I don't need to ask much.

921
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,260
I'll cook something delicious for you.

922
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,170
The director is here for ward round.

923
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,020
The director is here.

924
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,480
Doctor.

925
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,300
Most of the patients in this ward

926
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,580
had underwent caesarean section before.

927
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,570
Their conditions are all different.

928
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,880
What are the details?

929
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,030
Bed 27 underwent the operation three days ago.

930
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,310
The abdominal fat was too thick

931
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,660
which caused the wound

932
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,160
to heal poorly.

933
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:54,820
It had a bit exudate.

934
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,670
We're going to perform drainage today.

935
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,540
Bed 38.

936
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,300
Uterus scarring. Placenta praevia

937
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,240
covering the cervical canal.

938
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,700
Caesarean section will be performed tomorrow.

939
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:03,810
Bed 39

940
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,100
has been pregnant for 29 weeks.

941
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,830
The position of placenta is fine,

942
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,580
but it doesn't completely cover the cervical canal.

943
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,490
However it's only been a year and a half

944
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,480
since her last C-section.

945
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,050
The scarred uterus was very thin.

946
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,660
When she was hospitalized,

947
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,580
the minimum thickness from the ultrasound check-up

948
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,510
was only 1mm.

949
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,430
In addition,

950
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,890
the placenta is in the front of the uterus.

951
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,190
It was implanted in the scarred uterus.

952
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,410
We're monitoring her closely

953
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,110
every day.

954
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,760
I hope we can extend

955
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,950
the fetus's time in the uterus.

956
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,190
Bed 4041 and 4042

957
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,860
both have pernicious placenta previa

958
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,890
with placenta accreta.

959
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,780
Placenta accreta?

960
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,770
Three cases.

961
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,780
That's why

962
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,600
we need to reduce

963
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,630
the number of caesarean sections.

964
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,850
From 2000

965
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,790
to 2008,

966
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,370
three countries

967
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,360
with the highest C-section rate in the world

968
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,750
were Dominica, Brazil,

969
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,340
and China.

970
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,920
Until 2018,

971
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,210
the caesarean section rate in China

972
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,920
still remained at 36.7 percent.

973
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,340
The World Health Organization

974
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,680
set the limit

975
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
for caesarean section rate

976
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,920
to 15 percent.

977
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,960
As the two-child policy was announced,

978
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,950
our biggest challenge is

979
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,100
women at advanced maternal age

980
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,690
and high-risk pregnancy.

981
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,260
High caesarean section rates

982
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,140
caused risks at various levels.

983
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,210
Placenta praevia.

984
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:11,750
Back then,

985
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,020
when I was a resident,

986
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,380
we only had one or two such patients

987
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,090
every year.

988
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,530
But at the Obstetrics Department now,

989
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,950
if you don't see this type of patient for one day.

990
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,870
it'll be strange.

991
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:22,900
Doctor.

992
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,340
Risks.

993
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,980
Does it mean dangerous?

994
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,340
Will my mom's life

995
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,270
be at risk?

996
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,550
Don't be nervous, kid.

997
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,690
This term

998
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,320
sounds very scary.

999
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,220
But

1000
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,420
this lady,

1001
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,400
Dr. Huang,

1002
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,420
specializes in treating this disease.

1003
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,490
She has never failed

1004
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,710
in surgery.

1005
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,910
Why isn't your father

1006
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,780
here?

1007
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,310
My dad is working.

1008
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,670
He said he would come on the day of birth.

1009
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,300
Du Di, are you responsible for this bed?

1010
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,330
Director Tian,

1011
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,470
Wu Congrui has been

1012
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,340
responsible for this bed.

1013
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,750
Isn't Dr. Wu

1014
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,860
on leave for a month?

1015
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,020
Let Du Di take care of it.

1016
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,220
Director Tian,

1017
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,980
let me take care of the bed.

1018
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,620
I worry that Du Di

1019
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,730
is too busy

1020
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,400
to handle it.

1021
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,460
Junxiao.

1022
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,870
If Du Di is too busy,

1023
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,060
you'll be even busier.

1024
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,590
You're an attending physician

1025
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,830
acting as the chief resident now.

1026
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,810
Why would you be in charge of the ward?

1027
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,280
Isn't that the resident's job?

1028
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,230
Head Nurse,

1029
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,930
since Junxiao said

1030
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,100
he has the energy

1031
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,160
to share the burden,

1032
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,870
we should believe

1033
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,760
he has the ability.

1034
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,670
He can do it.

1035
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,760
Okay, I'll inform the nurse.

1036
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,070
Alright.

1037
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,440
Junxiao,

1038
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,270
you're in charge.

1039
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,270
Thank you, Director Tian.

1040
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:37,850
Let’s go.

1041
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:42,980
Uncle.

1042
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,500
From now on, are you going to take care of my mom?

1043
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,730
Just call me Dr. Li.

1044
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,700
Hello, Dr. Li.

1045
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,260
My surname is Li too.

1046
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,750
My name is Li Huandi.

1047
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,710
Hello, Li Haundi.

1048
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,950
Turn her around.

1049
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,070
Let me help you.

1050
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,820
Do you feel scared

1051
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,410
when you take care of your mom by yourself?

1052
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,130
It's okay.

1053
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,340
From now on,

1054
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,020
I will take care of mom with you.

1055
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,110
Don't worry.

1056
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:26,900
I disagree.

1057
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,240
You have to agree.

1058
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,310
Wu Congrui was just pregnant.

1059
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,320
How could you directly deprive of

1060
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,500
her chance to be the chief resident?

1061
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,440
Besides, she had a miscarriage.

1062
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,150
She had a miscarriage this time.

1063
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:35,900
What about next time?

1064
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,350
Don't blame me for being direct.

1065
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,320
From the hiring perspective

1066
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,340
of our department,

1067
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,490
she is planning to have a baby.

1068
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,660
Pregnancy

1069
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,050
takes a long time.

1070
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,300
It cannot be compatible with

1071
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,850
being chief resident of the hospital.

1072
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,580
You should know this better than me.

1073
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,620
I think we should wait

1074
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,390
until she gives birth.

1075
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,260
I'll think about

1076
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,970
whether she can be the chief resident.

1077
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,260
In a short period of time,

1078
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,490
she won't be pregnant again.

1079
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,850
I promise you.

1080
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,590
Promise me.

1081
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,580
It's up to them.

1082
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,900
How can you promise me that?

1083
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,450
I know

1084
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,860
Wu Congrui is your student.

1085
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,680
You can't be too biased.

1086
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,120
Du Di, you can see

1087
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,100
how hard

1088
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,300
she worked.

1089
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,980
No matter if she was responsible for the ward,

1090
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,840
she was able to memorize

1091
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,300
all the medical records.

1092
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,590
Is Wu Congrui that good?

1093
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,180
Wu Congrui is skilled at

1094
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,100
communicating with superiors and subordinates

1095
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,490
and all types of people.

1096
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,800
After two years of standardized training,

1097
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,800
her professional skills has been improving.

1098
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,830
What about Du Di?

1099
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,710
Her communication skills never changed.

1100
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,880
If you ask me

1101
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,890
who is more likely

1102
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,290
to be the chief resident next year?

1103
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,360
I think

1104
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,540
Wu Congrui is more capable than Du Di.

1105
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,270
Fine.

1106
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,080
Considering

1107
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,140
what you said,

1108
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,790
I'll give Wu Congrui

1109
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,510
another chance.

1110
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,620
But I have to

1111
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,500
make it clear.

1112
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,170
This is the critical time

1113
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,560
for our department to obtain more wards.

1114
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,520
You Zhenghua was lying on the hospital bed

1115
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,120
while being in charge of the work in the department.

1116
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,630
He didn't rest for a second.

1117
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,670
He also received

1118
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,680
a national scientific research project.

1119
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,570
We can't

1120
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,780
make any mistakes here.

1121
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,700
You guarantee for Wu Congrui this time.

1122
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,260
If it happens again,

1123
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,190
I won’t let it slide.

1124
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,630
Thank you, Director Tian.
