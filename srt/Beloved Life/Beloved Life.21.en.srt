[Beloved Life]

[Episode 21]

4
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,900
It contains some cases

5
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,460
about early and late interventions

6
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,820
in perinatal depression

7
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,300
and comparisons in maternal recovery.

8
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,789
This is great.

9
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,070
It will just provide a theoretical basis

10
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,160
for what I'm doing.

11
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,100
He also said

12
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,680
he'd like to invite you

13
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,039
to be the corresponding author

14
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,920
and finish this paper with him.

15
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,650
This will surely work.

16
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,470
I can gather some cases

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,710
from the obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

18
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,539
Or based on his research direction,

19
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,720
I can persuade some pregnant or parturient women

20
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,940
to accept early interventions

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,990
so as to provide more concrete evidence

22
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,260
for his research.

23
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,900
Do you want to join us?

24
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,169
I'm not interested in this.

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,460
What I'm interested in is oncology.

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,930
Cutting tumors and saving lives

27
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,890
are more hardcore than this.

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,610
Do you think there is

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,050
perinatal depression combined

30
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,450
with gynecological tumors

31
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,560
so we can work together

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,900
and be invincible?

33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,020
Perinatal depression

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,750
is unfortunate enough.

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,070
With gynecological tumors?

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,240
Are you a devil?

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,940
You're so nice to me.

38
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,050
Thank you.

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,550
I touched your arm?

40
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,260
No.

41
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,970
You touched my heart.

42
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,060
I wondered

43
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,790
why an inexperienced returnee

44
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,220
got along so well in Shengji.

45
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,690
It turns out that his father

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,840
is the director of the neurosurgery department.

47
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,940
How do you know about it?

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,940
It's no news in the hospital.

49
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,110
All resident staff

50
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
had a meeting this morning,

51
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,970
and your father admitted it himself.

52
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,060
Liu Nianbai!

53
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,300
Liu Nianbai!

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,900
Liu Nianbai.

55
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,060
Don't go.

56
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,290
Move.

57
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,590
What do you want?

58
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,900
I want to go ask Liu Zhenghua.

59
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,260
He never took me as his son

60
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,990
during the last 20 years

61
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,900
when I was abroad.

62
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,670
Now he admitted it

63
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,950
because I got in his way for promotion?

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,870
Are you crazy?

65
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,070
Do you want to make a fuss about it?

66
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,250
I don't want to make a fuss about it,

67
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,829
Lin Wei.

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,900
I didn't send the video.

69
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,180
Liu Zhenghua sent it himself.

70
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,300
It's him who wants to make a fuss.

71
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,770
I know you hate him,

73
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,690
but you can't slander him like this.

74
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,430
What is good

75
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,490
for him to post this video?

76
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,510
It only damages the reputation

77
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,300
he's built up for years.

78
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,190
It's either me or him

79
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,900
who sent this video.

80
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,790
I'll say it again,

81
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,110
I didn't do it.

82
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:00,950
As for his purpose,

83
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,490
why don't you go ask him?

84
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,620
Enough.

85
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,540
No matter what happened,

86
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,870
that's it, Nianbai.

87
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,090
Stop fighting with your dad.

88
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,940
Liu Nianbai,

89
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,390
you still have a lot of

90
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,260
important things to do,

91
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,110
and a lot of people

92
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,140
like your mother to save.

93
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,430
Stop fighting with your dad.

94
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,190
Go back.

95
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,180
Okay. I'll go.

96
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,910
Let him wait and see.

97
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,380
Was it Nianbai here?

98
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,720
He said he didn't send the video.

99
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,340
It wasn't him.

100
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,860
It was me.

101
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,940
Why did you…

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,260
...send this video?

103
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
I hate being threatened

104
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,020
by people.

105
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,420
Especially when this person

106
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,260
is my son.

107
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,170
Rather than waiting

108
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,460
for this ticking time bomb to explode,

109
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,310
I might as well

110
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,180
detonate it myself.

111
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,840
I did nothing wrong.

112
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,510
I'm not afraid of being investigated.

113
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,280
I sent this video

114
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,180
in order to clear the air

115
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,420
as soon as possible.

116
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,950
I understand, but…

117
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,980
In this way,

118
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,960
Nianbai's prejudice against you

119
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,660
will be deeper.

120
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,450
It doesn't matter.

121
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,800
I don't care.

122
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,190
I'm used to it anyway.

123
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,520
Dr. Tian,

124
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,610
I saw you enter the office.

125
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,900
Are you alright?

126
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,710
Come in.

127
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,620
The whole neuro department

128
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,660
is celebrating it.

129
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,710
What's there to celebrate

130
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,020
to be a vice president?

131
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,220
The neuro department

132
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,130
is so short-sighted.

133
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,520
There have been many academicians

134
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,610
and presidents in our department,

135
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,370
we never celebrated it.

136
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,660
Stop pretending it.

137
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,590
I know you feel bad.

138
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,400
I don't.

139
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,140
Say it to Director Zhang.

140
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,740
It's me and you who are talking.

141
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,980
What does it have to do with him?

142
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,340
Sorry.

143
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,460
I admit that

144
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,020
I was not happy

145
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,940
when you got in charge.

146
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,990
But in the past months,

147
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,920
I've watched you take pains working

148
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,380
for the department.

149
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,840
I feel guilty about it.

150
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,100
Maybe we wouldn't

151
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,100
have failed if I was

152
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,940
with you in the first place.

153
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,040
I thought

154
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,650
you are here to laugh at me.

155
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,610
We're all on the same boat,

156
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,090
how can I laugh at you?

157
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,500
All right.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Forget about it.

159
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,170
You did not become the vice president,

160
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,580
and we did not get beds,

161
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,830
but for you,

162
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,820
the director of our department

163
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,620
who has just taken office,

164
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,580
this is only

165
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,700
the first step in a long journey.

166
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,180
Now,

167
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,360
it's time to plan the second step.

168
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,460
The second step?

169
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,110
The Obstetric and Gynecologic Department

170
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,480
in Shengji is so famous

171
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,950
not only for its extraordinary

172
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,060
and famous doctors,

173
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,540
but also for the excellent history.

174
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,400
And there are many celebrities

175
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,480
who choose to give birth here.

176
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,710
In recent years,

177
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,100
under such a prestigious reputation,

178
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,100
countless leaders

179
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,520
care about internal strength

180
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,060
and the influence of the hospital.

181
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,640
But I think

182
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,180
it's more important to have

183
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,100
a bigger social influence.

184
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,650
Let me give you an example.

185
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,100
Shengji

186
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,140
is the most uncooperative hospital

187
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,820
with the media.

188
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,700
The whole marketing department is arrogant.

189
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,390
I heard with my own ears

190
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,380
that the marketing manager

191
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,780
tell the director of some

192
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,420
TV program that

193
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,580
Shengji needs no advertising.

194
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,830
He's right.

195
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,100
We don't need

196
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,980
any advertising.

197
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,720
You see,

198
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,980
this is the problem.

199
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,190
Shengji disdains publicity,

200
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,300
doesn't participate in competitions,

201
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,930
or holds inter-department

202
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,170
academic conferences.

203
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,420
Days ago when I was in the clinic,

204
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
two patients told me that they

205
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,850
wanted to transfer to Nanling Hospital.

206
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,299
I was surprised

207
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,500
and asked them why.

208
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,110
They told me that

209
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,909
the doctors at Nanling

210
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,860
are the most attentive in answering

211
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,059
online questions.

212
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,669
That makes them feel

213
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,580
that the doctors at Nanling

214
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,810
are also authoritative,

215
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,380
and easygoing.

216
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,050
You reminded me that

217
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,030
two days ago, I heard that

218
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,980
some private hospitals

219
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,480
were recruiting doctors from Nanling

220
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,330
with better wages than Shengji.

221
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,650
I thought it was a rumor.

222
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,140
So,

223
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,590
we have to go out

224
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,700
and make some social influence.

225
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,190
When you become famous,

226
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,030
no matter how they compete,

227
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,470
the leaders have to take public opinion

228
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,340
into consideration.

229
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,210
The older generation of leaders

230
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,920
and professors

231
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,420
dislike doctors

232
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,540
in front of cameras.

233
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,140
But I think

234
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,430
the time has changed.

235
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,900
We gotta find a new way.

236
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,940
I understand what you mean.

237
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,730
We sent very few people

238
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,060
to the OBG conference last year,

239
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,750
and made some reports

240
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,660
very simple.

241
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,950
Seems we have to

242
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,540
participate in more seminars this year.

243
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,130
Director Huang,

244
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,130
is there any profession-type competition?

245
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,670
Every year.

246
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,190
And debate or something.

247
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:41,780
Okay.

248
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,780
I will study on it

249
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,190
and see if there are any

250
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,660
new projects to be released this year.

251
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,830
And competitions

252
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,060
to participate and win.

253
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,620
And…

254
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,200
And what?

255
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,880
Dr. Huang,

256
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,550
you have to pay attention to talents

257
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,300
like Du Di and Wu Congrui.

258
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,980
In case there is a chance

259
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
for them to be the chief resident,

260
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,240
but they are not capable,

261
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,410
or that

262
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,380
one of them gets it,

263
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,190
and the other one

264
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,420
resigns.

265
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,260
All our efforts would go in vain.

266
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,100
I don't want the good students of Shengji

267
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,900
Medical College to work for other hospitals.

268
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,590
So Dr. Huang,

269
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
don't be partial.

270
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,190
Treat them equally.

271
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,390
How am I

272
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,780
being partial?

273
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,610
Besides,

274
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,760
no pressure means no motivation.

275
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,440
Dr. Huang,

276
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,900
you are about to give birth, aren't you?

277
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,180
The hard days of Shengji's

278
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,780
Obstetric and Gynecologic Department

279
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
have just begun.

280
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,020
We have to go through it together.

281
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,820
Please.

282
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,950
The competition content

283
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,150
at OBG

284
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,070
conference

285
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,340
includes suture, interrogation

286
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,030
and placental separation.

287
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,140
Of course,

288
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,950
this is also an important indicator

289
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,320
to see who gets promoted first.

290
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,740
In order to make you progress faster,

291
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,760
I've decided

292
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,010
to let you work in the

293
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,980
oncology ward in advance.

294
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,740
Really?

295
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,920
When do we start?

296
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,820
I will select a suitable patient

297
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,780
and let you participate

298
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,820
in her entire treatment process

299
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,670
to prepare for the competition.

300
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,710
It should be these two days.

301
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,050
You go and check

302
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,670
how many patients

303
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,380
in the maternity ward

304
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,210
are under your duty.

305
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,950
And then report to me.

306
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,140
I'll coordinate the work.

307
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,130
Okay, I'll go right away.

308
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,460
What now?

309
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,740
Director Huang,

310
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,100
I will do

311
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,220
my best this time

312
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,230
and will not disappoint you anymore.

313
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,750
I was worried

314
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,970
that you would back off.

315
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,180
I'm about to give birth.

316
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,450
I can't help you for too long.

317
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,660
If you have

318
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,100
the resolution to compete

319
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,300
for chief resident,

320
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,670
you have to try your best

321
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,690
whole-heartedly.

322
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,230
Understand?

323
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,940
You've helped me

324
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,780
too much.

325
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,140
Next,

326
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,180
I'll show you what I can do.

327
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,520
We're finally here.

328
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,870
What?

329
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,650
Why are you

330
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,420
here alone?

331
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm cold.

332
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,700
You have a fever?

333
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,980
No.

334
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,400
I just came out of the oncology ward.

335
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,270
You have taken shifts

336
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,340
in the oncology ward?

337
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,190
This should be the last ward

338
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,100
for your duty shifts.

339
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,040
You are scared?

340
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,900
I really don't like it there.

341
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,860
So depressing.

342
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,980
So cold.

343
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,460
Especially the wards

344
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,020
for patients with advanced cancer.

345
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,980
As soon as you enter,

346
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,270
you will see

347
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,610
faces saying farewell.

348
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,180
You can feel cold

349
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,060
from your feet to your head.

350
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,620
How does Du Di feel?

351
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,860
She's quite excited.

352
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,380
Because

353
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,950
being a doctor in oncology

354
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
has always been her dream.

355
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,290
She's like

356
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,740
a shark in the sea.

357
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,110
It suits her ambitions.

358
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,110
But it also means

359
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,380
you're more human.

360
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,550
In the four gynecological departments,

361
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,360
obstetrics,

362
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,490
general gynecology,

363
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,270
gynecological oncology

364
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,100
and reproductive center,

365
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,330
oncologic doctors

366
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,390
have the highest wages

367
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,970
and the fastest promotion.

368
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,090
Because there are more

369
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,160
surgeries and laparoscopy.

370
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,300
Du Di is a good picker.

371
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,310
But I like obstetrics the most.

372
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,510
I like to bring

373
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,780
children into this world.

374
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,370
I think the joy and hope

375
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:39,990
of being an obstetrician

376
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,730
is unique among the four departments.

377
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,060
All right.

378
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,650
In order to

379
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,540
become an obstetrician,

380
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,880
you have to keep going.

381
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,860
Let's go to the teaching room.

382
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,340
Let's go.

383
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,150
What have you prepared for me?

384
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,820
So many practicing materials.

385
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,110
You were so busy today,

386
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,230
when did you get this?

387
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,410
During lunch break.

388
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,840
I'll take care of all your preparations

389
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,580
for competition.

390
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,850
Well sewn.

391
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,090
The next time you sew,

392
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,710
cut the thread

393
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,960
one centimeter higher.

394
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,940
[Inpatient Department]

395
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,570
Do you hear cat purring?

396
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:04,800
Are you hungry?

397
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,990
You've been practicing too long with me.

398
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,790
Let me treat you to dinner.

399
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,050
If you don't mind,

400
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,580
come to my place for dinner.

401
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,290
My sister has made it already

402
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,040
for both of us.

403
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,690
You have a sister?

404
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,090
Eat.

405
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,970
Dr. Wu, go ahead and eat.

406
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,590
I haven't

407
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,580
figured it out yet.

408
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,210
Are you sister and brother?

409
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,690
Yes.

410
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,230
By blood?

411
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,590
Same father and mother?

412
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,260
Yes.

413
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,630
Dr. Wu,

414
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,220
you are so beautiful today.

415
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,990
You're not only good-looking,

416
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,700
but also kind-hearted.

417
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,950
You helped me a lot usually.

418
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,880
I've always wanted to treat you to dinner

419
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,750
to thank you.

420
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,380
But I know that

421
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,590
I should invite you people live in cities

422
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,150
to very expensive restaurants

423
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,250
to show sincerity.

424
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,660
But our condition…

425
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,540
Don't laugh at us.

426
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,470
No, no.

427
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,300
You're good.

428
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,770
Your food looks

429
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,540
more delicious than in the restaurant.

430
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,260
Do you remember that

431
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,970
there was a while

432
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,790
I worked in a restaurant

433
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,660
washing dishes?

434
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,740
I learned from the chef secretly.

435
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,910
Come on and eat.

436
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,820
How is it?

437
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,860
Why are you being

438
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,190
a nurse if you have this skill?

439
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,950
If you open a restaurant

440
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,070
in front of our hospital…

441
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,370
The stuffed buns were made by your sister?

442
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,430
Do I look like someone

443
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,730
who can make buns?

444
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,540
Him?

445
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,790
He looks like someone

446
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,900
who can eat a lot of buns.

447
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,860
Sister,

448
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,610
what are you talking about?

449
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,620
You're making me embarrassed.

450
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,740
Hurry up and get her more dishes.

451
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,470
Don't just eat all by yourself.

452
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:34,940
Okay. Okay.

453
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,840
Congrui,

454
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,500
eat this.

455
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,130
Ask her

456
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,180
if spicy food is okay.

457
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:38,980
Okay?

458
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,410
I'm so full.

459
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,350
My stomach is bursting.

460
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,910
Do you really think it's delicious,

461
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,590
or just say it to make us feel good?

462
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,020
It's really delicious.

463
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,470
If I can eat so many

464
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,720
delicious dishes every day,

465
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,780
I'll rather die for it.

466
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,740
You can.

467
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,540
My sister

468
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,619
dropped out after elementary school.

469
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,040
My parents died when I was little.

470
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:10,740
So she

471
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,859
went out to work

472
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,230
for money to support

473
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,020
my education.

474
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,700
I don't want people to know

475
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,450
that my parents were farmers,

476
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,829
and I have a

477
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,819
semi-literate sister,

478
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,260
so I lied that

479
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,020
my parents were both intellectuals

480
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,210
and died in a plane crash

481
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,370
to gain people's admiration

482
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,090
and sympathy.

483
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,180
I couldn't…

484
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,350
I couldn't even admit that

485
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,190
my sister is working

486
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,420
in the same department

487
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,770
of the same hospital with me.

488
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,420
She's my blood sister.

489
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,530
I see.

490
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,020
Congrui,

491
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,980
this is the worst part of me.

492
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,200
I'm telling you

493
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,770
the worst part of me

494
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,980
because I like you.

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,840
And I don't want to lie to you.

496
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,760
After hearing these,

497
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,610
can you give me a chance

498
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,860
to be your boyfriend?

499
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,010
But you're Du Di's ex-boyfriend.

500
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,070
We broke up long ago.

501
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,630
And at the beginning,

502
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,100
you're the one I liked.

503
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,730
You were already in a relationship

504
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,950
with Feng Yuanhang.

505
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,140
I couldn't come between you and him.

506
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,240
I know. I know.

507
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,190
I know you're close to Du Di.

508
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,340
We broke up

509
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,210
because we have

510
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,770
different goals in life.

511
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,890
But I've really liked you for a long time.

512
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,890
We both love kids

513
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,550
and love to enjoy the warmth of family.

514
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,900
We have the same views and goals in life.

515
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:45,650
Congrui,

516
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,660
can you give me a chance?

517
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,510
Why do you have dark circles?

518
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,650
Don't get distracted before the competition.

519
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,580
You need to rest and practice.

520
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,770
Otherwise, how could you win?

521
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,190
I get it.

522
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,760
As for the competition,

523
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,770
suture and placental separation

524
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,750
can be practiced

525
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,090
in your spare time.

526
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,340
What's most uncontrollable

527
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,460
is interrogation.

528
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,120
About the introduction, complaint,

529
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,970
present and pre-existing conditions,

530
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,430
systematic review,

531
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,820
personal health history, family health history

532
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,420
and conclusions,

533
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,180
you've taken related exams many times.

534
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,800
But have you truly understood

535
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,790
the role of each step

536
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,560
and would you follow these procedures

537
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,450
during an interrogation?

538
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,140
That may not be easily noticed in normal times.

539
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,340
But in the competition,

540
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,940
the judges would set a trap

541
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,780
for you to jump into it.

542
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,940
The most difficult part

543
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,450
is the one-sentence complaint.

544
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,650
The newly diagnosed and pre-existing medical conditions

545
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,670
should be found out

546
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,900
by yourself.

547
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,670
The mastery of knowledge

548
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,530
in both breadth and depth

549
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,290
is also a challenge.

550
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,380
It could highlight

551
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,040
your way of thinking in clinical practices

552
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,000
and even expose your blind spots.

553
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,710
So that means

554
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,910
during the competition,

555
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,660
we should try to ask for all details.

556
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,950
Of course.

557
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,550
There will be a time limit.

558
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,210
You won't have 24 hours.

559
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,370
It sounds so difficult.

560
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,020
This is the part

561
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,260
where you're most likely to win Du Di.

562
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,090
I should say it's where you're most likely

563
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,020
to win her with a big score.

564
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,270
I'll instruct you,

565
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,440
while Lin Mo will instruct Du Di.

566
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,140
We'll be supervising you as you ask questions.

567
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,540
It's really

568
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,260
a rare learning opportunity.

569
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,990
You must stay focused.

570
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,220
OK.

571
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,570
We can't focus on treatment and operation

572
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,060
but attending meetings

573
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,180
and preparing for the competition.

574
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,060
Formalism is killing people.

575
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,650
Dr. Lin,

576
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,360
can you take this seriously?

577
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,510
I want to win.

578
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,400
I just want you to relax,

579
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,000
but you're blaming me for not being serious.

580
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,830
I want to win since I've decided to do it.

581
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,460
I want to be serious since I want to win.

582
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,770
Being so aggressive,

583
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,190
don't you feel tired?

584
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,580
OK, let's begin.

585
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,070
Zhao Xiaoyu, twenty-three.

586
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,970
Where are you not feeling well?

587
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,580
Here, lower abdomen.

588
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,740
Abdominal pain.

589
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,680
Since when?

590
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,050
Two hours ago.

591
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,580
In internal medicine and gynecology,

592
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,540
there're countless causes of abdominal pains,

593
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,830
including ectopic pregnancy,

594
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,610
or problems with the ovaries.

595
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,350
I should ask about her menstrual cycle first.

596
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,790
When was your last period?

597
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,080
The start or end date?

598
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,620
Start.

599
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,590
About ten days ago.

600
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:05,850
I've forgotten that.

601
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
How many days exactly?

602
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,570
Can you try to recall it?

603
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,030
What does it have to do with my abdominal pain?

604
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:11,900
About ten days,

605
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,180
it shouldn't be ectopic pregnancy.

606
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,020
But she is not sure about it,

607
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,100
so it's hard to say

608
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,730
whether she remembers it right

609
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,950
or wrong.

610
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,030
Did you have sex

611
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,710
before feeling the pain?

612
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:24,710
Yes.

613
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,660
Pelvic inflammation is narrowly ruled out.

614
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,710
You go get an ultrasound examination

615
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,280
and blood test.

616
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,610
OK.

617
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,860
You failed.

618
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,390
Why?

619
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,340
The first patients for you today

620
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,550
are all performers.

621
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,700
They are not real patients.

622
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,200
This girl complained of having

623
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,060
abdominal pain for two hours.

624
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,470
In addition to

625
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,510
asking about her period,

626
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,940
you also need to ask her

627
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,780
what happened after having sex.

628
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,700
What happened after sex?

629
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,500
How to ask such a question?

630
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,420
You asked her to get an ultrasound examination

631
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,180
and blood test.

632
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,510
Of course, you'll know

633
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,640
what her problem is.

634
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,180
But what if you're in a remote area

635
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,810
where the conditions are not so good?

636
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,290
You learned in the interrogation

637
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,490
that she began to feel abdominal pain after sex.

638
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,500
That's distinguished from spontaneous pelvic inflammation

639
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,660
and ectopic pregnancy.

640
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,150
Sex happened

641
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,040
within one to two weeks

642
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,190
but not two to three weeks

643
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,180
after the period.

644
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,620
Nausea and vomiting occurred

645
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,130
immediately after sex.

646
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,860
And abdominal pain occurred in about an hour

647
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,590
but not immediately after sex.

648
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,680
All these

649
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,480
were designed in this case.

650
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,980
But you didn't ask about these.

651
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,430
These details

652
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,220
can be distinguished from

653
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,770
the symptoms of rupture of corpus luteum.

654
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,500
After asking about these, you'd be able to judge

655
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,340
it's ovarian cyst pedicle torsion.

656
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,250
This abdominal pain case seems simple,

657
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,940
but there're many traps in it.

658
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,930
She is a woman

659
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,870
and you're too,

660
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,280
but you still feel embarrassed

661
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
to ask for details after sex.

662
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,340
If the score is five points,

663
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,680
you got only one point.

664
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,210
Forty-six.

665
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,170
Married?

666
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,300
I'm divorced.

667
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:53,900
How long have you been bleeding?

668
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,900
For a few days,

669
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,100
intermittently.

670
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,100
Forty-six.

671
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,510
Irregular vaginal bleeding.

672
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,010
It might be perimenopausal

673
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,190
functional uterine bleeding

674
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,620
or endometrial diseases.

675
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,780
Have you ever had a child?

676
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,340
My child is already fifteen.

677
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,710
I got an IUD ring right after giving birth.

678
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,930
So, you've carried the IUD for fifteen years.

679
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,740
It was just removed

680
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,850
because

681
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,840
it moved down.

682
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,660
Is that the ultrasound image captured this morning?

683
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,120
Show me the report, please.

684
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,380
According to the report,

685
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,420
the ultrasound image shows

686
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,240
uneven low echoes in the uterine cavity,

687
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,260
and abundant blood flow.

688
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,990
Is it endometrial cancer?

689
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,810
Not endometrial cancer.

690
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,650
How do you know I'm thinking that?

691
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:35,900

that you missed one thing?

696
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,420
The complete blood count HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin).

697

It's not possible.

She said she's divorced,

699

but that doesn't mean she has no boyfriend.

700
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,580
She is forty-six,

701
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,140
but it doesn't mean she won't get pregnant.

702
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,340
There're many traps in this case.

703
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,020
Your inertial thinking

704
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,420
is what makes you fail.

So, pregnancy happened

706
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,190
because the IUD moved down.

707
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,520
The bleeding is the functional residue

708

caused by incomplete abortion.

make the patients feel uncomfortable.

00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,200
In my opinion,

757
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,410
both of them would have weak points

759

But I also know that, at the national competition,

760
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,560
there would be some fake patients

In that case,

I think Wu Congrui would prevail

764
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,400
because she is more patient in communication

Many intermediate and advanced-stage cases

864
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,470
have received comprehensive

865
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,860
and standardized treatment in our hospital.

866
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,080
Their five-year survival rate

867
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,510
is above 50%.

868
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,340
I know it.

869
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,140
I've searched about it.

870
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,950
The only option for now

871
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,300
is cytoreductive surgery.

872
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,420
The goal of primary cytoreductive surgery

873
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,500
is trying to help you reach

874
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,300
no gross residual disease status.

875
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,790
So, we need to

876
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,830
explain it to you in advance.

877
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,350
The lumps formed from ovarian cancer

878
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,330
in the abdomen and pelvis

879
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,260
usually invasively adhere to

880
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,650
the pelvic wall, the uterus,

881
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,720
the bladder, the rectum, etc.

882
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,310
So, the surgery often involves

883
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,290
the intestines and bladder.

884
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,500
OK.

885
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,870
Then during the surgery,

886
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,670
if there is damage to

887
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,860
my intestines or bladder,

888
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,820
how would I know

889
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,820
it's unavoidable

890
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,530
or it's caused by

891
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,700
your poor medical skills?

892
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,140
Then which doctor do you think

893
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,650
is medically skilled

894
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,930
and you can

895
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,320
give full recognition?

896
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,220
Trust

897
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,990
is most fundamental to

898
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,340
the doctor-patient relationship.

899
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,020
Now that you've chosen Shengji,

900
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,830
you must have recognized

901
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,990
this fundamental trust.

902
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,510
I hope

903
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,250
we can well cooperate

904
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,300
on this basis

905
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,500
to fight the cancer together.

906
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,210
The young nurse

907
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,710
is still waiting for you in the ward.

908
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,880
She is young,

909
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,630
but she is the most skillful

910
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,450
and most experienced nurse

911
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,020
in our Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

912
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,460
Can you let her try it?

913
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,990
If she is really good,

914
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,820
you may try to trust me

915
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,510
from this point.

916
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,500
OK?

917
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,190
I want you to reflect on

918
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,540
what your problem was.

919
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,620
I just told the patient the truth,

920
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,600
rather than

921
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,350
beating around the bush.

922
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,340
Is that a problem?

923
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,740
I don't think

924
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,140
burying the lead

925
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:11,890
can help the treatment.

926
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,020
Most patients

927
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,150
don't know much about

928
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,020
their conditions.

929
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,460
Some even know nothing about it.

930
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,060
What you should do first

931
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,900
is to reassure the patient,

932
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,980
especially this kind of patients

933
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,890
at intermediate and advanced stages.

934
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,220
This is because in the fight against cancer,

935
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,980
the patient's mentality is most important.

936
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,740
If you tell her at the beginning

937
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,880
that she won't live more than five years,

938
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,580
she would lose confidence.

939
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,590
Wu Congrui, you're too optimistic,

940
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,260
which is easily misunderstood by the patient.

941
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,270
Once the expectation can't be met,

942
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,840
it would be hard for the patient to accept it.

943
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,030
There're three days left before the surgery.

944
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460
In the following three days,

945
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,380
how to make her trust our hospital

946
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,620
and trust our doctors

947
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,640
depends on your performance.

948
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,340
On which side do you plan

949
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,040
to incise on me?

950
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,890
The left or the right?

951
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,170
Cytoreductive surgery

952
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,330
of ovarian malignant tumor

953
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,100
should be operated on a median longitudinal incision.

954
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,180
The tumor is on the right side.

955
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,790
Why would you

956
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,490
make a median longitudinal incision?

957
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,800
We're not here to be tested by you.

958
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,780
The location of the incision

959
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,080
will be decided by the attending physician.

960
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,580
Doctors' excuses again.

961
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,300
You need to probe after the laparotomy, right?

962
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,280
Which side will you probe first?

963
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,320
The left or the right?

964
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,480
There is no fixed order.

965
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,220
It all depends on the case's condition.

966
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,300
No matter it's the left

967
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,060
or the right side,

968
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:19,580
it has to be probed thoroughly.

969
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,440
I'm talking about my case.

970
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,900
I am the case.

971
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,380
The right side.

972
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,610
Which side is the liver on, left or right?

973
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,250
Which side is the spleen on, left or right?

974
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,690
If we probe

975
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,890
from the right of your enterocoelia,

976
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,060
we need to start from the upper part

977
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,570
and then deep to the downside...

978
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,510
This is what's what you recited

979
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,570
on your textbooks.

980
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,500
Does it take this long to think?

981
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,340
Here's the thing.

982
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,170
I've never

983
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,950
performed

984
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,740
a probe within the whole enterocoelia.

985
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,340
I just watched my teacher do it.

986
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,700
So I need to explain to you

987
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,530
the whole process.

988
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,380
Idiot!

989
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,460
Quack!

990
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,890
You can't even tell from left and right.

991
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,380
Can you tell from your left hand and right hand?

992
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,470
Do you have a stupid left brain

993
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,300
or a stupid right brain?

994
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,100
The only thing I know

995
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,360
is that there is only one entry for clysis.

996
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,260
At the median.

997
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,660
Just clean it thoroughly today

998
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,720
so that this room

999
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,670
-won't be contaminated by complaints.
-You...

1000
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,409
You get out of here!

1001
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,150
The air will soon be fresh!

1002
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,449
We're getting out of here.

1003
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,480
Don't be mad.

1004
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
Just don't argue

1005
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,800
with a patient with terminal cancer.

1006
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,590
Let it go.

1007
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,360
Think about it.

1008
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,280
The reason why she curses like that

1009
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,050
is that she's frightened.

1010
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,810
Put yourself in her shoes.

1011
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,590
Her curse won't kill you.

1012
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,409
I know

1013
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,570
everyone

1014
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,659
thinks I don't know how to communicate with patients,

1015
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,120
considering it my biggest shortcoming.

1016
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,860
But it's not necessary for doctors

1017
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,780
to yield to patients' nonsense.

1018
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,760
Doctors are humans.

1019
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,520
When she is cursed,

1020
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,870
she will get upset and sad.

1021
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,219
Doctors aren't supposed to

1022
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,920
bear with everything.

1023
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,780
If a person has an ill heart,

1024
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,630
doctors can cure his body

1025
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,750
but not his heart.

1026
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,020
Doctors aren't saviors.

1027
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,540
If all of you

1028
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,590
agree with such practices,

1029
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,940
then you're like indulging the bad people.

1030
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,500
There were many kind and virtuous doctors

1031
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,870
who were stabbed.

1032
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,900
Even if you put yourselves in her shoes,

1033
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,740
she will never feel

1034
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,410
grateful.

1035
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,590
Take Yao Yao as an example.

1036
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,750
She hates the hospital

1037
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,540
and the doctors like hell.

1038
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,440
I won't indulge her

1039
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,630
and I won't go easy on her from now on.

1040
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,510
What?

1041
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,200
Du Di gets impatient?

1042
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,660
I think we should heal both their

1043
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,880
bodies and hearts.

1044
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:30,780
No.

1045
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,730
Heal their hearts first.

1046
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,380
Only when we heal their hearts,

1047
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,090
make them trust us

1048
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,850
and show some coordination

1049
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,110
can we achieve

1050
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:38,770
better treatment.

1051
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,220
So?

1052
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,760
I checked Yao Yao's medical record,

1053
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,300
and found she got a divorce.

1054
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,280
She had one of her ovaries removed ten years ago.

1055
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,220
I want to start with her medical history,

1056
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,370
and dig out

1057
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,280
the deeper reason

1058
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,470
for her hatred

1059
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
towards doctors.

1060
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,590
You're like a forensic expert now,

1061
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,750
dating back to ten years ago

1062
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,280
in the treatment.

1063
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,570
It's a part of the previous history,

1064
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,020
not only the medical part,

1065
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,300
but also the mental part.

1066
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,150
You want to know from me

1067
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,190
in which hospital

1068
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,860
she had the surgery

1069
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,460
and who the doctor was.

1070
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,660
When we admitted her,

1071
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,030
it was in the preoperative phase.

1072
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,380
I just want to know

1073
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,990
what she mentioned to the doctor

1074
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,880
that admitted her.

1075
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,180
The first doctor driven away by her curse

1076
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
complained about it to me

1077
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,040
the surgery

1078
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,350
that failed ten years ago

1079
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,710
makes her hate

1080
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,690
every living doctor.

1081
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,310
Ask him.

1082
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,150
Thanks.

1083
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,040
Okay.

1084
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,160
Go for the admission procedure.

1085
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,420
Be careful.

1086
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Turn right in front.

1087
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,460
What is it?

1088
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,310
The Yao Yao you're talking about

1089
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,050
is indeed pitiful.

1090
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,020
Ten years ago, she looked over for hospitals to cure infertility.

1091
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,260
Then she was diagnosed with

1092
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,820
chocolate cyst in her right ovary.

1093
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:55,860
A

1094
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:56,750
specialized hospital

1095
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,980
told her she would recover after removing the cyst focus.

1096
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,020
But in the laparotomy,

1097
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,920
they got muddled up

1098
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,150
and remove her left ovary.

1099
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,000
Her family wouldn't be easy on it

1100
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,780
and required compensation at all costs.

1101
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,080
In the end, that hospital

1102
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,650
fled away.

1103
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,650
No wonder she's been nagging about

1104
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,770
the right and left.

1105
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,960
Turns out she's afraid

1106
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,790
that we'll remove the wrong ovary.

1107
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,430
I have sympathy for her.

1108
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,950
But I can't put up with her.

1109
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,300
Good luck to you.

1110
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,150
See.

1111
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:28,790
This...

1112
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,200
An intact crate of imported fruits.

1113
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,950
Totally untouched.

1114
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,560
See if the gift store

1115
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,510
would buy it.

1116
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,940
And this.

1117
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,870
Cubilose.

1118
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,740
A young lady had just one bite.

1119
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,460
She dislikes the sweetness

1120
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,460
and threw them all.

1121
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,650
What a pity

1122
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,790
it can't be sold as a whole.

1123
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,520
Cubilose is luxurious, isn't it?

1124
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,140
Rich people

1125
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,380
don't care about how much it cost.

1126
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,920
Don't mention it.

1127
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,570
Look.

1128
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,400
We got clothes here.

1129
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,240
Fine clothes.

1130
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,750
They were gifts from the patient's relatives.

1131
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,820
The patient dislikes

1132
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,880
by a glance

1133
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,380
and threw it away.

1134
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,660
It's unopened.

1135
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,550
Let's keep them.

1136
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,030
What are you talking about?

1137
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,640
It's indecent to share the booty

1138
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,510
in the middle of the night, isn't it?

1139
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,900
That's not true.

1140
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,360
We didn't steal them.

1141
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,060
They were thrown by the patients and their guardians

1142
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,160
in the daytime.

1143
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,580
They are untouched and unopened.

1144
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,620
It'll be a waste to dump them.

1145
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,650
so I tidied them up

1146
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,550
and placed them in the pantry.

1147
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Then I asked my friend to come over

1148
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,560
to sell them at night.

1149
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,390
We didn't steal them.

1150
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,400
A friend?

1151
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,870
Who would invite an intruder

1152
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,700
into the hospital

1153
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
late at night?

1154
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,620
Go to the securities with me.

1155
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,180
He's the delivery guy

1156
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,580
who delivers food for us in the daytime.

1157
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,990
He has a decent job.

1158
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:38,850
We don't have to steal anything.

1159
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,960
We're not thieves

1160
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,330
and we're not going to the securities with you.

1161
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,910
If I let him go now

1162
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,770
and something went missing in the department tomorrow,

1163
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,990
everyone in the department will be

1164
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,860
in great trouble.

1165
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,270
Go to the securities with me.

1166
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,180
Go now. Go now.

1167
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:49,730
Hey, you...

1168
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:50,770
Don't...

1169
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,910
Stop there.

1170
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,530
You!

1171
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,660
You won't escape from punishment.

1172
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,290
You can leave too if you're so capable.

1173
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,400
Miss Su.

1174
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,300
I did nothing wrong.

1175
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,550
Some patients and guardians

1176
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,810
don't cherish what they got.

1177
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,110
They just like to waste them.

1178
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,530
The things they dump

1179
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,500
from the ward

1180
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,280
are those

1181
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,720
never seen or eaten

1182
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,300
by the folks in my hometown.

1183
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,670
I just don't want them to be wasted.

1184
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,940
I sell them

1185
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,140
so that they won't be wasted

1186
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,140
and I can earn some money.

1187
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,250
Don't always hold prejudice

1188
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,330
towards us from the countryside

1189
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,030
and treat us like thieves.

1190
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,830
We earn a living

1191
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,550
by working hard.

1192
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,810
We feel proud of ourselves.

1193
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,790
The garbage

1194
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,450
belongs to the patients.

1195
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,270
It's like an infection source

1196
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,750
if you bring them outside without disinfection.

1197
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,580
Fine, even if you didn't steal them

1198
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,270
and you just sell them.

1199
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,220
It's a wrong thing to do!

1200
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,450
I have no problems

1201
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,530
with anyone from the countryside.

1202
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,170
But I have a problem

1203
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,740
with whoever violates the hospital's regulations.

1204
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,240
You have to confess everything

1205
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,270
to the securities

1206
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,180
with me now.

1207
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,060
Or I'll tell every detail of your deed

1208
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,060
to your superior!

1209
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,000
You just won't make any sense.

1210
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,520
I'll never collect them from now on.

1211
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,190
Okay?

1212
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,720
No way.

1213
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,410
Go.

1214
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,610
Why do you have to do this?

1215
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,640
You're just unreasonable.

1216
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,360
Someone like you

1217
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,600
dreams about marrying Li Junxiao?

1218
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,260
You know what? I'm his sister!

1219
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,290
With me here,

1220
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,030
don't you ever dream about

1221
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,030
marrying him!

1222
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,820
I'm sorry.

1223
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,020
I feel so sorry.

1224
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,310
My sister is indeed greedy for small advantages.

1225
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,550
But she is in no way a thief.

1226
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,380
No wonder.

1227
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,710
She gives me tens of bucks

1228
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,830
every day.

1229
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,540
So that's what she's been doing discreetly.

1230
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,710
If she was a thief,

1231
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,110
she wouldn't bother to steal

1232
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,420
something worth tens of bucks from here, would she?

1233
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,740
So she is really your sister?

1234
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,100
Yes.

1235
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:33,900
I thought

1236
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,870
you're a noble man

1237
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,220
who can't be offended.

1238
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,130
Turns out

1239
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,300
you're just a countryside boy,

1240
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,180
who covers up your background.

1241
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,850
Someone like you doesn't deserve to turn me down

1242
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,880
and court Wu Congrui.

1243
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,200
We're colleagues.

1244
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,540
Don't be too mean.

1245
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:50,400
Yes.

1246
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,170
You don't have to be so mean.

1247
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,900
The truth is mean.

1248
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,610
Right.

1249
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,660
You try to prove it to yourself by courting rich girls.

1250
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,060
People like you

1251
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,070
share the same goal like this!

1252
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,940
It's true I'm not a rich girl.

1253
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,340
Fine if you turn me down.

1254
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,350
But I'm telling you,

1255
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,870
Wu Congrui is a kind,

1256
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,830
pure girl.

1257
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,860
A liar full of lies like you

1258
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,900
had better stay away from her!

1259
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,630
Wait!

1260
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,440
Who are you calling a liar?

1261
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,820
What are you doing?

1262
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,980
You want to make a bigger scene here?

1263
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,800
Break up with Wang Dacheng.

1264
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,860
No, I...

1265
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,830
We're just friends.

1266
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,820
Stop lying.

1267
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,110
You chat on WeChat till midnight every day.

1268
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,910
It takes you like forever to fetch your takeaway.

1269
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:36,790
It must be Wang Dacheng

1270
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,900
who egged you on this.

1271
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,050
How can you trust him

1272
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,100
the moment you date him?

1273
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,210
How long have you been seeing him?

1274
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,580
It's...

1275
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,470
It's not for long.

1276
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,700
One or two months.

1277
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,220
My sister marrying a delivery guy

1278
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,260
is unacceptable for me.

1279
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,400
Cut ties with him.

1280
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:00,730
Hey.

1281
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,100
Why is it unacceptable?

1282
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,940
I am just a carer

1283
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,220
who got a divorce.

1284
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,340
What's wrong with being a delivery guy?

1285
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,260
We can make a good couple!

1286
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,590
I hope that my sister

1287
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,090
can marry someone capable

1288
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,190
so that you can improve your

1289
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,750
ways of thinking and living.

1290
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,020
If you marry someone like Wang Dacheng,

1291
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:14,940
you won't live

1292
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,860
a decent life in your lifetime!

1293
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,290
I don't think I'm someone from a low class.

1294
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,240
Neither does Wang Dacheng!

1295
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,340
You keep talking about class.

1296
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,020
It's something created by capitalism.

1297
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,250
The education you received taught you this?

1298
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,850
Sister.

1299
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,340
I've been working so hard

1300
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,290
and I spare no efforts to thrive.

1301
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,210
Why?

1302
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,460
I just want to

1303
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,060
bring a decent life

1304
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,260
to our family.

1305
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:42,720
What do I get?

1306
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:44,650
Every time

1307
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,070
when I think my life is about to change,

1308
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,360
the reality crushes my dreams

1309
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,600
over and over again.

1310
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,330
I dare not tell the girl I like

1311
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,330
how I feel about her.

1312
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,740
My superiors turn a blind eye to me

1313
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,030
however hard I work.

1314
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,890
Now that you're living in a city,

1315
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,620
why would you date a delivery guy?

1316
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,730
Can you be more ambitious?
