[Episode 31]

4
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,750
If you weren't a female doctor,

5
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,990
you'd be a lady

6
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,210
who's elegant,

7
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,870
and knows how to enjoy life.

8
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,470
Well, I know

9
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,710
how to enjoy life.

10
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
I just don't want to waste my time.

11
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,430
The pressure

12
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,870
of becoming a top-notch doctor

13
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,700
is always on my shoulder.

14
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,620
Life is short.

15
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,380
If you see

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,370
a great goal

17
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,300
that you can potentially achieve,

18
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,210
you strive for it.

19
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,460
There's nothing wrong with an ordinary life,

20
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,840
but I want a different life

21
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,700
for myself.

22
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,360
Of course.

23
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,050
Being aspirational is a good thing.

24
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,410
A tough woman can live

25
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,340
a full and beautiful life, too.

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,200
Being tough

27
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,370
is just a life attitude.

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,620
I didn't expect

29
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,910
that a person

30
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,870
whom I thought little of

31
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,170
would understand me so well.

32
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,460
It's not that I understand you well,

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,600
it's just many people

34
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,260
are trapped in their own little world.

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,740
They don't understand themselves.

36
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,980
How do you expect them

37
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,930
to understand others?

38
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,579
Good.

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,700
You're saying something smart.

40
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,340
Why aren't you eating anything?

41
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,890
Haven't you heard of this before?

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,220
After making a full table of dishes,

43
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,110
the cook loses all the appetite.

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,590
I'll cook for you next time.

45
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,720
Are you serious? Can you cook?

46
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,710
I'm dead serious.

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,290
I lived abroad for so many years.

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,160
I have some basic

49
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,150
survival skills.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,380
Omelette.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,130
Spaghetti.

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,730
Steak.

53
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,830
I can make them all.

54
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,940
Impressive.

55
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,030
When are you going

56
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,780
to cook some dishes for me?

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,650
On your next day off,

58
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,040
okay?

59
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:07,820
OK.

60
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,300
You look so pretty

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,250
when you smile.

62
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,860
Your smile

63
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,980
has sweetened the air.

64
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,620
You are not

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,080
watching a video about obstetrics & gynecology?

66
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,030
Neurosurgery.

67
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,480
You must watch a video about neurosurgery?

68
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,760
I have watched enough

69
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,940
female organs already.

70
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,079
So I wanted to watch something else

71
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,160
to learn some new stuff.

72
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,470
You want to learn this?

73
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,640
What's wrong?

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,350
Nothing wrong.

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,790
Just learn from me.

76
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,940
You have such a nice body.

77
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,840
It would be much fun to dissect you.

78
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,180
Sorry.

79
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,360
I've been busy these days.

80
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,200
Really? What have you been doing?

81
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,810
My sister told me

82
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,510
that you let her have

83
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,180
the free examination chance.

84
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:37,940
Congrui.

85
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,670
I know

86
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,900
there's no such thing as

87
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,880
an annual free physical examination.

88
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,590
You paid for her examination, right?

89
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,620
How much was it?

90
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,600
I'll give you the money.

91
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,680
That's fine.

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,220
She told me

93
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,950
that for some reason,

94
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,190
she was never able

95
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,570
to get pregnant after she was married for several years.

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
So she wanted a check.

97
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,660
I thought it might be too much for her,

98
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,400
so I came up

99
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,460
with this idea.

100
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,820
It didn't cost me much.

101
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,860
Don't worry about it.

102
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,410
Thank you.

103
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,020
You don't have to do this.

104
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,650
If it wasn't for you,

105
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,960
-my sister wouldn't be…
-Oh, right.

106
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,540
How is her

107
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,070
result looking?

108
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,970
Everything's fine?

109
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,460
Yeah.

110
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,650
Everything's fine.

111
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,760
Glad to know.

112
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,020
You know,

113
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,780
there are many reasons

114
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,340
that a couple doesn't have a baby

115
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,090
after years of marriage.

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,280
Why does it

117
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,750
have to be the female's problem?

118
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,900
I think both

119
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,170
the husband and the wife should have a check.

120
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:44,830
That man,

121
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,710
he didn't get himself checked.

122
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,180
He just blamed it on Sister.

123
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,230
She's actually better off

124
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,140
without that guy.

125
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,020
Yeah.

126
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,520
Junxiao,

127
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
this is the operation fee.

128
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,220
Enjoyed working with you.

129
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,910
This is how you make a month

130
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,060
at Shengji, right?

131
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,870
Now, one operation

132
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,960
can pay you that much.

133
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,550
So,

134
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,470
don't feel

135
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,250
pressured.

136
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,610
Looking forward to working with you again.

137
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:38,900
Sister,

138
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,500
we had a deal, didn't we?

139
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,470
That you'd quit

140
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,190
and get some rest at home.

141
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,340
Why are you still at work?

142
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,420
Look at you.

143
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,820
You aren't willing to stay in the hospital,

144
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,860
but you still came to work.

145
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,740
Watch your health, will you?

146
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,620
I'm fine.

147
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,990
You know me.

148
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,420
I have to keep myself busy.

149
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,170
And once I'm not busy,

150
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,940
I'd have crazy thoughts.

151
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,580
So I might as well keep working.

152
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,210
I know that you want to make more money.

153
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
About the medical bill,

154
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,300
I'll work out a solution.

155
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,790
But a patient shouldn't

156
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,540
be making money.

157
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,900
What solution?

158
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,420
I wanted to ask you this.

159
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,140
Did you come home

160
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,210
after midnight last night

161
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,130
and went out before 5:00 AM this morning?

162
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,940
Don't overstrain yourself.

163
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,060
My disease doesn't have to be treated.

164
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,670
I don't want to be a liability.

165
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,980
What are you talking about?

166
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,740
You will quit immediately.

167
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,580
Go home and rest.

168
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,100
You hear me?

169
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,260
Fine.

170
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,820
I will do that.

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:27,930
Junxiao,

172
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,580
I just met with Congrui.

173
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,420
Does she know

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,530
about my disease?

175
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,460
I still haven't got time to tell her.

176
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:36,809
All right.

177
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,350
Don't let her know.

178
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,299
I don't want it to affect you.

179
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,850
I got it.

180
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:55,990
What are you doing?

181
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,660
I only want to hold my girlfriend's hand.

182
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,580
No. People can see us.

183
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,630
I want them to see us.

184
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,400
I don't.

185
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,060
I want compensation then.

186
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,370
Do you know

187
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,190
how much it hurts?

188
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,490
Bai.

189
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,090
Bai.

190
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,190
You don't remember me?

191
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,330
I'm Li Qiao'er.

192
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,790
I played games

193
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,450
with you.

194
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,020
Li Qiao'er.

195
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,100
What a coincidence.

196
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,230
What are you doing here at the hospital again this time?

197
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,820
I came with her.

198
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,700
Qiao'er.

199
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,440
I have got my number.

200
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,930
Hey, Wang Lu.

201
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,610
He is Bai,

202
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,600
the one I often talked to you about.

203
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,740
He got a doctor's degree

204
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,080
at a foreign medical school.

205
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,700
He's very good.

206
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,220
How about you let him check on you later?

207
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,360
I'm only a trainee resident.

208
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,470
I'm not qualified to check on a patient.

209
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,540
The attending physician

210
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,200
will check on you.

211
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,020
Come on.

212
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,300
You've got your number. Just wait.

213
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,920
Let me take you there.

214
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,640
Ultrasound result.

215
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,930
Both ovaries are 11 centimeters in diameter.

216
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,950
Whereas the average diameter

217
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,780
of normal people's ovary is 3 to 4 centimeters.

218
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,200
There's a large amount of fluid

219
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,140
in the abdomen and chest.

220
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,600
Blood routine result suggests

221
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,710
severe hemoconcentration.

222
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,620
Hepatic injury.

223
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,700
Most importantly,

224
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,540
low blood protein.

225
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,450
You are both students at a nursing school.

226
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,090
You should know a little something about it.

227
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,300
I'll be straightforward.

228
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,310
You have

229
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,570
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

230
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,070
It's a serious complication

231
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,620
caused by ovulation induction and ovum pick-up.

232
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,020
It may cause

233
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,700
eternal organic damage

234
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,900
or even death.

235
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,440
Ovum pick-up?

236
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,260
I suggest you be hospitalized first.

237
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,420
After hospitalization,

238
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,530
you'll get a blood protein transfusion

239
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,780
and volume expansion therapy.

240
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,010
After tonight,

241
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,830
you'll have an operation tomorrow.

242
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,380
How much will it cost?

243
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,190
We aren't sure about the cost.

244
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,210
Do you have medical insurance?

245
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,570
I guess the school covers our insurance.

246
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,290
I'll ask our counselor.

247
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,070
You mustn't let

248
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,770
the counselor know about it.

249
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,530
You need to be hospitalized first.

250
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,760
Your condition

251
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,730
cannot be delayed anymore, you know?

252
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,570
Come on.

253
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,220
We'll get the admission procedure done.

254
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,430
She's so young.

255
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,630
Why would she have an ovulation induction?

256
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,420
I think she sold her eggs.

257
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,430
What?

258
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,690
Isn't that illegal?

259
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,340
Yes.

260
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,140
Those illegal organizations

261
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,310
make dirty money

262
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,250
at the expense of these girls' health.

263
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,240
I think

264
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,980
she took a lot of ovulation induction shots.

265
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,810
And the unprofessional procedures

266
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,070
caused her serious

267
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,420
hydrothorax and ascites.

268
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,460
We received cases

269
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,260
like her before.

270
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,540
Mostly young girls

271
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,610
who mindlessly sold their eggs.

272
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,850
They got the money, but lost their precious health.

273
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,060
That poor girl.

274
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,780
Her ascites will take some time to be drawn.

275
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,060
It's lucky that she's not infected,

276
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,560
or she'd be dead.

277
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,660
Have some food.

278
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,590
Did you ask the counselor for leave?

279
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,540
I did.

280
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,140
I told her that you

281
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,010
needed a few days to deal with some family stuff.

282
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,470
She asked you

283
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,300
to make a confirmation call to her.

284
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,620
I'll call her later.

285
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,170
How did you

286
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,300
get this ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome?

287
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,590
You mustn't

288
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,550
tell anyone

289
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,520
about this.

290
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,830
I sold my eggs before.

291
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,710
You what?

292
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,260
Why would you…

293
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,220
I know.

294
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,240
I regret it.

295
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,450
But I needed

296
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,820
to pay off

297
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,020
a loan.

298
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,910
I had no choice.

299
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,200
I needed the money.

300
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,970
So I sold my eggs.

301
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,980
And they guaranteed that the doctor

302
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,140
was from a Grade A Class 3 hospital.

303
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,540
They said there would be no risk at all.

304
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,190
But after I went there,

305
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,860
they gave me

306
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,360
a whole bunch of shots,

307
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,900
and used a tube this long

308
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,460
to take my eggs.

309
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,100
It nearly killed me.

310
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:57,770
And after

311
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,550
they got my eggs,

312
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,590
my belly grew bigger and bigger.

313
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,780
It's bloated.

314
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,440
But the middleman told me

315
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,940
that it was normal.

316
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,380
And a few days later,

317
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,400
this is what I have become.

318
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,140
Qiao'er,

319
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,090
can I be cured?

320
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,530
Don't worry.

321
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,020
Shengji will cure you.

322
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,500
But

323
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,860
it will cost much, right?

324
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,400
You got paid

325
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,860
after you sold your eggs, didn't you?

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,800
Where's the money?

327
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,090
I paid off the loan.

328
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
I have no money left.

329
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,820
You made such a big mistake.

330
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,230
I know.

331
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,140
I'm so regretful right now.

332
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,500
Qiao'er,

333
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,420
I see you know Bai well,

334
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,320
don't you?

335
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,180
Can you please…

336
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,420
Don't worry.

337
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,790
I swear I will pay him back.

338
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,610
It's not that I don't want to help you,

339
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,140
but I borrowed money from him before.

340
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,710
And I still owe him money now.

341
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,370
If I borrowed more from him,

342
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,680
he'd look down on me.

343
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,550
I'll figure out

344
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,540
another way for you.

345
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,150

The patient is diagnosed

519
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,570
with AFLP.

520
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,620
Director Wang,

521
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,130
it's a timely diagnosis.

522
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,230
A doctor sent her over.

523
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,160
He looked familiar.

524
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,020
He told us

525
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,110
that it might be AFLP,

526
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,020
so we diagnosed

527
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,530
her rather quickly.

528
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,030
Congrui, explain

529
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,810
AFLP's

530
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,640
therapeutic principle.

531
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,780
AFLP's

532
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,560
therapeutic principle

533
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,580
is prompt childbirth

534
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,130
and the maximum-level supportive treatment

535
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,120
to ensure euglycemia, and the balance of blood volume

536
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,380
and electrolytes.

537
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,550
Calibrate DIC.

538
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,340
The way of delivery

539
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,660
is to be a cesarean section.

540
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,870
But the coagulation disorder

541
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,130
can add risk to the operation.

542
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,050
Good.

543
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,430
How is her

544
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,010
coagulation function looking?

545
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,750
She now

546
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,020
has severe coagulation disorder.

547
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,100
A cesarean section

548
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,830
will quicken the delivery process,

549
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,060
but it may cause massive hemorrhage,

550
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,500
aggravating her coagulation disorder

551
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,790
and further damage

552
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,030
to her liver

553
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,080
and the other organs.

554
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,040
Indeed.

555
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,640
Congrui,

556
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,640
contact the blood bank.

557
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,670
She needs hemocyte and plasma.

558
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,870
Apply for fibrinogen

559
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,420
and prothrombin complex,

560
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,630
or the patient

561
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,900
will have a hemorrhagic shock.

562
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,160
After the childbirth,

563
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,310
watch the mother and the child closely

564
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,110
to see if

565
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,020
there's any LCHAD

566
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,860
symptom.

567
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,820
And hypoketotic hypoglycemia

568
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,450
and fatty liver.

569
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,540
Also, get the family's signature.

570
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,730
Specify the situation.

571
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,500
OK.

572
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,900
Are you going home or to Shengji?

573
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,260
Home.

574
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,210
How about I give you a ride?

575
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,260
No, thanks.

576
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:23,720
Ye Ying,

577
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,960
the reason why

578
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,750
I took the patient

579
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,780
to Shengji

580
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,400
is that…

581
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,970
I know. I don't blame you.

582
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,420
I admit

583
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,380
that at first,

584
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,370
I was a bit mad.

585
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,060
But later, I thought it over.

586
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,940
It's highly risky to treat

587
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,660
AFLP.

588
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,330
And her condition is serious.

589
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,420
It's better

590
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,170
that she's transferred to Shengji,

591
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,990
so there would

592
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,780
be no chance of medical dispute for me.

593
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm glad you understand.

594
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,580
But I hope

595
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,260
this is the last time you do this.

596
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,150
Director Wang wasn't there,

597
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,870
so I acquiesced

598
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,180
in your action.

599
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,560
I hope you will be

600
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,030
handling operations

601
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,260
of higher levels of difficulty

602
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,220
so that we can make more money.

603
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,300
You told me

604
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,580
that my family

605
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,270
can receive free treatment

606
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,180
in this hospital.

607
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,380
Do you still mean what you said?

608
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,700
Of course.

609
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,820
Why? Is your family sick?

610
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,810
Just checking.

611
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,820
I'm leaving then.

612
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,180
Doctor, how is my wife doing?

613
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,140
The surgery was successful. You can rest assured.

614
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,800
But she'll still be under observation.

615
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,940
That's great. That's great.

616
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,960
Thank you.

617
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,820
You're welcome.

618
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,010
AFLP

619
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,570
is a rare and fatal complication that typically occurs

620
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,930
in the third trimester of pregnancy.

621
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,690
It's characterized by fast development.

622
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,190
It's an obstetric

623
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,320
acute and serious complication

624
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,690
with a mortality rate of 70%.

625
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,710
Your wife is lucky.

626
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,110
You brought her here

627
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,130
in time.

628
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,030
I got to go home to see my baby.

629
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,430
You need to pay attention to

630
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,230
her post-surgical condition.

631
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,870
Rest assured, Director.

632
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,020
Please take care.

633
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,410
Can you tell me about

634
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,540
the doctor

635
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,030
who just sent you here?

636
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,900
I don't remember his name.

637
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,670
I only know

638
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,780
he's a specialist

639
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,490
in Kaiming Women's Hospital.

640
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,980
He seems to be hired

641
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,710
from Shengji Hospital

642
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,500
with a high salary.

643
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,390
Kaiming Women's Hospital?

644
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:16,980
Yes.

645
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,910
[Kaiming Women's Hospital]

646
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,740
Hello?

647
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,500
Congrui.

648
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,520
Are you busy on the night shift?

649
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,490
Where are you now?

650
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Where else could I be?

651
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,700
I'm at home.

652
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,740
Junxiao,

653
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,940
don't you really need a ride?

654
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,050
Tell me the truth.

655
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,940
Where are you now?

656
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,260
Well,

657
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,840
I'm coming to you right now

658
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,820
and explain it to you in person.

659
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,230
Let me give you a ride.

660
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,780
It's difficult to call a cab at this hour.

661
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,980
I'll drop you off

662
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,780
outside Shengji.

663
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,570
Congrui won't see me.

664
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,200
OK.

665
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,790
Congrui.

666
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,870
Where are you going at this late hour?

667
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,890
No,

668
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,330
I'm just walking around.

669
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,300
You're lying.

670
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,750
You've got rid of the habit of

671
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,780
nibbling your nails

672
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,630
when you feel anxious.

673
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,680
Why are you doing it again?

674
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,790
What happened?

675
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,710
Du Di,

676
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,710
can you follow me

677
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,980
to see Li Junxiao?

678
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,820
Where?

679
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,680
At the gate of the hospital.

680
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,680
Junxiao.

681
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,400
Here.

682
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,300
Thank you.

683
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:53,730
Bye-bye.

684
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,030
Li Junxiao,

685
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,920
who sent you here?

686
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:06,970
Was that Ye Ying?

687
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,800
Yes.

688
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:08,940
It was Ye Ying.

689
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,070
How did you know?

690
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,710
That's why I'm meeting him

691
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,900
in the middle of the night.

692
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,960
I want to hear your explanation.

693
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:16,880
Come on,

694
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,730
let's go somewhere else.

695
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,730
I'll explain everything to you.

696
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,660
We stay right here.

697
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,330
In front of Du Di,

698
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,400
let's get this straight.

699
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,670
It's the matter between you and me.

700
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,740
Why do we talk about it in front of her?

701
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,140
She is the witness.

702
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,660
I don't like people lying to me.

703
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,830
Ye Ying hired me

704
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,930
to work at her hospital.

705
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,380
It's been a month.

706
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,360
You've been saying that you're busy.

707
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,410
So, that's what you've been busy with.

708
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,100
Congrui,

709
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,250
there's nothing between Ye Ying and me.

710
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,460
Can you swear?

711
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,310
I swear that

712
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,260
I've never

713
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,850
had any feelings

714
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,200
for Ye Ying.

715
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
You're the only one in my heart.

716
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,630
Then can you not work

717
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,100
at Ye Ying's hospital?

718
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,300
I'm sorry.

719
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,040
I can't do it right now.

720
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,660
It seems that

721
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,370
I've taken myself too important.

722
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,700
Du Di, let's go.

723
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,290
Congrui.

724
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:14,410
Li Junxiao,

725
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,220
what do you mean?

726
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
Ye Ying told me

727
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,510
that as long as I work at her hospital

728
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,790
on a regular basis,

729
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,450
my sister

730
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,520
could receive free treatment

731
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,190
at her hospital.

732
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,790
Shengji is a Grade A Class 3 hospital.

733
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,800
Isn't it good enough for your sister?

734
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,620
You're an attending physician

735
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,630
but work as a specialist there.

736
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,520
Do you trust it for treating your sister?

737
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,490
I have no money.

738
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,110
They have the most advanced

739
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,420
equipment and medicine.

740
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,700
At least my sister could stay there

741
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,040
for the interval between surgeries.

742
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:39,740
Fine.

743
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,340
Since you said so,

744
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,100
I can't help you.

745
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,830
I've given you the chance

746
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,740
to explain it to her.

747
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,630
Don't be so sad.

748
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,940
I've been waiting for him to propose to me,

749
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,380
but he hasn't done it yet.

750
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,250
I thought he was too busy.

751
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,230
I didn't expect

752
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,590
that he is with Ye Ying.

753
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,310
Do you know about

754
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,140
his sister's illness?

755
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,270
What is it?

756
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,570
Ovarian cancer.

757
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,020
Was it found in the last physical examination?

758
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
I knew it by accident.

759
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,670
I tried to talk her into therapy,

760
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,450
but she wouldn't do it

761
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,770
and doesn't want to be hospitalized.

762
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,230
No wonder

763
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,400
she faltered

764
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,590
when I saw her.

765
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,070
Why doesn't Li Junxiao

766
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,260
tell me about it?

767
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,630
He's a proud man.

768
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,380
How would he tell you about it?

769
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,150
It turns out that

770
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,460
he's making money for his sister.

771
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,900
I was wrong about him.

772
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,320
Now that you've known the truth,

773
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,500
just stop making wild guesses.

774
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,060
Du Di,

775
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,030
I feel sad.

776
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,180
I feel really sad.

777
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,060
Bai, how is Wang Lu doing?

778
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,330
The surgery went well.

779
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,210
More than 3,000 ml of ascites

780
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,360
were drawn from her stomach.

781
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,590
It's about seven kilograms.

782
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,680
You can imagine

783
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,610
how much pain she had before.

784
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,160
Fortunately, she was treated in time

785
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,110
before having

786
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,900
serious consequences.

787
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,550
That's good. That's good.

788
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,570
Those organizations selling eggs

789
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,940
are so villainous.

790
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,890
Don't they have sisters?

791
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,120
How can they do this

792
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,860
to girls?

793
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,400
After going back,

794
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,910
you may work with some schoolmates

795
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,790
to print some relevant materials.

796
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,610
That could prevent more girls

797
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,390
from being cheated.

798
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,020
I will.

799
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,870
Bai,

800
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,790
you always think so thoroughly.

801
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,950
You're just like a protector of girls.

802
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,510
Without you,

803
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,990
I wouldn't be able to

804
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,900
be admitted to the nursing school

805
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,310
I haven't got a chance to thank you.

806
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,050
Besides,

807
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,970
I'll repay the money I owe you

808
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,880
as soon as possible.

809
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,920
Wait until you graduate and make money.

810
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,660
Wang Lu

811
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,480
is saved in time.

812
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,310
After she gets recovered,

813
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,450
I hope you can persuade her to call the police.

814
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,080
Girls shouldn't feel ashamed

815
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,490
to disclose such a thing.

816
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,530
Those vicious people

817
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,540
should be ashamed.

818
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,130
My girlfriend is right.

819
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,350
I'll persuade her to call the police,

820
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,720
just like

821
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,470
you persuaded me.

822
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,920
And

823
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,860
I'll study hard

824
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,740
and try to enter Shengji.

825
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,660
We'll be waiting for you.

826
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,160
You didn't drink before.

827
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,990
That's because I wanted to get pregnant.

828
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,830
But now I no longer have expectations

829
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,910
and can drink at will.

830
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,400
Haven't you cleared the air

831
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,760
with Li Junxiao?

832
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,530
If I didn't

833
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,630
find it out myself,

834
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,570
would he tell me that?

835
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,040
Now I find that

836
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,830
the two of us

837
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,780
are getting farther apart.

838
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,490
He doesn't tell me that his sister's sick

839
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,620
and he is working part time

840
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,540
at Ye Ying's hospital.

841
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,660
I thought

842
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,530
we're going to get married.

843
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,370
And I trusted him.

844
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,180
But now I realized

845
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,330
he doesn't tell me anything.

846
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,460
I feel really anxious.

847
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,230
Congrui,

848
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,220
Li Junxiao doesn't know

849
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,740
how to speak sweet words.

850
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,710
And he always feels inferior

851
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,180
due to his background.

852
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,320
Now

853
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,230
his sister is sick.

854
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,110
He certainly

855
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,410
won't propose to you

856
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,170
so easily.

857
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,110
Oh, I see.

858
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,600
He must be thinking of

859
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,210
solving the current difficulties

860
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,780
before talking about your future.

861
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,860
I've never expected

862
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,220
that you would speak for him.

863
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,200
I'm telling the truth.

864
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,830
Forget about me.

865
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,960
What about you?

866
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,950
When will you

867
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,800
marry Liu Nianbai?

868
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,250
We're not there yet.

869
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,470
Liu Nianbai

870
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,160
is an excellent man.

871
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,520
He is handsome and has a high IQ.

872
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,730
He has a good family background.

873
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,290
The most important thing is that

874
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,550
he loves you

875
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,300
and respects you.

876
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,470
So, you mustn't

877
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,250
let go of him.

878
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,700
Our feelings for each other

879
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,780
are very pure.

880
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,360
Why are you describing it

881
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,430
so worldly?

882
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,740
Am I?

883
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,920
It's not easy

884
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,520
to meet true love.

885
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,790
But when you meet the one,

886
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,920
you must cherish him.

887
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
Or it would be too late to regret it.

888
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,170
Understand?

889
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,140
Understood, Aunt Wu.

890
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,110
Who is it?

891
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,220
It's me. Du Di.

892
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,790
Liu Nianbai, what are you doing?

893
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,370
We're going to be late for work.

894
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,320
What are you doing?

895
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,810
What are you doing here?

896
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,480
Let's go to work together.

897
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,690
I brought you breakfast.

898
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Let's go. Or we'll be late.

899
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,510
Have you washed up?

900
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,140
Look at your hair.

901
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,090
Oh, my hair.

902
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,190
Why are you looking so nervous?

903
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,470
Have you done anything wrong to me?

904
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
How is it possible?

905
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,260
Let's go.

906
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,970
-You need to have breakfast.
-Nianbai,

907
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,860
who is out there?

908
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,630
Du Di.

909
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,390
It tastes good.

910
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,780
Du Di, have some, too.

911
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,340
I have no appetite.

912
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,220
I don't want to eat.

913
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,300
You're very busy every day.

914
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,220
You should have breakfast.

915
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,540
You may just go by yourself later.

916
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,280
I'll go and see your mom

917
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,620
and come back alone.

918
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,340
You don't need to worry about me.

919
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,260
Why?

920
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,150
Are you planning to stay here for long?

921
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:01,850
No.

922
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,470
Your grandmother's condition

923
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,700
has become stabilized.

924
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,790
The doctor said

925
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,710
that she just needs

926
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,700
to stay at home for recuperation.

927
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,260
I come to take care of your mom.

928
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,920
But you can't

929
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,100
stay at Liu Nianbai's place.

930
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,260
I want to stay at your place.

931
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,120
But

932
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,440
your place

933
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,430
only has one room

934
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,490
and it's in the basement.

935
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,560
How could I live there?

936
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,850
You've made yourself at home.

937
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,430
His place is big and comfortable.

938
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,270
Why don't you ask who has a villa

939
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,060
for you to stay?

940
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,890
It's someone else's house no matter how big it is.

941
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,600
It's not your house.

942
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,770
How is it someone else's house?

943
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,470
Liu told me

944
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,730
that you're together now.

945
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,210
This is the house of my son-in-law.

946
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,980
There are

947
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,870
two bedrooms here.

948
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,570
Just let Uncle stay here for the moment.

949
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,610
-I'm okay with that.
-Shut up.

950
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,580
Do you think I want this?

951
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,130
Your grandmother is so angry with you

952
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,800
that her heart condition is worsening.

953
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,740
That has costed me a lot of money.

954
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,040
Your mom's medical bills

955
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,590
are due soon.

956
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,650
Where do I get the money to stay in a hotel?

957
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,660
We're really going to be late.

958
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,989
Let's go to work first

959
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,770
and talk about this later.

960
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,020
Let's go.

961
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,540
Come on.

962
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,659
I'll find him a place

963
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,400
as soon as possible.

964
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,610
We're family. Just let him stay there.

965
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:35,560
Family?

966
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,460
I'm ready

967
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,520
to be with you forever.

968
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,750
Tell me that

969
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,960
you're not thinking differently.

970
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,690
Why do you suddenly say that?

971
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,150
Nothing.

972
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,630
Don't take it as a burden.

973
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,469
Even as a friend,

974
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,719
it's the right thing

975
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,929
to share a place

976
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,830
and help you

977
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,100
when you're in trouble.

978
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,870
This has nothing to do with burden.

979
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,230
If my father

980
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,840
stays at your house and won't leave,

981
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,720
you would know the consequences.

982
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,690
I just don't want to get you into trouble.

983
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,300
You see,

984
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,510
she looks healthy.

985
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,450
But why couldn't she wake up?

986
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,440
Your mom

987
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,470
likes the baby, too.

988
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,220
Of course.

989
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,120
All mothers like their babies.

990
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:44,970
Only men

991
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,840
easily get a child,

992
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,190
but they are not satisfied

993
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,380
and don't cherish what they have.

994
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,770
I don't want to argue with you

995
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,590
in front of your mom.

996
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,920
Maybe she could hear us

997
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,100
and wake up

998
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,940
to stop us from fighting each other.

999
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,930
After all,

1000
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,290
she doesn't want to see us arguing

1001
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,610
and doesn't want me to hate you.

1002
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,780
If you were not so self-willed,

1003
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,330
this wouldn't have happened.

1004
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,550
Now I just

1005
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,220
want the baby

1006
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,330
to be born soon.

1007
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Maybe she would wake up

1008
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,160
when she hears the baby's cry.

1009
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,660
Have a shrimp.

1010
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,100
Come on,

1011
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,320
have a fried chicken wing.

1012
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,280
I've made up my mind.

1013
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,010
I'll use my savings to pay for

1014
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,750
the treatment of Li Junxiao's sister.

1015
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,580
Sweetie,

1016
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,020
do you have that many savings?

1017
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,950
After divorcing Feng Yuanhang,

1018
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,810
we sold the house

1019
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,850
and each got half of the proceeds.

1020
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,690
Congrui,

1021
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,550
I'm not disapproving of you.

1022
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,230
But if you spend the money

1023
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,590
and Li becomes penniless,

1024
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,740
where and how would you live

1025
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,660
after getting married?

1026
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,530
As long as you like him

1027
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,660
and he is a good man and capable,

1028
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,230
we don't worry about

1029
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,280
your future life.

1030
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,070
Right.

1031
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,250
We are not snobbish.

1032
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,290
We just don't want you to live a hard life.

1033
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,740
You're about thirty

1034
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,580
and haven't earned a title.

1035
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,670
After getting married,

1036
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,100
you can't get pregnant so soon.

1037
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:40,960
As time goes fast,

1038
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,020
you'd become an elderly parturient woman.

1039
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,830
These are all inter-connected.

1040
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,660
There would be many hard days ahead.

1041
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,400
Father,

1042
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,180
I'm no longer a kid.

1043
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,910
I've thought about

1044
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,950
all what you just said.

1045
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,610
At the moment,

1046
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,350
Li Junxiao is facing

1047
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,530
the biggest obstacle in his life.

1048
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,710
I'm his girlfriend.

1049
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,340
If I don't help him, who would?

1050
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,630
I've also realized

1051
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,700
that I might live a hard life in the future.

1052
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,940
Or maybe the two of us

1053
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,330
would go our separate ways.

1054
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,370
But you always told me

1055
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,610
to do

1056
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,070
what I should do.

1057
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,850
If you were me,

1058
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,860
what would you do?

1059
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,690
What else would he do?

1060
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,710
Your father would surely choose to help.

1061
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,860
When your grandfather

1062
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,510
got sick,

1063
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,980
he would love to live in our house.

1064
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,490
Then I have to believe

1065
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,530
a good heart can earn good rewards.

1066
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,680
Just do what you think is right.

1067
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:34,780
In my opinion,

1068
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,170
you could get married sooner.

1069
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,660
When you're a couple,

1070
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,230
you could be of one mind

1071
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,470
and don't have to worry about others.

1072
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,950
When you're free,

1073
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,710
you bring him home.

1074
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,340
Then we can discuss it.

1075
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,770
You choose the wedding place

1076
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,860
and we will cover the expenses.

1077
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,390
You're so generous.

1078
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,970
I'll work hard to make money.

1079
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,550
And I'll no longer

1080
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,420
buy so many clothes.

1081
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,550
Okay, let's have the meal.

1082
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,500
Hello, this is your takeout.

1083
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,140
Thank you.

1084
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,190
Please give me a positive comment.

1085
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:11,890
Thank you.

1086
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,100
Uncle, the takeout is here.

1087
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,240
Yeah.

1088
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,420
It's really good to live in a big city.

1089
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,570
Home delivery is offered for everything.

1090
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,190
Back in our time,

1091
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,300
parents cared most about

1092
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,100
whether their daughters-in-law

1093
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,580
could cook.

1094
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,960
They were most worried about

1095
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,430
having a daughter-in-law

1096
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,990
who couldn't cook for their son.

1097
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,620
It's good now.

1098
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,680
Hot meals can be delivered to your house.

1099
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,860
There's no need to cook for yourself.

1100
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,020
By the way, Liu,

1101
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,820
do you have wine?

1102
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:47,900
Just have a drink with me.

1103
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,700
Uncle, I don't drink.

1104
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,150
But if you like,

1105
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,140
I can drink water

1106
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,900
and have a toast with you.

1107
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,000
Why don't you drink?

1108
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,770
I'm allergic to wine.

1109
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,660
There is only one bottle of alcohol,

1110
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,840
and it's from a friend.

1111
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,480
Uncle, cheers!

1112
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:07,840
Cheers.

1113
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,950
It's good.

1114
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,370
It's good.

1115
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,840
It's been a long time

1116
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,380
since I had such a good drink.

1117
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,020
Liu,

1118
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,220
thank you.

1119
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,140
You're welcome.

1120
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,580
Thank you for buying me the underwear

1121
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,060
and sleepers

1122
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,180
as well as my necessities.

1123
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,490
You are

1124
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,690
taking good care of me.

1125
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,000
Du Di is so lucky

1126
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,840
to have you with her.

1127
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,330
OK.

1128
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,130
Uncle,

1129
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,380
what was Du Di like

1130
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,500
when she was a child?

1131
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,240
Can you tell me about her?

1132
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:47,810
Stubborn.

1133
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,940
She's as stubborn as a cow.

1134
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,560
Who would come at this late hour?

1135
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,210
Could it be Du Di?

1136
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,460
She is on a night shift.

1137
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,440
What are you doing here?

1138
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,870
I'm your father.

1139
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,080
Can't I come?

1140
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,500
I haven't come

1141
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,030
since you're back.

1142
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,140
I'm stopping by

1143
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,460
to check on you.

1144
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,960
What needs to be checked on me?

1145
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,870
I'm doing fine.

1146
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,660
Isn't this Director Liu?

1147
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,860
What a surprise to see you here!

1148
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,460
Come in, come in.

1149
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,560
Come in, please.

1150
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,530
You are…

1151
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,860
I'm Du Di's father.

1152
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,600
What are you doing here?

1153
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,340
I'm living here.

1154
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,700
You're living here?

1155
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,410
Yes.

1156
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,690
Come on, let's have a drink.

1157
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,500
Come on.

1158
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,070
My son has never

1159
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,230
had a drink with me like this.

1160
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,220
Well,

1161
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,430
Nianbai

1162
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,050
is really good to me.

1163
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,810
He's taking good care of me.

1164
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,180
You're taking good care of

1165
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,330
someone else's father,

1166
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,240
while giving your own father

1167
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,940
the cold shoulder.

1168
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,060
Have you had dinner?

1169
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,420
Do you want to have it with us?

1170
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,540
No.

1171
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,660
I've got something to do. I got to go.

1172
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,170
Are you leaving so soon?

1173
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,080
He just arrived.

1174
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,860
Why doesn't he stay for a while?

1175
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,570
Did I

1176
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,270
say any wrong words?

1177
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:26,940
Don't care about him.

1178
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,990
Dr. Feng.

1179
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:36,900
Director Huang.

1180
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,610
Thank you

1181
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,860
for coming early in the morning for consultation.

1182
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,720
Don't be so polite. That's what I should do.

1183
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,740
I'm…

1184
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,080
You used to say

1185
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,960
that you're a family member.

1186
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,240
Therefore,

1187
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,740
you came more often

1188
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,600
than other neonatologists.

1189
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,930
It's all for Congrui.

1190
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,860
She is careless

1191
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,210
and I was worried about her.

1192
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,960
But now I don't need to worry about her

1193
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,790
since I'm no longer a family.

1194
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,670
Did you tell her

1195
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,970
about that?
