[Episode 13]

4
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,740
I'm out of here.

5
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,820
No, no, no.

6
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,250
I'll go. I'll go.

7
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,150
Still, I have to leave.

8
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,530
Or you can stay.

9
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,259
I'm going now.

10
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:44,960
I can't stay here.

11
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,740
I was going to leave.

12
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,920
You haven't finished your wine.

13
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,130
I was wondering why these stitches

14
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,240
looked so familiar.

15
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,860
So it was Du Di.

16
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,610
It's another misunderstanding.

17
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,290
It's fine, I get it.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,040
Everything starts with misunderstandings.

19
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,170
Explain to Dr. Lin.

20
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,259
She was drunk at that time

21
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,360
and slept in my home.

22
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,390
What are you saying?

23
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,310
Then what should I say?

24
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,660
Shut up. Keep silent

25
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,290
from now on.

26
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,350
Take your time.

27
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,090
I'm leaving.

28
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,510
No, Dr. Lin.

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,220
It's not what you think.

30
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,980
Hold on. Hold on.

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,540
It's coming soon!

32
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,870
I'm giving up! I'm giving up!

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,770
Okay. Okay. Okay.

34
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,240
What can we do, doctor?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,460
Hold on, please.

36
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,940
No contractions now.

37
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,550
Don't cry.

38
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,230
Hang in there.

39
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,780
You're crying too hard to give birth.

40
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,260
No.

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,150
Coming. Coming.

42
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,740
Push. Push.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,180
Push.

44
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,210
Push.

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,870
Don't cry.

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,180
Push hard here.

47
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,540
I'm giving up.

48
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,880
No more babies after this.

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,500
No more.

50
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,440
-You didn't follow what I said.
-I'll take it.

51
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,370
Honey.

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:10,880
Here you are.

53
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,790
Don't cry.

54
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,730
Don't cry. Don't cry.

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,400
Take a deep breath.

56
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,500
Stop your tears.

57
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,220
Then try to feel

58
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,950
the baby is dropping down.

59
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,150
He is also in a hurry,

60
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,720
right?

61
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,860
If you really feel tough,

62
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,130
you can grab anywhere

63
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,220
to distract your attention,

64
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:24,630
okay?

65
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,140
Honey, don't.

66
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,180
Push. Push.

67
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,800
Coming. Coming. Coming.

68
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,500
Push.

69
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,290
Okay.

70
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:31,730
Honey.

71
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,530
Honey.

72
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,220
Honey.

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:33,960
If...

74
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,770
If you feel painful,

75
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,030
grab my hand.

76
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,980
Don't grab the doctor.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,170
The head is coming out. Push again.

78
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,079
Honey. Come on!

79
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,550
Good. Good.

80
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,490
Coming. Coming. Coming.

81
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,140
Honey.

82
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,840
Sorry. Sorry.

83
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,930
I'm really sorry.

84
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,250
Doctor,

85
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,300
it hurt when she grabbed me.

86
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:09,850
I couldn't control it.

87
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,290
Are you all right?

88
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,090
It's good that we get the baby.

89
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you okay?

90
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,720
You follow up.

91
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,700
I'm going out to take a breath.

92
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,050
Are you really okay, doctor?

93
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,220
You're quite sturdy.

94
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm really sorry.

95
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,200
Honey, thank you.

96
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,370
Why are you copying me?

97
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,500
I am not.

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,230
I got hurt.

99
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,510
Why did you get hurt?

100
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,350
No reason.

101
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,460
I just got it.

102
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,890
It's not funny.

103
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,090
Liu Nianbai.

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,190
Don't think no one can stop you

105
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,910
just because

106
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,020
you have Director Tian to protect you.

107
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,390
I am not copying you.

108
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,420
I really got hurt.

109
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,570
I'm leaving, okay?

110
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,530
Persecutory delusion.

111
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,210
This index is too low.

112
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,420
Go and check it, okay?

113
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,780
What's up?

114
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,060
Well, what happened last night?

115
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,870
I got hurt last night.

116
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,650
You know it.

117
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,340
Why should I know?

118
00:05:59,370 --> 00:05:59,820
I left earlier.

119
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,090
I can understand. Young people.

120
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,180
Exciting.

121
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,040
I got hurt before you left.

122
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,780
Don't get it wrong.

123
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,270
These kinds of misunderstandings

124
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,580
are all plots of trash scripts.

125
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,500
Can you say that you don't have

126
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,010
any thoughts about Du Di?

127
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,540
No.

128
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,890
Stop lying.

129
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,850
You've been like this since you were a kid.

130
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,510
Roll your eyes when you are lying.

131
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,190
After I grew up,

132
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,220
I learned to roll my eyes

133
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,640
when I am telling the truth.

134
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,860
Fine.

135
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:27,800
If that's true,

136
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,710
I'll let everyone know that

137
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,210
last night, Liu Nianbai...

138
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,630
Shut up!

139
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,140
How much will you pay me?

140
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,770
One hundred.

141
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,320
How much?

142
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,080
Five hundred.

143
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,620
Okay.

144
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,330
Five hundred, yeah?

145
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,270
I'll talk with Wang Ying.

146
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,500
You name the price.

147
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,110
Dark blue. M990.

148
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,720
Navy blue. Four colors.

149
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,510
A fresh one.

150
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,840
-That's a lot, bro.
-Yeah.

151
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,510
I also think that's a lot.

152
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,909
Right?

153
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,380
Head Nurse? Head...

154
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:51,460
Deal.

155
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,880
You called me, Dr. Lin?

156
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,230
Well,

157
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,350
I think

158
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,820
you've been working quite hard recently.

159
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,409
I wanna treat you to dinner.

160
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,390
Will wonders never cease?

161
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,140
Or it's a conspiracy?

162
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,690
Come, come. Let's talk over there.

163
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,380
Mercury retrograde recently?

164
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,470
What's up?

165
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,190
My foot was stepped hardly

166
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,360
by the maternity's husband.

167
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,710
And the back of my neck

168
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,900
was grabbed hardly.

169
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,820
I think I've been

170
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,480
honorably wounded

171
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,530
for the next generation of our country.

172
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,440
Who grabbed it?

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,340
The maternity.

174
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,010
Let me see.

175
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,550
Oh my gosh.

176
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,350
She grabbed so hard.

177
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,180
And you are still kidding now?

178
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,540
Let me dress your wound.

179
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,730
Hang in there.

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,490
Don't you think Liu Nianbai

181
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,420
is so boring?

182
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,159
I am limping and he walked like me.

183
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,720
He is always like a kid.

184
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,720
Simple-minded.

185
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,470
I don't think so.

186
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,740
People who pretend to be naive are the most dangerous one.

187
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,610
I got hurt, too.

188
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,180
From cervical to caudal spine.

189
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,740
You wanna know why?

190
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,870
It was so embarrassing.

191
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Don't ask.

192
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,650
Liu Nianbai.

193
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,030
Go to the laboratory to

194
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,070
remind them of the blood routine for No.21 bed.

195
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,620
It's urgent.

196
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,770
Can you be quick?

197
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,820
My caudal spine hurts.

198
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,500
I can't be quick.

199
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:39,900
Forget it. I'll go.

200
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,169
Good for nothing.

201
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Let me check your foot.

202
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,260
No. No. No need.

203
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,180
No need.

204
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,050
Let me have a look.

205
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,780
It's so serious.

206
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,860
Hang in there.

207
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,560
Hang in. Hang in.

208
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,730
Poor boy, nobody cares about me.

209
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,820
How's your mum?

210
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,110
I didn't ask.

211
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,820
I think

212
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,050
you need to ask more.

213
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,530
Though they make you sad,

214
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,260
they are still your parents.

215
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,730
They are old now.

216
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,600
Many decisions and ideas they have

217
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,990
can't follow the age.

218
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,160
You should understand them.

219
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
And push her

220
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,840
to have regular antenatal care,

221
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,280
and those supplements

222
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,390
on time.

223
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,240
Don't worry.

224
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,770
My dad must be

225
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,890
feeding her

226
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,550
like a queen now.

227
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,200
When did you become

228
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,610
so confident about your father?

229
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,580
I know

230
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,780
what he cares about.

231
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:42,620
Forget it.

232
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,210
I have no appetite now that you mentioned them.

233
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,630
When are you going to move?

234
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,640
Tonight.

235
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,540
Tonight?

236
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,110
Why didn't you say it earlier?

237
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,090
I have a night shift

238
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,320
at the E.R. tonight.

239
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,510
I'll go ask them to see

240
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,210
if I can change the shift.

241
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,180
It's okay.

242
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,460
I've booked a moving company.

243
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,380
Even if you are with me,

244
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,700
we'll just clean up some pieces.

245
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,380
I just need to run my errands.

246
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,540
Congrui,

247
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,650
are you moving tonight?

248
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,830
I've changed my shift

249
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,390
with a chief resident.

250
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,700
I'll go to help you tonight.

251
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,550
It's okay.

252
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,350
I've booked a moving company.

253
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,780
I didn't even ask Du Di for help.

254
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,710
But you need someone

255
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,580
to keep an eye on the moving company.

256
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,700
I've changed the shift.

257
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,740
I'll go to help you tonight.

258
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,700
No...

259
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,980
Well, I... No...

260
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,610
Do you mind if

261
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,430
Junxiao helps me with moving?

262
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,450
Of course not.

263
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,720
Anyway, I can't go tonight.

264
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,900
With his help,

265
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,800
things will be easier for you.

266
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,010
Do you think

267
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,700
he changes

268
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,880
to another person

269
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,570
after breakup?

270
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,850
Why?

271
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,290
What he didn't do before,

272
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,800
he is willing to do it after breakup.

273
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,540
The bad habits he didn't change before,

274
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,120
he changes them after.

275
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,820
You mean about the moving?

276
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
I moved many times before.

277
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,670
Every time he said

278
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,640
he wouldn't go

279
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,280
since I didn't have much stuff.

280
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,330
This is the first time I see that

281
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,330
he is so considerate.

282
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,130
Maybe because I helped him

283
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,040
dress his wound.

284
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,500
He just wanna thank me.

285
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,420
Are these all yours?

286
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,590
Kind of.

287
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,040
I gave these to him.

288
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,160
I folded these stars.

289
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,530
When I gave to them him,

290
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,580
he said I wasted time

291
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,110
and I should have

292
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,540
read two more essays during that time.

293
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,650
There was a time

294
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,740
I saw he was watching

295
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,510
Chopper from One Piece.

296
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,800
I thought he liked it.

297
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,420
So I bought this garage kit for him.

298
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,430
Then he said

299
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,030
he heard that Chopper was a doctor.

300
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,580
So he wanted to see how Chopper had surgery,

301
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,780
and it was a pity that

302
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,610
Chopper made a lot of mistakes.

303
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,170
I also bought a lot of discs

304
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,430
of House M.D.

305
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,950
He watched in earnest

306
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,860
and even wrote many papers.

307
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,190
He said he was going to record

308
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,400
all the problems of surgeries

309
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,040
in the TV

310
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,760
and to avoid them.

311
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,030
Anyway, he is

312
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,860
so weird.

313
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,370
But you just love

314
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,280
this weird guy.

315
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,660
I adore him.

316
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,860
He was number one in the grade.

317
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,530
But he chose the most difficult neonatology.

318
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,150
I like children.

319
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,530
Every day I saw him saved

320
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,820
so many new-born lives,

321
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,870
he was like an angel.

322
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
So what did he have for you?

323
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,590
He didn't give

324
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,790
these kinds of things to me.

325
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,160
The best things he had for me

326
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,980
were some medical textbooks

327
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,480
and some surgical videos.

328
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,260
And

329
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,250
he got me a box of tampons.

330
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,480
He said they were practical.

331
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,660
And because of that,

332
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,850
I was laughed at by my classmates

333
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,050
for many years.

334
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,340
They often said,

335
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,030
"How's your Mr. Tampon,

336
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,030
bla bla..."

337
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,220
Is this umbrella from him?

338
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,060
Why it is here?

339
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,380
Maybe he picked me up one day

340
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,370
when it was raining

341
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,990
and I just left it here.

342
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,220
Don't get wet.

343
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,470
You'll get a cold.

344
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,010
Just a little bit.

345
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,140
I can go back and wipe myself.

346
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,410
Just wait until the rain eases up.

347
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,320
Or later

348
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Feng Yuanhang would come to pick us.

349
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,580
How long do we need to wait?

350
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,940
I'm in a hurry to get back to my revision.

351
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,690
Could you please

352
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,980
care more about yourself?

353
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,420
Girls should not be like this.

354
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,220
You need to ask for the guys' help.

355
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,890
Look.

356
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,020
I can do what man can do, either.

357
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,410
You wait for Feng Yuanhang.

358
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:18,800
I'm leaving.

359
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:21,910
Du Di.

360
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,980
You tomboy!

361
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,660
Junxiao,

362
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,100
are you coming to the library?

363
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,740
It's going to be closed.

364
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,500
That's okay.

365
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,380
I'll just look for the info and then leave.

366
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,890
You don't have an umbrella?

367
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,500
Take mine.

368
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,180
Then what about you?

369
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,660
It's okay.

370
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,060
My friend is inside.

371
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,920
I can take his.

372
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,150
Okay.

373
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,710
If Du Di left two minutes later,

374
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,640
she would not get wet.

375
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,420
Then I'll take it.

376
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,410
I'll give it back to you someday.

377
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,490
Thank you.

378
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,810
Just keep it.

379
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,580
How about these?

380
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,230
Give them to me.

381
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,530
Did you say you would not

382
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,250
come back tonight?

383
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,870
I come to see

384
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,980
if there is anything I can do.

385
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,460
No need.

386
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,330
You didn't like

387
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,630
these stuff before.

388
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,460
I'll throw them away later

389
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,270
on my way downstairs later.

390
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,420
You bought them for me.

391
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,500
Keep them for me.

392
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,190
Okay.

393
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,730
We're all packed up.

394
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,520
Junxiao, let's go.

395
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,140
Congrui.

396
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,810
What?

397
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,590
I wanna tell you something.

398
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,210
You mean about work?

399
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,500
They rejected you before

400
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,220
purely because they were worried about me.

401
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,760
I've told them already

402
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,650
to stop being like that to you.

403
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,820
If you don't feel good,

404
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,990
I apologize on their behalf.

405
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,600
That's not what I want to say.

406
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,630
Then what it is?

407
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,860
I'll go out to wait for you.

408
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,490
Come here.

409
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,860
Congrui,

410
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,030
can we talk?

411
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,770
Talk about what? We are divorced.

412
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,830
I've figured it out.

413
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,710
I shouldn't have said yes

414
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,480
when you wanted to divorce.

415
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,120
I regret it now.

416
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,560
Feng Yuanhang.

417
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,760
We are adults.

418
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,060
We need to be responsible for our decisions.

419
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,150
You said before that

420
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,220
I could take the house.

421
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,020
No.

422
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,329
Half to half.

423
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,680
Let me know when you sell it out.

424
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,579
I'll go to my mum's house now.

425
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,130
Can... can I say a few more words?

426
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,010
Just a couple of sentences.

427
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,300
When I was pregnant,

428
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,980
I wished you could be

429
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,900
as happy as me.

430
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,400
But you didn't.

431
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,579
Then I had a miscarriage.

432
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,890
I was so sad that

433
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,350
I hoped you could comfort me

434
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,450
or say something to me.

435
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,410
But you didn't.

436
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,200
Then after,

437
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,900
I wanted to have a baby again.

438
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,090
It was okay if you didn't want to.

439
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,890
But you had a vasectomy.

440
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,660
Well,

441
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,060
now we are divorced,

442
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,170
suddenly that

443
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,150
you wanna say something?

444
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,020
No.

445
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
I... I... I...

446
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,710
That was not the reason

447
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,940
I had a vasectomy.

448
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,140
I know you resent me.

449
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,330
Is it possible that

450
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,410
we could restore?

451
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,140
No.

452
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,690
Why aren't you drooling?

453
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,700
Otherwise, I can blackmail you.

454
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,510
You wish.

455
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,100
You are not sleeping?

456
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,920
You thought everyone was like you?

457
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Simple-minded.

458
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,220
Even thunder can't disturb your sleep.

459
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,480
I envy you.

460
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,890
Didn't you go to

461
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,430
help Congrui to move?

462
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,100
Why?

463
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,310
Li Junxiao went to help her.

464
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,260
So I didn't need to go.

465
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,440
The chief resident is so busy.

466
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,100
And he could even ask for a leave to move?

467
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,720
Right?

468
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,920
Do you also think

469
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,750
he is too considerate?

470
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,580
I think there must be something wrong.

471
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,820
That's not quite true.

472
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,050
He just helped a co-worker.

473
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,140
If you are moving,

474
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,970
I would help you also.

475
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,620
Thanks but no.

476
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,110
Last time I was misunderstood

477
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,060
by Dr. Lin in your home.

478
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,270
It's not even explained yet.

479
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,900
If you can't explain it, then forget it.

480
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,540
Why be so tired?

481
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,160
You thought everyone was like you?

482
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,290
Shameless.

483
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,750
I don't want

484
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,740
the superiors to think

485
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,660
that my personal life was not good.

486
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,680
Look what you said.

487
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,830
Why it was not good

488
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,140
when you were with me?

489
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,330
Okay. I'll explain it to him.

490
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,780
No.

491
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,280
You'll only make it worse.

492
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,440
You've worked for a whole day

493
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,180
and you are on the night shift.

494
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,370
There is nobody in the emergency now.

495
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,020
You can go to the break room to have a rest.

496
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:02,950
Superior doctors

497
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,860
are all there.

498
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,030
If there is any complex case,

499
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,540
I'll call you.

500
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,100
OK.

501
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,000
I am going to take a nap.

502
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,310
For the lab test report,

503
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,250
just give it to me to sign.

504
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,930
If there is anything

505
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,510
you can't deal with,

506
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,060
call me ASAP.

507
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,140
Relax, Senior.

508
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,390
I promise I'll get the job done.

509
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,930
Hi, patient.

510
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,060
Is it not polite

511
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,800
to call her

512
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,870
a patient when she just comes?

513
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,480
Hi, lady.

514
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,660
Sounds not good also.

515
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,060
Hi...

516
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,340
Come in, please.

517
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,980
Come. Come.

518
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,410
Take a seat, please.

519
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,490
Doctor, this is her medical record.

520
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,200
Lu Mengyao.

521
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,830
Anything not good?

522
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,580
She said she has a stomach ache.

523
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,550
Tell the doctor what is not good.

524
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,340
Doctor, I....

525
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,620
I have dysmenorrhea.

526
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,760
Did you have it before?

527
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,860
Quite often.

528
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,790
But it is worse this time.

529
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,470
I can't even sleep.

530
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,130
When was your last period?

531
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,570
Two... two months ago.

532
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,730
Irregular like this before?

533
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,540
A little bit.

534
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,770
What was the amount of bleeding?

535
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,200
More... more than before.

536
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,130
Where do you feel pain?

537
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,180
Here.

538
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,530
Come and I'll do a check.

539
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,710
How?

540
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,720
Just press with my hands

541
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,030
to make sure the location.

542
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,950
Do you have a female doctor here?

543
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,220
We don't have many doctors on the night shift.

544
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,360
Let me do a check

545
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,990
for her first.

546
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,770
Then don't close the curtain.

547
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:26,950
I'm sorry.

548
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,360
I have to close it when I check.

549
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,520
Just wait a moment.

550
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,940
It is gonna be over soon.

551
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,450
Here?

552
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,660
No.

553
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:43,860
Here?

554
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,440
A little bit.

555
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:46,940
Here.

556
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,610
It's here.

557
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,530
Did you have sex

558
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,570
in these two months?

559
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,330
What are you saying?

560
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,810
My daughter is just in her junior year.

561
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,780
What you said

562
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,460
is like a hoodlum.

563
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,420
Sorry. Sorry.

564
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,380
I'll correct my words.

565
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,790
Did you sleep with somebody

566
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,700
in the two months?

567
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,230
Anything different?

568
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,330
Calm down.

569
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,510
All O.B.s

570
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,340
need to ask this question.

571
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,270
Relax.

572
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,220
Is this your first time to O&G?

573
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,250
You can't ask this question

574
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,220
no matter if it's my first time or not.

575
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,290
Well.

576
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,220
Since your daughter

577
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,470
didn't have a period for two months,

578
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,940
it might be dysmenorrhea

579
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,060
or ectopic pregnancy.

580
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,900
Doctors need to check it.

581
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,240
This is the regular process.

582
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,310
Please understand.

583
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,280
I can't understand.

584
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,040
Let's do this.

585
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,450
You give me some pills for dysmenorrhea.

586
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,910
We are not going to be checked, okay?

587
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,000
Your daughter is 20 years old.

588
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,860
She is an adult.

589
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,330
I need to know this

590
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,230
just to be safe.

591
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:47,860
Well,

592
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,460
can you understand what I said?

593
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,490
You are doubting

594
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,800
my daughter's personal life now?

595
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,030
Tell him.

596
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,810
Did you have it or not?

597
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,290
Yes or no?

598
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,970
Say it.

599
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,720
I didn't.

600
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,980
Never?

601
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,300
Never.

602
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,300
The most difficult problem of a patient

603
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,670
is lying instead of illness.

604
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,050
Some because they are ashamed to talk about it.

605
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,420
Some just wanna bluff it out.

606
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,460
In O&G,

607
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,150
if you see a young girl

608
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,380
comes to consulting room with stomach ache,

609
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,950
you must check

610
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,620
the HCG

611
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,720
to rule out pregnancy.

612
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,800
Because they would not tell you

613
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,000
honestly their sex life histories.

614
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,060
Especially the girls

615
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,490
accompanied by their parents or teacher.

616
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,690
The younger she is, the more important the test is.

617
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,060
What if the patient doesn't want to take it?

618
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,950
Find an excuse.

619
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,340
This is for her own good.

620
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,060
I had a similar situation before

621
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,950
when I followed a superior doctor to visit.

622
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,020
I met five or six cases in two years.

623
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,400
This is for the patient.

624
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,120
Because the sudden mortality of

625
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,420
ectopic pregnancy is very high.

626
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,340
As a doctor,

627
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,460
we must give

628
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,140
priority to their lives.

629
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,440
Take a blood test first.

630
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,330
Blood test for dysmenorrhea?

631
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,770
Do you think we know nothing?

632
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,490
Considering the location

633
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,380
your daughter feels hurt,

634
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,270
it's not the location

635
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,090
dysmenorrhea usually happens.

636
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,520
It is possible that something is inflamed.

637
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,580
So taking a blood test

638
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,540
is safer.

639
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,510
Please wait a moment.

640
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,910
I'll have the superior doctor sign it.

641
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,230
Have the superior doctor sign it.

642
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,460
I told you to bear it up

643
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,820
and see a specialist tomorrow

644
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,280
to have a better check.

645
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,190
Now you met a young doctor

646
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,940
like this.

647
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,870
But I can't bear it up.

648
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,750
Press it.

649
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,730
Wait a moment over there.

650
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,840
There are not many patients at night,

651
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,390
so the result

652
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,220
should be got soon.

653
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,920
Okay.

654
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,930
You didn't get married secretly, did you?

655
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,980
No.

656
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,900
It's fine.

657
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,320
Your mum died young.

658
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,710
If there is something,

659
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,620
you have to tell me.

660
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,090
I know.

661
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,100
Here is the result.

662
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,310
Take it.

663
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,030
[Human Chorionic Gonadotropin 12000]

664
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,590
I'll ask you one more time.

665
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,870
Did you have sex before?

666
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
She told you already.

667
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,510
And you keep asking.

668
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,980
Do you wanna take advantage of her?

669
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,500
Here is the case.

670
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,050
Since she is inflamed

671
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,130
a little bit now,

672
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,420
we need to do an ultrasound

673
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,060
just in case.

674
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,460
Doctor.

675
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,020
Is this ultrasound

676
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,940
a must?

677
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,660
Do I have to do it?

678
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,730
You just give us

679
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,710
some medicine for dysmenorrhea now.

680
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,100
We are not going to take any checks.

681
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,300
I think

682
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,420
you take too many checks.

683
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,330
If you keep doing that,

684
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,910
I'll go to the TV station to expose you.

685
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,630
Doctors need to make sure the patient

686
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,580
has no risk at all.

687
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:05,730
Are you going to prescribe it or not?

688
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,700
I can't for now.

689
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,840
Then I'll change a hospital.

690
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,020
You can't leave.

691
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,910
It'll be dangerous for her if she leaves.

692
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,460
Let's go.

693
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,980
Sir.

694
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,600
You can't leave now.

695
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,610
May I have a talk

696
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,900
with your daughter alone?

697
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,880
You are just a hooligan doctor.

698
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,650
You just want to get something from her.

699
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,500
Let's go, Mengyao.

700
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,050
Don't.

701
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,420
Your daughter is in danger now.

702
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,940
Please, let me explain.

703
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,900
-Move away.
-Calm down.

704
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,670
You can't leave now.

705
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,420
Here it is.

706
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,220
I'll go to let the superior doctor

707
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,790
explain to you,

708
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,230
okay?

709
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,050
I'll call the police

710
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,760
if you keep doing that.

711
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:40,700
Let's go.

712
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,090
What was so annoying just now?

713
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,740
The girl who took the blood test,

714
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,540
did you get her result?

715
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,040
I got it.

716
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,400
She said she didn't have a sex life before.

717
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,180
But her HCG

718
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:01,690
is 12,000.

719
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,770
Ectopic pregnancy.

720
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:03,780
Where is she?

721
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,950
I couldn't say she is pregnant

722
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,940
when she was with her father.

723
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,880
So I wanted to ask her alone.

724
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:07,980
But her dad

725
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,900
didn't allow it.

726
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,910
He dragged her to run away.

727
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,890
Why didn't you tell me?

728
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,020
Did I say that

729
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,070
for the thing you can't deal with,

730
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,780
you need to let me know.

731
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,730
She ran away

732
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,250
before I told you.

733
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,780
Do you know that

734
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,460
this could be fatal?

735
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,500
How long have they left?

736
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,010
Just now.

737
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,630
Let's chase them.

738
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,720
They must have driven away.

739
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,540
Liu Nianbai.

740
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,170
Are you so desperate to prove yourself?

741
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,150
Where did you get the confidence that

742
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,450
you can handle this on your own?

743
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,120
I didn't do it to prove myself.

744
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,400
I was going to look for you,

745
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,090
but I didn't have time.

746
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,260
Her father was so harsh

747
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,640
that she couldn't even tell the truth.

748
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,730
I was afraid that if I tell them the truth,

749
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,800
her father would be mad.

750
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,800
Which one is more important?

751
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,710
Her father's madness or her life?

752
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,890
Liu Nianbai. Let me tell you.

753
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,070
If you can't

754
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,580
find her back today,

755
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,500
get the heck out of O&G.

756
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,390
She should have left her photo number.

757
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,440
I'll call now.

758
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,380
Hello.

759
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,750
The number you are dialing is not available.

760
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,640
It is a fake number.

761
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,990
The only way we can do is to

762
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,060
search the colleges around here.

763
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,810
Hello? Is that Academic Office

764
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,320
of University of Technology?

765
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,940
I'm a doctor from Shengji Hospital.

766
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,740
Last night,

767
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,910
a junior student

768
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,770
came to us to do a check.

769
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,550
Then we found that

770
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,430
she has a serious illness.

771
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,580
But we can't get in touch with her now.

772
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,420
Her phone number is not correct.

773
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,440
Lu Mengyao.

774
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,030
Female.

775
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,500
M-E-N-G.

776
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,960
Y-A-O.

777
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,140
If you get any information,

778
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,100
please let me know.

779
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,450
Thanks. Thanks.

780
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,940
Sorry to trouble you.

781
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,160
There are

782
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,150
ten universities and colleges

783
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:58,760
within ten kilometers,

784
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,750
I think I didn't miss anyone.

785
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,420
But Shengji is so well-known,

786
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,870
what if

787
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,260
they came from a far college?

788
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,730
I have to expand

789
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,510
the range.

790
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,660
Searching like this

791
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,820
is just like looking for a needle in the ocean.

792
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,020
For a patient like this,

793
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,040
she should be responsible for herself

794
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,500
when she left the hospital.

795
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,160
When she suffers something,

796
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,800
she gonna knows.

797
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,430
Even if you find her,

798
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,020
she won't admit it.

799
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,820
But I think my senior

800
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,690
is right.

801
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,710
Her life matters more.

802
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,610
So we should try our best.

803
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,180
You...

804
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,490
Okay. Fine.

805
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,540
Your senior is always right.

806
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,460
That's true.

807
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,010
Hey, Li Junxiao.

808
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,180
Dr. Li.

809
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,350
The patient in No.3 bed. Her cervix

810
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,100
is open about 3cm,

811
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,800
with premature rupture of membranes

812
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,670
and a sudden drop in the fetal heart.

813
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,660
I'm coming now.

814
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,600
I'll check it.

815
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,270
Can we have a

816
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,180
female doctor?

817
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,020
Female doctors are quite busy now.

818
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,540
And now

819
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,890
the fetal heart is dropping a lot.

820
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,110
We don't have time to change.

821
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,510
She has never been touched by a male doctor

822
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,820
since she got pregnant.

823
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,840
What a shame.

824
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,350
We are doctors.

825
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,280
And we are professional.

826
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,370
Please understand that.

827
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,640
Please.

828
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,770
If my wife was touched

829
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,620
by an unfamiliar guy,

830
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,100
it'll be a shame on me!

831
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,110
What matters is

832
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,980
your wife and kid's lives,

833
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,780
not your shame.

834
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,990
It's not that serious.

835
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,530
The doctor said

836
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,680
it's just malpresentation.

837
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,150
Nothing more.

838
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,440
Is it not a big deal?

839
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,780
Su Ye.

840
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,910
Take him out.

841
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
I must check now.

842
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,370
Sir.

843
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,620
For your wife and kid's safety,

844
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,420
please understand that.

845
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,120
-This way, please.
-Well...

846
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,900
I just mean that...

847
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,690
Prolapse of cord.

848
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,180
Su Ye.

849
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,820
It's a prolapsed cord.

850
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,510
Prepare for surgery now.

851
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,890
You... What are your hands doing?

852
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,550
The fetus's umbilical cord

853
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,660
is now prolapsing.

854
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,390
I must

855
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,480
push the fetus's head up

856
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,850
to prevent the umbilical cord from being compressed,

857
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,100
causing the fetus to die

858
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,060
from lack of oxygen in the uterus.

859
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,480
You go to tell

860
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,000
Dr. Lin now

861
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,810
to be prepared for the surgery.

862
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,260
Okay.

863
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,710
What... What is going on now?

864
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,220
Doctor,

865
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,500
why is it like this

866
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,570
after your check?

867
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,170
It has nothing to do with the check.

868
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,210
How can I know it's prolapsed cord

869
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,190
without checking?

870
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,960
We need to now have

871
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,800
the C-section.

872
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:08,690
Well...

873
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,350
Stop talking!

874
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,240
Is everything ready?

875
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:21,790
Relax.

876
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,000
As you have a prolapsed umbilical cord,

877
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,240
we can only have you

878
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,270
a local anesthesia

879
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,210
to get the baby ASAP.

880
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,590
The anesthesia will be followed by an immediate incision,

881
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,290
and you may feel pain, okay?

882
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,160
Yes.

883
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,960
I can suffer anything

884
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
to save my baby.

885
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,000
If you're in pain, pinch me harder.

886
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,650
I am afraid.

887
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,420
Don't be afraid.

888
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,850
They will finish it soon.

889
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,790
You need to hold on.

890
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,170
Luckily it's not overly asphyxiated.

891
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,970
It's a boy.

892
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,360
3,420 grams.

893
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,150
Thank you, doctors.

894
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,060
Thank you.

895
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,960
Thanks to all of you.

896
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,950
Thank you.

897
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,610
It's been a long time since we had an urgent battle like this.

898
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,490
Dr. Li, please do the abdominal closure.

899
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,770
You handled it very quickly.

900
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,140
From the finding of the prolapsed umbilical cord

901
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,080
to the delivery of the fetus,

902
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,200
it took less than 10 minutes.

903
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,430
You saved the baby's life.

904
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,050
Good job!

905
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,520
How is it?

906
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,510
The mother and the baby are both well.

907
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,280
It's a boy. 3,420 grams.

908
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,950
Congratulations to be a father!

909
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,820
That's great!

910
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,480
Prolapsed cord, right?

911
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,410
Yes. Prolapsed cord.

912
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,840
It's good that it was caught early.

913
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,030
The intrauterine asphyxia

914
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,020
was not very serious.

915
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,300
Director Huang,

916
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,920
my wife was good before.

917
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:03,950
It prolapsed just after

918
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,380
the male doctor checked on her.

919
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,030
Was the prolapsed cord

920
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,440
resulted by his check?

921
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,330
Do you know where is the cord?

922
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,960
In the uterus with the baby.

923
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,750
Then what kind of check

924
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,540
can get the cord

925
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,659
out of the uterus?

926
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,260
I don't know.

927
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,330
That's why I ask you.

928
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,900
The prolapsed cord

929
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,139
had nothing to do

930
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,260
with Dr. Li's check.

931
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,310
But his check

932
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,300
saved your baby.

933
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,860
If it was found a few minutes later,

934
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,100
the situation cannot be imagined.

935
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,650
You are co-workers.

936
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,600
Of course you would defend him.

937
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:33,909
After he checked,

938
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,139
the trouble happened to my wife.

939
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:35,920
Do you think

940
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,420
he is not responsible for that?

941
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,179
If you don't trust me,

942
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:39,940
let's do this.

943
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,170
If you know

944
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,600
the other O&G doctors in the hospitals,

945
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,929
you can ask them.

946
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,840
There are also consulting doctors

947
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,040
on the internet,

948
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,219
you can ask them

949
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,659
if you don't believe it.

950
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,370
You can also apply for a medical appraising.

951
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,590
Anyway, let me tell you.

952
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,550
The prolapsed cord

953
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,460
has nothing to do

954
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,530
with Dr. Li's check.

955
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,909
I'm sure

956
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,480
I'll check it out.

957
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,650
Let's go.

958
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,070
Senior, I found her.

959
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,500
Lu Mengyao?

960
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,020
Yes.

961
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,840
I made calls

962
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,620
to dozens of colleges.

963
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,690
Before one college was going to check,

964
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,830
they heard a female student

965
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,940
had a haemorrhage and fainted in college.

966
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,330
Her name is Lu Mengyao.

967
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,700
And then they told me immediately.

968
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,480
Now the ambulance

969
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,340
is on the way.

970
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,770
Good. Ask Director Huang to come.

971
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,350
Okay.

972
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,180
Mengyao... It's you again.

973
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,310
Anything wrong?

974
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,660
Lu Mengyao

975
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,320
had a haemorrhage and fainted in college.

976
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,570
She was sent here just now.

977
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,740
We did her a

978
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,010
ultrasound audiovisual examination.

979
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,900
And we found it is not dysmenorrhea,

980
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,730
but cervical pregnancy.

981
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:46,830
What...

982
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,240
What does that mean?

983
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,630
She is pregnant.

984
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,520
However, the fertilized eggs

985
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,350
wasn't settled or develop

986
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,290
in the uterus

987
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,790
but in the cervical canal.

988
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,780
For this case,

989
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,660
we need to have surgery now.

990
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,220
Or it can be life-threatening.

991
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,380
Do you take it wrong?

992
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,090
It's impossible.

993
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,300
She told me before

994
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,440
that she has no boyfriend.

995
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,190
A girl is usually afraid

996
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,750
to tell her father about this.

997
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,330
Please sign the Consent for Operation.

998
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,850
Doctors are waiting inside.

999
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,180
If you don't trust me,

1000
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:14,940
I can have the director here

1001
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,810
to explain to you.

1002
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,860
I trust you. I'll sign it.

1003
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,660
Director Liu,

1004
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,570
this girl is cervical pregnant.

1005
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,910
I'll have to bother

1006
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,160
your intervention department

1007
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:48,630
for the rest of the surgery.

1008
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,340
Director Huang, of course we'll cooperate.

1009
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,330
But the incidence of cervical pregnancy

1010
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,400
is generally less than

1011
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,990
one in 18,000.

1012
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,220
She met with

1013
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,180
such a rare situation.

1014
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,600
That's why there's so much blood.

1015
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,650
Yes.

1016
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,650
This is the unluckiest ectopic pregnancy.

1017
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:01,740
The fertilized egg

1018
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,980
laid in the predominantly fibrous

1019
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,090
cervical region,

1020
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,980
where the smooth muscle of the cervix was poorly contracted

1021
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,440
and the blood vessels could not be closed.

1022
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,930
This kind of haemorrhage

1023
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,790
is very difficult to be controlled.

1024
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,170
We will first consider

1025
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,300
UAE

1026
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,460
to see if the uterus can be preserved.

1027
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,370
Sure. Good.

Tell the Hematology

1029
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,890
to triple the blood reserve.

1030
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,600
Okay.

1031
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,680
The bleeding couldn't be stopped.

1032
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,020
Director Huang, the patient is bleeding too fast.

1033
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,100
I'm afraid there is no time

1034
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,440
to have UAE.

1035
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,330
The cervix is ruptured.

1036
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,500
The bleeding doesn't stop.

1037
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,620
I have to take a hysterectomy.

1038
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,210
Director Huang,

1039
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,130
is there any other way?

1040
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,280
She is only 20.

1041
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,360
She can't live without a uterus.

1042
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,390
Tell her family that

1043
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,170
we're going to take a hysterectomy.

1044
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,640
There's too much bleeding to keep it.

1045
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,960
Doctor, please.

1046
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,760
I beg you, please.

1047
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,230
I can't sign it.

1048
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,080
You must find a way

1049
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,230
to keep it for her.

1050
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,970
Please calm down. It cannot be kept.

1051
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,040
You need to keep her alive. Keep her alive!

1052
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,060
She is just a child!

1053
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,200
What will she do if it is cut?

1054
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,590
Sir.

1055

To keep your daughter alive,

1056
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,100
you have to make a decision.

1057

He agreed. Do it.

1058
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,410
Can't wait. I've cut it.

1059
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,650
A few minutes late, she would be dead.

1060
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,330
Are you okay?

1061
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,540
Take a rest there.

1062
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,460
I'm fine. I can help.

Do you want some water?

The doctor doesn't allow you to drink now.

I'm afraid to tell you about these.

I am ashamed of that.

1086

I don't even have the courage

1087

to tell you about my period.

I am married already.

You were only three

when your mom passed away.

It's me.
