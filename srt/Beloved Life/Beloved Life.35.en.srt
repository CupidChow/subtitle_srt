[Episode 35]

4
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,350
Li Junxiao was fired.

5
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:47,979
Lin Wei left.

6
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,950
Du Di's disciplinary action hasn't been removed.

7
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,350
Director Zhang left me in charge.

8
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,400
I failed him.

9
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,789
I think you should take over

10
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,580
as the head of the department.

11
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,200
You wanna leave this mess

12
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,160
to me?

13
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,590
Think about the old days with Director Zhang.

14
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,230
He always knew a way

15
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,360
to deal with an awful mess.

16
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,620
And you?

17
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,970
You're always groaning.

18
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,830
Li Junxiao just reported

19
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,580
Kaiming Hospital.

20
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,010
The biggest tumor in the medical system

21
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,460
was uprooted by him.

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,510
It caused an uproar in the city.

23
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,800
People admire him as a hero.

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,710
I was hoping to take this opportunity

25
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,620
to get him back.

26
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,260
But it turned out that

27
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,079
he insisted on going back to his hometown.

28
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,730
What a headache!

29
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm quite happy for him.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,670
I watched this young man

31
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,290
grow more and more mature

32
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,070
from a man who used

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,150
to be preoccupied with fame,

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,240
fortune and rank.

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,690
And now,

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,160
he finally figured out

37
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,670
the goal of his life.

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,810
Let him work in the grass-roots hospital

39
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,800
for some time.

40
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,620
It's good for him.

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,090
Maybe one day,

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,720
he'll come back.

43
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,690
Now he's gone.

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,100
We lost another candidate

45
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,880
for the chief resident.

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,700
Yeah?

47
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,220
Then find a way

48
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,890
to get Du Di back.

49
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,480
Reported by her own father.

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,510
It's by no means easy.

51
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,140
Oh, no.

52
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,380
It's a real thorn.

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,800
So Congrui has to take over all their work, doesn't she?

54

-I feel good, doctor.
-Do you feel unwell today?

57
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,820
No, all good.

58
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,300
I feel good in the abdomen.

Did you have a good night?

63
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,170

of progress in skills.

90
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,020
I'm really impressed.

91
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,170
This is probably

92
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,530
bouncing back from the bottom.

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,520
So dramatic.

94
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,180
Did Mengmeng cry today?

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,670
No.

96
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,490
She looked serious

97
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,790
when they gave her

98
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
the vaccine shot.

99
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,820
But she didn't cry.

100
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,230
You haven't improved a bit

101
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,990
in giving

102
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,710
names.

103
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,100
How can you call my sister Mengmeng?

104
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,670
You have this rigid personality

105
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,100
because of your name.

106
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,790
You know what? Our names

107
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,680
shape our personalities without being noticed.

108
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,310
Your name is Di, the supremacy.

109
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,030
So you dream about dominating the world every day.

110
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,510
Your sister's name is Mengmeng.

111
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,170
She will definitely be a cute girl.

112
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,080
What kind of sophistry is it?

113
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
This is the truth.

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,240
OK.

115
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,870
It's the truth, all right?

116
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,930
What do you want to say?

117
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,310
Have you been in touch

118
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:35,850
with Li Junxiao?

119
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:37,730
No.

120
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,260
Are you really breaking up?

121
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,080
I haven't agreed anyway.

122
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,140
Honestly,

123
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,250
in the past,

124
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,930
I wouldn't understand.

125
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,100
However,

126
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,460
after what happened in the last few months,

127
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
I kind of understand

128
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,200
Li Junxiao right now.

129
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,830
In the past,

130
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,820
I had a very clear goal of my life.

131
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
I believed that

132
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,300
the success in career

133
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,640
was the only goal of my life.

134
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,760
Only when I get the best position

135
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,620
in the best hospital

136
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,990
can I realize

137
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,560
my life dream and values.

138
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,160
Now that I think about it,

139
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,500
maybe

140
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,860
I was possessed by vanity.

141
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,730
After I was suspended, I realized that

142
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,820
except for those,

143
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,210
I had a lot more.

144
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,810
I have your friendship,

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,159
and Liu Nianbai's love.

146
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,420
I realized that

147
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,280
as a doctor,

148
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,440
our first priority is to cure and save lives.

149
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
As for on what platform

150
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,780
and in what position you do it,

151
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,830
it's not important.

152
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,710
Perhaps Li Junxiao

153
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,900
felt the same way

154
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,070
so he made his decision.

155
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,659
Du Di, you have changed.

156
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,340
You've become mild,

157
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,770
not so aggressive anymore.

158
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,680
You've changed too.

159
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,460
How?

160
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,630
You've become more confident,

161
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,390
unlike before when you thought all about

162
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,990
your own happiness

163
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,190
and often cried

164
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,290
like a pampered girl.

165
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
Is this good?

166
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,270
Of course it is.

167
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,480
Hello?

168
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,240
Is this Ms. Wu?

169
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:43,840
Yes.

170
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,460
Mr. Li Junxiao ordered

171
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,480
a one-carat diamond ring

172
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,420
from us.

173
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,790
It was out of stock.

174
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,620
Now we have it.

175
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,320
But I can't get through to him.

176
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,370
The emergency contact he left

177
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,210
is your number.

178
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,020
Would you like to come and pick it up?

179
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,140
A one-carat diamond ring?

180
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,020
Yes.

181
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,470
He said it was for proposal.

182
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,910
I suppose he's gonna propose to you.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,600
Congratulations!

184
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,690
Li Junxiao.

185
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,580
You've bought the ring.

186
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,660
You still want to break up with me?

187
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,820
Where are you?

188
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,340
I need to talk to you.

189
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,880
Are you hungry?

190
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,860
Shall I cook some noodles for you?

191
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,370
No, thanks.

192
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,990
I need to get my resume done quickly

193
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,430
and start to

194
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,690
look for a new job.

195
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,710
Luckily, I passed the residency training exam.

196
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,670
I wish a small hospital

197
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,620
would take me in.

198
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,230
No rush.

199
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,320
After so many years of hard work,

200
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,560
you finally have some time of your own.

201
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,870
Take a break.

202
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,010
Your professional skills

203
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,550
will not get rusty due to a few months

204
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,220
out of practice.

205
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,510
No.

206
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,420
I can't live a day

207
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,790
not checking medical records,

208
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,680
observing surgeries

209
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,090
or making ward rounds.

210
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,460
And,

211
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,090
the diapers, formula

212
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
and other stuff

213
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,560
my sister needs everyday

214
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,400
cost too much.

215
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,350
I have to start earning money.

216
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,500
You have me.

217
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,170
If I don't squander,

218
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,500
I can support you two.

219
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,210
If that's not enough,

220
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,320
I can sell my shoes.

221
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,140
It is said that some of my shoes' prices have increased

222
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,930
by hundreds of times.

223
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,830
Sell shoes?

224
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,280
Are those shoes?

225
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,490
They're your life.

226
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,600
You are my life.

227
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,840
That makes it hard for me.

228
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,700
Why?

229
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,630
Because I'm going

230
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,780
to put on a big show

231
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,970
and ask you this question at a critical moment,

232
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,320
"Do you want me or the shoes?"

233
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,350
Now that you've made

234
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,380
your choice,

235
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,720
the show is just impossible.

236
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,910
I will not give you a chance

237
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,820
to do that.

238
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,650
I also got a question for you.

239
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,820
Is the scalpel more important

240
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,690
than me?

241
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,830
I won't give you

242
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,430
the chance, either.

243
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,140
You're cheating.

244
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,320
What day is tomorrow?

245
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,900
Tomorrow?

246
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,270
Today is Saturday.

247
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,970
Tomorrow is Sunday.

248
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,670
What's wrong? Am I wrong?

249
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,310
By tomorrow, we'll have been in love

250
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,420
for 100 days.

251
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,640
There's an anniversary for that?

252
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,570
Who made it?

253
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,580
I'm so mad.

254
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,020
I don't care.

255
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,010
The 100-day anniversary is important.

256
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,570
We're going to celebrate it.

257
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,340
Let's go out for a big dinner.

258
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,180
Western food?

259
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,260
Japanese?

260
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,490
Huaiyang cuisine?

261
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,050
I have to take care of my sister.

262
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,090
I don't have time to go out.

263
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,160
Forget about the big dinner and celebration.

264
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,580
We can celebrate at home.

265
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,060
I'll arrange it.

266
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,490
You're so busy.

267
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,900
And I think

268
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,300
the ceremonial stuff

269
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,810
is unnecessary.

270
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
It's important to have ceremonies in life,

271
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,930
OK?

272
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,340
We can't neglect

273
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,480
a beautiful anniversary

274
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,680
due to work and worries in life.

275
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,420
Anyway, I'll make the arrangements.

276
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,660
All right.

277
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,710
It's time to shave and insert the urinary catheter.

278
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,290
What do you mean "shave"?

279
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,860
It means...

280
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,410
Oh, I see.

281
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,830
Then I'll draw the curtain.

282
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,130
OK.

283
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,310
It's gonna be uncomfortable when the urinary catheter is being inserted.

284
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,700
All right.

285
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,550
I wonder

286
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,600
if those who destroy others' marriage

287
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,100
will be punished in their next life.

288
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,880
Having a child without a dad

289
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,890
and to deliver without her husband's company,

290
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,900
oh, my poor daughter!

291
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,720
Three things before the surgery.

292
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,380
I remember them.

293
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,590
This is the first time I've seen you

294
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,780
in surgery.

295
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,000
You have to make so many preparations

296
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,270
before surgery.

297
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,240
Yes.

298
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,520
Because throughout the surgery,

299
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,790
it's critical to keep the urinary canal unobstructed

300
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,300
and the bladder empty.

301
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:20,910
Otherwise,

302
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,890
once the bladder accumulates a lot of urine,

303
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
it will form a bulge in front of

304
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,780
the uterus.

305
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,960
It's possible that

306
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,190
our scalpel would cut through the bladder

307
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,280
before we make an incision on the uterus.

308
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,730
Then the baby would be still in the uterus

309
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,100
when it is flooded by urine.

310
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,820
And it can make sure

311
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,460
no urine

312
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,340
is retained in the bladder

313
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,840
before the anesthesia effect wears off.

314
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,660
Having a baby is so hard.

315
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,700
Exactly.

316
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
In the past, there was a saying,

317
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,270
giving birth is like going through the jaws of death.

318
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,770
In the old days, the mortality rate of pregnant women was very high.

319
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,220
Fortunately,

320
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,190
after the founding of our country, the government paid close attention to

321
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,500
maternal health and safety.

322
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,910
That's when people began to realize

323
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,190
that having a baby is easy.

324
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,330
Honey, you're under local anesthesia.

325
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,430
So you'll feel

326
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,360
a little bit of a tug.

327
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,260
Now we're close friends in the real sense.

328
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,760
You'll see everything

329
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,860
in my belly.

330
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,130
Let's get started.

331
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,610
Time of surgery,

332
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,020
13:27.

333
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,660
Yunling,

334
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,240
do you think it's a boy

335
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,230
or a girl?

336
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,840
Do you want it to be a boy

337
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,580
or a girl?

338
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,180
Both are good.

339
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,260
If it's a girl,

340
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
I'll tell her to be wise

341
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,430
in choosing a husband.

342
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,420
Marry a good man or don't marry at all.

343
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,460
If it's a boy,

344
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,220
I will teach him

345
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,510
to respect

346
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,500
and love his soul mate.

347
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,500
Soon we will know.

348
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,380
Scalpel.

349
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,530
Moment of truth.

350
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,340
Let me see this little baby.

351
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,560
Congratulations, it's a boy.

352
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,170
Let me see.

353
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,100
Congratulations!

354
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,680
Take a look.

355
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,230
The baby weighs 3,440 grams.

356
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,810
That's great.

357
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,610
It's a 7.5-pound young man.

358
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,420
He looks like me.

359
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,260
My son.

360
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,300
What's this? Who are you?

361
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,540
It's me.

362
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,940
Take it.

363
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,710
You look like you're wearing

364
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,620
roses.

365
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,990
Come on, put them on the floor.

366
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,890
These are 520 roses

367
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,990
standing for my love.

368
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,180
How can I put them on the floor?

369
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,360
Then where do you want to put them?

370
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,600
On the dining table.

371
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,120
It's dinner time soon.

372
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,760
The tea table then.

373
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,470
It's covered by Mengmeng's stuff.

374
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,660
In the middle of the living room.

375
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,640
It's gonna be in our way.

376
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,940
There will be pollen everywhere.

377
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,080
What if Mengmeng is allergic to pollen?

378
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,060
I can't hold them any longer.

379
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:19,990
Let's put them here for now.

380
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,050
Didn't you just say

381
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,790
you can't put them on the floor?

382
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,050
I held them all the way back home.

383
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,850
That's what I meant.

384
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,750
Why did you have to

385
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,570
buy such a big bouquet?

386
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,220
Aren't you touched?

387
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,260
Shouldn't you be like, "Wow!"

388
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,290
You don't even do that.

389
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,040
The problem now

390
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,620
isn't that I'm not excited.

391
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,070
Where are we going

392
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,460
to put so many roses?

393
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,610
In an aquarium?

394
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,100
These roses don't need a vase or anything.

395
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:50,970
You just admire them.

396
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,940
Just admire them?

397
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,750
They'll rot and stink in a few days.

398
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,400
Admire them before they do.

399
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,780
Can you return them?

400
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,740
Why do you have to be a killjoy?

401
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,170
520 roses.

402
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,200
520 means

403
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,740
I love you.

404
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,180
This is my gift to you

405
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,020
for the 100-day anniversary of our love.

406
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,180
But to me, it's nothing but

407
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,099
a nuisance.

408
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,859
1, 2,

409
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,890
3, 4,

410
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,630
5, 6, 7.

411
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,980
Why don't we turn off the lights and light some candles?

412
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,190
Let's have

413
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,290
a candlelight dinner at least.

414
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,710
This takeaway hotpot sucks.

415
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,700
In candlelight,

416
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:39,980
you might not be able to find

417
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,720
what you put in the pot

418
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,500
and you might put food in your nose.

419
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,630
Right.

420
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,120
It's spicy.

421
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,450
All indicators are very good.

422
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,220
But she's still underweight.

423
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,120
But I can't do anything.

424
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,230
She has a poor constitution

425
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,780
and no breastfeeding.

426
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,310
I'll figure out something

427
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,070
to give her more nutrition.

428
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,660
And help her gain some weight.

429
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,440
Come back next month for a review.

430
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,940
Thank you.

431
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,610
How is Congrui recently?

432
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,100
Not bad.

433
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,450
I'm going to see her later.

434
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,090
Do you wanna say something to her?

435
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,860
No.

436
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,980
Actually, I do.

437
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,980
If she mentions me,

438
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,380
tell her for me that

439
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,940
I will always love her.

440
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,190
Next.

441
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,780
Isn't this Dr. Du?

442
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,960
I'm no longer a doctor.

443
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,940
I was only abroad for an exchange program for a month.

444
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,840
What happened?

445
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,410
It's such a pity

446
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,670
that you can't be a doctor.

447
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,470
I didn't handle

448
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,500
my family affairs well.

449
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,650
That means

450
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm not qualified

451
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,070
to be a doctor in some way.

452
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,640
That's not an excuse.

453
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,270
Whenever

454
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
there's a scandal in the hospital,

455
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,480
all they know

456
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,780
is to make peace as soon as possible.

457
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,170
The hospital leaders

458
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,690
worry only about their jobs.

459
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,980
They have little sense of responsibility.

460
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,430
Listen,

461
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,830
I have a student

462
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,260
who's now the vice president

463
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,510
of the No. 2 Women and Children's Hospital,

464
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,000
a specialized hospital for women and children.

465
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,540
My student went there only a while ago.

466
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,430
He's ambitious

467
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,570
and determined to improve the hospital's

468
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,310
clinical and academic competence.

469
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,100
He needs talents like you.

470
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,770
If you don't mind

471
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,760
it's a Grade-B tertiary hospital.

472
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,000
I can recommend you to him.

473
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,820
Really?

474
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,190
Can I still be a doctor?

475
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,200
There's no evidence to support the complaint

476
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,360
about fetal gender identification.

477
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,880
The hospital is afraid that the scandal

478
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,080
will impact their fame.

479
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,830
Do you think

480
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,800
they'll spread this scandal?

481
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,860
Thank you, Professor Lu.

482
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,040
As long as you have passion for medicine,

483
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,220
you must stick to it.

484
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,860
I believe that

485
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,480
you will become

486
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,640
a great doctor.

487
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,830
I will do my best.

488
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,820
So cute!

489
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,840
Little hands.

490
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,710
By the way, I have a gift

491
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,720
for the baby.

492
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,580
You don't have to do that.

493
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,520
It's not something expensive.

494
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,380
What is it?

495
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,450
These socks are so cute.

496
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,120
I knitted them myself.

497
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,100
It's cashmere. It doesn't prickle skin.

498
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,900
Help me put them on him.

499
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,390
OK.

500
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,320
Come on, baby.

501
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,140
-Auntie is gonna put the socks on you.
-Son.

502
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,310
-So beautiful.
-Cute.

503
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,610
Aren't they?

504
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,460
Ying, look who is here.

505
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,080
Honey.

506
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,830
What are you doing here?

507
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,760
Didn't your mom say

508
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,710
the baby was unhealthy

509
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,460
so you aborted it?

510
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,370
Who told you I was here?

511
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,990
Get out of here!

512
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,480
Ying, I told him to come.

513
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,820
Mom, are you crazy?

514
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,990
I'm not crazy.

515
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,530
Zilu told me

516
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,940
he made a stupid mistake.

517
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,910
You need to give him a chance

518
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,120
to make up for it.

519
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,070
He has abandoned

520
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,110
that woman a long time ago.

521
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,670
Mom.

522
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,990
My son doesn't even need

523
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,940
a dad like him.

524
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,940
Tell him to leave.

525
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,000
Son?

526
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,080
I have a son?

527
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,360
Get out of here!

528
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,100
Come on.

529
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:38,850
Get out!

530
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,270
What's going on?

531
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,420
What's all the noise about?

532
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,870
Nurse!

533
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,340
Nurse, this man is not my family.

534
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,870
Please ask him to leave.

535
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,310
I'm the baby's dad.

536
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,130
Go.

537
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,330
Sir,

538
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,260
-I don't care who you are.
-I'm the baby's dad.

539
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,230
The patient has just had a surgery.

540
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,600
Irritation is bad for her wound to heal.

541
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,020
-Guo Caiting!
-Please go.

542
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,150
Calm down.

543
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,290
Let's talk nice and easy.

544
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,540
Mom.

545
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,050
Mom, you can go.

546
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,590
Don't come anymore.

547
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,420
What are you talking about?

548
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,600
You're such a fool

549
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,200
to bring that wicked man here.

550
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,730
I told you before that

551
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,060
my son doesn't need

552
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,900
a dad like him.

553
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,050
Don't come here

554
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,060
in the short run

555
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,960
to see your grandson again.

556
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,130
How could you say that?

557
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,460
I'm doing it for your good

558
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,430
and for your son's good, OK?

559
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,500
Just go.

560
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,020
Caiting.

561
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,100
Caiting,

562
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,770
we have to think of something

563
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,490
to change a ward.

564
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,770
He won't just let us go.

565
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,780
Let's have some milk,

566
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,490
OK?

567
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,100
Here you go.

568
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,460
All right.

569
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:08,930
I'm gonna burp you.

570
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,700
OK?

571
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,150
Let's burp you.

572
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,980
Burp.

573
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,840
What's that look on your face?

574
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,880
I was in a trance for a second.

575
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,960
I thought we were a family of three.

576
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,940
The image of you holding the baby

577
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,670
is so beautiful.

578
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,060
In your dreams.

579
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,150
Am I right?

580
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,250
In his dreams.

581
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,790
Is it Congrui?

582
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,370
Go open the door.

583
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,470
Coming.

584
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,340
Mr. Du,

585
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,810
why didn't you give me a call before you came?

586
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,500
Come on in.

587
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,540
I remember

588
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,190
we're running out of diapers.

589
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:13,980
I'll go down to buy some.

590
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,580
Your grandma...

591
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,540
What?

592
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,120
She told you to come?

593
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,310
What are her instructions

594
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,090
this time?

595
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,070
She passed away.

596
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,070
I'm sorry.

597
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,700
Over the years,

598
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,260
I cursed you every day.

599
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,340
I blamed you for being too tough,

600
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,540
for not having any human touch,

601
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,270
for offending all our relatives and friends.

602
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,220
I blamed you

603
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,920
for not supporting us to give you a brother.

604
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,860
But now,

605
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,270
I wonder,

606
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,750
does what I do

607
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,810
make me a decent man?

608
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,820
I only have one daughter,

609
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,150
but she's not close to me.

610
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,430
I insisted that my wife gave me a son

611
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,300
despite her age.

612
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,890
I knew my mom

613
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,270
had given up years ago,

614
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,000
yet I gave her hope

615
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,280
of having a grandson.

616
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,860
Now that I think about it,

617
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,980
I should really scold myself.

618
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,740
I was hotheaded

619
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,090
when I reported you

620
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,930
in the complaint.

621
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,580
I thought

622
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,260
you fooled us around for so long

623
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,340
with a lie.

624
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,460
I'm sorry.

625
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,820
Now

626
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,700
I want to

627
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,820
apologize sincerely.

628
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,740
I'm sorry.

629
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,230
I don't care if you apologize to me

630
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,170
or not.

631
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,140
You owe this apology

632
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,730
to my mom.

633
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,260
Yes.

634
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,180
I...

635
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,220
Take me

636
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,030
to mourn her tomorrow.

637
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,810
I won't let you take her away.

638
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,010
She doesn't want to go back home with you.

639
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,910
Home?

640
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,170
Home is not only the root

641
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,380
but also the bond.

642
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,540
I won't bring her there.

643
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,540
I know she doesn't like my hometown.

644
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,350
But I only have one request.

645
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,700
If I die one day,

646
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,800
please put me by her side,

647
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,420
OK?

648
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,580
OK.

649
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,570
I promise you.

650
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,070
Honey.

651
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,610
Let me take care of your sister.

652
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,900
You?

653
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,180
Will you give her the best of everything?

654
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,860
Honey,

655
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,190
I was wrong before.

656
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,020
I thought

657
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,250
I had fulfilled my duty

658
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,560
to feed you

659
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,710
and pay your tuition

660
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,660
all the way to doctoral study.

661
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,500
Not until

662
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,030
Liu talked to me

663
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,660
did I realize

664
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,810
it had been so hard for you

665
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,060
in the past years.

666
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,150
If it weren't for my preference for boys,

667
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,800
you wouldn't have suffered so much.

668
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,080
Don't worry.

669
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,860
I won't let my second daughter

670
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,930
go through the same hardship.

671
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,900
I promise.

672
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,790
Do you mean what you said?

673
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,330
After your grandma

674
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,980
and your mom passed away,

675
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,610
I've realized one thing.

676
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,300
Sons

677
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,420
or daughters

678
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,520
are all family.

679
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,620
When

680
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,630
a person kicks the bucket,

681
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,300
none of this will matter.

682
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,830
I valued my dignity more than anything.

683
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,620
Over the past years,

684
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,340
I've been troubled

685
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,370
by the relatives' gossip

686
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,220
and have caused you and your mom

687
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,250
a lot of grievances.

688
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:44,940
I...

689
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,740
I've

690
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,310
sold the ancestral house

691
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,060
in our hometown.

692
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,150
I'm going to live with my second daughter

693
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,190
in the city.

694
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,060
I won't go back anymore.

695
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,620
I insisted

696
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,860
to have this baby.

697
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,770
Trust me.

698
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,680
I won't let your sister

699
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,510
become a burden to you.

700
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,860
But I don't trust you.

701
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,140
Right.

702
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,370
I understand.

703
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,340
Talk is cheap.

704
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,860
It's of no use.

705
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,260
So,

706
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,460
I'm gonna prove it with my actions.

707
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,610
I beg you.

708
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,770
Give me one more chance.

709
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,500
OK?

710
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,860
I'm begging you.

711
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,620
I will visit my sister regularly.

712
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,380
If you mistreat her,

713
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,920
I'll bring her back immediately.

714
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,340
OK.

715
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,150
Mr. Du.

716
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,220
You two talked?

717
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,580
Tomorrow,

718
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,460
I'll go mourn Du Di's mom.

719
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,260
Then I'll come to pick up her sister.

720
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:13,940
Tomorrow?

721
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,930
Thank you

722
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,150
for lately.

723
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,870
We can raise the baby

724
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,570
until she grows up.

725
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,580
But you're her father.

726
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,540
We have no right to refuse

727
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,290
to give her back to you.

728
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,300
To my eldest daughter,

729
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm already

730
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,840
not a good dad.

731
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,200
God gave me another daughter

732
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,740
probably to

733
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,340
give me a chance to make up for my mistakes.

734
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,880
I'll give her all the love

735
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,080
she needs to grow up.

736
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,770
That's for the best.

737
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
And the complaint about Du Di...

738
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,500
I've withdrawn it

739
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,020
and apologized to the hospital.

740
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,220
Really?

741
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,940
I withdrew it before I came.

742
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:56,980
That's great.

743
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,020
She's asleep?

744
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,030
It's gonna be fine.

745
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,940
When we miss her,

746
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,140
we can go to see her anytime.

747
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,770
From now on,

748
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,440
my dad will raise her on his own.

749
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,340
It'll be very difficult for him, right?

750
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,390
Love

751
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,610
conquers all.

752
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,210
She's awake.

753
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,000
Look at her big eyes,

754
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,040
and her chubby cheeks.

755
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,650
Remember

756
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,850
how cute she is

757
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:00,660
when she smiles at you?

758
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,090
Your dad will love her.

759
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,780
Never mind.

760
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,820
Let's drop this.

761
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,630
I'll pack up her stuff

in a while

763
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,140
and see if she needs anything else.

764
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,300
I have to buy everything today.

765
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,140
I think I need to buy at least

766
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,650
the necessities for the next two years.

767
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,290
I don't believe that my dad is a thoughtful man.

768
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,170
OK, I'll help you.

769
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,620
Hello?

770
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,180
Yes, this is Du Di.

771
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,560
Hello, Director Li.

772
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,250
I happen to be free this afternoon.

773
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,080
I can go visit you.

774
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,060
OK.

775
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,460
Thank you.

776
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,200
Professor Lu is so efficient.

Please don't go.

779
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,450
Your dad has

780
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,300
withdrawn the complaint.

781
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,920
I'll go beg Director Tian

782
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,830
to let you go back to Shengji.

783
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,420
He has indeed.

784

But what's done

785
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,960
cannot be undone.

786
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,560
I don't want to make things difficult for Director Tian.

787
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,900
Job opportunities are rare.

788

It's my mom's fault.

We used to have

a cozy double room.

Now we have to move into the quadruple room.

Let me check it.

I was gonna give you Oxytocin fluids intravenously.

can ease the pain.

00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:57,810
Guo Caiting!

858
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,410
Let go!

859
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,500
Let go!

860
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,640
If you don't, I'll hurt you.

861
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,390
Let go!

862
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,500
Step aside. Step aside.

863
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,300
Baby.

864
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,570
Step aside!

865
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,520
Stop!

866
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,140
What are you doing?

867
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,680
What are you doing?

868
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,140
Don't move!

869
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,710
What are you doing?

870
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:13,390
This is my child.

871
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,080
I'm the baby's dad.

872
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:15,910
Baby.

873
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,970
Let go of my son!

874
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,550
Zhang Ying! Zhang Ying!

875
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,210
My child!

876
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,030
My child!

877
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,270
Don't move!

878
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,220
Stay still.

879
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,020
Don't move!

880
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,350
I'm the baby's dad.

881
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:24,840
Stay still.

882
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,500
Don't move!

883
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:25,910
Stay still.

884
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,310
Let go of me!

885
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:26,940
Caiting.

886
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,620
My son!

887
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,510
My son!

888
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,280
Stay still.

889
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:29,980
Are you OK?

890
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,460
Caiting.

891
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,870
I'm the baby's dad!

892
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,440
Caiting.

893
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,980
The fetal heart stopped.

894
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,520
Roll her to the large operating room.

895
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,120
And call Dr. Huang.

896
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
The patient has abdominal trauma.

897
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,940
The baby's heart stopped.

898
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,980
My preliminary diagnosis is placental abruption.

899
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,670
Prepare for C-section immediately.

900
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,440
Get the blood.

901
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,780
Give her 8 units of blood

902
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,910
and 4 units of plasma.

903
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,380
OK.

904
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,980
Oh, my God.

905
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,500
Please,

906
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,570
you have to save her.

907
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,930
She was hurt

908
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,930
when she tried to save my baby.

909
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:39,980
Dr. Wu,

910
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,340
how is she?

911
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,240
It took us 10 hours

912
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,540
to save her life.

913
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,890
She's alive.

914
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,530
Thank you.

915
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,860
Thank you.

916
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,550
What about her baby?

917
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,820
She had massive placental abruption,

918
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,350
secondary post-natal hemorrhage

919
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,540
and secondary DIC.

920
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,530
It happened so fast.

921
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,640
The baby was already dead when we brought it out.

922
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,040
Come on.

923
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:27,970
Drink this chicken soup.

924
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,830
The doctor said

925
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,220
you could eat now.

926
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,500
You have to eat more.

927
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,840
I know that

928
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,990
it took a lot of courage

929
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,410
to have the baby.

930
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,780
The baby was innocent.

931
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,600
But his dad...

932
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,640
His dad didn't give him

933
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,820
a chance to live.

934
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,140
It's not your fault.

935
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,330
You can't do this.

936
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,380
If you don't eat or drink anything,

937
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,050
you'll collapse.

938
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,830
Come on. Have some.

939
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,180
No.

940
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,860
It's my punishment.

941
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,460
I wanted to marry a rich man

942
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,720
who could give me a comfortable life.

943
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,060
But I didn't know

944
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,380
I wrecked another woman's marriage.

945
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,550
And I insisted to give birth

946
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,210
to this baby.

947
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,840
Now that the baby is gone,

948
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,920
what is the meaning of my life?

949
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,260
Caiting.

950
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,730
That's not true.

951
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,460
Look.

952
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,310
Hey.

953
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,330
Look.

954
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,860
You still have him.

955
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,370
Because of you,

956
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,330
he's still alive.

957
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,500
I'll tell him

958
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:43,920
you're

959
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,530
the heroine who saved him

960
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,150
and you lost your baby

961
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,540
because of him.

962
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,770
I'll make sure that my baby

963
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,620
will be grateful to you.

964
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:58,850
Look,

965
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,310
look, he's smiling.

966
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:02,940
Look.
