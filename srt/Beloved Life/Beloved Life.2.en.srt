[Episode Two]

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,479
Patients nowadays

5
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,860
are full of ideas.

6
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,660
They will check it online.

7
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,590
If you're angered by

8
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,470
their moods,

9
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,259
they will file a complaint

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,170
about your bad attitude.

11
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,509
You'll just need to be patient awhile,

12
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,720
and it'll be fine soon.

13
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,900
Learn from me.

14
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,060
I just smile.

15
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,630
I smile however the patients treat me.

16
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,360
It's hard to rant at someone who is already on their knees.

17
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,670
No wonder the head nurse said you have high emotional intelligence.

18
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,210
I can't force myself to smile.

19
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,660
I was worried about you

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,030
when we were at college.

21
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,110
If you can't smile and become a doctor,

22
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,950
then you'll be in conflict

23
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,000
with patients every day.

24
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,300
I can operate. That's enough.

25
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,550
By what do you save people?

26
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Our scalpels.

27
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,770
Can you save people by smiling?

28
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,650
Say you met a person in shock on the road.

29
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,530
Are you going to

30
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,220
perform CPR on him immediately

31
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,060
or smile at him?

32
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,610
What is our motto

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,240
that motivates us?

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,380
To cure sometimes.

35
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,530
To relieve often.

36
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,750
To comfort always.

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,560
But I don't think that works

38
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,510
in our hospital.

39
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,140
To cure sometimes.

40
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,090
I can do it.

41
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,790
To relieve often.

42
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,090
I can barely do it.

43
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,900
To comfort always...

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,360
What about those hundreds of patients

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,940
waiting in line?

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,329
We don't have time to comfort everyone.

47
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,020
Who says it's impossible?

48
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,710
Lin Qiaozhi was such a person.

49
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,040
Few people can reach such a state

50
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,180
as Lin Qiaozhi.

51
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,950
Well, I want to relieve often

52
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,260
and to comfort always.

53
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,990
It'll be good enough

54
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,090
that you can cure sometimes.

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,050
You hurt me.

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,310
You achieve the first two,

57
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,230
and I, the last two.

58
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,190
Then we'll be perfect together.

59
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,390
There are only three sentences in total.

60
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,950
How can you say anything about the first or last two?

61
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,940
Isn't it doctors' duty

62
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,210
to relieve often?

63
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,140
Dr. Wu is always right.

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,810
I'm going to see my husband.

65
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,710
I want to ask him

66
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,490
what to do with Chen Ping's illness.

67
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,480
Bye.

68
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,060
Remember to smile.

69
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,810
I won't have lunch with you.

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,550
One baby is in a bad condition.

71
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,490
I want to tend him for a little longer.

72
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,390
I'm not here

73
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,450
to have lunch with you.

74
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,180
I have met

75
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,120
a very tricky problem.

76
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,310
I need your help.

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,940
Okay. What's the problem?

78
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,390
There's a multigravida

79
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,700
who had two children before.

80
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,940
But both of her children died

81
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,970
within 12 hours after the parturition.

82
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,380
Now she's pregnant with the third one.

83
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,840
Her whole family is very anxious.

84
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,820
I want to know the reasons.

85
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,710
Or is there a way

86
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,940
to avoid that tragedy

87
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,400
to happen to the third child?

88
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,960
Any other information about the first two kids?

89
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,280
Nothing.

90
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,600
They were born

91
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,400
in the hospital of their hometown.

92
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,800
When the children were born,

93
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,050
their Apgar Scores were quite high.

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,820
It seems that doctors

95
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,740
didn't give certain reasons.

96
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,200
The parents didn't ask for an autopsy either.

97
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,170
How can I infer anything from such little information?

98
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,090
Do you know how many possible causes

99
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,300
could there be for the death of a newborn?

100
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,170
If one baby died,

101
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,680
there could be so many reasons.

102
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,710
But

103
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,860
both of them died.

104
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,870
I was wondering

105
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,909
if there was any correlation

106
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,630
that the provincial hospital

107
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,340
didn't find out?

108
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,040
Even if both of them died,

109
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,700
it doesn't mean

110
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,630
the two incidents were strongly correlated.

111
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,540
They could be

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,960
just two separate random incidents.

113
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,440
And the information is so vague.

114
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,550
that I can't tell.

115
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,930
It's impossible for me to give any advice.

116
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,350
Honey, no need to be so rigid

117
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,750
when you're with me.

118
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,450
Just tell me some general idea.

119
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,130
I can go

120
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,850
think about it myself.

121
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,530
A doctor never says general ideas.

122
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,180
I'm pregnant now

123
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,140
and soon will be a mother,

124
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,670
so I can't bear to see

125
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,500
other moms suffer.

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,550
What if that horrible result

127
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,220
happened to

128
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,380
the third child,

129
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,510
what should that mom do?

130
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,810
She would be devastated.

131
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,550
We'll have to wait for the third child

132
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,670
to be born to check his state.

133
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,500
It's not the time to worry yet.

134
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,760
Can't you empathize with me?

135
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,090
Do you have no compassion?

136
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,440
Are you my husband or not?

137
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,470
Well, I'm busy.

138
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,730
Let's not talk about

139
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,890
a thing that has no result.

140
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,880
I'll go back first.

141
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,110
Have a nice meal.

142
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,590
Were you on night duty?

143
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,240
No.

144
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,830
I don't know why I'm always sleepy recently.

145
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,880
You're like this and you're not even 30.

146
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,540
If you get pregnant later,

147
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,450
how can you keep working?

148
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,340
It should be fine.

149
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,830
You've met so many

150
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,870
elderly primiparas

151
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,020
with health problems,

152
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,830
but you still have fantasies

153
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,860
about getting pregnant at an advanced age yourselves.

154
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,670
After all, we are female doctors

155
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,940
in Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

156
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,990
We know about

157
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,180
our body.

158
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,360
Take Director Huang for example,

159
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,470
being pregnant with her first baby

160
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,510
didn't keep her from

161
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,420
publishing a journal in SCI.

162
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,740
Now she's pregnant with a second child.

163
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,130
She only took a week off

164
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,050
during the days when she had morning sickness.

165
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,230
Now the baby is stable,

166
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,750
She performs surgery as usual.

167
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,060
She can do five operations a day.

168
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,360
She's almost 40.

169
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,640
You always use special cases

170
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,400
to convince yourselves.

171
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,190
Director Huang

172
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,500
had her first child long ago.

173
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,300
If you miss the best time to give birth,

174
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,910
you'll regret in the end.

175
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,460
Why are you so aggressive today?

176
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,870
Did you add something in your meal?

177
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:32,920
Du Di.

178
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,790
Here.

179
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,040
Something's wrong, Li Junxiao.

180
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,950
Did you two have an argument?

181
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,770
Someone doesn't want to get married.

182
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,680
Maybe she wants to break up.

183
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,870
No way. Are you kidding me?

184
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,880
I think so too.

185
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,670
God played

186
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,620
a big trick on me.

187
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,750
Did Du Di and Li Junxiao

188
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,440
break up?

189
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,620
No.

190
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:09,880
Head Nurse,

191
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,470
why are you so gossipy?

192
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,540
Stop protecting Du Di.

193
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,320
They eat together

194
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,670
every day.

195
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,690
Today, one's here and one's there.

196
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,790
Just wait and see.

197
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,760
Everyone in the department will know

198
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,610
about this no later than the time to get off work.

199
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,570
And in no time,

200
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,880
someone will go after Li Junxiao.

201
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,000
Watch

202
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,310
your nurses.

203
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,150
It's just small bickering.

204
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,610
They'll get back together in a few days.

205
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,610
Don't let your girls

206
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,480
get into their relationship.

207
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,050
All my nurses

208
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,510
are gentle and virtuous.

209
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,930
They are all better than Du Di.

210
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,150
I've never seen

211
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,260
such a fierce female doctor.

212
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,750
She fights with the nurses,

213
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,909
the superior doctors,

214
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,920
and the patients' family.

215
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,580
Her nickname Du Trio Wolves

216
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,340
is so appropriate.

217
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,590
She just can't tolerate anything wrong.

218
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,260
I have to persuade them somehow.

219
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,220
It's normal to quarrel.

220
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,260
You've been together for so many years,

221
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,690
and have never had a quarrel,

222
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,440
which I think is not normal.

223
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,130
You know,

224
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,350
quarrelling is the inevitable stage

225
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,540
of improving your relationship.

226
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,050
When you pass this stage,

227
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,340
your relationship will be upgraded.

228
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,300
Congrui,

229
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:13,900
let me ask you something.

230
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,930
If Feng Yuanhang ask you,

231
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,350
for the sake of your family and child,

232
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,080
to temporarily give up working in Shengji.

233
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,230
Will you say yes?

234
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,180
Of course.

235
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,010
That's

236
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,300
my plan anyway.

237
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,350
See?

238
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,490
Normal girls would think this way.

239
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,040
But Du Di is different.

240
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,350
She thinks

241
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,100
her so-called career,

242
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,510
or her so-called winning the first place,

243
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,350
is more important than anything,

244
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,440
even me.

245
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,169
You can't think like that.

246
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,720
Remember,

247
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,409
you are very very very important

248
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,520
in Du Di's heart.

249
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,530
At this time of quarreling,

250
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,770
women usually wait

251
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,650
for an apology from men.

252
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,500
As long as you

253
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,560
apologize and show your regrets,

254
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,640
she will surely discuss with you nicely.

255
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,240
Bed 18 is calling.

256
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,240
That's me. I’m going.

257
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,890
She went into convulsions before the intravenous drip's over.

258
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,100
Dr. Wu,

259
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,830
I lost consciousness

260
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,100
all of a sudden.

261
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,140
I feel very dizzy now.

262
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,100
What should I do?

263
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,030
Give her oxygen and listen to the fetal heart rate.

264
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,140
Use the ECG monitor.

265
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,620
Show me the lab test report.

266
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,340
There's a lot of urine protein.

267
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,430
The condition is progressing too fast.

268
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:45,770
And then what?

269
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,860
Then...

270
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,100
add magnesium sulfate for spasmolysis.

271
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,730
Okay.

272
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:53,690
I should

273
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,880
call Director Huang.

274
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,270
What are you doing? I'm in surgery.

275
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,900
D, d...

276
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,150
Dr. Huang,

277
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,580
Li Ran, the one with gestational hypertension,

278
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,610
She suddenly went into convulsions.

279
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,030
But she's fine now.

280
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,440
And now,

281
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,220
the fetal heart rate is normal.

282
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:08,910
Vital signs

283
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,710
are stable, too.

284
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,500
Is urine protein high?

285
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,370
Yes, very high.

286
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,770
Then what's with all the nonsense?

287
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,780
Use the magnesium sulfate.

288
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,650
Hurry up. Magnesium sulfate.

289
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,740
Call her husband now.

290
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,280
OK.

291
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,850
Magnesium sulfate, 2.5 grams.

292
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,890
What happened to my wife?

293
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,520
Elampsia?

294
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,240
How could that happen?

295
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,210
Why did she get that?

296
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,300
Keep your voice down.

297
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,830
Be quieter.

298
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,170
She doesn't convulse anymore.

299
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,110
The reasons for this disease

300
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,020
is complicated.

301
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,120
It can be caused by various factors.

302
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,020
Some people don't have hypertension normally,

303
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,510
but they do when pregnant.

304
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,470
In my opinion, your wife

305
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,820
didn't exercise much.

306
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,310
She loves eating over-salty and very spicy food.

307
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,040
Does she have a family history of hypertension?

308
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,340
Has she had thrombi before?

309
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,790
I don't know about her family history.

310
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,070
We are both orphans.

311
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,730
I don't have a mother

312
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,420
or a mother-in-law.

313
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,010
We didn't know what to do

314
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,000
when we first found out she's pregnant.

315
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm the lead vocal of a band.

316
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,140
The band is not famous

317
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,120
and can't make much money.

318
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,150
I thought

319
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,930
since I knew nothing else,

320
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,550
I'd find more performance chances

321
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,540
and make more money.

322
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,660
I hope I can provide them

323
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,940
more living guarantee in the future.

324
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,370
What does your wife do?

325
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,320
She's a cashier of a musical instrument store.

326
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,160
We met each other

327
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,430
when I bought musical instruments.

328
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,420
You were right.

329
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,470
She sat all day,

330
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,470
and she had no chance to exercise.

331
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,990
She often told me

332
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,940
that her legs were numb from sitting too much.

333
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,590
I'll give her a check-up immediately

334
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,150
to see if she has thrombi

335
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,060
in her legs.

336
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,330
Doctor,

337
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,190
I had plans to

338
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,220
to perform somewhere else,

339
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,670
but I rejected the performance.

340
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,220
But I'm worried about her.

341
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,320
I've compensate for the performance,

342
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,940
so now I can keep her company

343
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,010
every day

344
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,090
and take good care of

345
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,790
them both.

346
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,790
You have no other choices

347
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,080
but to stay here with her every day.

348
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,940
Because we need to monitor

349
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,600
the pregnant women and the fetus.

350
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,980
And we're prepared to perform Cesarean section at any time.

351
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,270
You have to prepare yourself

352
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,220
for a premature birth.

353
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,440
If it gets serious,

354
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,660
we might lose the baby.

355
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,800
You've been standing for a whole day again?

356
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,480
Director Huang,

357
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,050
you should reduce the amount of operations.

358
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,130
At this rate...

359
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,390
Reduce the amount of operations?

360
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,520
Who will take it from me then?

361
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,630
You?

362
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,750
I'm not capable.

363
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,890
I can't help you.

364
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,590
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

365
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,680
No.

366
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,300
Which line am I on?

367
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,000
Line Three.

368
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,950
When something

369
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
can't be solved on Line One,

370
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,860
which line should you turn to?

371
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,610
Line Two.

372
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,340
Then why did you call me

373
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,910
when something went wrong with Li Ran today?

374
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,900
Because that's the patient you specially noted.

375
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,510
So I called you when I was anxious.

376
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,900
Congrui,

377
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,340
I'm your mentor.

378
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,140
You're used to come to me when you have a problem.

379
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,340
It's not that I don't like it.

380
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,840
But you have to remember

381
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,190
that you are also

382
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,060
a resident doctor in this hospital.

383
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,070
You have to

384
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,340
comply with the hospital's rules.

385
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,450
Those rules

386
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,380
are based on the experiences

387
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,820
of many generations

388
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,900
of doctors.

389
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,030
They can maximally

390
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,900
safeguard the patients' life safety

391
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,150
and ensure the equitable distribution

392
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,970
of medical resources.

393
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,310
Today you should have called

394
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,900
the doctors on Line Two.

395
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,830
It is the way that you can

396
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,750
solve problems by

397
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,270
as soon as possible.

398
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,370
Besides,

399
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,090
can't you handle

400
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,020
Li Ran's condition alone?

401
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,350
You've been learning from me for nothing these years.

402
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,990
Sorry.

403
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,670
I saw

404
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,620
Du Di's operation yesterday.

405
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,970
I am impressed.

406
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,580
I've never seen

407
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,420
a resident

408
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,100
could reach such a high level.

409
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,510
She's a genius.

410
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,310
But you can't even handle

411
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,180
such a situation now.

412
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,300
How can you compete with her for the chief resident?

413
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,820
Director Huang,

414
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,620
I wanted to ask you something.

415
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,860
How did you balance

416
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
your career and family?

417
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,430
Do you think I can

418
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,340
get pregnant and have children

419
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,520
- and be the chief resident... - Stop dreaming.

420
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,870
I had my first child

421
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,870
when I was a postgraduate student.

422
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,780
You do what is age-appropriate.

423
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,180
In the twenties, you have the strongest

424
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,180
ability to have children,

425
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,380
but you all put it off.

426
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,310
The 41-year-old woman

427
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,450
who miscarried last week

428
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,690
is really rich.

429
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,220
She's a partner of a large enterprise.

430
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,690
For her Purchasing real estates is like buying cabbages.

431
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,860
When people fight for a career,

432
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,630
they all think

433
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,900
there's still time to have a baby.

434
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,430
When they finally want to have a baby,

435
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,270
what happens?

436
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,930
Ovarian failure.

437
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,220
She tried IVF over ten times,

438
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,680
and finally got pregnant.

439
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,830
But she miscarried again.

440
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,090
There are so many examples like this.

441
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,890
I advise you

442
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,330
to either have a baby soon

443
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,750
or be the chief resident.

444
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,710
It's impossible

445
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,460
to reap the benefits from both sides.

446
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,100
What is it?

447
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
Do you want to have a baby?

448
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

449
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,570
I wouldn't need to push you then.

450
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,540
I can just promote Du Di first.

451
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
I was just asking.

452
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:53,110
♫ My love for you, oh ♫

453
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,070
♫ Can't prevent you from ♫

454
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,940
♫ Falling down ♫

455
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,040
♫ We shouldn't be afraid, oh ♫

456
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,360
♫ It's better to be brave ♫

457
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,490
♫ Imagination is also fascinating ♫

458
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,600
♫ It's the first time to see you smile again ♫

459
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,530
♫ Good night, sleep tight ♫

460
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,780
♫ No need to frown ♫

461
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,730
♫ Or worry ♫

462
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,910
What song is this?

463
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,890
It's quite nice.

464
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,260
I don't know.

465
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,860
Maybe he wrote it himself.

466
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,340
So romantic.

467
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,870
If I had a husband

468
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,580
who can write songs and sing,

469
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,720
I'd never read comics

470
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,210
or join a fan club.

471
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,650
I'd only listen to

472
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,140
my husband singing all day.

473
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,560
Who said

474
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,830
a husband like him

475
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,630
was unreliable forever?

476
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,230
I was wrong.

477
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,750
I misjudged, okay?

478
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,580
It seems that

479
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,570
you really can't judge a book by its cover.

480
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,700
♫ You can still keep running ♫

481
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,130
♫ My love for you, oh ♫

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,200
♫ You should know ♫

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,820
♫ How precious you are ♫

♫ You deserve all ♫

490
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,170
What are you thinking?

491
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,880
How could Feng Yuanhang sing?

492
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,940
Well, Congrui.

493
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,190
I have to work overtime tonight.

494
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,329
We have a big job tomorrow.

495
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,829
Brain cancer combined with gestation.

496
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,770
We, the Neonatology Department, have to cooperate.

497
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,260
Do you have to?

498
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,910
I booked

499
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,329
a very high-end restaurant tonight.

500
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,700
It's rated 5 stars of Black Pearl.

501
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,770
I want to celebrate with you.

502
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,130
Celebrate what?

503
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,380
My pregnancy, of course.

504
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,230
I really can't go.

505
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,820
Maybe you can ask Du Di to go with you?

506
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,390
Am I pregnant with Du Di's baby?

507
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,740
Is this about the fact that you don't like this baby

508
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,030
coming at this time?

509
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,860
I'm so so sorry.

510
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,790
What about tomorrow?

511
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,790
The surgery is complicated.

512
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
It depends on when I get out of the operating room.

513
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,170
Tomorrow is my birthday.

514
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,110
What date is it tomorrow?

515
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,190
You defeat me.

516
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,460
How about this?

517
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,700
Come home before midnight.

518
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,550
At least cut the birthday cake

519
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,380
with me.

520
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,740
Okay, I'm hanging up.

521
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,420
Won't you order a cake for me?

522
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,400
You hung up so fast.

523
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,740
Their twins really exhaust me to death.

524
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,380
Are you asleep?

525
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,070
What is this?

526
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,220
Which bed is calling?

527
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,100
Bed? It's me who called you.

528
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,460
Why are you sleeping like this?

529
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,690
Sweetheart,

530
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,630
there's something

531
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,860
I really have to tell you.

532
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,120
What on earth is the matter?

533
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,420
I'm pregnant.

534
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,250
That's why you've been

535
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,370
sleepy for the past few days.

536
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,370
How many weeks has it been?

537
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,430
Do you want to take a leave?

538
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,440
I'll cover all your shifts.

539
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,740
No need.

540
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,320
I just found out.

541
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,870
I'll tell other people

542
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,780
when the fetus stabilizes.

543
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,250
What about your competing for the chief resident?

544
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,130
I gave up.

545
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,150
You gave up?

546
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,080
The chief resident

547
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,380
litterally means that you live

548
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,390
in the hospital 24 hours a day.

549
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,650
This time next year,

550
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,440
I'll just have delivered my baby.

551
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,890
How can I be the chief resident?

552
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,540
Are you willing

553
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,260
to just give up like this?

554
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,640
It's for my baby.

555
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,270
How can I be not willing?

556
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,180
But listen.

557
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,550
I gave up.

558
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,780
But you,

559
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,140
you'll have to try your best

560
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,500
to fight for the place of the chief resident.

561
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,130
Do you hear me?

562
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,840
Yes.

563
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,300
Have you had an ultrasound?

564
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,330
Not yet.

565
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:34,730
Come here.

566
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:45,970
You know what?

567
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,550
I've imagined

568
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,420
this scenario many times.

569
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,450
Congratulations. Your dream has come true.

570
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,410
I want to have three children.

571
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,380
It's a little cold.

572
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,360
Do you see it?

573
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,110
Right in the uterus.

574
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,210
Look.

575
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,210
I see it.

576
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,080
This is a small life,

577
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,680
Du Di,

578
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,730
now my body

579
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,960
is shared by two lives.

580
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm really touched.

581
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,170
I'm carrying a new life.

582
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,080
I think it's very beautiful

583
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,330
and amazing.

584
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,920
Anyway, it's complicated.

585
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,700
When I

586
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,200
see this small dot,

587
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,570
I find it amazing, too.

588
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,250
She is your baby!

589
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,430
I think my god-daughter

590
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,740
will definitely be cute.

591
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,970
How do you know she'll be a god-daughter?

592
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,390
Why not a god-son?

593
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,650
Daughters are better. They're warm as cotton-padded jackets.

594
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,110
I like daughters,

595
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,610
but I want a son, too.

596
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,210
Have you thought about names?

597
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,260
I'll call it Little Calabash.

598
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,280
The next child can be called Second Calabash.

599
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,060
The third child can be called Third Calabash.

600
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,740
Are you obsessed with

601
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,860
Calabash Brothers.

602
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,020
Let me remind you.

603
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,700
You must be very careful recently.

604
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,290
You'd better create a hospital filing these days.

605
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,250
If any bleeding happens,

606
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,140
check immediately.

607
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,650
You havn't been pregnant for 3 months,

608
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,840
so it's not very stable yet.

609
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,740
Why are you laughing?

610
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,900
This is medical advice.

611
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,090
The cold Empress Di

612
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,390
has become

613
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,780
so nagging.

614
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,370
Besties are more reliable than husbands.

615
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,320
Of course.

616
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,600
Oh no!

617
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,550
Why do you act so abruptly?

618
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,000
I just told you to be careful.

619
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,660
I totally forgot.

620
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,470
Li Junxiao is waiting for you

621
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,100
at Liuye Island Restaurant.

622
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,720
Go.

623
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,920
I'm not going.

624
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,050
Du Di,

625
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,800
if there's a problem between a couple,

626
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,070
you need to communicate in time.

627
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,350
If you act so passively,

628
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,590
you are being irresponsible

629
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,580
for your five-year relationship.

630
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,660
This five-year relationship is important,

631
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,660
but the biggest problem is

632
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,940
we have different sets of values.

633
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,690
When we were at college,

634
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,170
we had a simple life.

635
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,910
We never thought

636
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,710
what the future

637
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,020
would be like.

638
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,800
In the past two years,

639
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,870
I found Li Junxiao

640
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,090
more and more unfamiliar.

641
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,680
I can't accept

642
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,230
many of his opinions.

643
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,950
Have you communicated with him?

644
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,990
Have you told him

645
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,310
how you pictured

646
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,500
your future life?

647
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,040
Have you told him?

648
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,180
No.

649
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,350
That's it then.

650
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,950
Just go.

651
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,180
If anything happens

652
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,560
in the ward...

653
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,690
You have me.

654
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,350
I'm just pregnant.

655
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,620
It doesn't affect my work.

656
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,440
Fine.

657
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,030
If

658
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,990
nothing happens,

659
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,220
you'd better take the chance to have a nap.

660
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,960
Get yourself covered while sleeping.

661
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,050
Don't catch a cold.

662
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,280
Got it.

663
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,480
What a nag!

664
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,030
There should be a place like this in China.

665
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,680
But won't the doctors feel uncomfortable

666
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,610
to come here after work?

667
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,310
They finally get off the operation table,

668
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,700
but coming here

669
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,900
makes them feel like they're still in the hospital.

670
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,170
You'd have this feeling to get a scalpel

671
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,500
to slit open a belly.

672
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,380
This was opened by a former doctor

673
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,450
of Shengji.

674
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,590
For him,

675
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,170
this is nostalgic.

676
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,830
For ordinary people,

677
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,820
this is fresh.

678
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,540
But for us,

679
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,550
this is a tourist attraction

680
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,770
to entertain relatives and friends from other places.

681
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,300
But many young doctors

682
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,500
like to come here nowadays,

683
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,130
in hope of running into some experts

684
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,130
and thus establishing some relationship.

685
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,050
It's too complicated.

686
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,210
No wonder my old folk doesn't allow me to come back

687
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,860
or to do clinical work.

688
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,850
Do you want to do it?

689
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,820
You are the last student

690
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,700
of the top genius

691
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,300
in the world's best gene laboratory.

692
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,550
Even if you want to do clinical work,

693
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,850
your mentor won't allow you to.

694
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,210
But clinical work is interesting.

695
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,210
There are so many emergencies every day.

696
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,310
You get to meet all kinds of joy and sorrow, depart and reunion in the world.

697
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,030
It's boring

698
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,860
to stay in the lab.

699
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,890
Come on.

700
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,990
You are the hope

701
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,430
of human genetic science.

702
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,700
Don't get involved

703
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,490
in our clinical business.

704
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,330
How long do you plan to stay this time?

705
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,100
I don't know yet.

706
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,140
The old man has liver cancer.

707
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,230
He needs a liver transplant.

708
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,200
He finally remembered that he had a son

709
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,110
who was abandoned abroad.

710
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,130
He asked me to come back

711
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,090
to give him a liver.

712
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,500
I'll scam once it's done.

713
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,420
No wonder you're having soft drinks like me.

714
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,700
I thought you've changed.

715
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,060
Also,

716
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,680
it's not that he finally remembered you.

717
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,720
He's always been thinking about you.

718
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,580
Besides,

719
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,770
if he recovers,

720
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,020
how many patients

721
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,180
who have brain problems will be saved?

722
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,510
Think of it as

723
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,100
make contributions to the society.

724
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,240
Okay, I'll contribute.

725
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,860
After that,

726
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,900
I will never come back.

727
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,660
I just hope

728
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,370
his other parts will be fine.

729
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,630
We grew up in the same block.

730
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,460
To be honest,

731
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,950
when your mom died,

732
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,670
your dad was in great sorrow.

733
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,210
You can't treat him like that.

734
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,900
He's old.

735
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,450
You should visit him more.

736
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,010
Every time he sees me,

737
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,310
he asks me to open your WeChat Moments

738
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,610
and check how you are.

739
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,300
Why did you block him

740
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,550
without a good reason?

741
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,190
I blocked him

742
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,420
to clear his eyes.

743
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,250
Don't mention him.

744
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,860
We haven't seen each other for seven or eight years.

745
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,420
Can't we talk about

746
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,600
some romantic stuff?

747
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,740
Why do you keep mentioning him?

748
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:34,790
There's someone I know.

749
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,020
Du Di.

750
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,020
This is my childhood friend,

751
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,490
who grew up

752
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,630
following behind my back,

753
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,580
Liu Nianbai.

754
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,700
This is the best resident

755
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,050
in our department,

756
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:47,900
Du Di.

757
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,050
This is the most arbitrary resident

758
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,400
I've ever seen.

759
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,470
You are also the most

760
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,510
unreasonable person among

761
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,380
all the patient's family I've seen.

762
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,680
There must've been something between you two.

763
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,580
Why don't we sit down and talk?

764
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,680
No need. Someone's waiting for me.

765
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,220
Who is that?

766
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,880
Dr Li,

767
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,980
her boyfriend.

768
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,220
He was just promoted to attending physician,

769
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,510
so he's riding on the crest of success.

770
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,230
Such an unreasonable woman

771
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,100
could have a boyfriend?

772
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,180
She

773
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
has a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

774
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,770
This kind of person is at a disadvantage.

775
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,900
Who is that man

776
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,900
with Lin Wei?

777
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,260
I don't know. I don't care.

778
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,620
Du Di is here.

779
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,640
Iced lemon tea as always?

780
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,600
It seems that a hardworking lady like you

781
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,200
come here often, too.

782
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,290
Are you here to pick a fight?

783
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,400
Which time I came here

784
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
not because of a department gathering?

785
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,690
Weren't you there?

786
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,700
That's not what I meant.

787
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,890
I was just saying.

788
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,390
Today

789
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,940
I want to talk with you calmly.

790
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,740
I admit that day

791
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,260
my promotion to attending

792
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,930
made my head spin.

793
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,400
Also I really wanted to prove to you that

794
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,590
my sincere wish to

795
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,650
to form a family with you.

796
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,750
In a hurry,

797
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,570
some words came out wrong.

798
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,260
We've been together for five years.

799
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,600
Five years is not

800
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,800
a simple number.

801
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:13,980
It's the time we knew each other and

802
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,200
kept each other company.

803
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,090
It should be respected at least.

804
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,620
Knew each other?

805
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,630
Do you really think

806
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,660
we knew each other?

807
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,750
Iced lemon tea.

808
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,090
The first cup is free.

809
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,700
You really keep your promise.

810
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,440
Of course.

811
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,490
Our boss used to be a doctor.

812
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,440
The boss said doctors must get special treatment.

813
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,860
I heard that you are

814
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,110
the best female resident

815
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,780
in Shengji Hospital in recent years.

816
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,020
We must take good care of you.

817
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,040
You won the first place

818
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,270
in our Long Island Iced Tea

819
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:48,930
Challenge.

820
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,040
She didn't even blush after drinking seven glasses at a sitting.

821
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,670
No one break

822
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,550
this record until now.

823
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,850
Our boss said

824
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,270
no matter when you come,

825
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,860
the first cup is always free.

826
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,560
It was so impressing.

827
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,010
I don't drink normally.

828
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,300
I just didn't want to lose.

829
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,950
I can't even beat you in drinking.

830
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,840
I can at most drink a beer.

831
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,000
And you?

832
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,250
Seven glasses of Long Island Ice Tea.

833
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,860
Maybe I shouldn't have found

834
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,950
a woman who needs to be

835
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,040
No. 1 on everything.

836
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,160
Go on.

837
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,670
Women are women.

838
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,270
Men conquer the world.

839
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,310
Women conquer men

840
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,100
to conquer the world.

841
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,350
This is determined by physiology.

842
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,790
Men use androgen

843
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,700
to build muscles.

844
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,900
Women have estrogen

845
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,900
to raise descendants.

846
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,980
Isn't this inborn?

847
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,440
Du Di,

848
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,530
can't you just change

849
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,550
your bad temper?

850
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,030
I'm saying this for your own good.

851
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:45,780
Do you know how people

852
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,420
talk about you in private?

853
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,930
They say if weren't for Director Zhang,

854
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,690
no leader in the hospital

855
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,310
is willing to accept

856
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,190
a female doctor like you.

857
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,750
You always have thorns when communicating with others.

858
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,980
Not only the patient's family,

859
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,510
but even doctors and nurses

860
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,630
are not willing to cooperate with you.

861
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,030
And you want to be

862
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,900
the chief resident like this?

863
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,870
Do you know

864
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,340
a chief resident needs

865
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,150
not only professional skills,

866
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,640
but also capability

867
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,810
of coordinating all departments

868
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,690
and wards in the hospital.

869
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,450
Do you think you can do it with a personality like that?

870
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,890
Li Junxiao,

871
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,260
do you turn to personal attack

872
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,050
because of the failure of the proposal?

873
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,380
Why didn't I find

874
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,500
you were so disgusting?

875
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,080
Who's disgusting?

876
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,260
With your attitude,

877
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,260
we can't communicate at all.

878
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,620
It's more than what's due that

879
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,130
I came here today to talk to you.

880
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,900
See?

881
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,700
They're quarreling.

882
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,500
They'll break up sooner or later.

883
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,520
Your mouth is a jinx.

884
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,370
What do you mean?

885
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,750
Did you want to

886
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,450
break up with me long ago?

887
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,890
You despise me just because I'm poor.

888
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,470
Unreasonable.

889
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,610
Hello?

890
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,290
Dr. Du, come back quickly.

891
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,740
Li Qiao'er fainted in the toilet.

892
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,090
I see. I'll be right back.

893
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,000
What's wrong?

894
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,970
Li Qiao'er might have a tubal rupture.

895
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,920
How is she now?

896
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,900
What's going on?

897
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,750
Send the patient in first.

898
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,460
I’ll be right there.

899
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,750
Li Fei said

900
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,430
she kept going to the toilet tonight.

901
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,970
I suspect some bleeding

902
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,600
caused a bearing-down sensation in her lower abdomen.

903
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,760
She thought it was diarrhea.

904
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,420
She fainted

905
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,420
when she last went to the toilet.

906
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,240
Luckily, Li Fei knew

907
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,970
she had ectopic pregnancy,

908
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,790
so he kept an eye on her

909
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,670
and didn't dare to slack off.

910
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,750
She needs a surgery now,

911
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,220
but there are two problems.

912
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:31,950
First,

913
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,370
she has no family member to sign for her.

914
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,060
Second,

915
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,370
she doesn't have any money for follow-up treatments.

916
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,470
I'll pay for her fees.

917
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,000
I thought you have nothing to do with her.

918
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,640
We are kind of friends now.

919
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,790
It's important to save her life first.

920
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,780
According to the ultrasound report,

921
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,020
the location of implatation of her gestation sac

922
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,600
is very unfavourable.

923
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,950
It's the most dangerous type,

924
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,660
Tubal Isthmus Pregnancy.

925
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,850
After the rupture, the function of the fallopian tube

926
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,800
may be damaged.

927
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,840
I'll do the surgery.

928
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,250
Du Di, you'll be my assistant.

929
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,720
Okay.

930
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,780
No wonder it broke.

931
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,990
Such a big gestation sac

932
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,940
grows in such a narrow tube.

933
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,120
I guess she's already felt

934
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,710
unwell.

935
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,810
But she didn't know what happened,

936
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,290
so she didn't realize the seriousness of it.

937
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,740
The fallopian tube is broken like this.

938
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,670
Let's cut it off.

939
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,700
Don't!

940
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,690
There's no other choices.

941
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,720
Even if we stitch it,

942
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,700
it won't work.

943
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,010
What if she has ectopic pregnancy again?

944
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,650
Dr. Lin, she's only 18.

945
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,380
She must be a migrant worker

946
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
coming from the countryside to the city.

947
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,870
If one of her fallopian tubes is gone,

948
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,660
she'll be traumatized.

949
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,500
Let's try our best.

950
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,870
We can only give her

951
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,950
a symbol of intactness.

952
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:50,740
Bring me the thread.

953
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,010
Talk to the patient after the surgery.

954
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,270
Mom.

955
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,210
I...

956
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,690
I've already had one foot in the grave,

957
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,760
and my only wish is

958
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,470
to have a grandson.

959
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,800
Like I said,

960
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,900
it was just an appendectomy.

961
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,050
It has nothing to do with giving birth.

962
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,670
I know,

963
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,060
but I just feel bad.

964
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,100
I have nowhere to vent my anger.

965
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,410
That's not true.

966
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,910
Well then, you let her give me a boy.

967
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,760
What are you staring at?

968
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,250
There, there.

969
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,130
The ectopic pregnancy surgery

970
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,190
takes such a long time?

971
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,420
It's almost as long as the cerebral surgeries.

972
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,280
You know medicine?

973
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,150
Yes, I also study medicine.

974
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,650
Which school?

975
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,160
Johns Hopnews.

976
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,690
Famous school.

977
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,740
Is Du Di your girlfriend?

978
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,260
Almost not.

979
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,190
Done.

980
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,200
Dr. Lin, thank you.

981
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,920
If anyone should thank me, it should be Li Qiao'er.

982
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,060
What do you thank me for?

983
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,900
What time is it?

984
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,280
Two o'clock.

985
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,680
You close the abdomen.

986
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,550
How is it?

987
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,640
I'm done.

988
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,080
Let's go and continue.

989
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,870
Just leave the rest

990
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,100
to Du Di.

991
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,240
Let's go.

992
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,210
Shall we continue?

993
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,310
Let's...

994
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,760
Let's break up.

995
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,170
Why? Why are you

996
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,260
being so cruel to me?

997
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,390
Li Junxiao,

998
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,790
I can't become that kind of women

999
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,120
that you expect.

1000
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,130
I can't sacrifice what I want

1001
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,530
just because

1002
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,469
I'm a woman.

1003
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,179
I don't like

1004
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,179
others see me only as a woman,

1005
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,449
instead of a human being.

1006
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,310
I can't ignore

1007
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,130
the injustice that women suffered.

1008
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,210
Nor can I try to accept it

1009
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,449
until I'm heartless,

1010
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,989
and then use this crap

1011
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,960
to persuade my daughter

1012
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,110
or other women.

1013
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,449
I just can't.

1014
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,770
Du Di,

1015
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,980
you'll regret it.

1016
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:48,889
Mom!

1017
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,460
Mom.

1018
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,820
In this exam,

1019
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,150
Di

1020
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,420
is the No.1 again in her grade.

1021
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,780
She's just a girl.

1022
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,250
No matter how good she is,

1023
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,320
in the future,

1024
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,610
she will be the daughter-in-law

1025
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,260
of another family.

1026
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,360
What's the use of wasting money?

1027
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,860
Don't bother me anymore.

1028
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:06,970
Mom,

1029
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,570
could you not talk like this

1030
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,320
in front of the kid?

1031
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,140
I don't blame you yet,

1032
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,770
but you're lecturing me instead.

1033
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,760
I didn't ask you to come visit me.

1034
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,840
You came here to make me angry.

1035
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,680
If you want to talk to me,

1036
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,560
give birth to a boy first.

1037
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,470
Mom,

1038
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,760
didn't we agree on this?

1039
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,820
I work in public institution,

1040
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,090
therefore it's against the regulations to have another child.

1041
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,880
It's enough to have Di.

1042
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,410
You can resign.

1043
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,890
Is your work more important

1044
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,000
than the bloodline

1045
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,990
of our Du family?

1046
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,650
Okay.

1047
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,000
We'll think about it.

1048
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,420
Old fogey!

1049
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,990
What are you talking about?

1050
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,030
How could you say that?

1051
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Apologize to grandma.

1052
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,100
Grandma is being unreasonable.

1053
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,540
I won't apologize.

1054
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,240
I'm just better than men.

1055
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,070
I'm better than

1056
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,870
all the men in your family!

1057
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,980
Come back!

1058
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,560
Bai, have you found your phone?

1059
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,320
Yes.

1060
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:07,870
Coming.

1061
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,370
Am I dead?

1062
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,700
Almost.

1063
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,120
Last night,

1064
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,350
your fallopian tube was broken,

1065
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,020
so you had a surgery.

1066
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,150
I had an operation

1067
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,650
before I have an abortion.

1068
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,190
How much does it cost?

1069
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,920
The fetus is gone.

1070
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,170
Really?

1071
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,600
Yes.

1072
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,220
Thank goodness. It's finally gone.

1073
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,230
When can I get discharged?

1074
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,540
Is this a single room?

1075
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,050
I can't afford it.

1076
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,260
I've paid the fees of operation

1077
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,200
and hospitalization for you.

1078
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,610
Just take care of yourself.

1079
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,220
I'm leaving.

1080
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,960
How many levels do I need to help you gain

1081
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,640
to pay it back?

1082
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,370
You don't have to gain levels for me.

1083
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,810
But you'd better

1084
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,320
ask your family to come.

1085
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,150
I have something important.

1086
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,160
I can't be with you every day.

1087
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,620
I dare not.

1088
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,690
Why not?

1089
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,620
My uncle said

1090
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,010
if my family finds out,

1091
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,320
he'll tell my dad

1092
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,500
that I'm indiscreet

1093
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,460
and I slept around the moment I came to the city.

1094
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,060
He'll make our whole family feel ashamed.

1095
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,000
Your uncle?

1096
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,300
The children in our village

1097
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,640
are all brought to the city

1098
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,790
by this uncle.

1099
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,230
Not long after I came here,

1100
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,220
he...

1101
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,730
he made me

1102
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,120
to sleep with him.

1103
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,090
He hit me if I refused.

1104
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,150
He said other girls all did the same.

1105
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,110
My period didn't come. He said I'm pregnant.

1106
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,820
He gave me money and told me to abort it. He also asked me not to tell anyone.

1107
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,360
Qiao'er,

1108
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,320
you can't put up with this.

1109
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,050
You were raped.

1110
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,760
Do you know that?

1111
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,040
If you put up with it,

1112
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,220
more girls

1113
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,130
will be hurt.

1114
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,270
I dare not.

1115
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,190
I really dare not.

1116
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,750
Call the police.

1117
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,340
I heard everything you said.

1118
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,420
I'm scared.

1119
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,580
She's not ready yet.

1120
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,420
Whether you're ready or not,

1121
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,070
the gestation sag that was taken out

1122
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,670
will be properly protected as evidence.

1123
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,630
If you don't call the police,

1124
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,380
I'll do it for you.

1125
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,430
Can't you put

1126
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,630
her feelings first?

1127
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,730
She is so scared now.

1128
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,070
During the process of obtaining evidence,

1129
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
she will be asked about the details of the incident

1130
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,110
over and over again.

1131
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,170
Plus, there's the pressure

1132
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,960
from her family and the society.

1133
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,320
It'll cause secondary damage to her.

1134
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,260
We should wait for her to muster up the courage

1135
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,310
and to get prepared

1136
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,540
to face all this,

1137
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,710
and then we can take the next step.

1138
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,390
While you're mustering up the courage

1139
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,570
and preparing yourself,

1140
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,850
the man you mentioned

1141
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,840
may be hurting

1142
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,160
another girl from your hometown.

1143
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,730
Is this what you want to see?

1144
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,470
Don't put so much pressure on her.

1145
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,580
She just had a surgery.

1146
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,500
It hurts.

1147
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,380
How is it?

1148
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,300
It hurts.

1149
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,830
It's all your fault.

1150
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,700
It's me, okay?

1151
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,900
You go out first. I'll take care of her.

1152
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,440
Please bless me, Calabash.

1153
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,000
Bless me to give birth to a cute little calabash.

1154
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,760
Bless me.

1155
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,150
When did you come in?

1156
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,470
Why didn't you make a sound?

1157
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,300
I'm sorry.

1158
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,720
The nurse asked me

1159
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,540
to wait for you in the office.

1160
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,590
I want to ask

1161
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,460
about these parenting books.

1162
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,580
Which one do you think

1163
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,390
is more reliable?

1164
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,410
These two books are fine.

1165
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,440
Forget about this one.

1166
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,320
These two.

1167
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,100
Why did you buy so many books?

1168
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,760
I have to make up for it.

1169
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,350
I was not a good husband.

1170
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,770
I must be a good father.

1171
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,710
Good.

1172
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,860
Keep up the good work.

1173
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,750
I'll leave then.

1174
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,780
By the way,

1175
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,900
I watched a variety show

1176
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,040
a couple of days before.

1177
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,520
All the participants are rock bands.

1178
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,590
Why don't you go

1179
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,950
join such a show?

1180
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,750
Nobody likes a little-known band like us.

1181
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,290
Last time I heard you sing.

1182
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,560
I think you sang very well.

1183
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,680
You can really have a try.

1184
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,410
You might become famous.

1185
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,110
When you're famous,

1186
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,140
you don't have to run around

1187
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,990
to look for a performance chance.

1188
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,200
If you don't become famous,

1189
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,460
such a beautiful song

1190
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,560
would be a perfect present

1191
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,540
for your baby.

1192
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,970
Do you really think I can do it?

1193
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,420
I really do.

1194
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,220
The other day

1195
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:31,940
when I was browsing my WeChat Moments,

1196
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,210
I see that the family member of one of my patients

1197
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,380
works for this program.

1198
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,770
I can ask for you

1199
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,780
if there's any vacancies left.

1200
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,240
If there is, I'll register for you.

1201
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,450
Are you interested?

1202
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,620
Yes, I am.

1203
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,000
Thank you.

1204
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,110
You're welcome.

1205
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,560
Please knock the door next time.

1206
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,560
Okay, thank you.

1207
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,640
Bye.

1208
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,550
Bye.

1209
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,190
Are you okay?

1210
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,960
You are pale

1211
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,720
as a ghost.

1212
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,710
No problem.

1213
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,660
How was your talk yesterday?

1214
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,580
It's a waste of your kindness.

1215
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,140
We broke up.

1216
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,470
It's okay.

1217
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,820
Men don't matter.

1218
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,910
You still have me.

1219
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
What kind of logic is that?

1220
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,540
Won't you persuade me to get back together with him?

1221
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,960
I know you well.

1222
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,900
After talking twice,

1223
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,910
nothing has changed.

1224
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:30,920
So you must have made

1225
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,080
the final decision.

1226
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,880
Although I have some pities

1227
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,710
on Li Junxiao,

1228
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:35,850
but no matter what,

1229
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,450
I'm on your side.

1230
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,450
Thanks.

1231
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,530
There's more.

1232
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,420
What?

1233
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,020
what day is it today?

1234
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,030
Oh!

1235
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,630
Darn! Director Tian asked me

1236
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,730
to hand an experimental report.

1237
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,660
I forgot to organize it.

1238
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,730
You're so heartless.

1239
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,100
I have only you in my heart,

1240
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,690
while you only care about reports.

1241
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,080
Look at my report.

1242
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,910
How is it?

1243
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,570
It's perfect.
