[Beloved Life]

[Episode 5]

4
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,380
Since you have said

5
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,410
these words already,

6
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,050
I'll give Wu Congrui

7
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,740
another chance.

8
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,850
But I have

9
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,820
to make it clear.

10
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,670
It's time to get more beds

11
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,350
for our Obstetric and Gynecologic Department now.

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,910
Liu Zhenghua was still presiding over the work of his department

13
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,610
while lying in the bed.

14
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,240
He didn't rest at all.

15
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,870
He also got

16
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,020
a national scientific research project.

17
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,910
We can't

18
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,259
make any mistakes now.

19
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,060
You vouched for Wu Congrui this time.

20
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,580
If the thing happens again,

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,540
I won't show any mercy.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,010
Thank you, Director Tian.

23
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,979
All of you

24
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,970
are living goddesses.

25
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,390
The most miserable director

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,400
of this hospital is me.

27
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,550
Go.

28
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,760
By the way,

29
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,010
did our department

30
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,660
get any scientific research project?

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,060
After Director Zhang left,

32
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,190
we haven't got any research project.

33
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,500
I need more talents.

34
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,590
Talents.

35
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,540
I've been talking to you

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,870
about these trivial things all the time.

37
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,820
The status of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,610
in the hospital has been threatened.

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,970
It has been threatened, Director Huang.

40
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,690
Why are you here?

41
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,780
Firstly...

42
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,460
Lie down. Lie down.

43
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,130
Here.

44
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,730
Firstly,

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,340
I come to see you.

46
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,380
Secondly,

47
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,450
I would like to know

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,320
about the condition of Number 40.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,500
You mean Wu Chanjuan?

50
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,390
She is an out-of-town patient of our hospital.

51
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,790
Her family is very poor.

52
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,730
She has no medical insurance.

53
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,950
If you want

54
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,050
to use any expensive medicine,

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,020
you should discuss with her.

56
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,660
You can use as much cheap medicine as possible.

57
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,420
When she came to the hospital,

58
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,180
she spent all of her family's money.

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,230
Her husband

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,500
is still working outside now.

61
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,800
He's afraid that he can't afford the operation.

62
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,670
I think it's just a drop in the bucket.

63
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,870
No wonder.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,440
When I was on ward rounds today,

65
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,790
I only saw her daughter

66
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,710
with her.

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,410
I have stopped working.

68
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,590
Who took over

69
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,500
my patients?

70
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,510
Was it Du Di?

71
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,930
She wanted to take over

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
all the patients.

73
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,380
But I didn't let her succeed.

74
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,130
I took over your patients.

75
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,100
Do you think

76
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,100
I've gone too far?

77
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,290
I think you did the right thing.

78
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,300
She caused me to have a miscarriage.

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,140
She even wanted to take over my job immediately.

80
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,060
She was too greedy.

81
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,240
I just think

82
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,830
she's getting more and more unfamiliar

83
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,920
and horrible.

84
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,620
Maybe

85
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,600
when you return

86
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,840
to work,

87
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,290
you'll find she has already become

88
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:13,820
the chief resident.

89
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,670
I will compete with her

90
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,560
to the end.

91
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,060
Come on.

92
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,410
I support you.

93
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,769
From the time when we were in college,

94
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,149
I knew you were definitely not worse than her.

95
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,380
Let me ask you a question.

96
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,660
We've known each other for so long.

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,160
If I compete with her,

98
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,870
who do you think

99
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,390
is more likely to win?

100
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:29,860
It's you.

101
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,780
Stop kidding me.

102
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,680
Everyone in the world knows

103
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,380
how good Du Di is at surgery.

104
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,250
She's a hardworking player.

105
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,260
But you are different.

106
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,820
You are a genius player.

107
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,510
Her motivation for studying

108
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,670
is hatred.

109
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,580
But your motivation for studying is happiness.

110
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,390
Of course,

111
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,510
because we are so happy,

112
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,570
we are not as good as she is

113
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,390
when it comes to things

114
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,570
that require hard work

115
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,890
to achieve.

116
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,140
But...

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,400
What is a genius?

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,870
A genius is born.

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,260
Hard working is acquired.

120
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,110
Genius Wu Congrui, listen carefully.

121
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,860
As long as you work hard,

122
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,890
you'll beat her.

123
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,780
Li Junxiao.

124
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,730
No one

125
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,080
has ever told me these before.

126
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,070
Feng Yuanhang

127
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,460
just blamed me for not working hard enough.

128
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,000
You have given me a lot of confidence.

129
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,490
I'll work hard.

130
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,430
I'll never

131
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,420
give away the opportunity.

132
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,930
What are you doing?

133
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,090
What are you doing here?

134
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,080
Don't tell me

135
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,450
you're here to visit Congrui.

136
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,190
Don't you know

137
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,360
how much she doesn't want to see you now?

138
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,480
She lost her baby because of you.

139
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,480
Without me telling you,

140
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,620
you can see how upset she is now.

141
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,300
If you really care about her,

142
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,970
don't show up in front of her.

143
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,170
Let's go and see a doctor.

144
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,940
Be good.

145
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,050
Good girl.

146
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,250
The structure of a cat is like this.

147
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,340
Okay.

148
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,660
Okay.

149
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,410
Be careful.

150
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,180
Okay.

151
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,530
Good girl.

152
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:28,900
Doctor.

153
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:29,930
How is it?

154
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:30,930
It's fine.

155
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,800
It's just pregnant.

156
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,190
It's female?

157
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:33,830
Why are you, its master,

158
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,820
so careless?

159
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,290
It's a girl.

160
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,650
What's more,

161
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,790
look at this broken cardboard box.

162
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,550
How could you use it?

163
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,390
If you don't like cats,

164
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,360
don't keep a cat.

165
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,420
Look at them.

166
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,170
Look.

167
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,190
It's a wild cat.

168
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,950
It will give birth

169
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,620
in a week.

170
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,530
Bring it back here

171
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,040
when it's due.

172
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,430
By the way,

173
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,010
you need to go to the reception to pay fees.

174
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,060
The fees of the examination

175
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,820
and the ultrasound scan

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,490
are 1,100 yuan in total.

177
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,060
So expensive.

178
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:02,950
Wait.

179
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,960
The registration fee for an attending physician

180
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,180
at an upper first-class hospital

181
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,050
is only dozens of yuan.

182
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,700
The ultrasound scan fee

183
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,020
of one person

184
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,300
is only 380 yuan.

185
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,750
You just touched it

186
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,580
and gave it an ultrasound scan.

187
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,330
Did those cost 1,100 yuan?

188
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,350
Why are you so strange?

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,580
I've been studying veterinary clinical medicine

190
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,760
for four years.

191
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,650
Isn't it valuable?

192
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,440
I've been working for three years.

193
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,750
And I have saved many animals.

194
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,660
Isn't it valuable?

195
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,920
Do you know

196
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,830
the value of a doctor?

197
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,180
Yes.

198
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,430
I know that.

199
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,030
Well.

200
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,270
How much more does it cost

201
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:31,970
for the delivery?

202
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,620
It depends on whether the baby is delivered by a natural birth

203
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,400
or by a cesarean section.

204
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,050
If it's delivered by a natural birth,

205
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,970
it will cost 2,000 yuan.

206
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,340
If it's delivered by a cesarean section,

207
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,530
together with the hospitalization care fee,

208
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,380
you'll spend five to six thousand yuan.

209
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,159
Did you buy a commercial insurance for your cat?

210
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,820
Well...

211
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,220
Do cats have their commercial medical insurances?

212
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,790
Many insurance companies

213
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,140
provide such services now.

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,180
But you need to buy an insurance in advance.

215
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,270
I have given you

216
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,220
my living expenses for this month.

217
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,570
The pink cage.

218
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,500
Give me one.

219
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,520
Di.

220
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,950
Can you stop meowing?

221
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,900
The family member of Wu Chanjuan.

222
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,710
Hello, Dr. Li.

223
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,460
When is your dad coming?

224
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,710
I don't know.

225
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,350
Here's the thing.

226
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,150
The fees you paid

227
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,130
when you were just hospitalized

228
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,300
have been used up.

229
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,860
You have to inform your dad

230
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,940
to pay the bill.

231
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,340
He called my mom yesterday

232
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,660
and said he didn't make any money.

233
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,840
He asked us to buy some time.

234
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,140
Two days have passed.

235
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,590
Your mom needs surgery.

236
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,710
There are many medicines to be prepared in advance.

237
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,210
If you don't pay the bill,

238
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,850
the system won't be able to prescribe any medicine.

239
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,550
What does your dad do?

240
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
Delivery.

241
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,960
He was in a hurry yesterday,

242
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,890
and he accidentally bumped into someone's car.

243
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,990
He gave all the money he earned recently

244
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,180
to the car owner.

245
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,380
Do you have other relatives

246
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,300
to help you?

247
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,780
Dad said

248
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,030
our relatives were not rich.

249
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,970
We can't borrow money from them

250
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,930
unless we have no choice

251
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,430
because they will only lend us once.

252
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,860
But

253
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,450
I'll get the scholarship

254
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,760
in two days.

255
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,650
The scholarship

256
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,100
is over 1,000 yuan.

257
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,340
Is it enough?

258
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,400
Brother.

259
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,410
I got paid from the foreman of the construction site.

260
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,640
I earned over 1,000 yuan in three months.

261
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,020
Is it enough to pay your tuition fee?

262
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,620
How about this?

263
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,380
I'll pay the money for you first.

264
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,570
You can give it back to me

265
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,490
when you and your dad have enough money.

266
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,420
Is it okay?

267
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,390
Thank you, Dr. Li.

268
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,070
You're such a good person.

269
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,940
I will pay you back.

270
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,730
Don't cry. Don't cry.

271
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,250
Haven't you had a meal?

272
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,630
I don't have much money on my meal card.

273
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,570
I'm afraid that if I use the money up,

274
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,700
my mom will have no food.

275
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,620
How many days have you not eaten?

276
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,390
Just a few days.

277
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,280
I ate the rest

278
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,290
of what my mom didn't finish.

279
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,890
Let's go. I'll buy you a hamburger.

280
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,420
Don't be shy.

281
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,110
Although my salary is not high,

282
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,990
I can afford

283
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,890
a hamburger.

284
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,660
Eat it up.

285
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,460
Take a big bite.

286
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,140
What's wrong?

287
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,960
Is it not good?

288
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
It's my first time eating a hamburger.

289
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,530
I didn't expect

290
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,010
the taste of a hamburger to be like this.

291
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,920
It's not expensive.

292
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,380
How could it be your first time to eat that?

293
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,820
How old are you?

294
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,700
16.

295
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,140
You're 16.

296
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,390
But you look like

297
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,780
a girl of 12 or 13 years old.

298
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,620
I'm a freshman now.

299
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,130
I didn't expect your family

300
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,000
to be in such poor condition.

301
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,500
I thought

302
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,820
I was the only one

303
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,580
who experienced this.

304
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,300
You're 16.

305
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,140
You were born after 2000.

306
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,500
How could you have never had a hamburger?

307
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,670
You lied to me.

308
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,860
Actually,

309
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,490
my family

310
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,750
was not so poor before.

311
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,100
It was because my grandpa had cancer.

312
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
It cost a lot of money to treat him.

313
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,250
But it couldn't be cured.

314
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,580
After his death,

315
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,930
my grandma passed away.

316
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,250
My dad was sensitive about his reputation.

317
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,750
He borrowed a lot of money

318
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,150
to make

319
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,450
a big grave for them.

320
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,160
Then, we had few money.

321
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,390
It sounds like

322
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,180
he is a foolish father.

323
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,620
Uncle.

324
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,940
Why was your family poor

325
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,030
when you were young?

326
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,220
You and me

327
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,020
are different.

328
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,620
Although you have a foolish father,

329
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,050
your parents are both alive.

330
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,130
My parents

331
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,380
passed away

332
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,670
because of an accident at the construction site

333
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,340
when I was very young.

334
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,310
I remember

335
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,680
I was only 10 at that time.

336
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,580
My elder sister was 14.

337
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,630
Then, my sister

338
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,580
dropped out early

339
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,730
to send me to school.

340
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,180
She worked hard

341
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,020
to make money every day.

342
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
My sister told me

343
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,780
even if my parents died,

344
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,720
she would make me to be a qualified person.

345
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,100
She said she wanted to

346
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,380
bring honor on our ancestors.

347
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,720
I'm going to be an elder sister soon.

348
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
I may not be able

349
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,210
to go to university.

350
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,100
It won't happen.

351
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,260
As long as your father

352
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,460
work hard to make money,

353
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,500
the debt will be paid off soon.

354
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:43,980
Uncle.

355
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,760
Let's go back.

356
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,640
We haven't finished eating hamburgers.

357
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,570
Why are you in a hurry?

358
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,340
I'm full.

359
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,990
I don't think my mom has had a hamburger.

360
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,940
I want to bring it back

361
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,590
and give it to my mom.

362
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Eat it up.

363
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,650
I'll buy another one for you.

364
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,450
Eat it.

365
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,740
Kid.

366
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,160
Why are you here?

367
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,900
I'm the family member of Number 40.

368
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,640
Dr. Li said

369
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,790
I could use his computer

370
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,460
to do homework.

371
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,500
What are you doing?

372
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,980
I let her in.

373
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,660
When did you become

374
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,540
so kind?

375
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,780
What are you talking about?

376
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,860
The family member of Number 40 is Li Huandi.

377
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,830
If I'm not mistaken,

378
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,620
your previous name means "calling for a younger brother".

379
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,780
Your parents

380
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,060
wanted to have a son and you would have a younger brother.

381
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,740
You...

382
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,550
How do you know?

383
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,690
I not only know this,

384
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,740
I also know that

385
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,819
if your mother really has a son,

386
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,099
you'll have to drop out of school

387
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,740
to work.

388
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,180
Do you have any humanity?

389
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,280
Why are you telling this to a kid?

390
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:17,849
Sit down.

391
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,680
Can you consider

392
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,640
others' feelings?

393
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,900
From patients to their family members,

394
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,500
from your friends to your boyfriends,

395
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,540
if you still treat them like this,

396
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,609
you'll suffer a big loss sooner or later.

397
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,320
Only someone like you,

398
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,280
who has been taken care of by his elder sister

399
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,230
since he was a little boy,

400
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,580
would not understand the feelings of others.

401
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,100
You...

402
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,150
You two are so idle.

403
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,060
Director Huang.

404
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,020
Du Di.

405
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,290
From now on,

406
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,120
you'll be transferred from the Obstetrical Department.

407
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,190
The Family Planning Department

408
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,900
needs help.

409
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,410
You can go there.

410
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,250
Why?

411
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,890
I have

412
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,050
two high-risk pregnancies with diabetes

413
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,750
to operate on today.

414
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,370
Attending physicians can do that.

415
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,270
Junxiao.

416
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,280
Don't let the kid

417
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,460
in the ward office.

418
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,740
If she really needs to stay in an office,

419
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,540
you can take her to my office.

420
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,570
No one is there.

421
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,340
Thank you, Director Huang.

422
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,220
Huandi.

423
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,140
Let's go.

424
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,480
Go to Director Huang's office.

425
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,660
Those who always act unjustly will bring destruction upon themselves.

426
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,490
Let's go.

427
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,780
Do we wait for the natural placental separation?

428
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,210
She's bleeding a lot.

429
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,070
Don't wait.

430
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,860
You make the placental separation.

431
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,890
The placenta is complete.

432
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,660
Fortunately, the placenta is stuck in the uterus.

433
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,530
Only a small amount of the membrane remain.

434
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,750
Take off

435
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,420
all the remaining membrane.

436
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,900
Okay.

437
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,090
There's a lot of bleeding.

438
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,470
Bring a balloon and put it in the uterine cavity.

439
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,350
Stop the bleeding first.

440
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,390
Take it out tomorrow.

441
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,890
Great, Li Junxiao.

442
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,390
No wonder you were promoted

443
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,140
to the attending physician quickly.

444
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,700
You have great professional skills.

445
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,440
Thank you, Director Huang.

446
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,990
I hope you can

447
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,020
give me more chances.

448
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,320
I won't let you down.

449
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,220
By the way, Director Huang,

450
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,400
I recently found

451
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,510
that you were quite indifferent

452
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,180
to Du Di.

453
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,940
Was it because of Congrui?

454
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,140
Academician Lang Jinghe said

455
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,640
a great medical scientist

456
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,830
should have great thoughts.

457
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,940
This idea is philosophical,

458
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,230
scientifically inferred,

459
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,260
and dialectically deductive.

460
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,540
A great medical scientist

461
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,870
should also be selfless and loving.

462
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,580
This kind of love is wide,

463
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,530
deep,

464
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,300
and ethical,

465
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,080
and not single,

466
00:19:59,370 --> 00:19:59,880
superficial

467
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:00,930
and defiant.

468
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,580
I think you should know

469
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,980
the problem of Du Di.

470
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,650
I also hope

471
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,580
you will know

472
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,910
your problem in the future.

473
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,710
Okay.

474
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,000
It's finished.

475
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,710
Dr. Li.

476
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,230
What will you have for dinner?

477
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,570
I have no choice.

478
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,900
I can only go to the canteen and have a simple meal.

479
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,040
Let's go out to eat together.

480
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,820
My treat.

481
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,010
Why do you suddenly want to treat me?

482
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,370
What do you think?

483
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,940
You broke up with Du Di, right?

484
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,760
So, I have a chance now.

485
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,670
I'm not ready to move on

486
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,390
to the next relationship.

487
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,800
What else do you need to get ready?

488
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,180
We have been working together

489
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,730
for four years.

490
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,610
I think

491
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,870
we have known each other well.

492
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,900
Are you sure you know me?

493
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,350
Of course.

494
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,110
You graduated with a PhD from a top university.

495
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,750
You were excellent in school.

496
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,050
You were the president of the student union.

497
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,020
You're intelligent and have the leadership skills.

498
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,350
Now you have been promoted to the attending physician

499
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,070
and have become a key doctor

500
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,230
of our department to be trained.

501
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
You have a great future.

502
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,440
What do you think?

503
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,490
Do I know you well?

504
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:30,780
Fine.

505
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,930
I'll keep asking you out

506
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,940
until you are ready.

507
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,840
Congrui.

508
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,660
Are you discharged?

509
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,750
Wait.

510
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,110
You asked me

511
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,980
to take Di to the hospital.

512
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,300
I took it there.

513
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,970
It was not sick.

514
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,300
It's a girl.

515
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:03,950
It's pregnant now.

516
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,050
You bring a pregnant cat

517
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,980
to provoke me?

518
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,810
No, no.

519
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,790
What do you mean?

520
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,580
Be careful of your child.

521
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,730
Be careful of the bad guys.

522
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,160
Let's go home.

523
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,370
It's rare to have time to rest.

524
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,210
What are you doing

525
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,010
instead of sleeping and getting well?

526
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
I'm worried

527
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,740
that Du Di can't take care of Di well.

528
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,650
I want to bring it back.

529
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,270
How long are you going

530
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,260
to be in a cold war with Du Di?

531
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,940
I'm not in a cold war with her.

532
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,130
When I saw her,

533
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,290
I thought of my baby, Little Hulu.

534
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
I don't want to see her.

535
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,100
But you still have to face her

536
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,260
sooner or later.

537
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
Feng Yuanhang.

538
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,460
Our child is gone.

539
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,240
You're not sad at all.

540
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,450
You speak for her every day.

541
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,660
Are you my husband

542
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,620
or her husband?

543
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,720
I told you

544
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,220
there were many factors that caused the loss of our child.

545
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,500
I have seen

546
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,270
many cases of miscarriage

547
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,030
caused by various reasons

548
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,510
every month.

549
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,180
But that's our child.

550
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,340
The child of you and me.

551
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,090
From the perspective of biology,

552
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,830
it's still a mass of cellular tissue

553
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,020
without consciousness.

554
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,970
Enough. Enough. Enough.

555
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,440
You're a scientist.

556
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,620
You're strict.

557
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,660
But I'm really sad.

558
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,090
I'm sad, you know?

559
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,710
Congrui.

560
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,470
Let bygones be bygones.

561
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,700
Stop thinking about it.

562
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,350
The most important thing for you now

563
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,650
is to take care of yourself.

564
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,110
Okay?

565
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,620
Don't cry.

566
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,240
I heard that after today's work,

567
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,550
Su Ye and Li Fei

568
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,740
were going to see Congrui, right?

569
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,030
Congrui has been

570
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,670
in a bad mood recently.

571
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,060
Li Fei will go and talk to her.

572
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,550
I'll buy some donkey-hide gelatin

573
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,430
and red dates for her.

574
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,120
Can I ask them

575
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,200
to give these to her for me?

576
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,690
Why don't you give her directly?

577
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,120
You two haven't reconciled yet?

578
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,700
She's still so weak.

579
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,370
I don't want to upset her.

580
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,660
Okay.

581
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,710
I'll ask Su Ye

582
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,540
to bring these for you.

583
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:57,810
Thank you, Head Nurse Wang.

584
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,020
You're welcome.

585
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,070
Don't tell her they are from me.

586
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,270
I'm afraid she won't accept them.

587
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,990
I know.

588
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll tell them.

589
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,080
Dr. Du.

590
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,560
The patient is ready.

591
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,510
Okay, right away.

592
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,050
Thank you, Head Nurse Wang.

593
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,820
You're welcome.

594
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,030
Let's go.

595
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,540
You shouldn't have done that in the first place.

596
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,500
Here, be careful.

597
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,260
When is your dad coming?

598
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,660
He said he was on his way.

599
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,700
Did he

600
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,220
bring the money?

601
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,370
Yes.

602
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,980
But it seemed not enough.

603
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,410
It's okay.

604
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,360
I'll pay the rest for you first.

605
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,020
Send your mother to the operating room now.

606
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,900
Thank you, Dr. Li.

607
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,140
What's wrong?

608
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,240
Her surgery fee is expensive.

609
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,450
Her family members

610
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,350
have paid a part of it.

611
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,470
And I didn't

612
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
pay too much money.

613
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,580
You can't fool me.

614
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,540
I've been watching you these days.

615
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,890
You ate buns and drank plain water.

616
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,830
And you've lost a lot of weight.

617
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,660
A surgeon

618
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,410
must be full

619
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,470
and strong.

620
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Otherwise, you can't

621
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,260
perform any high-intensity surgery.

622
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,620
Saving money for patients

623
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,690
was extremely irresponsible

624
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
for yourself and other patients.

625
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,780
You helped them this time.

626
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,490
What if things like this happen next time?

627
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,300
Can you help everyone?

628
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,290
Let's get the surgery first.

629
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,150
What's the point of this surgery?

630
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,490
Choose the cheapest method.

631
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,500
What?

632
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,560
Nothing, Director Huang.

633
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,070
The patient has the problem of placenta percreta

634
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,880
and her placenta has reached the bladder.

635
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,020
After entering the abdomen,

636
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,300
we'll first find out the anatomic relationship

637
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,360
between the lower uterine segment and the bladder

638
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,440
and ligature the blood vessels on the surface.

639
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,300
Then, we'll try

640
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,380
to cut the uterus

641
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,230
while avoiding touching the placenta

642
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,140
and take the fetus out quickly.

643
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,930
Then...

644
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,180
Director.

645
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,780
The patient

646
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,980
is from a poor family.

647
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,060
I see.

648
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,930
Then, try to save some money for her.

649
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,090
Come on.

650
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,650
We have reached the uterus.

651
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,840
Be careful when cutting.

652
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,580
The placenta must be bleeding a lot if you hurt it.

653
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,360
Let me check again.

654
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,420
It should be fine

655
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,140
if I cut from here.

656
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,180
What?

657
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:54,610
Are you scared?

658
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,680
I'm not afraid of cutting.

659
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,540
I'm afraid that if I can't cut precisely,

660
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,260
I'll let them spend more money.

661
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,250
Li Junxiao, don't think too much.

662
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,610
In the operating room,

663
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,600
you need to keep your mind free of distractions.

664
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,530
I'll do my best.

665
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:23,720
Dad.

666
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,460
Are you family members of Wu Chanjuan?

667
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,690
Yes. Yes.

668
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,490
Congratulations. It's a boy.

669
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,560
He weighs 3,500 grams.

670
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,180
Dr. Li.

671
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,160
How is my mom?

672
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,470
She's fine.

673
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,570
The surgery went well.

674
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,600
She'll be out soon.

675
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,650
Come on, push him in.

676
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,280
Is he the Dr. Li

677
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,030
who has been helping us?

678
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,190
You're a great benefactor to us.

679
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,470
I can't pay you back now.

680
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,230
But I will work hard

681
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,200
to make money.

682
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,050
If I can't pay you back in a year, I'll spend two years.

683
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,300
If I can't pay you back in two years, I'll spend three years.

684
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,180
I won't owe you anything.

685
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,840
Okay. Okay.

686
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,820
Please get up.

687
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,500
There's no rush to pay the money back now.

688
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,260
And I'm a good friend of Huandi,

689
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:18,930
right?

690
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,610
Dr. Li.

691
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,380
You must know a lot of people in this city.

692
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,780
I think you treat Huandi quite well.

693
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,460
If it's convenient for you,

694
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,170
please help her

695
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,310
find a job these days.

696
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,780
Dad.

697
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,250
What are you talking about?

698
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,800
I'm still studying.

699
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,560
You're a girl.

700
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,650
You don't need to study so much.

701
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,630
Now you have a younger brother.

702
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,710
Your family is also poor.

703
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,820
You can drop out of school.

704
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,240
No, dad.

705
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,600
I want to go to school.

706
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,350
Why are you

707
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,310
so immature?

708
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,780
What era is it now?

709
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,610
Why are men more important than women?

710
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,950
She is only 16.

711
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,340
Why are you crying?

712
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,190
It's enough.

713
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,370
Don't be ridiculous.

714
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,070
Firstly, she's smart

715
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:56,710
and thoughtful.

716
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,250
She has the right to choose her future.

717
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,060
Secondly,

718
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,110
she has good grades.

719
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
You can't let her drop out.

720
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,120
It will be more helpful for your family

721
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,340
if she can go to a great university.

722
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,300
But

723
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,040
I don't have enough money

724
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,880
to pay her tuition.

725
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,440
Do you know the condition

726
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,550
of my family?

727
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:12,860
Dad.

728
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,190
Get up.

729
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,060
I'll pay it.

730
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,560
From now on,

731
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,770
all her tuition fees

732
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,430
will be paid by me

733
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,710
until she graduates from the university.

734
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,300
Dr. Li.

735
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,230
I don't need your money.

736
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,820
I can earn it myself.

737
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,470
I can work part-time jobs

738
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,970
when I'm in university.

739
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,360
I will study hard.

740
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,800
I will get scholarships.

741
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,180
I can...

742
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,280
I can earn it myself.

743
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,410
I don't need your money.

744
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,130
Huandi.

745
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,740
I also finished

746
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,450
my university education

747
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,370
with the help of many people.

748
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,530
I would like

749
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,450
to pass on the love

750
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,320
that others have given me to you now.

751
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,790
And many people

752
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,860
are sponsoring students.

753
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,380
For me,

754
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,500
it's not a big burden.

755
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,000
I, Li Huandi, swear

756
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,910
that I will remember

757
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,020
all the money you give me.

758
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,770
In the future,

759
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,910
I will pay you back all.

760
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,540
Yes.

761
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
We will pay you back.

762
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,700
Thank you so much.

763
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,470
Dr. Li.

764
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:23,970
All right.

765
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,660
Mom.

766
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:27,860
My wife.

767
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,790
Okay.

768
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,900
Go back to the ward.

769
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,890
Thank you, Dr. Li.

770
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,540
Don't worry.

771
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,170
My wife.

772
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,760
Go to the right corridor.

773
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,150
Okay.

774
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,030
Go ahead.

775
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,450
Dr. Li.

776
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:03,980
What will you have for dinner?

777
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,030
I...

778
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,350
I think I owe Du Di

779
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,050
an apology.

780
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,950
How is Di?

781
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,000
It has been in there for an hour.

782
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,820
It should be out soon.

783
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,340
How many cats did it have?

784
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,220
Three.

785
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,690
But they all died.

786
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,680
How is that possible?

787
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,240
All of them were died?

788
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,190
How did you take care of it?

789
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,170
It's hard to tell the condition

790
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,130
of a wild cat.

791
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,420
It might not be caused by lack of care.

792
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,980
When it was pregnant,

793
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,300
it had a lot of parasites.

794
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
It also couldn't have clean food.

795
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,250
So,

796
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,550
it's possible that the fetuses were dead.

797
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,980
My child was gone.

798
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,350
Di's children were gone too.

799
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,450
What happened?

800
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,610
Don't cry.

801
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,170
I'm sorry.

802
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:38,920
Honey.

803
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:39,780
What are you doing?

804
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,090
Let's have another baby.

805
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,900
Are you kidding me?

806
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,060
You haven't recovered yet.

807
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,260
I'm fine.

808
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,190
Congrui, stop joking.

809
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,290
I'm not joking.

810
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,540
I'm ready.

811
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,690
I'm really ready.

812
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,800
I need to be hardworking.

813
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,090
I want to get pregnant again.

814
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,110
I want to get pregnant right away.

815
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,890
I won't have a miscarriage this time.

816
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,790
Listen.

817
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,540
As long as I don't tell anyone,

818
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,020
I won't have a miscarriage again.

819
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,330
I had a miscarriage

820
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,070
because I told others I was pregnant.

821
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,870
I won't tell anyone this time.

822
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,780
I won't even tell you.

823
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,590
They said

824
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,260
I shouldn't tell others

825
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,389
in three months.

826
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,540
Because I told others,

827
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,620
-I... -Okay, it's enough.

828
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,130
Congrui.

829
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,409
You don't need to be pregnant. We don't need a child anymore.

830
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,230
You're still a child.

831
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,420
I'm almost 30.

832
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,239
Why am I still a child?

833
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,860
Because what you just said

834
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,730
was illogical and irrational.

835
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,600
I told you

836
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,670
you were not ready.

837
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,060
I was ready.

838
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,540
You were not ready.

839
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,960
Feng Yuanhang.

840
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,380
Our child was gone.

841
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,850
You were not sad at all.

842
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,290
If you were really ready

843
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,380
to be a father,

844
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,710
how could you not be sad?

845
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,010
What are you doing?

846
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,670
I'm going back to the ward.

847
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,970
Don't avoid this.

848
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,890
Make it clear today.

849
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,980
Someone in the ward is calling me back.

850
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,570
No.

851
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,630
Where is your phone?

852
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,740
Your phone didn't ring.

853
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,170
How could the person in the ward call you?

854
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,720
You are a silly boy who has waited for another day.

855
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,660
All right, Bai.

856
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,970
Take a walk with me.

857
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,270
If I don't give you the medical record,

858
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,980
do you still decide to help your father to change his liver?

859
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,780
Yes.

860
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,720
It's just a liver.

861
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,290
You really took after your dad.

862
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,440
There is nothing good if I took after him.

863
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,210
I don't like what you said.

864
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
He couldn't take care of his wife

865
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,300
and his son.

866
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,060
He is old and utterly isolated now.

867
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,380
What's the use

868
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,160
of his title as a great professor?

869
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,020
I think you're stubborn like your dad.

870
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:19,750
As for the medical record,

871
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,580
I can't

872
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,450
give it to you.

873
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,350
When Head Nurse Bai

874
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,220
gave birth to you,

875
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,730
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

876
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,460
I was afraid that many years had passed

877
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,270
and my memory was wrong

878
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,690
with the real situation.

879
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,740
So, I checked the medical record.

880
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,080
What happened?

881
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,540
The shoulder dystocia.

882
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,000
The shoulder dystocia is an obstetric killer.

883
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,200
It occurs

884
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,300
at a fraction of a percent.

885
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,120
At that time, Head Nurse Bai was delivered

886
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,070
by Professor Qin,

887
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,780
a famous obstetrician from Shengji Hospital.

888
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:54,810
Your shoulders

889
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,990
were stuck in her pelvis.

890
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,590
Within two minutes,

891
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,900
Professor Qin tried three ways.

892
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,820
But he failed.

893
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,140
In the end, he could only put you in a position as if your limbs were on the ground.

894
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,030
Because of severe laceration of perineum,

895
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,860
your mother was hospitalized for a long time

896
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,950
and had a repair surgery.

897
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,030
Then, she was discharged.

898
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,920
There was no record later.

899
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,930
Did it have anything to do

900
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,380
with her suicide after a few years?

901
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,150
I can't talk nonsense about that.

902
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,420
But

903
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,380
I remember your mother

904
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,310
often asked for leave.

905
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,730
The director talked to her

906
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,270
and asked her

907
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,540
if she would like to go to a relaxing position.

908
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,420
She refused.

909
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,860
She said she would try not to ask for leave.

910
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,360
And then, she suddenly...

911
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,110
Didn't you notice

912
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,040
anything strange?

913
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:36,780
No.

914
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,820
What she was before she gave birth to you

915
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,260
was still the same as what she was after she gave birth to you.

916
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,380
She even had a better temper than before.

917
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
Everyone praised her.

918
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:45,420
Really?

919
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,830
I've told you

920
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,100
everything I know.

921
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,610
From tomorrow onward,

922
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,540
don't follow me.

923
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,820
Okay.

924
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,660
Amazing!

925
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,660
Amazing!

926
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,740
Amazing.

927
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,440
What is she doing?

928
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,920
She's challenging the record

929
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,790
for drinking the most Long Island iced tea.

930
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,010
She's already drunk seven glasses.

931
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,360
What's the highest record?

932
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,250
Seven glasses.

933
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,080
This girl created it.

934
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,260
She's going to break through herself today.

935
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,180
Do you want to die?

936
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,040
You can't drink anymore.

937
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,180
Who is he?

938
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,760
I don't know.

939
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,370
Are you crazy?

940
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,240
Amazing!

941
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,290
Good!

942
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,100
Awesome!

943
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,530
The new record is out.

944
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,490
It's my treat today.

945
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,420
Everyone who witnessed that

946
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,910
can have a glass of Long Island Ice Tea.

947
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,320
Good.

948
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,100
Are you really okay?

949
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,490
I'm leaving if you don't say anything.

950
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,080
Why do you want me to shut up?

951
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,170
Do I disturb you?

952
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,740
I can't talk.

953
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,570
I will vomit if I talk.

954
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,780
Oh my god.

955
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,210
You know you want to vomit?

956
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,730
You have drunk too much at a stretch.

957
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,920
How are you going to get home later?

958
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,430
Walk home.

959
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,290
I should have recorded

960
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,890
what you look like.

961
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,370
I can show it to everyone in Shengji Hospital.

962
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,690
What are you doing?

963
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,780
What are you doing? Say something!

964
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,060
My shoes!

965
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,060
I told you I couldn't talk.

966
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,930
My shoes are expensive.

967
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,460
It took me a long time to buy them.

968
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,710
You can't even buy them if you want to compensate.

969
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,750
Du Di.

970
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,590
You are really a devil.

971
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,620
Are you a friend of Du Di?

972
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940
She's still waiting for you.

973
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,530
Go. Let's go home.

974
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,900
Go.

975
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,060
Your way of getting drunk

976
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,260
is really rare.

977
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,570
You're still not relaxed even when you're drunk.

978
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,180
Where do you live?

979
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,710
What should I do?

980
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,480
Let's find Aunt Wang Ying.

981
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,000
Forget it.

982
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,190
You're sensitive about your reputation.

983
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,790
If people in the hospital

984
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,390
know it,

985
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,170
you will kill me.

986
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,120
We're home.

987
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,520
We're home.

988
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:15,990
Why is there

989
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,980
such a stubborn girl?

990
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
She only gets relaxed when she gets home.

991
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,320
Luckily, I'm agile.

992
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:03,940
Go to sleep.

993
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:09,730
No.

994
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,010
I won't sleep. I won't sleep.

995
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:12,930
I won't sleep.

996
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,070
Du Di.

997
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,840
Can I submit to you?

998
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,800
What are you going to do if you don't sleep?

999
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,670
I want to study hard.

1000
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,750
You're drunk.

1001
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,840
Why do you want to study?

1002
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,870
You know nothing.

1003
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,810
Only by studying hard

1004
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,170
can I become Lin Qiaozhi.

1005
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,700
Why do you want

1006
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,570
to become Lin Qiaozhi?

1007
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,070
Because...

1008
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,950
Because my father

1009
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,650
was delivered by Lin Qiaozhi.

1010
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,860
I see.

1011
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,960
Lin Qiaozhi

1012
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,400
is the greatest woman

1013
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,500
in the world.

1014
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,040
She is the mother of thousand babies.

1015
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,220
She is one of the founders

1016
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,740
of Chinese Obstetrics Department.
