[Episode 15]

4
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:39,800
Fine, I lost.

5
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,780
Lip gloss, huh?

6
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,620
Come on.

7
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,479
But no girl in our department

8
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,050
carries a lipstick around, right?

9
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,140
No lipstick?

10
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,259
Well, that's not on me.

11
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,130
I have one.

12
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,450
I now announce

13
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,610
that Du Di won.

14
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,590
I'll fulfill my duty

15
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,690
by punishing the loser.

16
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,660
Don't worry, Dr. Lin.

17
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,330
I'll be very careful with your lips.

18
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,470
I promise it'll feel like your first kiss.

19
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,780
My baby girl.

20
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,850
It looks great.

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,420
So exotic.

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,079
Move, please.

23
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,420
My God.

24
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,500
So many people today.

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,960
Has everybody chosen this day to give birth?

26
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,610
Don't you know?

27
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,900
I see you don't know your job well.

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,440
It's not relevant,

29
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,390
is it?

30
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,380
What month is it?

31
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,300
August.

32
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,180
Yeah.

33
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,860
August is a peak month.

34
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,630
How come August is a peak month?

35
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,390
For what I can tell, many Chinese

36
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,890
are virgos or scorpios.

37
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,560
Because people have time

38
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,630
for weddings during the Spring Festival.

39
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,430
So October

40
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,160
and November are peak months.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,540
It's because

42
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
there's a long national day holiday in October,

43
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,640
many people

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,140
hold their weddings in the holiday.

45
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,030
So the next year's August

46
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,780
is the peak month

47
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,700
for childbirth.

48
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,980
I totally forgot about

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,640
the national day holiday.

50
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,550
When do I get

51
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,750
to have a 7-day national day holiday?

52
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,350
In your dreams.

53
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,390
Unless all babies

54
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,300
decide to take a break, too.

55
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,470
I'm so tired.

56
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,740
I feel you. Look.

57
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,540
The parturients

58
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,980
have doubled in the last two years.

59
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,110
But there are only these beds

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,150
in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,570
When the hallways are full,

62
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,329
we'll have to shove people in the staircases.

63
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,620
Short-staffed, insufficient beds.

64
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,570
This has been the toughest condition

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,880
for you residents so far.

66
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,000
I heard

67
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,700
Director Tian

68
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,850
grew gray hairs

69
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,190
in order to apply for more beds

70
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,290
for the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

71
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,670
Would the situation improve

72
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,810
when he becomes the deputy dean?

73
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,260
You just started your work here,

74
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,070
don't you

75
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,290
gossip about the director like others.

76
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,580
I'm not gossiping.

77
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,420
It's been posted

78
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,350
on the notice board.

79
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,470
Liu Zhenghua of the Neurosurgery Department

80
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,080
versus Tian Yunshan of the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,300
There will be a vote in a few days.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,339
I'll vote for Director Tian.

83
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,230
It's none of your business.

84
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,760
It's a vote within the leadership.

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,550
Just get back to your work.

86
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,450
Stop taking naps.

87
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,140
If we don't deliver at least 8 babies a night,

88
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,130
then the government

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,920
has approved the long holiday for nothing.

90
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,030
I'm going to deliver babies.

91
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,420
Director Tian, you asked to see me?

92
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,840
Nianbai. Come. Sit.

93
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,900
I asked you to come here

94
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,250
to talk to you about

95
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,760
the sickbed scramble between the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department

96
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,700
and your father's Neurosurgery Department.

97
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,730
Look at the problem

98
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,909
Du Di had.

99
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,770
If we had enough beds

100
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,640
here in our department,

101
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,720
she wouldn't have rejected the family.

102
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,540
She would think before act.

103
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,460
It's the peak season for childbirth.

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,300
As you can see,

105
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,450
even the hallways are full.

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,620
Over the spare rooms in the old building,

107
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,150
your father and I

108
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,980
are also having a fight.

109
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,350
It is a real headache

110
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,250
for the leadership of our hospital.

111
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,240
They reconciled differences regardless of principles

112
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
and said whoever had a higher-level project

113
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,620
could get the beds.

114
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,220
So, is there any update

115
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,660
on your father?

116
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,390
I never care about him.

117
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,510
Well, you should.

118
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,380
He's your father, after all.

119
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,290
I don't want to speak to him.

120
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,159
By the way,

121
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,730
could your teacher

122
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,230
do his research here at Shengji?

123
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,880
Here's his suggestion.

124
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,040
He will work with you.

125
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,490
But the research funds

126
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,630
will be applied from both domestic and overseas channels.

127
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,030
This way,

128
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,820
the cash flow won't be a problem.

129
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,270
And both of your names

130
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,260
will be on the research achievement.

131
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,640
Great. Perfect.

132
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,060
Let's get it going.

133
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,040
I'll ask him

134
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,090
how we push this thing forward.

135
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,290
Once this is achieved,

136
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,080
I consider myself

137
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,070
live up to Director Zhang's expectations.

138
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,090
What was Director Zhang like?

139
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,200
How come every one of you

140
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,380
holds him in high esteem?

141
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,460
Director Zhang

142
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,070
was the last student

143
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,290
of the master obstetrician-gynecologist of Shengji Hospital,

144
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,750
as well as the shiniest rising star

145
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,210
in the academic community of obstetrics and gynecology.

146
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,530
He was a top-notch doctor

147
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,520
both academically and clinically.

148
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,090
If everything went in the right direction,

149
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,270
he would become

150
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,750
the youngest academician.

151
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,680
Many excellent students

152
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,600
and social resources

153
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,740
would follow Director Zhang.

154
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,230
Director Huang and I

155
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,659
also studied under his instructions.

156
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,690
Du Di was his

157
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,550
last doctoral student.

158
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,920
Director Zhang

159
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,200
wasn't going to recruit a doctoral student.

160
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,540
But why did he want Du Di?

161
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,150
Because he saw

162
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,020
the commitment in her

163
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,700
was the same as he had when he was young.

164
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,470
Director Zhang would only sleep

165
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,820
for 3 to 4 hours a day.

166
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,600
He was in poor health when he just reached 40.

167
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,000
For the good reputation

168
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,020
of the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department of Shengji,

169
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,400
he burned himself out.

170
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,980
He had no idea

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,240
that he had a late-stage cancer.

172
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,600
It was Shengji's greatest shame

173
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,040
that we failed to save his life.

174
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,830
I was wondering

175
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,330
why you keep giving Du Di chances

176
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,470
even though

177
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,070
you don't like her.

178
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,060
It's not that

179
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,940
we don't dislike her.

180
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,060
Du Di has the potential

181
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,730
to be a top-notch doctor.

182
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,780
However, the doctor-patient relationship

183
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,610
nowadays is complicated.

184
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,100
It takes more to be a good doctor

185
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,300
than using a scalpel well.

186
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,910
If she was half empathic

187
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,810
as Director Zhang,

188
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,260
I wouldn't have a second thought.

189
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,250
But maybe it's also my problem.

190
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,909
I'm not a good boss

191
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,090
for doctors like Du Di.

192
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,230
Director Zhang once said

193
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,250
the young people should have the chance

194
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,990
to decide their targets and positions

195
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,060
based on their characters.

196
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,650
Speaking of that,

197
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,580
Director Zhang was not only a academical master,

198
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,950
but also a good mentor.

199
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,710
I feel bad that I fail to put

200
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,140
what I learned from Director Zhang into practice.

201
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,780
Director Tian,

202
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,940
I will do whatever I can

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,250
to help the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

204
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,350
This is, after all, the department that my mother

205
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,580
used to work in.

206
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,670
Oh, speaking of your mother,

207
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,600
you'll receive a gift from me

208
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,660
some time later.

209
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,420
What gift?

210
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,350
Wang Ying, the head nurse

211
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,170
told me that

212
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,320
you were searching for your mother's medical record.

213
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,380
Yes.

214
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,690
I can give that to you.

215
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,250
Mrs. Wang Ying said

216
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,230
there was nothing special about the medical record.

217
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,550
Nothing special

218
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,850
in the record of the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

219
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,940
But your mother

220
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,070
also went to other departments.

221
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,560
I believe this is what you want.

222
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:36,840
Nianbai,

223
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,980
you are now

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,490
a member of our department.

225
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,020
Frankly,

226
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,340
I won't allow the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department

227
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,320
to go down

228
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,250
under my management.

229
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,830
I'll make it better.

230
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,930
But to do this,

231
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,850
I'll need you to join hands with me.

232
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,310
I see.

233
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,920
I'll do my best for our department.

234
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:00,940
Thank you.

235
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,300
Have you made up your mind?

236
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,540
When will you give me the thing?

237
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,500
Honestly, I have

238
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
nothing for you.

239
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,250
I only had a slip of the tongue

240
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,120
before the operation.

241
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,420
How about this?

242
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,180
You stop taking beds

243
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,920
from the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

244
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,140
I won't report you if you do that.

245
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,850
Did Tian Yunshan send you here?

246
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,830
It was my own choice.

247
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,180
I am also a member of the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

248
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,150
When did you

249
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,100
get the sense

250
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,940
of responsibility and honor?

251
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,230
I like working in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department.

252
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,410
The girl I like also works

253
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,470
in the department.

254
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,930
And I sincerely

255
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,350
want to contribute to our department.

256
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,830
Well, I guess

257
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,180
I'll take your word for it.

258
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,210
But I can tell you this,

259
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,970
I'm not fighting him

260
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,400
over the beds and the deputy dean position

261
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,770
for my personal interest.

262
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,560
The Neurosurgery Department has recently

263
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,150
founded a state-level key laboratory.

264
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,480
It needs more resources.

265
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,200
I need more beds,

266
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,340
and I need to be the deputy dean.

267
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,860
Otherwise,

268
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,560
it will be difficult

269
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,840
for me to push the project forward, do you understand?

270
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,200
I understand.

271
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,780
But I don't accept it.

272
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,900
I thought

273
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,370
you've changed

274
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,750
and become sensible.

275
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,480
Well, I guess it was my delusion.

276
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:58,910
Listen,

277
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,260
I don't want Mom's legacy.

278
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,650
Give us the beds.

279
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,750
Not a chance.

280
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,730
Alright, I changed my mind.

281
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,480
I want the beds and the thing.

282
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,350
And I'll get them.

283
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,360
Let's wait and see.

284
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,570
The project that Nianbai

285
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,560
introduced should be

286
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,040
the most important one for me in this year.

287
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,830
Considering one head scientist

288
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,800
can only be in charge of one project

289
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,700
and follow two subjects,

290
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,840
I'd like each of you

291
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,300
to be in charge of one subject respectively.

292
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,570
No problem.

293
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,870
It's just my baby will be born.

294
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,780
That will take some of my time.

295
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,490
Well, I refuse.

296
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,720
Can you take off your mask?

297
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,480
Do I not deserve

298
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,220
your respect?

299
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,860
I'm cold.

300
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,940
It's summer, and you're telling me you're cold?

301
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,850
What is going on?

302
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,890
I lost a bet.

303
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,340
Can you be serious?

304
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,310
Can you please

305
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,270
think more about the department's future

306
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,290
and yours?

307
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,500
No.

308
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,540
Unbelievable.

309
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,120
He's hopeless.

310
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,160
It's not the first day

311
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,440
that we know he's not into academic research.

312
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,580
Calm down.

313
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,150
We're short of academic manpower.

314
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,110
I suggest you steal

315
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,500
some director-level doctors

316
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,640
from other hospitals,

317
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,440
and promote some of

318
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,470
the residents and attending physicians

319
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,910
to prepare and build

320
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,870
a scientific research team of our own.

321
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,860
I tried. It was hard.

322
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,100
Not long ago,

323
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,430
I participated in an academic meeting.

324
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,660
I only had a few words with the director

325
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,770
of the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department in Nanling Hospital

326
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,380
before their dean took him away in a hurry

327
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,540
as if I'm a pickpocket.

328
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,450
We'll take our time stealing directors.

329
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,940
But we can start building a talent team as soon as possible.

330
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,430
What do we do now?

331
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,790
On the basis of your research project,

332
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,520
organize an open competition for the young doctors.

333
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,930
They can choose their own subjects

334
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,470
that they're interested in and do a report.

335
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,450
We'll appraise their information-collecting ability,

336
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,600
analytical ability, and basic skills.

337
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,380
To put it simply, who does a good job

338
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,220
gets into the research team?

339
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,520
Yes.

340
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,740
Good. You go make the announcement.

341
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,870
I'll give them one night.

342
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,260
This is a rare opportunity.

343
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,170
Director Tian

344
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,400
will select members

345
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,170
for his project

346
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,310
based on your performance.

347
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,950
As we all know,

348
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,080
once you're in a project,

349
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,610
you'll have a chance

350
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,340
to discuss cutting-edgy academic subjects

351
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,840
with the big shots.

352
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,390
You'll have access to more knowledge.

353
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,920
You'll be making academic achievements

354
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,700
step by step

355
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,610
and eventually get your names on your thesis.

356
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,940
The quality of your thesis

357
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,330
and the impact factors

358
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,660
will determine your future.

359
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,300
The project is

360
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,530
Assisted Reproduction for Elderly Parturient Women.

361
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,940
You'll have one night.

362
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,410
You can choose

363
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,770
your own subjects,

364
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,540
collect information

365
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,590
and write an essay

366
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,850
on your ideas of the research direction.

367
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,130
I'll collect your essays tomorrow morning.

368
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,230
Got it.

369
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,860
What's for dinner?

370
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,670
Leave me alone.

371
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,090
What's for dinner?

372
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,820
Are you all possessed?

373
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,470
Are you going to take a test?

374
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,960
You passed your practitioner license test,

375
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,140
didn't you?

376
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm more nervous than the time I had the test.

377
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,030
What makes my daughter

378
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,710
feel nervous?

379
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,980
I haven't seen you so tensed up

380
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,720
since the college entrance exam.

381
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,860
I don't want to lose.

382
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,230
It's my dream

383
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,410
to become

384
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,520
a top-notch doctor.

385
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,940
Your dream?

386
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,260
Bring babies to every

387
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,200
sterility and infertile families.

388
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,750
Am I great?

389
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,950
You're great.

390
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,550
Alright, don't stay up too late, though.

391
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,180
Remember to drink your milk.

392
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,330
Why do you give me a video call in the middle of night?

393
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,220
I want to know how it is going

394
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,050
with your report?

395
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,090
Thank you for your concern.

396
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,300
It's going well.

397
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,440
And if you'll leave me alone,

398
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,550
it'll go even better.

399
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,770
I have written

400
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,640
quite some directions.

401
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,280
How about I share one with you?

402
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,630
Are they even usable?

403
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,350
I directly took them

404
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,540
from my teacher's report.

405
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,120
I was helping him

406
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,340
in the laboratory anyway.

407
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,340
I appreciate it,

408
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,610
but I can't cheat.

409
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,990
You came early, too.

410
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,510
Sleeping a few minutes longer doesn't help.

411
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,830
I'd rather get up early for the subway

412
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,430
while it wasn't crowded.

413
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,810
I thought the same.

414
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,120
Du Di, do you know that

415
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,420
the one who gets in the project

416
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,920
will most likely be appointed

417
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,040
as the next chief resident by the leadership?

418
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,830
I do.

419
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,770
Are you aware

420
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,930
that academically, you won't necessarily get the better of me?

421
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,780
Your English is so good,

422
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,020
and you're expressive.

423
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,770
I'm very aware.

424
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,610
So let's bring out

425
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,500
our best.

426
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,820
Let's have a good match,

427
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,340
okay?

428
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,710
OK.

429
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,090
But after this,

430
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,080
we're still friends.

431
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,090
Sure.

432
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,800
Then I won't hold back.

433
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,280
And I won't care about your feelings then.

434
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,010
The comparison between

435
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,400
frozen single blastocyst implantation

436
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,100
under in vitro fertilization

437
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,710
and fresh single blastocyst transfer.

438
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,020
Du Di,

439
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,300
why did you choose this subject?

440
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,120
To verify the frozen eggs and cryo-embryos' influence

441
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,060
on reproduction.

442
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,300
So that the age problem

443
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,590
can no longer trouble women.

444
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,420
This is interesting.

445
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,510
Li Junxiao.

446
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,730
Age's effects on pregnancy outcome

447
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,010
and the offspring's health.

448
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,170
It looks like

449
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,869
you're going in different directions.

450
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,109
Yes, Director Tian.

451
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,079
I personally advocate

452
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,990
high-quality reproductions

453
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,230
at suitable ages.

454
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,060
In recent years,

455
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,069
bad pregnancy outcome

456
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,329
and risk of poor offspring health

457
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,270
are both increasing.

458
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,280
Because

459
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,940
there have been more and more elderly parturient women.

460
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,290
Not necessarily.

461
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,810
Director Tian, this is mine.

462
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,690
The technology upgrade for assisted reproduction.

463
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,830
My goal is

464
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,070
to cure sterility and infertility.

465
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,590
Nianbai, how come you didn't write yours?

466
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,780
My subject is

467
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,860
the screening and diagnosis

468
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,820
of single gene inheritance disease

469
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,700
before the embryo implantation.

470
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,620
Last night, my teacher told me

471
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,990
that he'd fly here

472
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,570
and talk with you about the collaboration.

473
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,350
Really? So soon?

474
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,220
Yeah.

475
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,820
Alright, you go back to your office.

476
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,030
When there's a result,

477
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,110
I'll let you know.

478
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,940
Nianbai, come to my office.

479
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:56,810
OK.

480
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,510
No matter how hard we work,

481
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,650
we can't compete with certain people with a background.

482
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,430
How do you know that he doesn't work hard?

483
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,170
Do you think it's so easy to get into

484
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,950
Johns Hopnews University?

485
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,140
Perhaps his family

486
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,210
sponsored a lot of money.

487
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,110
Li Junxiao,

488
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,770
you're already the attending physician.

489
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,230
Less jealous, more performance.

490
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,040
Could you stop

491
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,460
barking at me like a mad dog?

492
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,710
When will you two

493
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,050
make peace?

494
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,000
Not in this lifetime.

495
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:30,900
She's very close

496
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,770
to Nianbai.

497
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,170
Will Nianbai talk Director Tian

498
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,390
into choosing her?

499
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,620
That's possible, actually.

500
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,450
Don't you think it's unfair?

501
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,940
Well, we live in

502
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,250
an unfair world.

503
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,200
We do what we can, and let fate decide.

504
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,920
Zhang Zilu?

505
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,650
What is he doing here?

506
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,720
Hello, Zhang Ying.

507
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,860
When will you come and get your report?

508
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,380
I'm not very busy today.

509
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,240
I'll treat you to lunch.

510
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,180
Director Huang,

511
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,580
you seem troubled.

512
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,610
Are you tired

513
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,710
or is there something on your mind?

514
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,940
I'm okay.

515
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,800
It's about Zhang Ying.

516
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,380
I'm thinking about what I'm going to tell her.

517
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,840
You're worried

518
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,100
that it'll be bad for her emotions.

519
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,560
But it's not a small thing.

520
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,410
She has to be informed.

521
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,950
Yeah.

522
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,570
I can't believe

523
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,860
I have to deal with this.

524
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,500
Oh, you know.

525
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,900
You gotta work hard

526
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,000
on your subject.

527
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:02,890
Nowadays,

528
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,470
more and more women

529
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,300
choose to have babies at older ages.

530
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,000
Sterility and infertility

531
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,150
are more and more common.

532
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,400
Your subject

533
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,580
is a meaningful one.

534
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,310
If you ever

535
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,160
need my help,

536
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,460
just come to me at any time.

537
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,520
I will. Thank you, Director Huang.

538
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,590
Congrui,

539
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,570
you have become

540
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,330
more and more professional.

541
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,810
Director Tian and I

542
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,180
both think you can compete with Du Di.

543
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,420
Prepare yourself.

544
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,060
OK. I'll call the next number.

545
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,060
Sure.

546
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,630
Director Huang,

547
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,140
here's my Down's syndrome screening report.

548
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,370
What's wrong?

549
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,110
Is there something

550
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,140
wrong with the report?

551
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,970
It shows

552
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,830
that there's a high chance of Down's syndrome.

553
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,290
Is something wrong

554
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,220
with my baby?

555
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,590
Down's syndrome

556
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,370
is caused by conventional chromosome aberration.

557
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a sporadic illness.

558
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,470
This screening

559
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,900
sampled your serum

560
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,930
to test the AFP,

561
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,290
HCG,

562
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,360
and your free estriol level.

563
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,660
The calculation

564
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,750
of the risk coefficient

565
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,470
takes your expected date, weight,

566
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,450
age, and your gestational week into consideration.

567
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,420
If it

568
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,490
suggests high risk,

569
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,990
you'll need

570
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,130
another confirmatory test.

571
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,570
Because the accuracy

572
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,360
of this test

573
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,220
is only 70% to 90%.

574
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,430
Currently, there are three types

575
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,210
of confirmatory tests.

576
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,530
Villus sampling, amniocentesis,

577
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,170
and umbilical cord puncture.

578
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,220
Are you telling me

579
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,350
that my child

580
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,290
may be a dummy?

581
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,550
We cannot be certain.

582
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,790
There is high risk.

583
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,340
This is awful.

584
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,890
I need to talk to my husband.

585
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,910
Can I ask him to come in?

586
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,300
Sure.

587
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,650
Her husband?

588
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,000
Weird.

589
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,350
What is he doing? Why doesn't he pick up my call?

590
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,270
What?

591
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,850
You didn't see the doctor's name

592
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,110
while you waited?

593
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,490
I see you're surprised to see me.

594
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,360
She's an old schoolmate of mine.

595
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,350
Long time no see.

596
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,310
I see you are a doctor now.

597
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,430
You know each other?

598
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,850
Tingting,

599
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,230
give me some time, please.

600
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,540
She used

601
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,640
to pursue me. It'll be awkward.

602
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Give us a moment alone.

603
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,510
There's a misunderstanding

604
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,190
between us.

605
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:54,880
I need a quick chat with her.

606
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,450
Make it quick, then.

607
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,130
There's a problem with my report. I'm scared.

608
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,330
I'll be quick.

609
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,080
Just go.

610
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,150
I hope you don't

611
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,350
say a word to Zhang Ying about it.

612
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,180
If anything happens

613
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,060
to my child,

614
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,130
you're not going to get away with it.

615
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,040
Shouldn't you be

616
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,300
begging me?

617
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,590
Your wife is pregnant,

618
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,190
and you knocked up your mistress.

619
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,050
Now you're threatening me.

620
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,950
It's my family business.

621
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,100
It's none of your business.

622
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:22,990
I have both

623
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,060
their files with me.

624
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,160
And you're telling me it's none of my business?

625
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,310
Caiting?

626
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,220
Zhang Ying.

627
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,620
You're here for another check?

628
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,610
No.

629
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,840
My bestie is free,

630
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,550
and someone stood me up at noon,

631
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,040
so I thought

632
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,090
I could come here and surprise her.

633
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,490
Have you had lunch?

634
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,270
How about we go together?

635
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,680
You know my bestie.

636
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,580
Director Huang.

637
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,220
You, too, are seeing her, aren't you?

638
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,320
Great.

639
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,170
There's a problem with my Down's syndrome screening report.

640
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,600
I'm really worried.

641
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,730
I really didn't know

642
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,630
you were a director

643
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,580
in Shengji Hospital,

644
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,570
or else,

645
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,630
I wouldn't have allowed her to come here.

646
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,210
Alright, we'll go to another hospital.

647
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,050
Who is this guy?

648
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,380
What a jerk!

649
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,160
They lived a poor life.

650
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,840
In order to provide the family,

651
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,040
my bestie never thought about having a baby.

652
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,300
No.

653
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,100
He's not getting away with it.

654
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,540
Help me up.

655
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,600
Sure, we'll go together.

656
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,500
Tingting, let's go.

657
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,590
Honey?

658
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,530
Zhang Ying,

659
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,940
who are you calling "honey"?

660
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,780
Zhang Zilu. This is my husband.

661
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,070
Who's your husband?

662
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,870
Zhang Zilu.

663
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,780
What's going on, Zhang Zilu?

664
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,460
Listen, honey. I…

665
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,780
Let's talk somewhere else.

666
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,700
I'll explain everything to you.

667
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,300
OK?

668
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,010
-I'll explain.
-You'll explain right here.

669
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,780
From the moment I found myself pregnant,

670
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,850
you have never accompanied me

671
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,180
to any prenatal check.

672
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,770
You're coming to the hospital with another woman.

673
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,580
Zhang Zilu, you're good.

674
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,560
Zhang Zilu,

675
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,300
didn't you say

676
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,570
your wife was dead?

677
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,080
Wh... What is this?

678
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,460
Stop filming!

679
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,830
You keep making a scene here.

680
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,620
I'm embarrassed.

681
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,750
You're embarrassed?

682
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,810
When you cheated on me,

683
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,840
were you embarrassed?

684
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,640
You stand aside.

685
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,870
Now you're embarrassed?

686
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,810
Make way. Make way.

687
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,260
Stop it. Make way.

688
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,620
Stop, stop.

689
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,750
You're pregnant.

690
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,020
Be careful with me baby. Come with me.

691
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,890
Come on.

692
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,700
Stop filming.

693
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,460
Put your cell phones away.

694
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,240
Who allowed you to film this?

695
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,290
Zhang Zilu!

696
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,460
We'll talk in the car. Come on.

697
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,500
There, there.

698
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,560
Here.

699
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,560
Calm yourself down.

700
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,030
Or it'll be bad for the baby.

701
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,310
I don't want it anymore.

702
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,500
I want an abortion.

703
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,700
I'm going to divorce him.

704
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,670
No. The child did nothing wrong.

705
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,260
Congrui, go to the ward for now.

706
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,620
Some other patients are waiting to see you.

707
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,650
Shall I ask them to see another director?

708
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You do that.

709
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,020
You make the arrangements.

710
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,450
You started to want a baby

711
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,960
more than a decade ago, right?

712
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,890
Just think it over.

713
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,210
Yes.

714
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,190
I was afraid to have a baby over the years,

715
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,900
now I'm finally pregnant,

716
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,020
I find my husband is cheating on me,

717
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,450
and his mistress is pregnant as well.

718
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,910
Ironically, we have become friends.

719
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,420
We agree to

720
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,340
give birth our babies together.

721
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,750
All these years…

722
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,820
All these years,

723
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,410
I sacrificed for the family.

724
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,660
I'm a joke.

725
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,630
Why?

726
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,300
Why do I get this

727
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,680
in return?

728
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,820
All right. All right.

729
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,340
Let it out. You let it out.

730
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,770
After that,

731
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,130
we'll work out a solution.

732
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,620
Let it all out.

733
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,300
Only us here. Go on, speak.

734
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,370
I have no feelings for her already.

735
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,010
You watched so many dramas

736
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,310
with me,

737
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,350
can't you come up with a better line?

738
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,990
How did she get pregnant then?

739
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,900
When you were poor,

740
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,820
she was afraid to have a baby.

741
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,910
She worked hard to provide your family.

742
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,310
You have no feelings for her?

743
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,780
Not only do you have no feelings,

744
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,850
but you also have no conscience.

745
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,820
Guo Caiting, how do you know my past?

746
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,310
You lied to me.

747
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,300
Your wife and I became friends.

748
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,840
What a joke.

749
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,590
When she told me how her husband

750
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,970
worked to become a successful entrepreneur

751
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,040
from a poor guy,

752
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,210
I felt lucky

753
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,180
that I found the right person

754
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,160
so I didn't need to go through her misery.

755
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,830
Now,

756
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,960
I think I'm a joke.

757
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,490
No, Tingting.

758
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,340
Please listen to me.

759
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,610
I really love you.

760
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,260
Right before I planned

761
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,060
to divorce her,

762
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,190
I found she was pregnant.

763
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,810
You know I

764
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,790
can't divorce a pregnant woman, right?

765
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,250
Yes, she did help me a lot,

766
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,520
but that's exactly why I can't stand her.

767
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,660
She always acts like

768
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,060
she's sacrificed for me.

769
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,310
The more she helps me,

770
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,180
the more pressured I feel.

771
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,200
I feel like I'm a complete loser

772
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,390
when I'm with her.

773
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,100
No matter how much money I make,

774
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,600
she has the credit.

775
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,300
I don't want to live

776
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,530
in her shadows anymore.

777
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,270
Stop finding excuses

778
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,060
for your cowardice and unfaithfulness.

779
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,500
It has nothing to do

780
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,420
with you lying to me

781
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,880
about your so-called dead wife.

782
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,970
You're a jerk. You're shameless.

783
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,100
Fine, fine. I'm a shameless jerk.

784
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,660
Tingting, this is enough.

785
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,840
Calm down.

786
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,350
Trust me, I will divorce her.

787
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,220
Just believe me.

788
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,150
As soon as the baby is born,

789
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,090
I'll divorce her.

790
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,560
You're such a bad man

791
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,950
that you don't deserve a healthy child.

792
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,670
I'm young and healthy.

793
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,700
I was wondering why my baby has a high risk of Down's syndrome

794
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,330
So it's because of your trash DNA.

795
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,260
It's impossible.

796
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,480
It's impossible.

797
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,530
Think it through before you call him.

798
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,500
I haven't thought it through,

799
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,790
but my phone keeps buzzing.

800
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,750
Guo Caiting

801
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,880
sent a whole bunch of text messages to me.

802
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,000
What does she want? Ask you to divorce him?

803
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,170
Honey,

804
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,350
I'm sorry.

805
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,030
I…

806
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,420
I got drunk

807
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,350
and made a mistake,

808
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,670
and she wouldn't get off my back.

809
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,050
I knew it would be too much for you

810
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,810
during your pregnancy.

811
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:15,930
I was gonna…

812
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:16,830
I was gonna

813
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,530
end the relationship with her

814
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,070
and ask her to get an abortion.

815
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,780
Really?

816
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,650
Yes.

817
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,980
You were drunk?

818
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:28,940
Only one night?

819
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,960
Yes, only one night.

820
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,140
Only one night,

821
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,040
and you bought her so much stuff.

822
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,290
Honey,

823
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,820
I had no choice.

824
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,570
She's a greedy one.

825
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,460
She keeps threatening me with the baby.

826
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,990
I…

827
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,940
I didn't want to harm you,

828
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,690
so I kept it to myself.

829
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,560
What are you going to do?

830
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,140
I will break up

831
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:54,690
with Guo Caiting.

832
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,380
Honey, please don't get mad.

833
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,310
Be careful with the baby.

834
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,080
We grew up together

835
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,160
and have been with each other for over 20 years.

836
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,650
Over 20 years.

837
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:04,870
How can I have the heart

838
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,180
to harm you and the baby?

839
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,480
Fine.

840
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,120
How about we get it done right now?

841
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,730
Call her.

842
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,090
Break up with her now,

843
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,070
and ask her to get an abortion.

844
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,490
She won't get an abortion,

845
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,260
she's threatening me with the baby.

846
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,740
If you kill her delusion of marrying you,

847
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,460
she will

848
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,370
get that abortion.

849
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,400
My dear,

850
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,030
I'll take more time

851
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,160
to convince her.

852
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,530
But look,

853
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,350
if anything happens to her,

854
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,060
I'll be in trouble, right?

855
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,860
How thoughtful

856
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,510
and considerate you are!

857
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,970
You still don't want to break up with her.

858
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,470
Fine.

859
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,720
I'll get an abortion.

860
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,310
-No.
-I'll divorce you.

861
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,090
No, no, no.

862
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,520
I'll let you two

863
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,410
be together as a happy couple.

864
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,310
No.

865
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,770
You can wait for the divorce deal.

866
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,900
You should start thinking about

867
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,850
the division of property.

868
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,870
No, honey.

869
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,100
No, honey.

870
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,250
Yunling, thank you for your help.

871
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,710
I have to go.

872
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,230
Here.

873
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,260
Honey, please. Stay calm.

874
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,020
I'll drive you home. Come on.

875
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,160
No anger for baby.

876
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,320
No anger for mom.

877
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,620
It's alright. It is alright.

878
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,870
4 bottles of saline.

879
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,160
You wrote 40. What?

880
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,320
A saline bath for the patient?

881
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,380
How about

882
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,090
you give her a massage?

883
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,380
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

884
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,090
Director Huang

885
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,420
had a little bit of trouble.

886
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,160
So I

887
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,000
accidentally added a zero.

888
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,330
You're lucky that Li Fei found it out,

889
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,070
or else,

890
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,120
the patient would

891
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,910
report you to the dean

892
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:58,600
if she saw it, you know?

893
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,670
Things haven't been smooth in our department.

894
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,510
Can you please save trouble for the leadership?

895
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,050
I swear that I won't

896
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,990
make the same mistake again.

897
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,530
Director Huang doesn't know this, right?

898
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,570
She has no time for you.

899
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,900
Did her bestie fight against

900
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,030
the mistress in the hospital earlier?

901
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,340
Oh, yeah.

902
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,780
The mistress and the wife

903
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,930
found out that they were pregnant

904
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,260
with the same man's baby.

905
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,400
Director Huang was so mad

906
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,260
that she nearly gave birth on site.

907
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,050
There's no negotiation on this.

908
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,180
Keep the baby, get a divorce.

909
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,760
For the good of the child,

910
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,160
I don't suggest a divorce.

911
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,030
It's sad that a child grows up without the dad.

912
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,790
Fix it,

913
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,720
and cancel the wrong one.

914
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,300
Right away, ma'am.

915
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,480
Yes, that's tolerable

916
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
if it's for the child,

917
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,000
but the thing is,

918
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,540
the mistress is pregnant, too.

919
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,090
For the completion of the family,

920
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,470
she should forgive the man

921
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,360
and deal with

922
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,430
the mistress later.

923
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,230
Forgive him?

924
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,340
A man like him

925
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,620
cannot be forgiven

926
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,270
unless he proposes to kill himself.

927
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,550
If everybody is as extreme as you are,

928
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,270
most families in the world

929
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:53,850
will break apart.

930
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,060
Well,

931
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,510
is this your justification

932
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,660
for having an affair?

933
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,380
What the…

934
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,600
Alright, stop.

935
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,510
You both have a point.

936
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,390
I don't think so, extreme feminist.

937
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,620
You male chauvinist.

938
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,880
Du Di, you ordered

939
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,840
so much take out?

940
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,790
A high blood pressure primipara

941
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,510
secretly ordered

942
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,030
a lot of spicy crayfish for herself.

943
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,340
I found it under her bed.

944
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,750
What's her problem?

945
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,639
Which restaurant did she order from?

946
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,360
Is it that good?

947
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,570
I don't know if it's good,

948
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,670
but it's expensive, though.

949
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,920
When I confiscated the crayfish,

950
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,360
she nearly burst into tears.

951
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,090
She didn't even cry

952
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,050
when she was diagnosed

953
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,710
with preeclampsia.

954
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,219
Is the crayfish really worth it?

955
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,060
Where did you

956
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,860
get these?

957
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:35,690
Director Tian's office.

958
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,100
To thank his

959
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,080
excellent medical skills,

960
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,440
the patient gave him a whole bunch of sweet snacks.

961
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,739
But Director Tian doesn't like sweet snacks.

962
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,429
No wonder I didn't see you anywhere,

963
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,650
you were in Director Tian's office.

964
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,949
I went to fetch the snacks for you.

965
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,300
Fine.

966
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,190
I'm going to ask you a question.

967
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,139
If you pass my test,

968
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,810
I'll forgive you.

969
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,420
If the wife and the mistress are found pregnant at the same time,

970
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,699
what to do with the man?

971
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:54,929
That's exciting.

972
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,360
This is for my senior

973
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,430
and the head nurse.

974
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,010
Mocha flavor. Nice.

975
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,580
Director Huang wasn't working.

976
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,320
It's been a tough day for me.

977
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,040
Be nice to me as well.

978
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,670
The mistress is also a victim.

979
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,280
I'm told that she didn't know the man was married.

980
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,140
So

981
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,740
that man is a total scumbag.

982
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,780
It's so you, Du Di.

983
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,440
Only you would use this word.

984
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,590
I think

985
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,050
this is their privacy.

986
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,310
We shouldn't think about it.

987
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,750
You can have it.

988
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,860
Was I wrong?

989
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:23,830
No.

990
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,830
You have officially been

991
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,450
kicked out of the gossip association.

992
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,600
The gossip association? Who's in it?

993
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,580
Thank you

994
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,920
for spotting my mistake earlier.

995
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,030
"Always double check".

996
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,530
It's what we nurses do.

997
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,480
No need to thank me.

998
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,530
Always double check?

999
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,440
Double check when and what?

1000
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,370
You, answer me.

1001
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,600
Before, during, and after the action.

1002
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,530
Double check the name, bed number,

1003
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,260
drug name, dose, concentration,

1004
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,640
time, way of use,

1005
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,690
expiration date, nationality, marital status…

1006
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,690
Wait a minute.

1007
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,940
Nationality and marital status?

1008
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,670
You caught me.

1009
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,950
You failed.

1010
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,690
Examination for your shift tomorrow.

1011
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,710
If anyone makes a mistake,

1012
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,980
you say goodbye to your bonuses.

1013
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,800
You are good at imitating the head nurse.

1014
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,120
I say

1015
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,020
you can pair up with Liu Nianbai

1016
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,310
for his stand-up.

1017
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,490
Be honest with me.

1018
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,470
Do you have a crush on Liu Nianbai?

1019
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,960
I noticed that you took quite a lot of pictures of him.

1020
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,370
I didn't.

1021
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Let me check your cell phone.

1022
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,910
I don't like him.

1023
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,460
I'm one of his fans.

1024
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,670
I'm only

1025
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,020
managing his fan group.

1026
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,780
We are all his fans.

1027
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,370
We're a large community.

1028
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,930
How many people?

1029
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,900
Let me see

1030
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,950
what you chat about him?

1031
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,520
Well,

1032
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,410
a large community indeed.

1033
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,610
16 people up till now.

1034
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,380
He didn't

1035
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,620
give away any pictures of his face,

1036
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,230
so he hasn't

1037
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,590
got many fans so far.

1038
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,040
I'll suggest him to

1039
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,110
pay attention to image management,

1040
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,940
and

1041
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,050
we will help promote him.

1042
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,360
Since you don't intend to pursue him,

1043
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,990
just stop

1044
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,380
paying attention to him.

1045
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,070
If he gets married one day,

1046
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,620
your heart will break.

1047
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,070
I don't mind.

1048
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,660
I have no feelings for others.

1049
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,400
You see, Dr. Li

1050
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,810
is a good looker,

1051
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,990
but I think

1052
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,620
he's

1053
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,040
way too direct.

1054
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,120
Look.

1055
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,480
Even his post about his date

1056
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,470
is so embarrassing.

1057
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,930
Who is he dating?

1058
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,000
I don't know.

1059
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:27,880
Look here.

1060
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,780
"You like fish.

1061
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,900
I wish I was fish".

1062
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,900
Eesh.

1063
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,120
How come I can't

1064
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,050
see this post?

1065
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Perhaps,

1066
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,330
he forgot to include me in the co-worker group?

1067
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,740
Hey,

1068
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,700
who is he dating

1069
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,840
in our hospital?

1070
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,850
He's been sneaky.

1071
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,970
Send me a screenshot.

1072
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,190
You want some gossips,

1073
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,050
don't you?

1074
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,830
Senior,

1075
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,380
will you watch my stand-up

1076
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,350
when you're off work?

1077
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,270
No.

1078
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,360
That's hurtful.

1079
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,460
Director Huang isn't at work today. I'm busy.

1080
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,190
We'll have lunch together.

1081
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,680
No. I'm busy.

1082
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,960
You are not going to skip lunch, are you?

1083
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,290
It's Friday today.

1084
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,510
Your favorite braised pork with potato

1085
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,790
is on the menu.

1086
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,920
Ah, yes.

1087
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,800
Braised pork on Friday.

1088
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,160
Come on. No pork for us if we're late.

1089
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,010
Pack the lunch for me.

1090
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,230
OK.

1091
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,880
-Braised pork, please.
-Thank you for queuing for me.

1092
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,270
Braised pork, please.

1093
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,600
Hey,

1094
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,860
you just cut the line

1095
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,680
and took my pork.

1096
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,180
I learned from you.

1097
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,590
You got the last portion

1098
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,300
of braised hairtail with your acting last time.

1099
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,790
Swipe your own card.

1100
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,440
More rice, please.

1101
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,120
OK.

1102
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,400
Mine.

1103
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,100
I thought you didn't like braised pork.

1104
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
My senior loves it.

1105
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,090
Give me a break.

1106
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,450
Love drives men crazy.

1107
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,440
I can't believe someone like you

1108
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,960
would cut the line for a girl.

1109
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,790
Let me have a taste.

1110
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,070
Not allowed.

1111
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:40,850
I tell you what,

1112
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,680
if Du Di was with us,

1113
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,680
she would allow me to have one piece.

1114
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,880
She would allow me to have all.

1115
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,520
Do you believe me?

1116
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,390
And even if

1117
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,170
she knew you got it for her,

1118
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,160
she would let me have it.

1119
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,330
Weiwei.

1120
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,370
How come she doesn't respond

1121
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,000
to my wooing?

1122
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,250
Does she not like me

1123
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,260
and pretend she doesn't know what I'm doing?

1124
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,390
You're pursuing her?

1125
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,670
How come I didn't know?

1126
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,030
Isn't that obvious?

1127
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,370
You claimed

1128
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,170
that you had a girlfriend abroad.

1129
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,790
So it was a brag?

1130
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,290
No, it wasn't.

1131
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,150
I would just go to a bar,

1132
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,300
make eye contact with a girl.

1133
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,920
And she'd understand,

1134
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,600
and we'd talk and go out on a date.

1135
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,620
It never took me

1136
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,490
so long to pursue a girl.

1137
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,300
No matter how hard I tried,

1138
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,950
how I made eye contact with her…

1139
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,700
Hell, even my eyes are tired.

1140
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,940
She won't respond to me.

1141
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,840
I even doubt

1142
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,910
if I'm a real man.

1143
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,570
Does she take me as a woman?

1144
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
Since when did you

1145
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,580
have feelings for Du Di?

1146
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:27,950
I don't know.

1147
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,280
At first, I would get scared

1148
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,670
at the thought of seeing her.

1149
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:32,810
Yeah.

1150
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,260
I would wonder

1151
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,390
what traps she got for me.

1152
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,530
And then, I started to feel a little bit down

1153
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,910
if I didn't see her the whole day.

1154
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,340
I started wanting to know her,

1155
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,130
approach her, invite her to my apartment,

1156
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,000
and dine with her.

1157
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,880
But like I said, no response.

1158
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,230
Maybe it's

1159
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,650
a stereotype thing.

1160
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,140
Maybe Du Di only

1161
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,990
sees you as a dumb,

1162
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,650
incapable returnee intern.

1163
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,210
So everything you do

1164
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,660
fits your image.

1165
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,440
How do I

1166
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,400
break the stereotype?

1167
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,240
She beats you at intelligence,

1168
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,510
physical strength, and expertise.

1169
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,290
How do you

1170
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,510
break the stereotype?

1171
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,780
Am I that lame?

1172
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,350
I was the best student at school.

1173
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,770
I was admitted into Johns Hopnews University.

1174
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,180
I was the youngest assistant researcher

1175
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,320
in a top genetic science laboratory worldwide.

1176
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,640
I was a top player on the university hockey team.

1177
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,340
Yes, she's smarter than me,

1178
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,970
and her clinic work is better than mine,

1179
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,030
but I'm better than her physically.

1180
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,660
You

1181
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,200
have no idea how tough she is.

1182
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,100
There'll be an operation this afternoon.

1183
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,360
I think you should watch it.

1184
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,660
Too much fat.

1185
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,150
We have to open all layers of your fat

1186
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,740
before the cut.

1187
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,950
Your operation

1188
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,370
will take longer than that of others.

1189
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,630
Doctor, thank you.

1190
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,560
I weighed

1191
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,630
over 200 kilograms last night.

1192
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,500
I was only 130 kilo before pregnancy.

1193
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,250
Doctor,

1194
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,010
how about you remove my fat

1195
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,020
while doing the cesarean?

1196
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,980
Good idea.

1197
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,020
Maybe we can

1198
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,200
do a joint

1199
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,810
cesarean-fat management operation

1200
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,940
with the plastic surgery department.

1201
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,070
It may become

1202
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,790
our hospital's featured project.

1203
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,080
Congratulations, you're a mother now.

1204
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:19,710
Out comes a little girl.

1205
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,960
She's not big.

1206
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,300
3.2 kilograms.

1207
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,730
Only 3.2 kilograms?

1208
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,780
Well, all the weight is on me.

1209
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,050
You must be careful when you're out of the hospital.

1210
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,050
There's a high chance

1211
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,980
of fat liquefaction on the wound.

1212
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,470
You may feel awful if that happens.

1213
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,520
I guess I shouldn't listen

1214
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,200
to the older generations' advice.

1215
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,110
My mom

1216
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,750
said that I couldn't bathe

1217
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,500
within the first month after the birth.

1218
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,060
If the fat liquefaction

1219
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,490
causes an infection because you don't bathe,

1220
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,590
that will be real trouble.

1221
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,620
You mustn't follow her advice.

1222
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,900
I won't.

1223
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,140
Alright, the stitching is finished.

1224
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,780
Now, we get her off the table.

1225
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,650
Senior, let me.

1226
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,620
Now, follow my command.

1227
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,130
One, two, three. Up.
