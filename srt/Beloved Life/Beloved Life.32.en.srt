[Episode 32]

4
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,020
It's all for Congrui.

5
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,890
She's a happy-go-lucky person.

6
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,330
I was afraid she'd be distracted from work.

7
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,090
Now I don't have to worry.

8
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,070
I'm not her family anymore.

9
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,950
Have you told her

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,080
that thing yet?

11
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,100
Not yet.

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,890
Not yet?

13
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,080
When are you going to tell her?

14
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,090
I want the best for her.

15
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,270
I thought this disease was a good reason

16
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,900
for her to focus on her career.

17
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,560
And I planned to tell her

18
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,350
when she became chief resident.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,720
I didn't expect that

20
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,860
she was seeing someone else so soon.

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,370
When you were her husband,

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,480
I respected your opinion.

23
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,900
You made a decision

24
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,180
that you thought was a good one for her.

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
So I didn't tell her.

26
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,350
But now I heard

27
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,230
she would soon

28
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,370
marry Junxiao.

29
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,630
You know

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,890
how much she wants to have children.

31
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,620
If you don't tell her,

32
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,900
she may be devastated by the truth later.

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,630
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,990
Dr. Huang.

35
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,079
Is there something

36
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,410
you and Feng Yuanhang trying to hide from me?

37
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:47,930
Is it about me?

38
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,180
Congrui,

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,700
I'd like to say sorry first.

40
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,960
And then,

41
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,500
I hope you can try

42
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,370
to stay calm

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,970
and let me finish, OK?

44
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,540
Dr. Huang.

45
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,730
The miscarriage is not an accident.

46
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,120
Not an accident?

47
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,110
During the operation,

48
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,160
I found that Congrui had a congenital

49
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,190
cervical insufficiency.

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,450
Any future pregnancy would result in a miscarriage

51
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,520
unless during pregnancy,

52
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,329
she has a prophylactic cervical cerclage.

53
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,500
Also,

54
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,100
she'll have to stay in bed all the time,

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,170
which means

56
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,510
for Congrui to successfully

57
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,490
give birth to a child,

58
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,780
it's gonna be a huge project.

59
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,770
Trying to work as usual during pregnancy

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
is impossible.

61
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,170
That means

62
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,620
if Congrui

63
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,260
wants to have a baby,

64
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,060
after pregnancy,

65
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,750
we must monitor all the time

66
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,620
the condition of the cervix.

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,360
And after the cervical cerclage,

68
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,630
she'll have to stay in bed for the long term.

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,940
Then it is impossible for her to

70
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,250
complete the standardized residency training,

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,990
not to mention contend for chief resident.

72
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,620
Exactly.

73
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,130
Because she has to spend

74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
all her energy on keeping the baby.

75
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,530
Dr. Huang.

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,380
Could you please

77
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,530
not tell her this yet?

78
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,220
Why?

79
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,940
Congrui wants so much

80
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,420
to have a baby.

81
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,680
But honestly,

82
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,620
I wish she could be healthy and happy,

83
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,700
rather than paying a huge price

84
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,959
to become a mom.

85
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,350
She has plans

86
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,300
for everything.

87
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,530
I don't want the pregnancy

88
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,810
to disrupt her plans.

89
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,250
From preconception to delivery,

90
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,000
it takes at least two years.

91
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,460
When she resumes standardized residency training

92
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,350
to compete for the chief resident,

93
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,750
Du Di would have become

94
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,320
an attending doctor by then.

95
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,659
I would rather she completes

96
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,970
her career plans first.

97
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,710
The baby can wait.

98
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,700
Why?

99
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,020
Who is he?

100
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,350
I was supposed to make choices

101
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,400
for my life.

102
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,020
Who was he to make the choice

103
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,990
for me?

104
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,540
He was your husband.

105
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,380
He loved you so much.

106
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,260
So he made a decision

107
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,420
which he thought was right.

108
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,820
He was going

109
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,380
to tell you the truth

110
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,180
after you become the chief resident.

111
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,530
But as you know,

112
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,700
you've always wanted to have another baby.

113
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,910
But he didn't want you

114
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,420
to suffer another miscarriage

115
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,100
in a short time,

116
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,030
so he

117
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,190
got himself a vasectomy,

118
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,780
hoping to

119
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,960
take all the blame

120
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,250
by telling you

121
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,780
that he wanted to be a dink.

122
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,330
But he never expected that

123
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,270
your yearning for kids

124
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,320
outweighed your love for him.

125
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,659
It led directly to your divorce.

126
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,620
He probably never thought

127
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,980
he would divorce you.

128
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,140
All he ever wanted was

129
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,340
to spend the rest of his life with you.

130
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
So he thought everything

131
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,800
would work out eventually.

132
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,060
But he didn't know

133
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,900
this situation

134
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,540
would lead to your desperation,

135
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,230
heartbreak

136
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:58,960
and the decision to abandon him.

137
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,570
What should I do?

138
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,460
Can I still get married?

139
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,050
But Junxiao wants so much to have babies.

140
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,980
What should I do?

141
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,440
Congrui,

142
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,750
I'm sorry

143
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,360
I had to tell you this

144
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,640
at this juncture.

145
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,690
As your mentor,

146
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,670
my life

147
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,900
is also a mess.

148
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,890
So I don't know

149
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,340
what advice I could give you.

150
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,400
But in the next 2, 3 years,

151
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,210
baby or work,

152
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,880
you have to choose one.

153
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,060
You go back and think carefully about

154
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,430
which is more important

155
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,460
to you.

156
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,930
What's up?

157
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,060
What happened?

158
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,170
I may not be able

159
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,790
to have my own children in my life.

160
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,540
I can't get married.

161
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,700
It's impossible.

162
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,310
Don't feel bad yet.

163
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,620
Didn't you get pregnant before?

164
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,630
How come you can't

165
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,650
have a child of your own?

166
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,340
Don't cry.

167
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,370
You have to work in the afternoon.

168
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,760
Do you want to

169
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,700
go to the wards with swollen eyes?

170
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,250
Dry your tears.

171
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,270
Talk to me.

172
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,730
Director Huang told me

173
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,710
my last miscarriage was not an accident,

174
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,720
but severe

175
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,590
congenital cervical insufficiency.

176
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,700
Cervical insufficiency

177
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,659
isn't something incurable.

178
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,980
Why are you crying like a baby?

179
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,400
I thought it was something big.

180
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,850
It's the worst type

181
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,380
and I need a major operation

182
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,340
to barely give birth to the child.

183
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,400
And once I'm pregnant,

184
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,780
I have to stay in bed

185
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,860
for months, you know?

186
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,100
It's not like you can't get pregnant

187
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,160
or have children.

188
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,140
It'd be awful for you.

189
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,990
It's not as simple as being awful.

190
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,260
Director Huang showed me my medical record.

191
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,280
It takes a year or two

192
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,740
and all my energy

193
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,320
to barely keep the baby.

194
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,530
It's gonna be very, very difficult.

195
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,530
Li Junxiao couldn't possibly

196
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,060
taking care of both her sister

197
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,910
and a pregnant wife

198
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,140
who cannot get out of bed at the same time.

199
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,820
Then don't have a baby now.

200
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,900
Even if you couldn't have a baby at all,

201
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,650
so what?

202
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,180
You two are going to marry

203
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
for love,

204
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,059
not for having babies.

205
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,710
I want babies,

206
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,630
so does Li Junxiao.

207
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,980
This agreement

208
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,780
is the cornerstone

209
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,370
of our relationship.

210
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,300
Yes.

211
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,550
I didn't want babies.

212
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,760
Neither did Feng Yuanhang.

213
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,660
So you and Junxiao,

214
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,140
the two who want babies, get together.

215
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,910
But this is by no means

216
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,740
the basis of your marriage.

217
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,070
It's your appreciation, respect

218
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,790
and love for each other.

219
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,910
If the goal of your marriage

220
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,180
is to have children,

221
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,090
what's the point of getting married?

222
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,020
But I'm still worried.

223
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,300
About what?

224
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,910
If Li Junxiao knows

225
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,380
it's difficult for me to bear children,

226
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,010
and even if I get pregnant,

227
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,890
we'll still have to give so much,

228
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,030
will he still be willing

229
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,020
to spend his life with me?

230
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,270
If he isn't,

231
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,260
you should leave him as soon as possible.

232
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,070
It means it's not true love.

233
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
OK, don't cry.

234
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,000
I believe he loves you.

235
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,050
Congrui.

236
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,460
Congrui.

237
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,250
Still angry about Ye Ying?

238
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,840
I've made up my mind

239
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,480
to resign from her hospital.

240
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,540
Aren't you happy?

241
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,490
I've already thought about it.

242
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,990
Look,

243
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,670
I'll find some decent jobs to do

244
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,910
and take time to save money.

245
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,130
I don't want you to misunderstand.

246
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
You don't have to quit your job.

247
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm in no position to interfere with your business.

248
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,940
In no position?

249
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,980
Who was so angry with me before?

250
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,390
Moreover,

251
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:33,980
you

252
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,290
are my girlfriend.

253
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,840
If you're not in the position, who else is?

254
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,670
Have you eaten yet?

255
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:40,870
How about this?

256
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:41,830
Let's have lunch

257
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,470
together at noon.

258
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,630
I'll go fill out the medical records first.

259
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,000
What medical records

260
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,260
need the attending doctor to fill out himself?

261
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,140
This is a complicated case.

262
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,740
A 41-year-old pregnant woman

263
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,870
planned to be a dink couple

264
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,980
with her husband.

265
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,780
But as they grew older,

266
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,530
the couple regretted and wanted a baby.

267
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,630
After 9 ovulation inductions,

268
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,210
8 egg retrievals and 7 transplants,

269
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,550
the wife got pregnant

270
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,370
through IVF.

271
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,130
But it turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy.

272
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,130
So they had to abort it.

273
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,360
The medical history is

274
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,220
far too complicated.

275
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm afraid the resident would miss anything.

276
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,840
What's your opinion on this case?

277
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:26,860
My opinion,

278
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,070
no matter how long humans' lifespan

279
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,120
extends,

280
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,770
the best childbearing age

281
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,110
won't change.

282
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,720
It's called the best for a reason.

283
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,310
Many young couples

284
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,790
want to be dinks.

285
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,480
When they get older, they regret it.

286
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,740
By then they cannot conceive at all.

287
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,430
Get married when you should.

288
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,270
Get pregnant when you should.

289
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,470
We do things

290
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,960
at particular ages.

291
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,330
Going against the physiological laws,

292
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,640
you'll end up

293
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,340
too late to regret.

294
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,350
Is dink

295
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,780
completely unacceptable for you?

296
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,580
Why dink?

297
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,330
Children make a family completed.

298
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,720
Don't you think

299
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,520
procreating is also

300
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,020
our contribution to society?

301
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,690
If every couple chooses to be dink,

302
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
human beings will soon be extinct.

303
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,440
And we both

304
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,380
like children.

305
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,640
We'll have a lot of children.

306
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,960
Let's have two first.

307
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,140
If the policy allows, we'll have more.

308
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,560
As long as I work hard,

309
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,130
I can definitely support them.

310
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,330
Wait for me for a while.

311
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,400
I'll be done in 10 minutes.

312
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,130
My mom wants to see me.

313
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,690
I won't have dinner with you.

314
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:31,820
You...

315
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,110
Abort it.

316
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,330
If this is reported,

317
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,920
we will be in big trouble.

318
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,260
We were good friends back in school.

319
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,710
Do you think I'll report you?

320
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,890
When you came here, you begged me

321
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,630
to ask the ultrasound doctor

322
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,150
to check

323
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,110
the gender of the baby.

324
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,040
You said it was your first child.

325
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,620
It was the same whether it was a boy or a girl.

326
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,050
You just wanted to know what kind of babywear you should buy.

327
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,750
When you found out it was a girl,

328
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,060
you wanted an induced abortion.

329
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,770
This is too much to ask.

330
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,880
To be honest with you,

331
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,990
I already have two daughters.

332
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,340
My wife has had two C-sections.

333
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,340
This time,

334
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,810
she's facing great risk

335
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,830
to get pregnant.

336
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,610
Look,

337
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,010
if we have this daughter,

338
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,120
it's possible

339
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,470
that she won't have any babies.

340
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:19,820
So...

341
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,470
I don't have

342
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,540
a doctor who's capable of doing it.

343
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,120
We're talking about induced abortion,

344
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,070
not an early-stage abortion.

345
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,050
We specialize in gynecology here,

346
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,070
not obstetrics.

347
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,060
Why don't you make up an excuse

348
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,610
and do it in a Grade-A teritary hospital?

349
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,220
No, no, no.

350
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,690
Too many procedures.

351
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,460
How about this?

352
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,980
As long as you can do it,

353
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,570
I don't care how much

354
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,560
it takes.

355
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,220
Let's talk about it later.

356
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,180
Please come in.

357
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,170
-I...
-Dr. Li,

358
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,560
you're just in time.

359
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,510
I have a surgery here.

360
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,900
I'm thinking about who is

361
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,580
more capable of it.

362
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,430
When I see you,

363
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,400
I got the answer.

364
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,300
Take a look.

365
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,370
I'm here to resign.

366
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,380
I don't think

367
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,130
I belong here.

368
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,810
Even if you resign today,

369
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,020
it can't be effective immediately.

370
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,590
Right?

371
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,900
As per our contract,

372
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,110
there's a one-week transition period.

373
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,540
Why don't you take a look?

374
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,120
There's nothing wrong with it.

375
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,010
Why do you want an induced abortion?

376
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,180
We just

377
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,140
don't want the baby.

378
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,150
If you don't want it,

379
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,100
why wait until it's 28 weeks?

380
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,790
Legally speaking, a fetus reaching 28 weeks

381
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,890
is considered a human life.

382
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,500
I won't do this kind of surgery.

383
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,540
Dr. Li, wait a minute.

384
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,440
It's not like this is some

385
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,550
outrageous crime.

386
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,270
The couple

387
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,170
decided not to have this baby.

388
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,410
Tell them to do it through regular procedures

389
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,200
in a Grade-A teritary hospital.

390
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,580
We go through regular procedures too.

391
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,550
I'm here to resign today.

392
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,700
I'll go back

393
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,530
to my work at the hospital later.

394
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,950
I don't have time for surgery today.

395
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,300
Wait, why do you have to quit?

396
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,420
Doesn't your sister need chemotherapy?

397
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,140
My sister's business is not your concern.

398
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,670
And I don't want

399
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,780
Congrui to misunderstand.

400
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:07,940
OK.

401
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,950
Since you are so determined,

402
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:11,880
I won't try to persuade you to stay.

403
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,020
But I'll give you 50,000 yuan.

404
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,530
The couple

405
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,670
is willing to spend more money on this surgery.

406
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,780
I'll give you 50,000.

407
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,460
Don't you want to propose properly?

408
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,820
A decent ring

409
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,850
costs at least 50,000, right?

410
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,690
When the surgery is done,

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,410
I'll let you go.

412
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,830
Here, here, here.

413
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,070
Ouyang.

414
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,150
Why do we have to make it so complicated?

415
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,560
Let's just

416
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,980
make a copy of the guest list

417
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,400
of Congrui's last wedding.

418
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,430
Why did you smack me?

419
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,640
You're such a fool.

420
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,880
It's Congrui's second wedding.

421
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,220
If we invite

422
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,610
all the guests at her last wedding,

423
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,310
some of them would scold you.

424
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,140
OK.

425
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Then you say, I'll write.

426
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,310
Listen to me.

427
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,110
This one first, Wu Jia.

428
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,040
Yang Ying.

429
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,550
And Wang Qian.

430
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,440
No cold drinks.

431
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,120
It's bad for health.

432
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,390
Come.

433
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,020
You sit here.

434
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,050
Have a look.

435
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,490
This is the guest list for your wedding.

436
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,380
And

437
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,300
your dad and I don't recognize

438
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,100
your classmates and colleagues.

439
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,910
Check if we miss out on some guests.

440
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,890
Put their names on.

441
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,010
Take a break, no rush.

442
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,840
What's up?

443
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,280
Did you have a fight?

444
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,670
No, we didn't.

445
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,010
It's so busy at the hospital lately.

446
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,730
I don't want to do this right now.

447
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,380
I want to put off

448
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,220
the wedding.

449
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:40,580
Oh,

450
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,920
how can you put off

451
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,360
a major event like marriage?

452
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,670
Your dad and I

453
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,380
even selected an ideal hotel.

454
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,650
Drink some hot water.

455
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,470
You haven't made a reservation.

456
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,800
I don't want the wedding now.

457
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,570
What?

458
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,040
Something must be wrong.

459
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,760
Shall I ask Du Di about it

460
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,910
on WeChat?

461
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,339
She may not tell you.

462
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,819
And Congrui will be angry when she finds out.

463
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,450
Let's wait and see.

464
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,930
What's going on?

465
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,810
Li Junxiao,

466
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,470
you quack! I'm gonna kill you.

467
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,170
I didn't make any mistakes in the surgery.

468
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,180
Why are you here

469
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,829
threatening to kill me?

470
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,190
You aborted my son!

471
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,300
Of course I'm gonna kill you.

472
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,130
Get off me!

473
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,180
Stop!

474
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,490
What are you doing?

475
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,200
Let me tell you something.

476
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,540
I'll hold you accountable too.

477
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,710
Didn't you tell me

478
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,720
it was a daughter?

479
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,620
Why is it a son?

480
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,580
You two!

481
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,750
Give my son's life back!

482
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,210
You're so patriarchal.

483
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,430
You deserve it.

484
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,060
What did you say?

485
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,020
I dare you say it again!

486
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,830
You! Control him!

487
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,140
Let go of me!

488
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,650
I'll sue you!

489
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,480
Li Guang,

490
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,300
you signed for the surgery.

491
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,220
Do you think you can win the lawsuit?

492
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,160
Let me tell you something.

493
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,780
I'll sue you first.

494
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,680
I'll make sure

495
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,710
your hospital will never be able to open again.

496
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,550
And you, Li.

497
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,490
Just wait.

498
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,320
I'll make you sorry!

499
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:04,940
Let go of me!

500
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,780
Let go of me!

501
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,300
Go.

502
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,010
Go!

503
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,820
We'll see!

504
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,720
Go!

505
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,540
Are you OK?

506
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,270
Let's go get checked out.

507
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,380
Then we'll ask him for compensation

508
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,210
with the report.

509
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,170
No, I'm fine.

510
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,250
I have to go.

511
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,580
Just a sec.

512
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,260
Together, we can

513
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,720
make Kaiming a top hospital.

514
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,220
I'll put you in charge.

515
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,100
You can call off the surgeries

516
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:23,690
you don't want to do.

517
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,810
I'll do whatever you want, OK?

518
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,170
You can make a lot of money.

519
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,940
And you can inherit

520
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,020
my family property.

521
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,650
I'll do whatever you say.

522
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,540
Please, don't go.

523
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,700
I don't want any of these.

524
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,620
Did I hear that right?

525
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,690
The family property?

526
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,300
What are you looking at?

527
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,060
Go back to work.

528
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,840
Come on, let's go to work.

529
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,500
Li Junxiao, you'll regret it.

530
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,110
Junxiao,

531
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:00,990
you're back so early

532
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,810
today.

533
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,040
Oh,

534
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,060
what happened to your face?

535
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,140
You...

536
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:11,900
Oh.

537
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,360
Did you fight with someone?

538
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,180
No.

539
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,290
I fell accidentally.

540
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,500
Don't lie to me.

541
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,430
The bruises are clearly

542
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,220
the result of a fight.

543
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,020
You never fought with others.

544
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,790
What happened?

545
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,290
I really didn't, Xiaojuan.

546
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,440
Don't worry about me.

547
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,710
Don't go. Sit down.

548
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,830
Tell me everything.

549
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,290
I noticed you'd been gloomy

550
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,180
lately.

551
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,390
What's up?

552
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,720
Are you short of money?

553
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,800
Does Congrui despise you?

554
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,330
It's my fault.

555
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,980
Junxiao,

556
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,740
don't keep it to yourself.

557
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,020
No matter how big it is,

558
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,420
I'm here with you.

559
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,510
We can go through it.

560
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,260
Xiaojuan.

561
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm not a good brother.

562
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,590
I have already arranged for you

563
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,460
a hospital for treatment.

564
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,520
But now it's over.

565
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,880
If I had known, I would not have studied medicine.

566
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,490
So you wouldn't have toiled for so many years.

567
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,080
And now you've got cancer.

568
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,060
Xiaojuan.

569
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,530
I just want to make some money.

570
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,490
But every day I have to do those operations

571
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,420
against my conscience.

572
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,670
I knew that

573
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,990
cervical erosion wasn't a disease,

574
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,190
but I cut patients' cervixes.

575
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,000
I knew that

576
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,970
a couple wanted to abort a baby girl,

577
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,840
yet I did the induced abortion for them.

578
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,490
I went from undergraduate

579
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,830
straight to doctoral study in Shengji.

580
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,430
I'm an attending doctor at Shengji Hospital.

581
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,340
Yet that's what I did.

582
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,280
Xiaojuan.

583
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,900
I just want to make some money

584
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,740
so you can get good treatment

585
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,130
and be a healthy bride.

586
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,060
I want to give Congrui

587
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,200
a well-off life.

588
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,150
I don't know what's wrong with me.

589
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,060
Other people can easily

590
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,250
get these things.

591
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,300
But why is it so hard for me?

592
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,150
Junxiao,

593
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,290
what

594
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,220
have you done?

595
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,100
I'm an attending doctor

596
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,170
in Shengji hospital.

597
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,170
Shame on me!

598
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,500
Don't...

599
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,420
Don't do this, don't do this.

600
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,820
Please.

601
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm here.

602
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,620
I'm here.

603
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,360
Xiaojuan.

604
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,220
I know it's wrong.

605
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,040
I don't want to do this anymore.

606
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,700
But now...

607
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,690
It's Congrui.

608
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,150
I have to go see her.

609
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,450
-Why aren't you at work?
-Why aren't you at work?

610
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,940
What happened to your face?

611
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,390
I'm OK.

612
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,180
I...

613
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,300
resigned from Ye Ying's hospital.

614
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,450
By the way,

615
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,310
we haven't decided on

616
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,700
the hotel to hold our wedding reception.

617
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,500
Why don't we decide today?

618
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,210
When my sister gets her surgery,

619
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,890
we'll hold the wedding.

620
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,710
There's no rush.

621
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,770
You've been rushing me for a long time.

622
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,470
I was busy making money before

623
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
and didn't have time.

624
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,970
I'm sorry.

625
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,580
I told you,

626
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:25,780
there's no rush.

627
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,020
There's no rush.

628
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,480
We can put it off for a few weeks.

629
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,500
After all, my sister needs time

630
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,980
to recover from the surgery.

631
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,640
If she can come

632
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,670
to our wedding,

633
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,750
it'll be great.

634
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,590
No.

635
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,340
I don't want to get married.

636
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,660
My last miscarriage wasn't an accident.

637
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,570
I have congenital

638
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
cervical insufficiency.

639
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,140
Getting pregnant and delivering babies

640
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
will be very dangerous

641
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,080
and difficult.

642
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,700
Don't you want to have children

643
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
as soon as we get married?

644
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,060
I don't want to let you down.

645
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,210
When did you know about this?

646
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,380
Three days ago.

647
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,270
I don't think you would want to marry

648
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,160
a woman

649
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,620
with fertility problems.

650
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,650
Let's say goodbye here, Dr. Lin.

651
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,710
-It's OK.
-Dr. Lin,

652
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,730
I'm so grateful to you this time.

653
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,110
I'll send a silk banner

654
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,750
to every doctor and every nurse

655
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,420
I met in this hospital.

656
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,570
I have made dozens of them.

657
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,140
Are you doing wholesale business?

658
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,690
This hospital saved

659
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,980
my wife and my baby's lives.

660
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,280
I'd like to give each employee here

661
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,200
a silk banner.

662
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,580
Although all indicators are

663
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,220
good now,

664
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,190
you must remember

665
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,200
to come back on time for review.

666
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,150
Better safe than sorry.

667
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:51,880
Sure, we will.

668
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,470
Don't worry. Dr. Lin.

669
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
From now on,

670
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,390
I'll listen to all your advice.

671
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,810
I'll come back to you.

672
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,030
You will not see me

673
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,840
in Shengji anymore.

674
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,840
Why?

675
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,360
You are my last patient.

676
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,340
I'm going to resign

677
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,060
and leave the hospital.

678
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,530
You can't do that.

679
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,310
You have such good skills.

680
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,530
You are needed here.

681
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,380
Shengji

682
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,580
is never short of talents.

683
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,670
All right, go home.

684
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,440
OK.

685
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,760
I'll leave now, Dr. Lin.

686
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,080
Bye.

687
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,450
Are you really leaving?

688
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,190
I have successfully completed

689
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,170
8,000 surgeries

690
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,710
and I cured Wang Xiaoke.

691
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,340
It's time to fulfill my promise.

692
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:48,900
Xiaojuan.

693
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,350
Xiaojuan.

694
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,900
Junxiao,

695
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,660
I left.

696
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,450
For hometown.

697
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,730
I've broken up with Dacheng.

698
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,340
Don't try to find me.

699
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,510
I don't want to be a burden to you

700
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,890
and ruin your future.

701
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,730
I shouldn't have come in the first place.

702
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,940
Keep saving money.

703
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,500
Marry Congrui.

704
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,380
I can't attend

705
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,620
your wedding.

706
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,780
Send me pictures of the wedding.

707
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,320
Bye.

708
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,790
Hello,

709
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,820
the number you dialed

710
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,380
is not answered for the moment.

711
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,280
Please redial later.

712
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,190
I don't agree.

713
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,670
Even so, I have to quit.

714
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,650
Don't you want to go to

715
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,600
Pokhara?

716
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,760
Go.

717
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,900
I'll give you the leave.

718
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,340
Come back when you have enough rest.

719
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,210
Dr. Tian,

720
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,750
do you know how I felt

721
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
when Feng Ke passed away?

722
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,700
Every minute and every second of these years

723
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,960
is a torture to me.

724
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,050
It was my promise to her

725
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,750
got me through.

726
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,600
I spent almost every day in the operating room,

727
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,960
hoping to fulfill my promise to her

728
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,070
some day.

729
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,890
Now I've fulfilled it.

730
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,420
I don't want to come back.

731
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,240
Lin Wei,

732
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,050
to be an excellent doctor,

733
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,460
it takes a man

734
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,620
at least 15 years of hard work

735
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,300
from a medical school student to a lead surgeon.

736
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,940
With your qualifications,

737
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,360
in a couple of years,

738
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,380
you'll probably be promoted to deputy director,

739
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,620
or even the head of a department.

740
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,480
What you're giving up

741
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,460
is not only a promising career,

742
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,380
but also years of hard work.

743
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,300
I don't think Feng Ke

744
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,530
would want you to give it up.

745
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,180
I know what you're trying to do.

746
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,530
But I really don't see

747
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,040
the meaning to be a doctor anymore.

748
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,550
Dr. Tian.

749
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,820
Dr. Huang.

750
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,020
You're just in time.

751
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,220
Help me persuade this stubborn donkey.

752
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,020
If you're really no longer interested

753
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
in being a doctor,

754
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,660
then you should leave.

755
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,350
I asked you to persuade him.

756
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,550
What are you doing?

757
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,080
But,

758
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,630
you're obviously passionate

759
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,550
about being a doctor.

760
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,710
Though you're obsessed with surgeries

761
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,730
and don't care about promotion,

762
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,770
you always

763
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,410
put patients' lives

764
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,200
first and foremost.

765
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,460
Sometimes you even risked your own future

766
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,040
to save lives.

767
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,940
Take Wang Xiaoke's case as an example.

768
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,600
You did so much homework

769
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,880
in the hope that you could

770
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,750
cure her

771
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,040
while giving her baby the best protection.

772
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,370
The patient may not understand,

773
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,910
but we do.

774
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,670
A doctor who has performed

775
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,980
8,000 surgeries

776
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,220
still has the light of hope in his eyes

777
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,650
every time he saves a life.

778
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,780
Do you know what it means?

779
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,880
It means

780
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,190
you love this profession

781
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,980
from the bottom of your heart.

782
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,170
Director Huang is so right.

783
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,820
That's what I wanted to say.

784
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,320
I believe when Feng Ke asked you

785
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,550
to make this promise,

786
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,720
she didn't care

787
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,560
how many surgeries you could perform.

788
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,530
She hoped when she was gone,

789
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,910
you would still be able

790
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,360
to stick to this path

791
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,630
as a doctor.

792
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,010
Director Tian has approved.

793
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,610
Take a long vacation.

794
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:25,820
Right.

795
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,690
You haven't had a vacation in years.

796
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,570
I'll give you a long vacation.

797
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,240
Travel around and relax.

798
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,700
Come back when you have enough fun.

799
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,310
The door of Shengji Hospital

800
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,850
is always open for you.

801
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,340
So?

802
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,090
What's it gonna be?

803
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,610
Will he come back or not?

804
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,700
I believe he will come back.

805
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,370
In the past, I imagined

806
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,210
the head of a department

807
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,680
was the one who called the shots

808
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,690
with great dignity.

809
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,500
Now that I've become one, I realize

810
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,740
I have to beg around every day.

811
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,300
There's so much to worry about.

812
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,380
It's totally different

813
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,290
from what I imagined.

814
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,500
By the way,

815
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,620
how are things

816
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,300
at your home?

817
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,020
Well,

818
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,740
I finally got my divorce.

819
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,410
It's inappropriate to say congratulations, right?

820
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,850
Look, lunch is on me.

821
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:38,700
Let's go.

822
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,500
Lin Wei,

823
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,310
What?

824
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,020
Don't want me to go?

825
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,020
Are you coming back?

826
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,300
It depends on my mood.

827
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,850
Maybe when I have fun

828
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,750
somewhere,

829
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,030
I'll find a local wife

830
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,010
and settle down there.

831
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,530
If you do that,

832
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,540
I'll go to the ends of the world

833
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,460
to get you back.

834
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,620
Lin Wei,

835
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:03,780
be safe.

836
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,950
Gross.

837
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,540
Bye.

838
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,740
By the way,

839
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,370
take it.

840
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,410
It was broken before.

841
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,410
I've already fixed it for you.

842
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,430
You're welcome.

843
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,380
What's this?

844
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,200
I picked it up somewhere.

845
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,030
Watch it for yourself.

846
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,100
I'm fine with this place.

847
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,930
It's really not a big deal.

848
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,560
It's not for you, but it is for me.

849
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,740
He'll stay at my place.

850
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,900
Director Tian

851
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,060
managed to get me a bed

852
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,160
in the hospital dormitory.

853
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,520
And,

854
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,440
I don't have to take the subway

855
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,220
during the morning peak.

856
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:46,960
It's close here.

857
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,580
Not an excuse to take advantage of him.

858
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,540
Let's go.

859
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,230
Don't come out.

860
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,380
Say daddy.

861
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,470
Daddy.

862
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,460
-Daddy.
-My baby.

863
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,350
Daddy.

864
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,310
Look, look, look!

865
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,030
He just called you.

866
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,690
Why?

867
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,880
He suddenly called you daddy.

868
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:50,850
It was accidental,

869
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,300
not a conscious behavior.

870
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,750
Miemie, my baby.

871
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,550
Your dad

872
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,840
is just a dull head.

873
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,440
When you grow up

874
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,260
and watch this video,

875
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,250
you must scold him.

876
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,460
But,

877
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,300
he changed diapers for you

878
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,360
and everything.

879
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,020
Forget it.

880
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,340
You'd better not scold him.

881
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,410
Our Miemie is so small.

882
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,580
Yet mom told you to scold dad.

883
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,170
Baby,

884
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,220
say you love daddy.

885
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,250
Then you have to tell him you love him first.

886
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,320
Come on, dull head.

887
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,640
I said it in my heart.

888
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,510
No, say it quickly.

889
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,140
Say you love him.

890
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:33,620
Baby,

891
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,560
I love you.

892
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,400
Daddy loves you.

893
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,680
Look at him. So cute.

894
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,080
Daddy loves you so much.

895
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,120
Miemie!

896
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,190
Hold Daddy's hand.

897
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,170
Hold Daddy's hand.

898
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,740
That's good.

899
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,790
Miemie, you also love dad,

900
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,690
don't you?

901
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,380
Yes.

902
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,540
You love daddy too.

903
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,700
My baby.

904
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:03,980
That's good.

905
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,870
That's good.

906
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,310
Miemie, you love daddy too, don't you?

907
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,530
Why are you back?

908
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,530
I walked my dad to the subway station.

909
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,630
I remembered you hadn't eaten anything.

910
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,280
So I bought you some food.

911
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,580
What's wrong?

912
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:24,620
Did you cry?

913
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,420
You're just in time.

914
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,429
There's something

915
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,400
I'm afraid I can't watch it all by myself.

916
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,540
Miemie!

917
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,830
OK, blow out the candles. Come on.

918
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:42,820
Look!

919
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,610
How old were you?

920
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,370
Three or four years old, maybe.

921
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,460
I can't remember.

922
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,139
Happy birthday to you.

923
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,260
I never saw

924
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,250
my dad so happy.

925
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,100
Happy birthday to you.

926
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,120
Why didn't he show you

927
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,400
the lovely video earlier?

928
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,250
Maybe the more lovely it looks,

929
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,680
the scarier

930
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,580
the truth behind it is.

931
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,450
One, two, three.

932
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,720
-I think your mom was very brave.
-You're 4 years old.

933
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,780
-Daddy will cut the cake for you.
-At that time,

934
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,080
she obviously suffered

935
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,510
from depression.

936
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,350
But

937
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,500
look,

938
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,740
she kept laughing

939
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,220
so happily.

940
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,010
To make others happy,

941
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,740
she must have been trying so hard to pretend.

942
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,800
Take a bit and you're one year older.

943
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,940
I remember this dress.

944
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,490
This is what she wore the day she disappeared.

945
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,020
Miemie,

946
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,300
Zhenghua,

947
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,650
I'm leaving.

948
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,140
In fact, even I myself

949
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,090
don't know

950
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,890
why I can't hold on any longer

951
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,640
when

952
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,500
the three of us love each other so much.

953
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,020
I know

954
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,800
I have a mental problem.

955
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,260
But Miemie,

956
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,360
if you find out

957
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,460
everything in the future,

958
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,810
please don't blame yourself.

959
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,800
Mom did not get depression

960
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,780
because of having you.

961
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,180
Mom just

962
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,680
can't accept the fact

963
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,500
that I become

964
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,400
an ordinary woman,

965
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,590
dependent on your dad.

966
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,540
But you mustn't hate your dad.

967
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,460
He has done everything he can

968
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,460
to show tolerance.

969
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,070
He loves us so much,

970
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,100
really.

971
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,420
Zhenghua, I love you so much.

972
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,370
But I'm not

973
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,560
a qualified mom.

974
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,270
I'm not a qualified

975
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,320
head nurse.

976
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,450
I'm not even a qualified

977
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,790
wife for you.

978
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,440
I...

979
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,740
I'm lost.

980
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,070
I don't know

981
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,220
who I really am.

982
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,930
I don't know

983
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,780
which identity

984
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,380
I can hold on to the end.

985
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,400
I know that

986
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,280
you always pretend to be relaxed.

987
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,740
I also know that

988
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,530
when I'm gone,

989
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,150
your life with our son

990
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,020
will be very difficult.

991
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,720
But

992
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,530
please forgive me.

993
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,630
I'm too tired.

994
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,220
I can't take it anymore.

995
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,740
I love you, Zhenghua.

996
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:18,920
Miemie,

997
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,990
mom loves you too.

998
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,530
I hope that in the future

999
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,940
you will meet someone

1000
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,330
who loves you more than I do.

1001
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,880
Don't go.

1002
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,060
Stop.

1003
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,460
You can't go.

1004
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,620
I won't let you go.

1005
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,770
I won't forgive you.

1006
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,160
I won't forgive you.

1007
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,740
And I hate my dad.

1008
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,890
Come back.

1009
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,680
Mom.

1010
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,070
You said you loved us.

1011
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,400
Why couldn't you hold on a little longer?

1012
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,310
Do you know for how many years

1013
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,540
I've hated my dad?

1014
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,490
Don't blame a depressed patient.

1015
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,930
Back then,

1016
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,410
people knew little about

1017
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,040
depression.

1018
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,140
Your mom

1019
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,410
must have been in so much pain.

1020
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,530
So was your dad.

1021
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,850
At least you know now

1022
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,430
that you love each other.

1023
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:55,980
And,

1024
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,210
your mom

1025
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,980
didn't get depression

1026
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,980
because of having you.

1027
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,450
You've saved so many

1028
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,570
depressed people.

1029
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,810
I'm sure she'd be proud

1030
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,590
of you.

1031
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,610
Ms. Wang.

1032
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,060
Did you inherit Lin Wei's style

1033
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,950
or what?

1034
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,300
We lost a punk doctor.

1035
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,610
And here comes another.

1036
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,190
Talk to your boyfriend.

1037
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,570
What kind of image is this?

1038
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,970
He's OK.

1039
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,490
I made him cry last night.

1040
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,060
Doctor.

1041
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,650
Dr. Liu,

1042
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,050
I heard that you had an eyelid surgery.

1043
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,310
But you already had double-fold eyelids.

1044
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,990
Did you broaden them?

1045
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,400
Where did you hear this?

1046
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,650
I'm amazed how the rumor developed

1047
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,470
in just an hour.

1048
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,040
Ma Ru, 42 years old,

1049
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,590
multipara.

1050
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,140
When did you have your last baby?

1051
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,060
This is my first child.

1052
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,660
I never had a baby before.

1053
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,420
It's written here that you're a multipara.

1054
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,920
Maybe you made a mistake.

1055
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,470
No way.

1056
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,980
Who did this?

1057
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,810
Dr. Lin.

1058
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,230
He's not here right now.

1059
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,120
He can't possibly make such a mistake.

1060
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,850
Maybe Dr. Lin was distracted before he left

1061
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,230
and made the mistake.

1062
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,080
No way.

1063
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,650
Not in a hundred years

1064
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,940
would he make such a stupid mistake.

1065
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:03,720
It's OK.

1066
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,670
I'll give him a call later

1067
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,230
to confirm it.

1068
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,070
I learned that it's a nuchal cord

1069
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,700
and needs a C-section, right?

1070
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,420
Yes.

1071
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,550
I need to check you out now.

1072
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,820
OK, thank you.

1073
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,180
Doctor,

1074
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,870
what should we do with

1075
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,570
a nuchal cord?

1076
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,860
I'm so worried.

1077
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,600
Dr. Du,

1078
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:26,880
Dr. Liu,

1079
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,370
have you checked her?

1080
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,380
How is she?

1081
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,670
When will we

1082
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,330
take the surgery?

1083
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,460
The umbilical cord wraps around the baby's neck 3 times.

1084
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,420
The blood supply looks OK so far.

1085
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,500
The fetus does not show asphyxia.

1086
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,070
But the fetus may move

1087
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,090
in the womb anytime.

1088
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,840
If the cord tightens

1089
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,200
when it moves,

1090
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,250
it will impact the blood supply.

1091
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,030
Then there will be a risk of distress at any time.

1092
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,480
I will tell the senior doctor now

1093
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,940
to schedule your surgery as soon as possible.

1094
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,610
We will also monitor closely

1095
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,370
the fetal heart condition.

1096
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,180
Thank you.

1097
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,290
This is our first child.

1098
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,730
My wife is extremely nervous.

1099
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,240
Thank you for taking care of her.

1100
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,940
Are you sure it's your first child?
