4
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,460
Time to breastfeed.

5
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,820
Please bring me the baby.

6
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,340
Here. Here.

7
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,259
Lady.

8
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,630
In the fridge,

9
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,560
there is breast milk I sucked and saved.

10
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,720
Please give it to my mom.

11
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,660
Your breast milk is not much.

12
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,750
Just barely enough for your own baby.

13
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,830
Why did you suck it?

14
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,950
Feed my grandson first.

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,220
Mom, you've been feeling bad lately.

16
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,470
It's hard to get milk.

17
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,800
You should let him have first.

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,970
Give it to him.

19
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,740
Okay.

20
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,370
Sister Lan, you're here?

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,850
Yeah.

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,220
How's today?

23
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,100
I'm telling you.

24
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,160
You can't imagine.

25
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,510
Daughter-in-law gives birth

26
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,579
with mother-in-law.

27
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,329
And they are even

28
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,329
in the same ward.

29
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,500
Holy crap!

30
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,690
Oh, my gosh!

31
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,860
The brother-in-law and his own nephew

32
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,829
gonna grow up together.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,640
For people who don't know,

34
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,460
they're gonna think they're blood brothers.

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,829
Yeah, in my view,

36
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,180
why did she have a baby

37
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,660
at 48-years-old?

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,400
She can't even have milk. Shame on her.

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:48,770
Totally agree.

40
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,480
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,660
You freak me out.

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,540
Dr. Du,

43
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,540
please don't be so horrid.

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,670
Did you finish your work?

45
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,570
Talking nonsense here.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,280
How could you say that?

47
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,740
Who were talking nonsense?

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,130
You can't even do a good job as a carer.

49
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,540
Uneducated and gossipy.

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,140
Leave now if you don't want to work.

51
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,150
You're educated.

52
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,500
But nobody wants you.

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,800
You're so mean.

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,220
No wonder Li Xiaojun dumped you!

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,190
Li Xiaojun!

56
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,290
What's wrong with you?

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,690
Even the new carer knows

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,070
we broke up.

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,940
Can't you shut your mouth up?

60
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,940
The new carer?

61
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,050
The carer who always

62
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,110
warms up your food.

63
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,880
So ill-mannered.

64
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,450
She was gossiping about the patients.

65
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,960
When I stopped her, she mocked me

66
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,210
and said you dumped me.

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,020
What exactly did you tell the others?

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,210
Ill-mannered?

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,030
Yes.

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,880
It's this ill-mannered carer

71
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,020
who calls you every week,

72
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,770
asks if you eat well,

73
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,560
and wear enough clothes.

74
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,200
It's this ill-mannered carer

75
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,300
who uses her hard-earned salary

76
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,580
to buy local speciality

77
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,870
and couriers to your family

78
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,660
every month.

79
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,050
It's this ill-mannered carer

80
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,700
who cried day and night

81
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,340
at home

82
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,380
after knowing we broke up.

83
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,030
And then she went out to earn more money

84
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,070
and came back to ask me

85
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,670
if the reason you broke up with me

86
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,490
was because I came from

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
a poor family.

88
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,230
Du Di, are you heartless?

89
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,579
This ill-mannered carer

90
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
you mentioned is the one

91
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,510
who called you for several years.

92
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,440
You've also seen

93
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,690
her photos.

94
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,690
And now she has worked here

95
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,860
for over a month.

96
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,020
You really don't know?

97
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,180
You really can't tell

98
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,460
she is my sister?

99
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,980
I've already told my sis.

100
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,020
So she knew we broke up.

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,120
Of course.

102
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,300
Breaking up is quite normal.

103
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,810
I won't say anything bad about it.

104
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,060
It's not that I am shamed of it,

105
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,040
it's because I don't think

106
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,890
having a relationship with you

107
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,820
is something

108
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,840
to be proud of.

109
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,410
Are you okay?

110
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,790
The bin was tipped over

111
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,080
by accident.

112
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,700
Dr. Wu,

113
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,970
you can't do this.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,930
If your uniform gets dirty,

115
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,030
you need to disinfect it.

116
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,150
It's okay.

117
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,010
I can't believe that such a clean

118
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,230
and pretty doctor like you

119
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,050
is doing this for us.

120
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,050
Don't mention it.

121
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,520
You helped me a lot.

122
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,180
Thank you.

123
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,190
Sis, this bin is okay.

124
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,260
But that one

125
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,380
contains medical waste.

126
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,860
So be careful.

127
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,750
It's dangerous.

128
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,130
You must be cautious.

129
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,100
I know.

130
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,770
You learn quite fast.

131
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,780
I am leaving.

132
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Sis, I am sorry.

133
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,940
Don't call me sis.

134
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,020
I can't afford it.

135
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,300
How could an alliterated

136
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,860
and uneducated person like me

137
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,980
deserve being a sister

138
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,200
of a doctor like you?

139
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,240
I'm really sorry.

140
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,409
I don't know you would come.

141
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,690
So what if you knew

142
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,730
I would come?

143
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,880
You look down on people like us.

144
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,420
You wouldn't change your attitude.

145
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,540
That's not the truth.

146
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,010
Let me treat you to dinner.

147
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,610
You always take care of me.

148
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,750
I haven't got the chance

149
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,600
to thank you.

150
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,670
Who cares about your dinner?

151
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,400
I sincerely apologize.

152
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,380
Can you forgive me?

153
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,610
I didn't mean it.

154
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,560
Forgive?

155
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,340
I can't do that.

156
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,820
I think the worst thing

157
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,480
my brother did in his life

158
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,420
was to choose you instead of

159
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,120
Dr. Wu

160
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,860
when he was in college.

161
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,170
What's wrong with you?

162
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,550
I am okay.

163
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,780
You don't look good.

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,320
What's up?

165
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,680
What are you peeking at?

166
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,990
Nothing.

167
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,510
Give it to me.

168
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,909
Sis.

169
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,909
How could you have a hard temper

170
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,060
and a hard head?

171
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,790
My fault? Why are you hiding?

172
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,180
My fault. My fault.

173
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,500
By the way, Wu Nan comes.

174
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,430
Oh, yeah?

175
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,820
How is the baby?

176
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,880
Director Huang said he is good.

177
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,230
The hospital performed

178
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,530
a brain test on the fetus.

179
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,290
And it shows that the malformation

180
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,210
was reversed.

181
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,070
The back of its brain was also restored

182
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,850
to normal appearance.

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,820
So Feng Yuanhang's intrauterine surgery

184
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,850
was very successful.

185
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,300
When the baby was due?

186
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,710
C-section is due tomorrow afternoon.

187
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,250
Great!

188
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,560
Luckily, she was persuaded to keep the baby.

189
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,070
Vital signs are good.

190
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,600
Surgery time is 16:00 sharp.

191
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,840
Be ready to get the baby.

192
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,500
One minute. Rated 7.

193
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,530
Not bad.

194
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,840
Honey.

195
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,060
Do you think

196
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,330
we were cheated by the doctor?

197
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,050
Why?

198
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,460
The scar is so big.

199
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,550
We don't even know

200
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,860
how is the brain.

201
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,000
The doctor said before that

202
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,260
there was no cure

203
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,530
for spina bifida,

204
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,000
right?

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,290
Now our baby is quite young,

206
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,380
we can't see it.

207
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,790
But who knows what will be wrong

208
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,760
in the future?

209
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,850
I also searched

210
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,130
on some online forums before.

211
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
Many babies who were found

212
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,180
with spina bifida

213
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,330
were all aborted.

214
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,270
Why this hospital tried all the way

215
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
to persuade us have the surgery?

216
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,140
Do you think they want us to pay the surgery fee

217
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,370
or something else?

218
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,170
Miss.

219
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,260
You've seen a lot of babies here.

220
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,000
Could you tell if our baby

221
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,910
is healthy?

222
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,090
Well...I...

223
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,060
Please do me a favor. Please. Please.

224
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,060
Come. Come.

225
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,390
How could I tell you

226
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,810
anything about that?

227
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,370
It's okay.

228
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,020
Just say whatever you think.

229
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,420
The baby looks quite sallow.

230
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,870
Unlike

231
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,070
other babies

232
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,070
who look plump.

233
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,360
Honey, you see.

234
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,160
Even a random person can

235
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,140
tell something is wrong.

236
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,210
We must be cheated.

237
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,510
One of my friends said that

238
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,250
there is no need to have

239
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,070
the Intrauterine surgery.

240
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,330
The doctor was just practicing.

241
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,460
What we can do?

242
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,810
I'll get back to work.

243
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,830
You may accompany the family out.

244
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,900
Brother.

245
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,630
What did I say at home?

246
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,180
Dr. Li.

247
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,820
I heard from Wu Nan that

248
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,730
they are gonna do something.

249
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,150
What are they going to do?

250
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,870
I don't know the detail.

251
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,120
Then what are you worrying about?

252
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,700
We saved their baby.

253
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,910
What else they can do?

254
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,020
You are right.

255
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,140
They can't

256
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,060
abandon their baby,

257
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,530
right?

258
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,910
Have you eaten yet?

259
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,190
There is food in canteen now.

260
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,300
Shall I buy you something?

261
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,780
No, I have box lunch in my office.

262
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,540
It must be cold already.

263
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Let me heat it for you.

264
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,540
How could a carer heat food for a doctor?

265
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,320
What if people see it?

266
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't mind such stuff.

267
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,090
If you keep doing this,

268
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,230
you should leave.

269
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,290
What's up, Dr. Li?

270
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,300
Nothing. Let's go.

271
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,210
Let's grab a bite.

272
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,260
Okay.

273
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,200
Are you leaving?

274
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,310
Yes, I am leaving.

275
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,780
This carer is so weird.

276
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,100
Is she working well?

277
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,820
If not, you should talk with her supervisor

278
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,520
to fire her.

279
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,070
It's okay. She is new here.

280
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,120
She doesn't know a lot,

281
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,380
so she asked a little more.

282
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,580
The director is making the rounds.

283
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,390
[Department of Neurosurgery]

284
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,390
[Section Director Office]

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,710
Director. Be careful.

286
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,070
Director Liu.

287
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,300
You leave first.

288
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,160
Are you okay?

289
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,470
I am good. No worry.

290
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,450
Okay.

291
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,920
Congratulations to you on the recovery

292
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,060
and coming back to work!

293
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,140
Thanks.

294
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,860
Director Tian.

295
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,000
What brings you

296
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,160
to my office?

297
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,090
Nothing special.

298
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,570
Just come to say hello.

299
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,050
It's impossible you come for nothing.

300
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,530
Just say what you want.

301
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,340
It's about bed allocation in the old building.

302
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
The hospital has already decided that

303
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,620
40% for neurosurgery,

304
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,610
30% for O&G,

305
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,390
and 30% of the ground floor

306
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,550
for hepatology.

307
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,150
Then I heard you

308
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,610
wanted all when you came back.

309
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,000
And no concession.

310
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,360
So I think...

311
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,810
Neurosurgery has recently obtained

312
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,440
a national-level lab.

313
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,070
I do need more wards.

314
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,860
I know.

315
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,030
Everyone has difficulties.

316
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,610
And we need to overcome them.

317
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,010
More and more elderly women

318
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,970
are having their second child.

319
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,880
The length of stay is extending.

320
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,840
And their cases are complicated.

321
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,270
Our O&G wards have both

322
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,740
a low turnover of ward usage

323
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,900
and the burden of

324
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,940
maternal safety.

325
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,970
To be honest,

326
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,890
even if you give me all the wards,

327
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,170
they are not enough.

328
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,720
30%

329
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,950
is a concession already.

330
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,900
We work together.

331
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,000
Why don't we take one step for each?

332
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,940
Also, the hepatology

333
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,350
just saved your life.

334
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,300
And you want to take all

335
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,550
30% from them.

336
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,740
It doesn't make sense

337
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,390
in any way.

338
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,880
That's another matter.

339
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,540
You are right.

340
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,540
They saved my life.

341
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,560
But I've expressed

342
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,470
my sincere gratitude

343
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,460
in many ways

344
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,850
both in public and in private.

345
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,940
For the benefits of my department,

346
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,660
I still need to fight.

347
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,290
Okay.

348
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,660
So you just won't compromise?

349
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,200
No.

350
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,890
Then I'll also

351
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,290
go fight for ourselves.

352
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,620
Scientific research is also an important

353
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,400
competitive indicator in our hospital.

354
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,890
I heard

355
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,470
after Director Zhang left,

356
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,340
several of your major research projects

357
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,270
have been at a standstill.

358
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,410
In that case,

359
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,420
why don't you

360
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,290
compromise a little?

361
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,450
The projects you mentioned

362
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,120
could be restarted soon.

363
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,030
I am talking with the lab of

364
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,900
Johns Hopnews University

365
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,530
about cooperation now.

366
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,170
And

367
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,120
your son is the matchmaker.

368
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,700
He is the normalized trainee

369
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,520
in O&G now.

370
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,900
He works very hard

371
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,720
and diligently.

372
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,890
What?

373
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,530
You don't know about it?

374
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,150
How could he not tell you that?

375
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,790
If my project

376
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,020
goes well,

377
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,030
I am not sure

378
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,820
who would get those wards.

379
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,780
But I suggest, Director Liu,

380
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,150
don't be so exclusive.

381
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,310
We all work for the hospital.

382
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,000
We should respect and

383
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,300
be courtesy to each other.

384
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,850
What do you think?

385
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,130
I am leaving.

386
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,640
Go ahead.

387
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,730
Tell me.

388
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,510
How much do you need to go back?

389
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,690
Why do you laugh?

390
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,970
All these years,

391
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,940
no matter what kind of trouble I got into,

392
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,730
you always paid.

393
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,339
Do you think I'm still a spoiled child?

394
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,990
Don't imagine you could

395
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,220
piss me off

396
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,079
just because you work in O&G.

397
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,130
You are an adult now.

398
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,030
You need to be responsible for your own future.

399
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,650
Your mentor is a

400
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,550
world-leading genetic scientist.

401
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,510
Do you think he trained you for years

402
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
so that you can deliver babies?

403
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,180
I don't think delivering babies

404
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,970
is something low.

405
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,600
Do you think so?

406
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,240
Nonsense.

407
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,500
As a world-class scientist,

408
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,550
he trains every student

409
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,920
to make greater contribution

410
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,990
for medicine.

411
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,170
Don't let him down.

412
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,680
You've got his best interests at heart.

413
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,510
I don't think you are a good father,

414
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,780
but might be

415
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,880
a good teacher.

416
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:58,720
Leave tomorrow.

417
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,260
No.

418
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,430
I've officially decided

419
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,940
to stay in O&G.

420
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,660
Do you know what you're talking about?

421
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,850
At first, I did

422
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,640
come here

423
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,430
for my mother's belongings

424
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,920
and to piss you off.

425
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,420
But now I am in O&G

426
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,110
welcoming

427
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,570
one baby after another everyday

428
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,320
and helping one mother after another

429
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,680
to get their babies.

430
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,410
I have learned the value and meaning

431
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,560
of being clinical.

432
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,830
Also...

433
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,930
Forget it. You don't understand.

434
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,450
Anyway, I am going to stay.

435
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,300
Can you be a man?

436
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,170
A man?

437
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,980
Like you?

438
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,870
Like what you did to make your wife suicide

439
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,060
and leave your son abroad alone?

440
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,630
If you define that

441
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,490
as being a man,

442
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,000
then I prefer

443
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,820
not to be a man.

444
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,230
You shouldn't

445
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,250
talk to him so harshly.

446
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Why is Dr. Lin,

447
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,140
who isn't interested in anything

448
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,250
so nosy now?

449
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,700
You think I am interested in that?

450
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,170
I just think sometimes,

451
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,430
there are things you don't cherish

452
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,380
and one day

453
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,740
you'll feel regretful when you lose them.

454
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,620
Gone.

455
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,660
What gone?

456
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,950
Mr. and Mrs. Wu Nan.

457
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,770
Discharged?

458
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,500
No. Liu Nianbai.

459
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,500
Did he tell you anything?

460
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,990
Nothing.

461
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,330
He just said they recovered well.

462
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,580
They left and abandoned the baby.

463
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,250
They didn't even pay the bill.

464
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,570
What happened?

465
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,900
Mr. and Mrs. Wu ran away

466
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:44,920
without the baby.

467
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,180
We worked a lot to keep the baby.

468
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,650
So heartless.

469
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,420
Some people want to have a baby and can't.

470
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,880
They got the baby

471
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,690
but chose to give her away.

472
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,980
How is

473
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,000
the abandoned baby now?

474
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,940
We've called the police.

475
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,540
The police want us

476
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,500
to take care of the baby first

477
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,370
and make sure she's safe.

478
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,900
The publicity department

479
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,010
also asked the media

480
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,570
to report the news

481
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,880
and put some public pressure

482
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,710
on them.

483
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,620
Here it is.

484
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,040
According to the regulation in our hospital,

485
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,120
if a patient runs away

486
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,100
without paying the bill,

487
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,460
the doctor in charge should pay half.

488
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,420
Another half would be

489
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,680
equally split

490
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,260
among the others in the department.

491
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,560
So,

492
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,260
everyone's bonus should be

493
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,470
reduced this month.

494
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,140
That's unfair.

495
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,920
When patients run away,

496
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,140
it's the doctors who are in trouble.

497
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,250
Now,

498
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,110
we have another problem.

499
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,590
Actually, the baby

500
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,510
is quite healthy.

501
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,700
She doesn't need treatment.

502
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,760
So there's no reason

503
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,550
to keep her in the neonatology,

504
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,080
taking up the wards.

505
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,630
However,

506
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,880
we don't have enough hands

507
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,760
to feed and take care of her.

508
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,720
So neonatology asked us

509
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,650
what can we do?

510
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,130
They asked us?

511
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,670
They're making it difficult for me.

512
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
I need to find a temporary mum

513
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,030
for her.

514
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,600
That means a lot.

515
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,610
Where can I find such a woman?

516
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,470
Who can do that?

517
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,190
Me.

518
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,640
You?

519
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,940
You are a doctor.

520
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,520
Do you have time to take the baby?

521
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,910
Yes, I do.

522
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,940
In the daytime,

523
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,720
I can take the baby with me

524
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,490
to the hospital for work.

525
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,960
After work, I'll take her

526
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,720
back home.

527
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,190
I promise I will

528
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,180
take good care of her.

529
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,270
Good idea.

530
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
I don't think so.

531
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,280
Congrui is a doctor.

532
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,700
She is the best choice.

533
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,130
And she can take the duty.

534
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,300
If by any chance someone

535
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,380
inquires about the baby's

536
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,000
health issues,

537
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,380
there is no loophole.

538
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,490
You agree?

539
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,160
How about others?

540
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,760
I agree.

541
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,520
Okay.

542
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,190
Then you take the duty.

543
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,870
But I have to tell you.

544
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,580
You must strictly follow

545
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,630
the workflow of nurse

546
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,590
to take care of the baby,

547
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,190
especially concerning the diet and disinfection,

548
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,100
which must be scientific.

549
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,140
Nothing can go wrong

550
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,070
with this baby.

551
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,420
Director Tian, don't worry.

552
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,140
I'll take good care of her.

553
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,490
Okay.

554
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,560
La La La La.

555
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
See, how cute

556
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Calabash is.

557
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,670
She is not Calabash.

558
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,230
I know she is not.

559
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,330
But this is an existing name.

560
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,160
I don't feel like to get another one.

561
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,120
This is the time

562
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,480
to give the baby a name

563
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,060
so she can identify herself.

564
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,980
Then you make a name.

565
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,180
I'll think tomorrow.

566
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,480
She needs to be fed again.

567
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,560
You go to sleep first.

568
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,280
Calabash boys. Calabash boys.

569
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,460
Great skills.

570
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,660
Sis.

571
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,600
So is this baby soon

572
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,600
to be discharged?

573
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,980
Raised in incubator for a month.

574
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,540
The mother also recovered.

575
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,810
Mother and baby could be discharged together.

576
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,460
Du Di,

577
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,310
may I have a talk with you

578
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,020
if you are available?

579
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,020
Go ahead and

580
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,970
discharge the mother.

581
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,580
Sure.

582
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,450
Which baby do you come for?

583
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,470
The one that was born ten weeks prematurely

584
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,860
and the mother had her uterus removed.

585
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,790
That baby has gained a kilo

586
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,990
in a month.

587
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,290
He is very resilient.

588
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,860
You came to me

589
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,360
is not for the case, right?

590
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,180
I want to talk with you

591
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,630
about Congrui and the baby.

592
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,340
Anything wrong?

593
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,650
Is Congrui okay?

594
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,600
Is it too hard

595
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,210
to look after the baby?

596
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,410
I wondered before how could she deal with

597
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,480
working in daytime and

598
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,610
taking care of the baby at night?

599
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,330
No.

600
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,920
She is quite happy now.

601
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,600
And she takes good care of the baby.

602
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,030
But just because she is too happy

603
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,780
and does the job too well,

604
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,900
it's not normal.

605
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,060
After her abortion,

606
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,870
I always worry about

607
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,860
her mental condition.

608
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,510
First, she took the baby's stuff

609
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,460
for the cat,

610
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,430
and cuddled the cat to sleep.

611
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,590
And she took someone else's

612
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,190
child home,

613
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,620
and name the child after her own child.

614
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,780
I think this is transference.

615
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,220
But other people's child

616
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,500
can never be hers.

617
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,640
Legally speaking,

618
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,520
she is not the child's

619
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,250
guardian.

620
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,470
Sooner or later,

621
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
she'll have to step out of it.

622
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,630
I'm worried

623
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,080
that she'll suffer from the pain

624
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,300
of losing a child again.

625
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,790
By then, she'll collapse emotionally.

626
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,340
You're telling me this,

627
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,710
what do you expect me to say in return?

628
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,070
After all, I caused her

629
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,820
miscarriage.

630
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,220
Also, she hasn't fully

631
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,560
forgiven me yet.

632
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,220
I'm in no position to tell her

633
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,210
to accept the painful fact

634
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,320
that she has lost her child.

635
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,460
Now, you're her husband,

636
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,980
you two live together.

637
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,240
You should be very clear

638
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,620
that she wants a child.

639
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,110
So I think the most important thing

640
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,250
for her is to have

641
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,030
a child of her own

642
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,220
as soon as possible, isn't it?

643
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,480
Can you try to convince her

644
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,400
from this perspective?

645
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:47,880
OK.

646
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,950
When she's in good shape,

647
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,660
I'll talk to her.

648
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,370
Dr. Huang,

649
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,530
when did you come?

650
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,620
I have been here for a while.

651
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,340
I thought you'd be busy, so I didn't come in.

652
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,660
What can I do for you?

653
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,830
The press is here.

654
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,320
Get the child out.

655
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,940
If you ask me,

656
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,350
why bother looking for them?

657
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,080
They heartlessly

658
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,980
abandoned the child.

659
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,680
Even if we put it on the press,

660
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
they won't be back.

661
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,850
Every child

662
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,430
needs to be with their own parents.

663
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,440
Or how do they live their future lives?

664
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,260
Come on, let's go.

665
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,280
Have the parents of the child

666
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,680
contacted the hospital?

667
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,710
Not yet.

668
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,290
As the director of Obstetric and Gynecologic Department,

669
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,360
I'd like to tell

670
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,680
the biological parents of the child.

671
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,860
We have been looking

672
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,560
after this child.

673
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,390
Her surgery scars

674
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,330
have healed,

675
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,380
and she is gaining

676
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,560
weight during this time.

677
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,450
She's been eating well.

678
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,500
Her parents thought

679
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,140
the surgery

680
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,120
would affect the child,

681
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,280
but the fact is, it didn't.

682
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,510
We have designated

683
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,270
a female doctor

684
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,270
to look after

685
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,420
this child

686
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,750
in order to make sure

687
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,210
of her health.

688
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,610
Look how cute Calabash is.

689
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,120
You named her Calabash?

690
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,750
Yes.

691
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,000
I hope she'll be like the Calabash Brothers.

692
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,700
Cute and strong

693
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,250
and smart.

694
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,730
Calabash's parents,

695
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,880
are you watching this?

696
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
Calabash is getting prettier

697
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,490
and healthier,

698
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,930
but she has yet to meet

699
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,080
her real parents.

700
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,200
Hope you contact

701
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,560
the hospital as early as possible.

702
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,060
So you'll reunite as a family.

703
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,880
Baby.

704
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,440
She's so cute.

705
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,270
What if Calabash's parents

706
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,550
never come back?

707
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,180
What then?

708
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,890
You can take care of her for a while,

709
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,500
but you can't keep her forever, right?

710
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,090
Why not?

711
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,750
I'll adopt her if I must.

712
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,310
You are such a loving person.

713
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,380
But

714
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,480
we still hope

715
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,260
the child's parents will come around.

716
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,670
Or else, when she grows up

717
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,750
and finds out that her parents

718
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,620
abandoned her,

719
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,170
her heart would break.

720
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,690
Well, hope so.

721
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,550
Calabash Brothers...

722
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,060
Morning, Weiwei.

723
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,350
Did you apologize to your dad?

724
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,620
Why should I?

725
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,510
He didn't respect my choice,

726
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,880
and he won't get my respect, either.

727
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,810
You keep acting like that.

728
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,080
You'll regret it someday.

729
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,150
Dr. Lin, Dr. Liu.

730
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,780
You don't know?

731
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,000
What's the matter?

732
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:50,850
Why are you all secretive?

733
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,190
What's up with the crowd over there?

734
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,710
Wu Nan, the mother who ran away,

735
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,730
has come back for the kid.

736
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,980
She's having a fight with Dr. Du.

737
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,730
Why?

738
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,450
I'm her mother!

739
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,990
You abandoned your child.

740
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,240
I can't believe you call yourself her mother.

741
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,950
I didn't abandon her.

742
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,660
I just went out for a walk.

743
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,910
I had two operations throughout the birth-giving,

744
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
what, I couldn't get some rest?

745
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,660
You owe the hospital

746
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,370
a medical bill of over 30,000.

747
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,990
And you left your child for a month.

748
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,690
That was a long rest, wasn't it?

749
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,780
30,000, huh?

750
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,530
I'll pay the money.

751
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,520
Now,

752
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,940
give my child back to me.

753
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,330
Fine.

754
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,660
Please pay off

755
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,060
the medical bill now.

756
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,570
Parenting

757
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,690
means responsibility.

758
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,860
The hospital held the press conference

759
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,030
and asked us to come back.

760
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:30,960
Now here we are.

761
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,900
Where's my daughter?

762
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,420
Yeah.

763
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:32,990
Did something happen

764
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,690
to my daughter?

765
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,860
Speak.

766
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,090
Where's your supervisor?

767
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,950
Get your supervisor here.

768
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,700
Get your supervisor here.

769
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,200
Coming. Coming.

770
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,220
The supervisor is here.

771
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,650
Who are you?

772
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,560
What's your title?

773
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,420
Hold on a minute.

774
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,800
Let me take a good look

775
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,620
at the parents

776
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,560
who abandoned their child.

777
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,650
Hey, watch it!

778
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,410
Well, bring it on.

779
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,900
Use your brain.

780
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,310
Why would the supervisors

781
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,840
work in the impatient department office?

782
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,190
Go to the administration building.

783
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,780
What's the point

784
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,340
of yelling at us here?

785
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:56,940
Good.

786
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,320
Just wait.

787
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,520
If anything happens

788
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,430
to my daughter,

789
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,710
I'll make you pay.

790
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,740
Xiaowei, let's go.

791
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,400
Go ahead.

792
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,870
Talk to our supervisor.

793
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,950
Leave us humble doctors alone.

794
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,510
They're unbelievable.

795
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,050
They left their child here

796
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,430
and ran away.

797
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,350
They didn't even

798
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,210
leave her a diaper.

799
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,670
And now,

800
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,670
this?

801
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,630
What a pair

802
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,140
of role-model couple.

803
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,090
I'm completely amazed.

804
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,900
That's understandable, actually.

805
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,620
Because it's quite unlikely

806
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,310
for them to have another child.

807
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,770
Why?

808
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,760
Wu Nan's husband has low sperm motility.

809
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,180
She got pregnant

810
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,450
after many test tube attempts.

811
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,660
In the past month,

812
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,930
I think they

813
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,600
went to other hospitals

814
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,420
for more checks,

815
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:31,830
and I bet they have been told

816
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,290
that their hope of pregnancy becomes slimmer.

817
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,900
And they heard from the news

818
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,090
that the child is healthy,

819
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,280
so they came back for her.

820
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,870
It's good

821
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,880
if they

822
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,720
will treat the child nicely.

823
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,900
But I believe someone

824
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,660
will go through hell.

825
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,790
She won't give

826
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,890
the child to those two.

827
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,350
I won't let them

828
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,380
have Calabash back.

829
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:58,850
Dr. Wu.

830
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,430
I've been trying

831
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,180
to convince you for over an hour.

832
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,570
My mouth is dry.

833
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,220
You still don't understand me, do you?

834
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,900
It's their child,

835
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,700
not yours.

836
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,950
You are temporarily looking after

837
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,070
her on behalf of the department.

838
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,510
Now, we're only asking you

839
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,980
to give her back to her biological parents.

840
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,890
She isn't your child.

841
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
You are not related.

842
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:15,810
Do you understand me?

843
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,840
Yes.

844
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,790
But I won't do it.

845
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,180
Dr. Tian,

846
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,340
calm down.

847
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,060
Congrui,

848
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,000
I know you care about the child,

849
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,930
and think that her parents are unreliable,

850
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,020
but don't worry.

851
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,810
She is the only child

852
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,760
they'll ever have.

853
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
I believe they'll treat her nicely

854
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,680
no matter what.

855
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,980
Low sperm motility.

856
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,820
You never know.

857
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,380
Maybe the guy will produce a strong sperm someday.

858
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,830
And Calabash

859
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,060
will be abandoned once again.

860
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,470
They are selfish,

861
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,460
callous people.

862
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,470
Calabash deserves

863
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,310
parents better than them.

864
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,480
They're related by blood.

865
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,760
Blood is thicker than water.

866
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,520
Only kind-hearted fools

867
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,450
will believe this.

868
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,100
Dr. Huang,

869
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,430
I suggest you stop.

870
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,030
She's not listening to anything.

871
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,350
Let's just call the police.

872
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,710
Call the police on our doctor?

873
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,340
The press just reported

874
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,000
her as a Merit Doctor last month,

875
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,940
and now, you want to call the police on her?

876
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,100
What were you thinking?

877
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,780
What do we do then?

878
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,710
How do we persuade her

879
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,340
to give the child back to her parents?

880
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,250
Stop.

881
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,460
I have got a lawyer representing me.

882
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,700
No matter what happens,

883
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,440
I'm keeping the child.

884
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,940
I'll sue them.

885
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,830
We didn't abandon the child.

886
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,620
What's going on?

887
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,410
We just went to borrow money from our relatives

888
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,670
to pay for the medical bill.

889
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,490
Correct me if I'm wrong.

890
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,810
Would they let us

891
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,330
take away our child

892
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,260
if we didn't pay off the medical bill?

893
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:36,920
No!

894
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,780
But after we have

895
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,740
managed to scrape the money together，

896
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,630
they told us

897
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,420
they wouldn't give our child back.

898
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,380
This is kidnapping.

899
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,990
Shengji Hospital, give my child back to me!

900
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,030
Give the child back to us!

901
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,210
Give the child back to us!

902
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,610
Give the child back to us!

903
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,070
Give the child back to us!

904
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,500
Give the child back to us!

905
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,180
Give the child back to us!

906
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,760
Give the child back to us!

907
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,490
Dr. Wu.

908
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,570
Hello. Hi.

909
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,460
I'm Mr. Feng, the lawyer.

910
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,400
Hello.

911
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,960
I'm sorry,

912
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,490
she's making noises.

913
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,010
She's not feeling well lately.

914
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,870
You can hear me, right?

915
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,180
It's fine.

916
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,800
As long as you hear me clearly.

917
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,700
So…

918
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,870
We can win the lawsuit, right?

919
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,900
I gotta say, the chance is slim.

920
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,410
The parents

921
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,330
have paid off the medical bill,

922
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,380
and they denied

923
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,600
that they abandoned their child.

924
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,780
Whether from

925
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,220
a perspective

926
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,540
of civil affairs or from legal,

927
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,570
the child can't be defined as an orphan.

928
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,620
In addition,

929
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,650
you and your husband

930
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,460
aren't qualified to adopt children.

931
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,820
Even if she was an orphan,

932
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,730
you wouldn't be able

933
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,950
to win her custody.

934
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,530
But they did abandon her.

935
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
For a whole month!

936
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,250
This is a fact.

937
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,180
The hospital

938
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,650
never stopped calling them.

939
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,990
They even changed their phone numbers.

940
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,380
Tell me if it's not abandonment.

941
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,330
Dr. Wu,

942
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,180
here's the thing.

943
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,450
Emotionally and morally,

944
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,810
I'm on your side.

945
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,740
But this lawsuit

946
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,750
may cost you a lot,

947
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,210
and it probably won't end well.

948
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,660
The public opinions

949
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,710
are not all in favor

950
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,340
of the hospital.

951
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,770
The parents now claim

952
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,560
the hospital's medical treatment was excessive.

953
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,270
They said

954
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,450
the intrauterine surgery

955
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,380
was unnecessary

956
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,480
and the doctor

957
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,250
convinced them

958
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,480
into agreeing to it

959
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,590
so she could gain more fame.

960
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,380
This is nonsense!

961
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:46,920
If the hospital hadn't done the operation,

962
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,910
she would have already been dead.

963
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,550
We made it very clear!

964
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,430
A medical dispute can be even trickier.

965
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,660
It'll take a lengthy investigation.

966
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,830
I suggest you

967
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,210
reach a settlement with them.

968
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,010
That won't happen.

969
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:00,820
I swear

970
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,630
I'll win the lawsuit one way or another.

971
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,770
If you can't help me win it,

972
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,820
I'll have you changed!

973
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,070
Please calm down.

974
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,380
I know how you feel.

975
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,940

The director forced him

you weren't there.

They were going to call the police,

and Feng Yuanhang called

1016

me immediately.

1021

And then,

1022
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,810
he and I came to find you.

1023

How did you know I was here?

1024
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,120
You always

come to the old house left by your grandma

whenever you have something on your mind.

1027

You have kept

1028

this place tidy over the years.

1029
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,410

if you should put the house up for rent

1031
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,660
because it was a waste to leave it unoccupied.

1032
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,950
Always stay on guard against the besties.

1033
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,580
I'm not here to convince you.

1034
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,260
I, too, think

1035
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,660
they have no right to have the child back.

1036
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,020
It's been days.

1037
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,410
You are

1038
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,020
the only one

1039
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,000
who thinks in my shoe.

1040
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:45,530
Thank you.

1041
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,090
You know, I feel guilty.

1042
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,220
I think the reason why you insistently

1043
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,200
keep the child

1044
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,740
is that you lost

1045
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,700
your own child.

1046
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,220
Congrui,

1047
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,390
Calabash is a poor girl,

1048
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,580
but she isn't your biological daughter.

1049
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,840
Do you honestly think

1050
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,030
that she can fill

1051
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,190
the hole inside you?

1052
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,290
There's no hole to fill.

1053
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,920
I simply don't want her

1054
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,360
to be taken away by irresponsible people.

1055
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,300
Give me a minute.

1056
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,430
Sorted?

1057
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,850
How much longer do you need to

1058
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,800
change this situation?

1059
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,490
What am I supposed to do?

1060
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,550
Can't you just tell her explicitly

1061
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,350
that you'll have

1062
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,230
a child of your own

1063
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:41,970
very soon?

1064
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,340
You know she's in a bad state.

1065
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,600
You asked for help everywhere.

1066
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,630
And yet, you didn't

1067
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,100
make any efforts.

1068
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
It's not certain

1069
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,180
that we'll have our own child very soon.

1070
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,620
Yeah, I see you're very precise,

1071
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,280
but we're not doing research here.

1072
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,900
It's a humanity thing.

1073
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,830
Could you please

1074
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,810
be less stern?

1075
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,000
Do you want her to be fired

1076
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,020
and pointed at by the netizens

1077
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,290
and eventually lose the child?

1078
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,670
Could you please

1079
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,260
be vague about it?

1080
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,620
This isn't

1081
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,740
about being vague.

1082
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,410
What is this, then?

1083
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,660
Whatever it is,

1084
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,750
she'll lose

1085
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,830
this child.

1086
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,250
Just rip off the band-aid, will you?

1087
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:13,980
Logical, huh?

1088
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,790
Very logical.

1089
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
You take turns to urge me.

1090
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:28,940
Try to wear me out?

1091
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,460
Congrui,

1092
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:33,740
I…

1093
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,320
You what?

1094
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,590
You are afraid to be fired.

1095
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,180
I don't want to adopt someone else's child.

1096
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,030
We'll make our own baby

1097
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,370
as soon as possible, okay?

1098
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,440
Sorry.

1099
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,260
I'm sorry.

1100
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,340
It's not like I must keep the child.

1101
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,300
It's just she

1102
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,760
really makes me happy.

1103
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,250
I really want a child.

1104
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,920
I want to be a mom.

1105
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,860
Our child…

1106
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,430
It was a poor baby.

1107
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,220
She, too, is a poor baby.

1108
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,990
I don't understand

1109
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,140
why those who want a child

1110
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,980
can't have one

1111
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,970
whereas someone would

1112
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,370
throw their own child away.

1113
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,970
I'd like to say sorry

1114
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,610
on behalf of her parents.

1115
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,140
How about you be her godmother?

1116
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,190
You can supervise her parents

1117
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,020
and make them good parents.

1118
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,770
How about that?

1119
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,410
There, there.

1120
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,740
You must

1121
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,150
grow up as

1122
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,100
a happy girl.

1123
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,660
A girl who won't rely on any men.

1124
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:52,920
Dr. Wu.

1125
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,470
Dr. Wu.

1126
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,280
Let them have the baby.

1127
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,620
What's the meaning of this?

1128
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,500
There are a few things

1129
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,460
that I want you to know.

1130
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,490
She has a narrow throat,

1131
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,700
so she's a slow drinker.

1132
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,660
When you feed her,

1133
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,820
you have to be very patient.

1134
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,870
After the feed,

1135
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,020
it takes a long time to burp her.

1136
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,030
She craves milk recently,

1137
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,580
but she drinks slowly.

1138
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,830
So when you feed her,

1139
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,170
be extra patient.

1140
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,620
And you need to shorten the time

1141
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,150
between two feeds.

1142
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,210
Noted.

1143
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,130
Here.

1144
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,100
She's caught a cold.

1145
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,400
She hasn't got a fever yet,

1146
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,090
but she hasn't been

1147
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,290
sleeping well.

1148
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,440
Mind the temperature

1149
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,470
in the room.

1150
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,030
It shouldn't be too hot

1151
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,310
or she'll have rashes on the head.

1152
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Not too cold, either,

1153
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,100
or she'll get feisty in sleep.

1154
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,170
OK.

1155
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:26,770
Also…

1156
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,140
What else?

1157
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,290
She's allergic

1158
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,530
to certain types of body lotion.

1159
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,250
So some brands are forbidden.

1160
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,510
I have written them all

1161
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,400
down on a notebook.

1162
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,980
She enjoys baths.

1163
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,360
She enjoys good-smelling cream.

1164
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,820
She likes to seize mommy's hair

1165
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,420
when she sleeps.

1166
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,520
Mommy?

1167
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,250
Oh, sorry.
