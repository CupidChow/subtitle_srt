I will take good care of her.

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,940
Luckily you were scrubbing her body.

9
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,750
A big bed sore like this

10
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
could become a big problem

11
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,450
if you were negligent.

12
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,670
She's pregnant.

13
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,780
You probably don't dare

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,770
to roll her over once in a while.

15
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,040
In that case,

16
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,450
she'd definitely get bed sores.

17
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,590
Not to mention

18
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,260
that she's had a lot of antibiotics.

19
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,430
If the sore festers,

20
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,650
that'll be a real nightmare.

21
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,480

And you come when she's gone.

So we can't see each other.

You still have a fever.

Don't worry.

I wasn't slacking off.

on aunt.

50
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,470
It's inappropriate for me to be there.

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,790
So she threw me out.

52
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,420
I know.

53
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,900
You would never slack off.

54

58
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,550
if you keep staying up with me.

59
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,300
I will take some rest.

60
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,100

She is in there caring for my mom's bedsore.

to fight with her?

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,740
Don't worry about it.

74
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,210
Go.

75
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,890
Go home as soon as you finish the talk.

76
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,640
Okay.

77
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,110
Go.

78
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,380
Tell me when you're home.

79
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,140
Okay. I got it.

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,420
Is your fever gone?

81
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,540
Thank you.

82
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,540
You don't have to say thank you to me.

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,360
Looking at her state now,

84
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,070
it's understandable

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,850
that you blamed me.

86
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,470
If I knew she'd be in so much pain,

87
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,140
I wouldn't have given her hope at all.

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,950
I've thought it over

89
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,100
recently.

90
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,100
It's always been her dream

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,500
to have another child.

92
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,020
You saved the child for her.

93
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,180
She should be happy.

94
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,420
Now I only hope

95
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,470
that she can have the baby safely.

96
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,410
Maybe she'll be willing to wake up

97
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,130
when her child is born.

98
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,460
She will.

no matter what we say.

104

Dr. Tian.

105
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,830
Should we do it or not?

106
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,020
We do it.

107
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,800
I'll take responsibility.

108
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,820
What are you waiting for?

Dr. Tian.

110
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,700
What was that?

111
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,700
Ask for Dr. Tian.

112

Dr. Tian.

113

You are my student.

You can.

122
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,220
I know my own state.

123
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,940
But that's against the hospital regulation.

This operation

125

is against the regulation, isn't it?

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,220
You shouldn't

127

As her instructor,

133
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,010
I have to give her a chance.

you are right next to her.

136

You won't give her the chance

137
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,990
to make a mistake.

138
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,710
Right?

Dr. Huang.

140
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,500
You really made it

141

difficult for me.

142
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,860
The child and me

143
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,260
were saved

144
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,060
because of Congrui.

145
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,700
I'm not afraid.

146
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,720
Congrui.

147
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,720
I'll leave this to you.

148
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,310
You can do it.

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,340
Come on.

150
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,260
Leave it to me.

151
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,150
I'll take over if things get complicated.

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,070
Just use

153
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,140
everything you learned

154
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,490
from Dr. Huang.

155
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,350
Time of operation.

156
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,330
Ten past 11 p.m.

157
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,540
Dr. Huang.

158
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,460
A beautiful little girl.

Du Di.

160
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,940
Sew her up.

161
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,210
Why?

162
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,230
You're better at it.

163
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,140
I want her scar

164
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,230
to be as small as possible.

165
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,460
Okay.

166
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,020
I'll do my best.

167
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,740
Stop taking pictures.

168
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,390
Didn't you come here to see me?

169
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,110
You've been taking her pictures

170
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,300
for half an hour now.

171
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,980
Maybe pay some attention to her mom?

172
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,380
She's so cute.

173
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,300
I want a daughter in the future.

174

No.

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,340
I like boys too.

176
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,040
It's not necessary

177
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,490
to have children.

178
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,400
It's good enough

179
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,070
if you two are happy together.

180
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,980
Happy?

181
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,420
I can barely see Li Junxiao

182
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,670
lately.

183
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,710
He used to accompany me to work

184
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,600
when I work,

185
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,820
and have a date with me when I'm off work.

186
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,760
And now?

187
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,620
Whenever I get a day off,

188
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,770
he'd say he's busy.

189
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,820
And when I ask him what he's busy with,

190
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,310
he'd say,

191
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,660
nothing.

192
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,410
The whole thing

193
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,540
just seems fishy to me.

194
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
He must be working on the paper

195
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,150
Dr. Tian assigned him.

196
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,340
What kind of excuse is that?

197
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,090
Every chief resident here

198
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,020
is always busy.

199
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,570
The last thing a couple wants

200
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,570
is suspicion.

201
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,580
Why don't you

202
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,780
ask him in person sometime?

203
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,400
What?

204
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,220
What do you want to say?

205
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,220
Dr. Huang.

206
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,950
I used to think

207
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,480
my marriage is perfect.

208
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,700
And yours too.

209
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,420
Working in the O&G department,

210
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,570
we've seen

211
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,250
so many couples

212
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,910
fighting over

213
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,140
mere trivia

214
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,070
and trying to kill each other

215
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,420
for a little money.

216
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,340
I used to think

217
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,870
that those intelligent women

218
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,140
like us

219
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,220
were doing so good

220
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,620
at our marriage.

221
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,590
But now I think about it.

222
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,100
How ironic.

223
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,230
I don't know why.

224
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,750
But I start to develop a fear

225
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,060
for marriage.

226
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,280
I really don't know what to do

227
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,940
in the future.

228
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,900
My story

229
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,290
must have disappointed

230
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,420
and shocked a lot of people.

231
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
All those years,

232
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,170
I tried so hard

233
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,110
to keep

234
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,290
a fake perfect marriage.

235
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,780
I'm so tired.

236
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,700
I can't guarantee

237
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,700
that the next person you meet

238
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,350
is perfect.

239
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,300
I can't guarantee that I'll be perfect either.

240
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,670
But two things are important.

241
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,530
First,

242
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,890
don't take out on the next person

243
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,790
the mistakes and traumas

244
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,360
from the last partner.

245
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,160
Second,

246
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,430
cut the losses in time.

247
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,500
Once you find out that he's not the one,

248
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,760
don't be soft-hearted,

249
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,900
don't endure,

250
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,080
and don't put your hope on the possibility

251
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,840
that he'll change.

252
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,660
I'm off.

253
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,410
Tell me after you think it over.

254
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,020
Okay.

255
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,420
You're not gonna give me a hug?

256
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,180
I switched for a latte for you.

257
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,550
A sick person

258
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,780
can't have strong coffee.

259
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,740
I got the milk tea for Congrui as well.

260
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,730
Tell me.

261
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,750
If you see

262
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,400
your best friend's boyfriend

263
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,860
with some other woman,

264
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,440
will you tell her about it?

265
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,800
If you're not sure that she trusts you,

266
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,850
you'd better not.

267
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,010
Will Congrui believe me?

268
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,340
Or Li Junxiao?

269
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,540
Come in.

270
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,100
Mom.

271
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,400
Sichen.

272
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,220
Sichen.

273
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,230
You came.

274
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,780
Come, sit here.

275
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,530
I forgot

276
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,500
to pick up

277
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,300
this little guy.

278
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,460
Let me look at you.

279
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,820
You got tanned and thin.

280
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,210
I'm not thin, mom.

281
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,290
These are muscles.

282
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,580
I got stronger, mom.

283
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay. Muscles.

284
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,690
You are a little man now.

285
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,490
I got stronger,

286
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,220
so I can protect you.

287
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,850
She's my little sister?

288
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,930
She's so soft.

289
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,330
Just like when you were little.

290
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,210
Sister.

291
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,510
I'm your big brother.

292
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,910
Now you have me.

293
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,340
No one would dare to bully you.

294
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,220
She smiled at me.

295
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,430
See?

296
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,660
He's going to love her.

297
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,400
Mom.

298
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,000
I want to ask you something.

299
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,780
What is it?

300
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,140
I want to go back to school.

301
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,540
But your dad pulled you out of school.

302
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,010
I want to go back to a normal school.

303
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,910
I want to be the best pupil,

304
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,400
and get into the best high school.

305
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:31,690
Mom.

306
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,400
I want to try my best

307
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,740
to get into the best college.

308
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,950
I want to be the best one.

309
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,520
So I can protect you two in the future.

310
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,580
I know now.

311
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,720
I'll go to the principal

312
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,060
as soon as I get out of the hospital.

313
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,610
I'll also protect you two,

314
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,540
and get your custody.

315
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,300
We'll do it together.

316
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,550
We can do it.

317
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,140
You're here again?

318
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,820
Doesn't it bother you

319
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,900
to hand these out every day?

320
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,950
I give you so many forms every day.

321
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,100
But I didn't see much coming back.

322
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,580
Not even you would do it

323
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,660
for pregnant women.

324
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,500
I did recommend it.

325
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,890
I even put it

326
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,600
in their medical records.

327
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,880
But they just

328
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,520
wouldn't do it.

329
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,670
I can't threaten them

330
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,820
to fill it out, can I?

331
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,050
I don't care.

332
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,280
I want at least ten filled forms

333
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,120
today.

334
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,140
Fine.

335
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,630
As your buddy,

336
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,210
I'll try.

337
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:01,940
Hello.

338
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,790
During pregnancy,

339
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,410
your hormones fluctuate wildly,

340
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,060
and you may experience severe mood changes.

341
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,110
This scale here…

342
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,670
No, thank you.

343
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,380
Mom.

344
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:09,960
No.

345
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,790
You can have a look.

346
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,740
Hello.

347
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,550
This is

348
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,710
the postnatal depression scale.

349
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,260
Do you experience this?

350
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,820
And this here…

351
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,690
No.

352
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,850
My wife is not depressed.

353
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,340
How can you know that?

354
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,380
Hello.

355
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,030
This is

356
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,880
-the postnatal depression…
-No.

357
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,170
What's so funny?

358
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,730
Hello.

359
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,510
This is

360
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,580
the postnatal depression…

361
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,380
Hello.

362
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,640
Postnatal depression scale.

363
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,940
-No.
-No.

364
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,920
…experience this…

365
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:42,780
Hello.

366
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,950
The postnatal depression scale.

367
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,740
Can you please fill it out?

368
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,140
Let me ask you.

369
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,190
What's the biggest problem

370
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,300
of Chinese patients?

371
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,620
That's a big question.

372
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,830
I can write a whole paper

373
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,730
to analyze this.

374
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,099
What paper?

375
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,380
You've spent too much time on the academy.

376
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,319
Let me tell you.

377
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,460
The biggest problem of Chinese patients

378
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,520
is that they hide their illness.

379
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,540
They feel ashamed of being sick.

380
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,430
Especially in Psychiatry and Gynecology.

381
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,420
Many patients with emotional illness

382
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,609
avoid going to the hospital.

383
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,339
Because

384
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,900
many of those specialized hospitals

385
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,000
are called the asylum.

386
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,339
As for Gynecology,

387
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,599
many people would connect the diseases

388
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,410
with promiscuity.

389
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,730
You ask them to fill out this depression scale

390
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,660
in public

391
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,190
in a department

392
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,200
with so many women.

393
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,220
Who would do it?

394
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,650
People who are sick

395
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,970
wouldn't talk about it in public.

396
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,690
People who aren't

397
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,980
would probably want to smack you.

398
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,190
So,

399
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,170
how do I do a thorough survey

400
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
of postnatal depression?

401
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,520
I think

402
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,680
you can try a new approach.

403
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:49,970
Meaning?

404
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,760
You can conduct

405
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,870
an online survey

406
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,640
and put up the code in a more secret place

407
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,910
of the hospital,

408
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,400
such as the female sanitary.

409
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,600
In that case,

410
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,790
pregnant women

411
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,790
can scan the code in secret

412
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,500
and do the survey.

413
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,690
You can also get

414
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,370
much more accurate information.

415
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,100
Today I'll be the host

416
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,420
of out inter-departmental

417
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,900
clinical research conference.

418
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,550
Let's start with

419
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,610
our Neurosurgery department.

420
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,220
This year,

421
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,610
the focal point of the fourth semester

422
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,170
is to apply for the national project

423
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,040
of perinatal brain injury.

424
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,170
Considering the fact that they don't have enough beds

425
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,600
in the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department,

426
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,380
and,

427
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,000
the line pregnant women

428
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,720
with perinatal brain injury

429
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,020
should be received

430
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,670
by the Neurosurgery department,

431
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,940
the neurology department,

432
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,130
or the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department

433
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,860
is never clear,

434
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,810
I suggest

435
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,520
that our Neurosurgery department

436
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,610
provides a few wards

437
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,020
and builds

438
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,360
an inter-departmental joint ward,

439
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,280
so as to help

440
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,190
the pregnant women with perinatal brain injury.

441
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,050
Dr. Tian.

442
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,390
What do you think?

443
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,020
Of course I'm an advocate.

444
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,540
This is a good thing.

445
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,670
Dr. Liu.

446
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,300
No, president.

447
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,860
That is also why

448
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,960
I asked for more beds

449
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,810
from the hospital before.

450
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,150
You made so many efforts

451
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,100
to take away the beds.

452
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,140
And now,

453
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,760
you are using them to build this inter-departmental ward.

454
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,260
I have to say,

455
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,140
I didn't expect that at all.

456
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,930
For the same purpose, yes.

457
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,410
But under the same governance?

458
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,300
Not necessarily so.

459
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,370
Oh, of course.

460
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,410
So,

461
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,460
if none of you

462
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,780
has any objection,

463
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,500
we'll start to get to it.

464
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,010
This is a good thing.

465
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,700
Who would object?

466
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,610
The turnover of beds is slow

467
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,090
in the neurology department.

468
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,050
This arrangement

469
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,340
puts us to ease as well.

470
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:38,900
Another thing.

471
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,140
Dr. Tian.

472
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,630
For this project,

473
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,560
I'd like to borrow a few young doctors

474
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,460
from the O&G department

475
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,740
to help me out.

476
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,200
Okay.

477
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,640
I'll make some arrangements.

478
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,340
No.

479
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,500
I have a few names in mind.

480
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,110
We don't have enough people

481
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,340
in the O&G department to start with.

482
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,660
I'm afraid designation is out of the question.

483
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,150
What do I do

484
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,760
if you take away the backbone of our department?

485
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,180
The people I want

486
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,110
might not be the people you want.

487
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,460
For example,

488
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,650
Du Di,

489
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,210
the resident.

490
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,170
She's pretty good.

491
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,280
President,

492
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,070
you've always been impartial.

493
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,820
But today you seem indifferent to it.

494
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,580
Du Di.

495
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,700
Isn't she

496
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,300
your son's girlfriend?

497
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
The one whose mother

498
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,260
became vegetative a while ago?

499
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,420
You are not like your usual self,

500
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,510
President.

501
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,520
I don't know much

502
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,190
about my son's girlfriend.

503
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,970
It's just that in a few joint operations

504
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,140
with the O&G department,

505
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,110
she has left quite an impression

506
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,010
on me.

507
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,060
In addition to that,

508
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,530
Dr. Tian's quota

509
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,010
is pretty limited.

510
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,780
I just want to show some support

511
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,850
to the young people with potential.

512
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,770
If we can't even keep

513
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,780
good doctors like that,

514
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,710
then I really don't know

515
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,230
what kind of doctor

516
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,140
Shengji is looking for.

517
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,580
And I think

518
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,530
it's also practical

519
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,420
for such a good doctor

520
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,630
to transfer to another department.

521
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,050
I didn't say anything about transfer.

522
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,590
She's our doctor

523
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,660
in the O&G.

524
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,020
I heard that you've got some complaints again,

525
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,860
Dr. Tian.

526
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,570
It might make it difficult to get quota.

527
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,860
That's just some trivial matter.

528
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,930
You don't have to mention that.

529
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,860
And again,

530
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,740
the O&G doesn't

531
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,180
work with the Neurosurgery alone

532
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,290
on inter-departmental projects.

533
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,230
Our young doctors just recently

534
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,340
made an online survey

535
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,170
of perinatal depression scale.

536
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,340
It is widely welcomed

537
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,300
by pregnant women.

538
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,610
And it's not limited to our hospital.

539
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,240
Many pregnant women completed the survey

540
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,710
and found out

541
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,300
about their prenatal and postnatal depression.

542
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,230
It was shared and promoted

543
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,650
by many influencers in the medical field.

544
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,850
They have collected

545
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
a lot of information about pregnant women.

546
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,060
That can act as a solid basis

547
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,140
for our cooperation

548
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,860
with the neurology department.

549
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,010
Who is this young doctor

550
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,660
you are talking about?

551
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,420
Liu Nianbai.

552
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:52,960
Liu Nianbai?

553
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,350
So,

554
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,330
should I be the first to be proud?

555
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,790
Weiwei.

556
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,340
You made the appointment for me.

557
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,260
Where are you?

558
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
How do I go in without you?

559
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,410
It's so awkward.

560
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,000
I have an emergency here.

561
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,770
A critical patient just came in.

562
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,580
I can't leave now.

563
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,020
He's your dad.

564
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,080
How bad could it be?

565
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,820
Just say whatever you want.

566
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,510
Is this another trap?

567
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,040
Spare me, please.

568
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,060
You asked me out for dinner.

569
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,060
And now you're going to stay silent

570
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,060
until we finish?

571
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,380
I didn't ask you.

572
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,320
Weiwei did.

573
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,330
If there isn't anything else,

574
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,350
I'm gonna go now.

575
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,730
Work's waiting.

576
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,680
There is.

577
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,100
Um, I, um…

578
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,040
Du Di's mother

579
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,810
had another CT scan

580
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,450
earlier today.

581
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,100
I wonder

582
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,000
if you could invite more experts

583
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,340
to another group consultation

584
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,690
to work out some other solutions?

585
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,580
What experts do you expect?

586
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,220
All the renowned ones came and saw her.

587
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,960
Any higher level would be academicians.

588
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,790
So academicians then.

589
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:56,680
Fine.

590
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,480
I'll see what I can do.

591
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,900
But you see,

592
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,660
even all those experts

593
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,940
didn't work out a solution.

594
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,770
Academicians aren't magicians,

595
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,340
and it's not like they can

596
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,680
turn the whole thing around with a snap.

597
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,150
I'm aware of that,

598
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,610
but I still want to give it a shot.

599
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,070
Or keep trying.

600
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,670
Du Di.

601
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,840
Her character…

602
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,270
What's up with her?

603
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,820
Although you always say

604
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,270
that I'm in no position

605
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,460
to ask about your life,

606
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,540
as your father,

607
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,640
there's still something

608
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,260
that I would like to say to you.

609
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,150
Du Di is overly committed

610
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,540
and aspirational.

611
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,460
Those may be good traits at work.

612
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,270
She is willing to give all she has

613
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,860
to achieve her goals.

614
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,980
And she'll be moving up

615
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,100
in her career.

616
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,820
But in life,

617
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,300
her personality isn't suitable to be a wife.

618
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,270
A woman normally

619
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,090
makes progress in career

620
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,960
at the cost of her family.

621
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,980
Do you understand?

622
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,820
This is how you

623
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,820
saw my mother,

624
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,420
right?

625
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,560
I had a marriage.

626
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,570
Yes, you did, but it doesn't mean

627
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,360
everything you say is correct.

628
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,650
I know nothing about

629
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,960
how personality affects career and marriage.

630
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,940
All I know

631
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,490
is that I admire and respect Du Di.

632
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,810
Together, we will face

633
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,000
all kinds of problems in the future.

634
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:35,980
The future?

635
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,620
You two are making plans for the future already?

636
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,550
I don't know what she thinks,

637
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,680
but I want to be with her forever.

638
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,300
So you're serious about her.

639
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,060
Yes, I am.

640
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,510
[Gynecological Cancer Ward]

641
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,910
The pregnancy

642
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,140
must be terminated.

643
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,590
Director Tian,

644
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,390
he seems very emotional.

645
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,670
Can we have some time

646
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,810
for a quick discussion?

647
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,550
-Enough.
-Let me…

648
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,610
Let me speak to him.

649
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,100
-Let me speak to him.
-Calm down.

650
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,500
The patient was just diagnosed with malignant tumor.

651
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,340
He needs to think things through.

652
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,440
It won't do anything good for them

653
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,690
that you're being so emotional.

654
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,840
Director Tian is in there.

655
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,540
Don't worry.

656
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,360
Safety is always Director Tina's No. 1 priority.

657
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,500
He only listens to the family.

658
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,910
She must get an abortion at once,

659
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,550
or she will die.

660
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,420
Not necessarily.

661
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,410
There was

662
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,720
successful childbirth

663
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,430
in a pregnancy with cervical cancer

664
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,660
case previously.

665
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,320
Were you there?

666
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:36,960
What do you know?

667
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,850
Honey, let's…

668
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,620
Let's get you treated first, okay?

669
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,040
The doctor said

670
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,190
your condition

671
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,380
would worsen easily.

672
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,540
But once you're cured,

673
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,640
you'll be fine for many years to come.

674
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,550
Can we not

675
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,740
get another baby after you're cured?

676
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,090
What if they can't cure me?

677
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,740
It's a cancer.

678
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,220
Who knows what would happen.

679
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,750
What if I can't get pregnant again

680
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,920
after I'm cured?

681
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,230
What if your

682
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:05,940
condition worsens?

683
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,710
Because of

684
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,730
all those what-ifs,

685
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,360
I will choose the baby.

686
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,130
Maybe to others,

687
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,540
the baby in my belly

688
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,790
is not a life

689
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,130
that has a form and thoughts yet,

690
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,520

861
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,060
to save more lives.

862
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,800
Also,

863
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:26,300
♫Every soul is different now and dreaming about the distance♫

864
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,240
although the information gap

865
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,350
does exist,

866
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,020
at least they won't regret

867
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,660
the choice they make on their own

868
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,230
or harass the hospital.

869
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,740
♫The last item on life's list♫

870
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,660
How do you know that they won't regret it?

871
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,390
Oh, my.

872
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,600
I never saw him like that before.

873
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,700
♫Luckily I have an angel like you♫

874
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,520
What's up with him?

875
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,280
He's relating to himself.

876
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,200
♫To complete it with♫

877
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,200
Maybe I can't feel how they feel,

878
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,620
but I hope

879
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,390
you leave your personal feelings

880
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,290
out of the case.

881
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,990
I have no personal feelings at all!

882
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,060
You have no idea!

883
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,860
Are you finished?

884
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,160
We need to go now, or I'll be late.

885
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,300
You still haven't finished your breakfast?

886
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,980
Every meal takes you at least 40 minutes.

887
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,560
Are you dining

888
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,410
or taking pills?

889
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,940
Enough, stop eating.

890
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:03,840
Don't cry.

891
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,190
Get out and get in the car.

892
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,710
I'm always late for work after dropping you off at school.

893
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,400
Let's go.

894
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,640
You're slow at everything.

895
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,710
Your dad and I are fast-paced.

896
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,280
How come

897
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,250
you are so dull?

898
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,910
You get off bed slowly.

899
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,850
You brush your teeth slowly.

900
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
You eat slowly.

901
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,500
And I need to organize your backpack.

902
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,540
If you can't speed up,

903
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,360
there will be no breakfast for you anymore.

904
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,060
Mom, I'm hungry.

905
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,970
Hungry, huh? Why can't you

906
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,010
get up early?

907
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,550
Why can't you have

908
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,690
your breakfast more quickly?

909
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,860
Stop crying.

910
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,470
Just stop.

911
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,580
You'll take the metro to school if you keep crying.

912
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,390
I don't have time and energy for you.

913
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,520
What's the matter, honey?

914
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,380
What?

915
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,350
Another bad dream?

916
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:58,800
Darling,

917
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,020
our daughter's death was on me.

918
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,000
I can't believe I treated her like that.

919
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,130
I knew she was a slow eater.

920
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,910
I could've woken her up earlier.

921
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,640
I could've asked

922
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,610
her to eat some bread on the way.

923
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,530
The moment before she left,

924
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,010
I was still telling her off.

925
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,220
She cried so hard.

926
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,620
Darling,

927
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,520
that was my fault.

928
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,540
Why did I do that?

929
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,070
Why did I do that?

930
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,600
It wasn't your fault.

931
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,220
What's the matter?

932
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,220
Doctor.

933
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,650
Doctor.

934
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,550
Please.

935
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,690
You must keep the baby

936
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,120
for me.

937
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,620
I have lost a daughter.

938
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,330
I can't afford to lose

939
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,630
another child, doctor.

940
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,160
Please lie down.

941
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,260
Please, doctor.

942
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,820
Dr. Wu,

943
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,150
you may not know this,

944
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,010
but there's more about this child.

945
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,850
It's my life's greatest wish

946
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,270
of her life.

947
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,310
We tried to have a baby,

948
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,980
but we never made it.

949
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,580
On the death anniversary

950
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,409
of my daughter,

951
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,739
I begged her,

952
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,710
"Come back, please?"

953
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,050
"I'm sorry."

954
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,900
"Could you come back

955
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,159
so I could love you again?"

956
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,610
Soon after, the hospital notified me

957
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,300
that the test tube was a success.

958
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,800
I knew my daughter was back.

959
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,460
Since I got pregnant,

960
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,260
I have been very careful.

961
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,380
But maybe

962
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,520
getting the cervical cancer

963
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,179
is how God put me through a trial.

964
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,310
If I have to die

965
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,330
to keep the baby alive,

966
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,420
I won't regret it.

967
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,820
I owe it to my daughter.

968
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,420
Doctor,

969
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,960
please help me.

970
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,350
Please.

971
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,570
Please help me, okay?

972
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,340
I'll tell

973
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,800
Director Tian about your condition.

974
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,350
But if you want

975
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,220
to keep the baby,

976
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,730
you need to stay calm.

977
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,780
Can you promise me that?

978
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,480
Yes.

979
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:25,700
OK.

980
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,320
I'll do what you say, doctor.

981
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,200
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

982
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,640
[Shengji Hospital]

983
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,220
What?

984
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,170
Something on my uniform or what?

985
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,820
Well done, Du Di.

986
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,840
Even Director Tian couldn't win,

987
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,680
but you did it.

988
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,900
What do you mean?

989
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,680
In the staff meeting,

990
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,140
Liu Zhenghua

991
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,740
specifically praised you.

992
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,470
He said

993
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,950
there would be no hope for Shengji

994
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,720
if Du Di had to leave.

995
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,180
-What happened?
-What happened?

996
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,180
I have no clue.

997
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,820
No clue?

998
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,290
She nailed

999
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,680
a young student

1000
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,860
who happens to be the deputy dean's son.

1001
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,640
And she's getting a promotion

1002
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,880
thanks to nepotism.

1003
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,700
Li Junxiao,

1004
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,260
what the heck

1005
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,940
is wrong with you?

1006
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,500
Can you not be so mean?

1007
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
I'm not being mean.

1008
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm only stating the fact.

1009
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,620
Junxiao,

1010
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,960
I need to talk to you.

1011
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,140
He's such a jerk.

1012
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,820
Relax.

1013
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,020
You will definitely

1014
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,250
be promoted to the chief resident.

1015
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,720
Director Tian won't give you away

1016
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,870
to Mr. Liu.

1017
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,060
So after all the hard work,

1018
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,880
I still get a promotion through nepotism?

1019
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,670
Be open-minded, will you?

1020
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,450
A promotion is a promotion.

1021
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,770
Who cares how you got it?

1022
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,180
I really don't know

1023
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,400
what happened.

1024
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,050
Can you talk

1025
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,330
to Mr. Liu on my behalf?

1026
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,820
Tell him that I appreciate his recognition,

1027
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,420
but since it's a fair contest,

1028
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,700
I need to show what I've really got

1029
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,150
and that I don't need

1030
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,060
extra help From anyone.

1031
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,670
I'm going to make rounds.

1032
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,210
But I don't think

1033
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,790
that stubborn old dude

1034
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,700
did anything for you.

1035
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,630
You haven't had your breakfast.

1036
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,040
Can you just stop picking on Du Di?

1037
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,410
Her work has been hard enough.

1038
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,720
I'm not picking on her or anything.

1039
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:18,920
Her feigned righteousness

1040
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,610
made me

1041
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,710
want to diss her.

1042
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,540
It'll make people think that you're still hold a grudge

1043
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,820
against the fact that she dumped you.

1044
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,940
No way.

1045
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,740
I have put it all behind me.

1046
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,470
Then stop dissing her.

1047
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,660
All right.

1048
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,340
I'll obey

1049
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,260
since you aren't happy about it.

1050
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,600
I'll always follow your orders.

1051
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,850
That's more like it.

1052
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,020
Oh, right.

1053
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,660
It's my day off tomorrow.

1054
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,330
Tomorrow's your day off, too, right?

1055
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,990
How about we have lunch

1056
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,060
and watch a movie together?

1057
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,060
I…

1058
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,300
I may not have time for that.

1059
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,050
You always have no time.

1060
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:49,820
Look,

1061
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
other than

1062
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,890
my daily work,

1063
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,900
I must write the paper for Director Tian.

1064
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:55,940
Also…

1065
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:56,660
I got it.

1066
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,460
You focus on

1067
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,370
your paper and finish it first.

1068
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,230
Thank you.

1069
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,320
I will do my best.

1070
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,210
Look, Director Tian asks to see me.

1071
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,390
Go.

1072
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,360
What has he been busy with all day?

1073
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,820
I told you, didn't I?

1074
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,630
The answer is no.

1075
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,010
Stop calling me.

1076
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,450
Let's just talk about work, all right?

1077
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,700
No other subjects.

1078
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,680
I don't want to think about anything else.

1079
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,100
I'm going to propose to Congrui.

1080
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,610
I knew no one could find me

1081
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,900
sleeping here.

1082
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,060
It looks like

1083
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,210
my happiness is doubled.

1084
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,620
Yingying,

1085
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,010
Dr. Li is too busy.

1086
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,840
I told the director

1087
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,430
that Dr. Liu, a well-educated overseas returnee,

1088
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,740
will be in charge of you.

1089
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:20,730
Hello.

1090
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,070
Just call me Bai.

1091
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,220
Hi.

1092
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,570
I've got other stuff to do.

1093
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,780
I'm off.

1094
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,150
Thank you, Dr. Li.

1095
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,540
Dr. Liu,

1096
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,840
my nephew is the only child in her family,

1097
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,870
and she's kind of spoiled,

1098
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,470
so please be patient with her.

1099
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,220
Sure I will.

1100
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,110
I'll take good care of her.

1101
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,920
Dr. Li,

1102
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,450
do you like spicy food?

1103
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,420
I do.

1104
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,580
Me, too.

1105
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,310
Too bad, I'm not allowed to have any.

1106
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,400
I can only slake my desire

1107
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,830
by watching videos about food.

1108
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,920
I, too,

1109
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,050
enjoy documentaries about food like A Bite of China.

1110
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,040
Every time I watch it,

1111
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,630
I want to travel around the country to try all the cuisines.

1112
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,840
You watch that too?

1113
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,740
I watch it every day.

1114
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,940
Yeah, yeah.

1115
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,190
When I was watching it,

1116
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,890
I'd tell myself

1117
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,840
that I'd try all the food in it

1118
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,130
after I give birth

1119
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,760
to my baby.

1120
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,500
He'll realize your wish.

1121
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:12,790
We'll try all the food after this.

1122
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,710
It's a promise, then.

1123
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,310
Make an effort

1124
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,180
instead of just crying, can you?

1125
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,320
I'm in pain.

1126
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,080
I can't take it anymore.

1127
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,910
Stop crying.

1128
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,440
You make me want to cry.

1129
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:24,940
Honey,

1130
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,870
I'm going to cry as well.

1131
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,750
Shut up.

1132
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,580
Listen to my instruction.

1133
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,940
Here comes the contraction.

1134
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,180
Shut up and push. Come on.

1135
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,090
Hold your breath.

1136
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,040
Come on.

1137
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,610
You can do better.

1138
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,280
Come on.

1139
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:40,900
Keep pushing.

1140
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,180
Hold it. Push.

1141
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,550
Bring out your best.

1142
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,030
Come on.

1143
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,540
All right. All right.

1144
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,190
All right. Stop.

1145
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:49,950
Wait until next one.

1146
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:53,940
Jeez.

1147
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,540
Liu Nianbai,

1148
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,660
if you can't

1149
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,060
make her stop crying,

1150
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,450
you will not be allowed to enter my labor room again.

1151
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,620
What can I do?

1152
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,800
You are a slick guy, aren't you?

1153
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,060
Whatever she enjoys,

1154
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,670
whatever she likes,

1155
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,540
just get it here.

1156
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,900
The labor is taking too long.

1157
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,950
The baby would suffocate

1158
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,820
if it spends more time inside.

1159
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,170
She loves videos about food,

1160
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,650
I'll eat in front of her.

1161
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,660
It hurts.

1162
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,900
Hey, that's my hot and sour rice noodle.

1163
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,580
I'm still eating.

1164
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,080
I'll give it back to you later.

1165
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,440
I…

1166
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,490
Look what this is.

1167
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,140
Want some?

1168
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,890
Yes.

1169
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,680
You get that baby out of you.

1170
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,450
I'll treat you to it afterward.

1171
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,110
Get it over with or you won't get any.

1172
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,740
All right. All right.

1173
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,130
Here comes the contraction. Push.

1174
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,550
Come on.

1175
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,340
Honey, come on.

1176
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,250
Come on. Come on.

1177
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,890
Good. Good. Good.

1178
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,450
Good. Again.

1179
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:52,980
Again.

1180
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,940
Almost there.

1181
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,390
Congratulations, you're a mother now.

1182
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,560
It's a little boy.

1183
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,340
Congratulations, you're a father now.

1184
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:29,780
So?

1185
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,620
I'm smart, aren't I?

1186
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,660
As a doctor,

1187
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,340
you ate hot and sour rice noodle in a labor room.

1188
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,470
You'll be in trouble.

1189
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,380
Come on.

1190
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,500
Candy for everyone.

1191
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,800
My sister has a grandson now.

1192
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,070
Thank you.

1193
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,380
Come here and share the candy.

1194
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,550
Here.

1195
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,240
What are you doing, head nurse?

1196
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,750
Don't worry, it's not a red packet.

00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,050
My nephew's family runs a restaurant.

1198
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,670
She wanted to give us red packets, I said no,

1199
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,770
because the rules wouldn't allow it.

1200
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,210
So they got a stack

1201
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,350
of restaurant coupons instead.

1202
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,420
Listen.

1203
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,300
Just take them.

1204
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,020
Free meals for you all.
