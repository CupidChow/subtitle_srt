[Episode 16]

4
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,780
Okay, stitching is done.

5
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,380
Now move her off the stage.

6
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:42,490
Let me do it.

7
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,009
Senior, let me.

8
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,080
Okay, everyone.

9
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,670
One, two, three, now.

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,280
Again. One, two, three, now.

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,039
No.

12
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,820
You're obviously

13
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,780
not doing it right.

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,440
Du Di.

15
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:02,680
Be careful.

16
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,020
Come. One, two, three.

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,650
Now!

18
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,759
Dr. Du and Dr. Lin are setting

19
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,460
a perfect example.

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,919
Be careful

21
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,970
Dr. Du, added weight

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,840
in deadlift again, did you?

23
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,950
Still 90 kilos.

24
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,110
But I'm going to try 100.

25
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,579
You're either hit the gym

26
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,560
or read at home

27
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,430
after work,

28
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,270
when can you

29
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,040
get yourself a boyfriend?

30
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,220
What do you

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,920
think of Liu Nianbai?

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,790
Is he good enough to be your boyfriend?

33
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:28,980
Forget it,

34
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,900
he can't deadlift as much as I can.

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,860
Who told you this?

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,350
I can easily go for 100 with exercise.

37
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,780
Why don't you exercise?

38
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,560
Senior, I will do

39
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,770
whatever you do from today.

40
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,700
And I'll beat you in everything.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,680
Funny.

42
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,270
Funny.

43
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,450
Have we reached ten miles yet?

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
One more lap.

45
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,930
Hurry up.

46
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,950
You're slowing me down.

47
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,579
Are you still in?

48
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:32,940
Yes.

49
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,260
I don't believe

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,820
there is nothing I can beat you up.

51
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,890
Cramp.

52
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,540
Cramp.

53
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,580
Okay, have a break.

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,900
Get down.

55
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,290
How long haven't you exercised?

56
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,620
It's only a few jumps.

57
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,700
I exercise twice a week.

58
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,350
Aren't you exercising

59
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,120
too much?

60
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,940
This is our

61
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,180
most intense workout.

62
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,910
It doesn't suit ordinary people.

63
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,110
Twice a week?

64
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,210
Why do you think you can beat me up?

65
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,220
I exercise every minute

66
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,090
when I'm free.

67
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,350
Don't you eat or go out

68
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,540
with friends for fun usually?

69
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,810
I only eat when I'm hungry.

70
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,140
And what's more fun

71
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,980
than having operations?

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,790
There.

73
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,750
Doctors have very little spare time.

74
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,780
If you want to be

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,880
a good surgeon,

76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,930
you must maintain

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,870
good physical fitness.

78
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,870
You are too weak for clinical job.

79
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,650
I'm not weak. Check my abs.

80
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,380
I can't see any.

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,040
Stop breathing in.

82
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,540
Let's do bench press.

83
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,110
I have great pectoral muscles.

84
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,580
And skydiving, I'm border than you.

85
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,440
Do I look like interested

86
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,200
in playing with you?

87
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,520
My legs still hurt.

88
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,420
Don't leave me alone.

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,870
Enough workout for today.

90
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,700
Time to read.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,590
Have a good rest.

92
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,540
No.

93
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,970
Why am I pursuing

94
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,090
such a hard-to-catch?

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
What the heck am I thinking?

96
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,720
Am I a masochist?

97
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,310
Research questions.

98
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,409
How to win up Du Di's heart?

99
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,670
Research methods.

100
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,310
How to make Du Di fall for me

101
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
in physical strength

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,320
and intelligence and work.

103
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,210
In intelligence,

104
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,530
apply for literature degree

105
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
that Du Di is not good at.

106
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,220
In physical strength,

107
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,820
get a two-month training program

108
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,760
to deadlift 100 kilos

109
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,100
and build up abdominal muscles.

110
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,409
In work,

111
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,590
implement research projects

112
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,950
in Shengji ASAP

113
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,340
and invite Du Di to join.

114
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,620
I really want to take a photo of it
and sent it to Du Di.

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,390
I don't believe

116
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,310
she won't be moved.

117
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,960
How is it?

118
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,440
Do you think I can win her heart
with this plan?

119
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,290
Are you serious?

120
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,890
Of course I am.

121
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,340
I always thought you were joking.

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,400
Never knew you are so serious.

123
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,090
You just know it today?

124
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,350
But there are

125
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,820
so many pretty girls around you.

126
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,990
Are you sure you want to

127
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
crack this hardest nut?

128
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,030
There were many girls

129
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,910
around you too,

130
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,620
why did you spend

131
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,220
so much effort chasing after Feng Ke?

132
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,140
Sorry, Weiwei.

133
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,410
I didn't mean to mention it.

134
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,430
You've done a good job

135
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,320
in this mind map.

136
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,470
You must have undergone

137
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,470
rigorous academic training.

138
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,650
But when you

139
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,830
do these things,

140
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,940
Du Di is busy too.

141
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,800
She is progressing as you are.

142
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,980
When you get these done

143
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,620
and look back,

144
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,790
you're still behind her.

145
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,840
When will you catch her?

146
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,090
Yeah, what do I do then?

147
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,080
I should just put her down.

148
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,310
You can't beat her.

149
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,340
She could put you down.

150
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,310
I'm freaking out.

151
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,060
Why is it so hard

152
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,260
to pursue a girl?

153
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,340
You should just tell her.

154
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,020
But

155
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,300
don't choose the occasion

156
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,080
in the office,

157
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,120
because you will be interrupted

158
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,590
by the patient's call any time.

159
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,380
Not in the bar,

160
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,470
because you can't get her drunk.

161
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,140
Then where?

162
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,520
Figure it out by yourself.

163
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,600
I know a place

164
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,480
where she would never flip out and punch me.

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,830
How did you come?

166
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,220
It's not your shift today.

167
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,290
I want to learn with you

168
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,470
and practice the whole process

169
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,240
of hand brushing before entering the operating room.

170
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,400
You're so sweet.

171
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,270
If you really work so hard,

172
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,780
you should have finished
the internship by now.

173
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,260
Senior, once I finish the internship,

174
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,740
you won't see me every day.

175
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,770
Will you miss me?

176
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,850
Yes.

177
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,540
Really?

178
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,840
Beer before liquor, never sicker.

179
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,590
I'll have to do everything

180
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,300
by myself without you.

181
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,470
I'll fetch the meal

182
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,980
and water all by myself.

183
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,500
Do you have any returnee classmates

184
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,820
not so smart as you?

185
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,670
Introduce them to Director Tian,

186
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,140
and he will bring them to me.

187
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,270
Then your job

188
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,200
will be taken over.

189
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,060
Hand brushed?

190
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,580
So you can't touch anything?

191
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,270
Certainly.

192
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,900
Are you testing me

193
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,060
for preoperative preparation process?

194
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,060
Senior, I like you.

195
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,920
Can you be my girlfriend?

196
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,120
Hands brushed.

197
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,200
No punching. No pushing.

198
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,550
No running out of operation room.

199
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,130
You gotta hear me through.

200
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,780
♫Maybe someone is thinking of you♫

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
I like you.

202
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,440
I like you. I like you.

203
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,190
♫Maybe he never mentions it♫

204
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,290
I really like you.

205
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,520
I hope you can be my girlfriend.

206
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,660
♫You don't think you're unique
in the crowd♫

207
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,530
Don't come near me. Germs.

♫But you are in his heart♫

209
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,510
I won't touch you, my mask might.

210
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,180
But it's clean.

211
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,380
Dr. Du?

212

♫Sometimes happiness is too small♫

213

What are you doing?

214
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,580
You bumped my nose.

215
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,510
You got my nose bleed.

216
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,110
♫You have to look carefully
to find it♫

217
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,470
You got my nose bleed.

218
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,740

219

222
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:19,960
No.

223
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,800
You're having a surgery.

224
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,510
Caesarean. It's urgent.

225
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,690
I'll punch you when I finish.

♫You are warming his heart♫

227

I'm so sorry.

241
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,100
I really didn't know

242
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,020
where to go.

243
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,040
So I...

244
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,080
Your husband is not mad, is he?

245
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,030
It's fine.

246
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,160
He slept

247
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,500
in our son's room last night.

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm all you got

249
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,150
when something like this happens.

250
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,310
Don't be guilty about it.

251
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,970
Come, sit for breakfast.

252
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,690
Morning.

253
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,040
-Morning.
-Morning.

254
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,010
How was your sleep?

255
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,220
Is my bed comfy?

256
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,880
I asked the nanny

257
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,150
to change a new sheet yesterday.

258
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm so lucky

259
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,350
to have generous friends like you.

260
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,910
People used to say that they started

261
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,830
to believe in love when they saw

262
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,930
us two families together.

263
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,530
Now it's over for us.

264
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,590
But fortunately,

265
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,670
you're still happily married.

266
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,150
Come, Sichen. Say hi to Auntie.

267
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,150
Hi, Sichen.

268
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,850
Sorry.

269
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,610
Lu Sichen.

270
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,690
It's alright. Kids are

271
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,550
all rebellious

272
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,830
and don't like it with adults around.

273
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,910
Don't put so much pressure

274
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,020
on him this early morning.

275
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,060
It's fine.

276
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,570
No, it's not. Lu...

277
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,270
Zhang Ying,

278
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,200
what's your plan for today?

279
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,230
Do you want me

280
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,730
to go talk to your husband?

281
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,290
No, thanks. I'm going to…

282
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,880
To meet the girl today.

283
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,700
Remember to talk nicely.

284
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,330
You have a child.

285
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,660
I know. Don't worry.

286
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,950
She asked me out.

287
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,200
She's been asking me out for a long time.

288
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,380
I just want to go check

289
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,390
what does she

290
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,310
have to say to me.

291
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,180
You guys go ahead and eat.

292
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,500
I… I don't feel like eating.

293
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm going now.

294
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,680
Let me give you a lift.

295
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,740
No, thanks. I have checked.

296
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,790
It's only two stops

297
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,780
by subway.

298
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,370
Thank you for this.

299
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,510
Once this is finished,

300
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,190
I'll treat you to dinner.

301
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,820
Bye, Sichen. See…

302
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,260
See you.

303
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,390
Okay, take care.

304
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,380
-Okay.
-I'll see you off.

305
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,720
Be careful. Don't get too excited.

306
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,380
Don't worry.

307
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,060
Go back.

308
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,410
Lu Sichen, stop it.

309
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,590
Stop eating if don't like it.

310
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,420
Fine.

311
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,710
How can you talk to me like that?

312
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,460
You really have to talk to him.

313
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,660
He fights with his classmates

314
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,540
every day at school.

315
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,720
The teacher said,

316
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,640
if he does it again,

317
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,070
he will be expelled.

318
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,350
It's normal for kids to fight.

319
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,870
I can explain to the teacher

320
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,050
for one or two times.

321
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,510
Several times a week,

322
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,440
is that normal?

323
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,180
He told me he learnt that from...

324
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,450
He learned that from me, right?

325
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,270
Say it. Go ahead and say it.

326
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,920
You have to stop spoiling him.

327
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,030
You're about to give birth.

328
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,000
So don't make me do it.

329
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,660
Please enjoy.

330
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,700
Tell me, what do you want?

331
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,220
He told me at the door that day

332
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,260
that he doesn't love you anymore.

333
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,160
He wanted to divorce you long time ago.

334
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,350
But you got pregnant.

335
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,990
I didn't know he was married.

336
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,750
I didn't know

337
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,640
from the beginning.

338
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,660
He told me that

339
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,610
his wife died

340
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,490
from disease years ago.

341
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,170
Later I got pregnant,

342
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,190
he was thrilled.

343
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,360
He wanted to marry me.

344
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,360
Now it seems that he is not

345
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
going to divorce you.

346
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,600
So it's hard for him.

347
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:21,950
Do you know

348
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,820
what he told me?

349
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,710
He said you were drunk.

350
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,150
You got pregnant
and he couldn't get rid of you.

351
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,730
I knew it.

352
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,500
When I told him the baby

353
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,040
might have Down syndrome,

354
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,790
I couldn't get in touch with him anymore.

355
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,750
He must be begging you

356
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,650
for forgiveness.

357
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,930
Will you forgive him?

358
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,440
What?

359
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,690
Are you afraid that he would

360
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,140
abandon you because the baby

361
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,770
is defective?

362
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,980
I met with him

363
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,560
at his company's year-end party.

364
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,370
I was working-study

365
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,580
as a ritual girl

366
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,460
in an etiquette company.

367
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,230
He was presenting awards to employees

368
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,580
while I was holding

369
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,820
a trophy and a certificate beside him.

370
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,180
When he got off the stage,

371
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,930
he asked for my phone number.

372
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,560
He said I had great etiquette

373
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,260
and wanted me to

374
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,590
help him train his staff.

375
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,340
Later, he kept pursuing me

376
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,390
till I graduated.

377
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,500
Now I know that

378
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,940
behind his successful career,

379
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,510
there were you supporting him

380
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,430
all the time.

381
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,490
I complimented him

382
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,060
for his taste in clothes.

383
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,830
Now think back,

384
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,830
how could a widowed old man

385
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,730
have every shirt

386
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
washed so clean,

387
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:37,960
every garment

388
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,970
ironed so well,

389
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,020
and every tie

390
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,680
perfectly go with the suit?

391
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,700
Yeah.

392
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,000
You're right.

393
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,580
I bought

394
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,000
and organized all his clothes.

395
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,760
He doesn't have

396
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,740
such aesthetic taste.

397
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,750
Well,

398
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,530
I just want to ask you,

399
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,910
is he worthy of your forgiveness?

400
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:07,980
What kind of woman

401
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,700
do you want to be?

402
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,430
A forbearing wife,

403
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,520
a woman who defeats

404
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,609
her husband's mistress,

405
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,329
a single mother who abandons

406
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,210
her scumbag husband,

407
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,130
or a tough woman?

408
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,910
How to be tough?

409
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,310
I admit it that

410
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,460
I've always been

411
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,700
looking for shortcuts.

412
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,300
When a rich man

413
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,090
came after me,

414
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,070
I didn't dig into

415
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,180
his past and experience.

416
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,420
Now look back,

417
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,680
I've already got punished.

418
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,680
How could

419
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,880
there be a rich good man

420
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,010
who just lost his wife

421
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,780
waiting for me?

422
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,240
I still remember

423
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,050
the way his friends

424
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,420
looked at me.

425
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,600
I should've been vigilant back then.

426
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,000
But I've been

427
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,820
fluke about it.

428
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,360
I didn't find out

429
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,660
because I didn't want to.

430
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,470
I can break up with him,

431
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,690
but I don't want him

432
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,130
to get away with it so easily.

433
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,420
How could he hurt others

434
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,540
and pretend that

435
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,930
nothing ever happened?

436
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,670
So,

437
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,130
I want to join forces with you

438
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,280
and make him pay for it.

439
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,960
Are you kidding me?

440
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,870
I've been married to him for 20 years,

441
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,400
and now you are asking me to join hands with you?

442
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,120
What are you thinking?

443
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,680
Come, put it here.

444
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:49,880
Thanks.

445
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,470
Put the pillow over there.

446
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,170
Okay.

447
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,530
How does she feel?

448
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,470
Good.

449
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,220
It's okay.

450
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,560
I'm waiting in the place

451
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,130
as usual.

452
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,730
I'm here.

453
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,940
Why does it take so long today?

454
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,640
We've received many patients recently.

455
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,250
I'm as busy as a bee.

456
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,270
Take it.

457
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,390
What to do now?

458
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,150
The foods are all right.

459
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,770
But the soup is spilled.

460
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,240
How will you tell the guest?

461
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,340
Let me go buy another one.

462
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,240
No, no.

463
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,820
I spilled it and I will pay for it.

464
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,180
You go deliver the next one.

465
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,810
If it's late,

466
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
they will give you bad reviews.

467
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,040
But...

468
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,600
Just go.

469
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,050
Be careful.

470
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,330
Just tell me how much

471
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,480
you pay them.

472
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,460
Go.

473
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,950
How can you take it over?

474
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,050
You should make him pay for it.

475
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,070
It's not easy for the delivery guy.

476
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,070
Is it easy for me?

477
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,990
It's his job

478
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,420
to make sure the food is intact.

479
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,310
Do I earn

480
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,420
my money doing nothing?

481
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,910
You took it over.

482
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,540
You pay for it.

483
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,220
I…

484
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,110
What are you yelling about?

485
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,130
Everyone in the hospital hears you.

486
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,300
She spilled my takeout.

487
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,080
How could you order

488
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,060
something so spicy?

489
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,990
If you want to die,

490
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,010
don't take the baby with you.

491
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,940
I'll talk to the hospital

492
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,530
to forbid you guys from ordering takeouts.

493
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,420
Forbid?

494
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,820
You can't forbid it.

495
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,420
The food in our hospital cafeteria

496
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,920
is really tasteless.

497
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,440
Does taste matter or health?

498
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,280
Throw it away.

499
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,830
Whatever I eat is none of your business.

500
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,630
If you throw my food,

501
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,340
I'm not done with you!

502
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,230
Throw it away.

503
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,300
But this is hers.

504
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,260
You're a carer.

505
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,480
Don't you listen to the doctor?

506
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,210
It's all about spilled food.

507
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,390
I'll pay for it, all right?

508
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,790
Du Di, No.50 Bed is looking for you.

509
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,910
I want you to think again

510
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,200
about your health

511
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,830
and the baby's,

512
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,860
and throw it away.

513
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,110
Otherwise, I'll tell the director that

514
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,190
we are not receiving patients

515
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,170
who don't follow the doctor's advice.

516
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,930
Who do you think you are?

517
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,160
You're not in charge here!

518
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,530
Miss, don't be mad.

519
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,600
I know that you love

520
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,880
your baby very much,

521
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,950
but you are used to eating spicy food.

522
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,210
You just want to eat some

523
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,540
to satisfy your craving, right?

524
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,190
Yeah, I got greedy.

525
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,910
Forget about the soup

526
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,950
since it's spilled.

527
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,100
You don't have to eat it

528
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,870
because it's

529
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,860
not nutritious anyway.

530
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,290
You can have some little bites

531
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,100
of the other dishes to satisfy

532
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,130
your appetite.

533
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,990
As for the crayfish,

534
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,380
you can order minced garlic flavor,

535
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,720
it still tastes good, all right?

536
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,910
All right.

537
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:50,960
Okay.

538
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,240
Dr. Wu is so considerate.

539
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,330
Yeah.

540
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,590
Not like that doctor,

541
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,770
who is so ferocious.

542
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,270
All she knows is throwing things.

543
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,730
I'm not a fool.

544
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,020
Dr. Wu,

545
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,200
No.50 Bed wasn't looking

546
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,860
for Dr. Du, was she?

547
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,700
She calls the doctor

548
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,940
100 times a day even she's all right.

549
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,750
As long as Dr. Du is there,

550
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,950
she'll definitely have questions to ask.

551
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,500
So,

552
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,620
that isn't called lying.

553
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,220
Thanks for speaking for me.

554
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,620
Not only did she

555
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,490
not blame me anymore,

556
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,580
but she's now in a good mood.

557
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,340
Pregnant women

558
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,500
are emotionally unstable.

559
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,690
Don't blame her.

560
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,580
You're so emotionally intelligent.

561
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,380
Am I using the phrase correctly?

562
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,090
Yes.

563
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,330
We won't really ban takeaways,

564
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,270
would we?

565
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,780
How is that possible?

566
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,090
If takeout is banned,

567
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,640
we will have nothing to eat.

568
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,660
We are busy.

569
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,840
Sometimes we don't have time

570
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,790
to go to the cafeteria.

571
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,290
Okay, good. I was just thinking,

572
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,500
we couldn't interrupt the business

573
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,820
of the delivery guys.

574
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,420
You're so kind-hearted.

575
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,750
Still thinking about others

576
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,890
since you were in trouble yourself.

577
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,570
You're kind-hearted that my brother Li…

578
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,060
What?

579
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,050
I mean,

580
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,740
if I have a little brother,

581
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,380
I'll introduce him to you

582
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,010
and ask him to be good to you.

583
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,290
You're so funny.

584
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:10,970
Dr. Li.

585
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,900
What is it?

586
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,260
Dr. Wu

587
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,540
did me a favor today.

588
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,470
A big favor.

589
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,980
Doesn't Dr. Wu

590
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,760
do you favors often?

591
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,860
That makes it more precious.

592
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,940
You two talk.

593
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,040
I'm going back to work.

594
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,650
Congrui,

595
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,660
did you have lunch?

596
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,550
No.

597
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,250
Come, let's go to the canteen.

598
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,530
I'm not hungry.

599
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,090
Do you not like the canteen?

600
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,350
Alright, I'll order takeout for you.

601
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,250
No, I'm fine.

602
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,500
I had a late breakfast.

603
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,990
When I'm hungry,

604
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,970
I can order some myself.

605
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,360
Let's have dinner together.

606
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,330
I'm needed at No.50 Bed.

607
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,070
I'll be right there.

608
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,730
What?

609
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,350
Focus on your food.

610
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,780
Are you looking for trouble?

611
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,490
I don't want my girlfriend to develop gastric diseases.

612
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,980
Who's your girlfriend?

613
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,790
Speak louder,

614
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,550
and an hour later,

615
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,140
the whole Obstetric and Gynecologic Department will know it.

616
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,540
Who is your girlfriend?

617
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,850
I asked you to be my girlfriend

618
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,310
after that surgery.

619
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,190
You didn't say no,

620
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,140
so it was a yes.

621
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,230
From then on,

622
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,680
you're my girlfriend.

623
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,970
My hands are not scrubbed now.

624
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,420
Do you want to punch me?

625
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,470
For one punch,

626
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,580
I'll kiss you once.

627
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,570
Liu Nianbai,

628
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,350
how come I didn't notice before

629
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,270
that you're a rascal?

630
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,080
I found that

631
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,590
neither the love signal thing

632
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,280
nor common pursuit worked on you.

633
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,700
I'm not a rascal.

634
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,060
I was driven into a corner

635
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,840
by your indifference.

636
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,760
I'm done.

637
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,040
If you leave, I'll kiss you.

638
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,640
Senior, you're so cute

639
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,600
when you blush.

640
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,340
Eat your food. It's gonna be cold later.

641
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,620
Senior,

642
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,230
my mentor's project

643
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,460
is going to be initiated in Shengji.

644
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,310
Do you want to be a part of it?

645
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,570
Of course I do...

646
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,940
Just me?

647
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,050
What about Congrui?

648
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,240
Her English is better than mine.

649
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,110
Why not choose her?

650
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,100
You're my senior,

651
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,210
and my girlfriend.

652
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,070
I have the right to choose the staff

653
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,900
for the task I introduced.

654
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,170
But it's not fair to her.

655
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,420
And I don't want to

656
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,660
defeat her in this way.

657
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,060
Are you sure?

658
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,810
100%.

659
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,860
I hope I can

660
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,180
get this opportunity

661
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,080
based on fair competition.

662
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,170
How about I teach you English?

663
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,990
Are you great?

664
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,510
Yes.

665
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,780
You went to medical school abroad.

666
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,520
Now the junior becomes your teacher.

667
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,650
It feels bad, doesn't it?

668
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,760
No.

669
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,430
You spare your time

670
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,180
to teach me.

671
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,060
I'm grateful

672
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,940
and would love that.

673
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,140
You know,

674
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,810
in big cities in China,

675
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,260
children begin to learn English in kindergarten.

676
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,230
That's why Congrui speaks better English than me.

677
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,950
I didn't know until college that

678
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,420
how important it is to speak fluent English

679
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,040
in the medical circle.

680
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,910
Then you'll be my fitness trainer

681
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:08,960
and take me to work out,

682
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,570
and I'll be your English teacher

683
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,250
to teach you English. Win win.

684
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:12,950
Deal?

685
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,600
My treat.

686
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,060
Congrui,

687
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,780
are you and Dr. Huang

688
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,470
receiving outpatients this afternoon?

689
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
Remember to talk to her

690
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,320
about getting you in the research team.

691
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,580
I heard Li Nianbai recommended

692
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,240
Du Di to Director Tian.

693
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,700
Liu and Du looked so happy together

694
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,820
at the canteen during lunch.

695
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,960
You should be careful.

696
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,620
They learn from the same mentor.

697
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,610
If they recommend Du Di,

698
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,840
I can do nothing about it.

699
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,440
Are you yielding to Du Di?

700
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,520
Then what can I do?

701
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,990
Anyway,

702
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,220
the result is not announced yet.

703
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,670
Maybe Director Tian

704
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,730
will make a fair decision.

705
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,080
I don't think so.

706
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,420
You should talk to Dr. Huang

707
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,060
about it

708
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
and see what she can do.

709
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,230
Dr. Huang,

710
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,630
you don't look well.

711
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,990
Have you not recovered?

712
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,670
Do you want to take a break?

713
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,940
Are you still receiving outpatients today?

714
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
I'm OK.

715
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Let me get you a cushion.

716
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,710
Where did I knock you?

717
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,280
I don't need that.

718
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,240
I was hit by the children's toy

719
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,330
on the back today.

720
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,860
It just hurts a little.

721
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,110
But I'll be OK.

722
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,340
Are we still receiving outpatients today?

723
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,420
There are a few patients

724
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,250
we need to follow up.

725
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,040
After we're done here,

726
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,500
I still have work to do in the wards. I'm fine.

727
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,200
Ms. Huang, you work so hard.

728
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,400
Whenever I see you working so hard,

729
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,460
I feel ashamed of my previous days

730
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,180
when I muddled through.

731
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,860
You haven't called me Ms. Huang for a long time.

732
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,620
It sounds so nice when you say it.

733
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,700
When I became

734
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,860
your doctoral supervisor,

735
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,810
you often called me that.

736
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,000
I remember once

737
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,250
in a restaurant,

738
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,530
you kept calling me Ms. Huang.

739
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,970
The manager thought

740
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,780
I was some

741
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,420
big shot

742
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,590
and kept introducing

743
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,580
the fancy dishes.

744
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,500
In the end, all his effort went down the drain

745
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,380
and you just ordered

746
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,280
scrambled eggs with tomatoes

747
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,990
and fried pork with garlic shoots.

748
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,860
The manager was so angry.

749
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,900
I was so poor back then.

750
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,830
In the hospital,

751
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,210
I try not to call you Ms. Huang

752
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,030
in case not to give others the impression

753
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,150
that I'm specifically stressing

754
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,260
the tie between us.

755
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,540
Yes.

756
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,600
In the hospital, it's not as simple

757
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,630
as in the medical school.

758
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:19,980
Ms. Huang,

759
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,810
I heard

760
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,900
Liu Nianbai recommended Du Di

761
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,770
to join his project.

762
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,390
What should I do?

763
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,810
Who said that?

764
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,550
Liu Nianbai or Du Di?

765
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,270
It's just a rumor.

766
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,910
It's unfair to make a decision like that.

767
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,110
I will not

768
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,100
let such things happen.

769
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,460
If it's true,

770
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,700
I'll let you

771
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,930
in my project directly.

772
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,990
Thank you, Ms. Huang.

773
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,820
Don't worry.

774
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,110
After I deliver this baby,

775
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,870
I'll set up some projects.

776
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,980
Then I can ask Dr. Tian

777
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,570
to apply for more quotas

778
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,100
to the hospital administration.

779
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,580
For the last few months,

780
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,940
the department has been overburdened.

781
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,130
We all listen to the hospital.

782
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,540
Everyone is exhausted.

783
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,270
All right. Call them in.

784
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,580
No.1.

785
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,260
Why did you come to see me?

786
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,890
Is Miss Zhang Ying

787
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,380
alright?

788
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,500
Didn't she

789
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,610
go to you in the morning?

790
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,740
You know the answer.

791
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,180
We didn't talk much.

792
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,170
She left in anger.

793
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,050
I don't want to talk about this right now.

794
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,840
Give me the report.

795
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,510
The risk of Down's syndrome is almost eliminated.

796
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,820
I won't tell him.

797
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,950
He thought the child was unhealthy

798
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,790
and hasn't

799
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,500
contacted me.

800
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,650
But I won't tell him.

801
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,230
As a doctor,

802
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,910
I don't want you to give up

803
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
on a healthy baby.

804
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,380
He's so resilient.

805
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,240
But you have to remember

806
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,570
that he has

807
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,820
a very unreliable dad.

808
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,010
I hope you and the child

809
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,330
can be independent

810
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,610
and happy.

811
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,270
Shall I call the next?

812
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,510
Yeah.

813
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,950
No.7.

814
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,800
Thank you.

815
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,190
Dry your tears.

816
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,190
You've been crying here

817
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,180
for over two hours.

818
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,920
I can't let go of this child.

819
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,420
He's moving, you know?

820
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,500
I know.

821
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,160
I lost a child once.

822
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:33,620
I understand.

823
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,670
This child

824
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,180
isn't promised a happy life

825
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,440
with such a terrible dad.

826
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,640
Whether he divorces or not,

827
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,930
I will never forgive him.

828
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,860
After I lost that child,

829
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,430
I thought life was so hard for women.

830
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,220
When you want a child,

831
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,310
the man might not want the same way.

832
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,730
When you don't want a child,

833
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,780
the man will get you pregnant with lies.

834
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,910
If we didn't have wombs,

835
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,060
we could be independent.

836
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,730
But we do.

837
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:10,500
Sometimes, I felt like

838
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,639
we're like a tool.

839
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,130
But then I came through.

840
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,650
Whether we should give birth to children,

841
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,580
how we do it

842
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,330
and what to do with their future

843
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,679
is not totally the men's call.

844
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:26,590
Because we don't

845
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,790
have children for men.

846
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,530
You have to think clearly.

847
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,070
You have this child for yourself.

848
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,270
I need to think about

849
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,489
if I'm having this child

850
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,400
for myself

851
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,429
or not.

852
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,970
Let's talk about it.

853
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,910
I've read the report.

854
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,980
My child is fine.

855
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,080
I didn't tell Zhang Zilu.

856
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,460
After I talked to you

857
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,750
in the morning,

858
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,100
I went home

859
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,990
to get straight to divorce

860
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:26,890
with Zhang Zilu.

861
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,880
But when I got home...

862
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,080
Mom, what are you doing here?

863
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,040
Honey, I'm so sorry.

864
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,320
Mom, Mom, don't do this.

865
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,620
Mom, what he did

866
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,680
has nothing to do with you.

867
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,220
I thought

868
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,780
you were barren.

869
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,630
So I advised Zilu

870
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,380
to have a child with a younger woman.

871
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,880
It's all my fault!

872
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,100
Mom, please. Don't.

873
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,140
Zilu didn't want to cheat on you.

874
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,800
Mom,

875
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,490
how could you do this?

876
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,220
I know that woman's child

877
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,030
is a retard.

878
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,070
God is punishing me!

879
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,100
Please

880
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,250
don't consider abortion.

881
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,450
Don't divorce Zilu, please.

882
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
I beg you!

883
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,140
What a story, huh?

884
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm not sure if Zhang Zilu

885
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,670
convinced his mom

886
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,610
to take the blame,

887
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,820
or just wanted to use your womb

888
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,630
to give birth to his baby.

889
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,460
But there's one thing I'm sure about.

890
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,500
They found out

891
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,970
that your baby was unhealthy,

892
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,800
so they tried to keep mine.

893
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,330
He...

894
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,170
He said he loved me.

895
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,310
Am...

896
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,230
Am I just a tool?

897
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,540
In fact, I used to be

898
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,350
filled with

899
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,620
anger and resentment as the wife.

900
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,460
I was even

901
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,380
prepared

902
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,300
to save the family.

903
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,590
But now,

904
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,540
I want to fight him to the end.

905
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,580
He's so despicable.

906
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,660
Are you willing to

907
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,900
work with me on a show?

908
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,630
What kind of show?

909
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,620
I'll propose a divorce to him.

910
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,900
You tell him

911
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,430
your child is fine

912
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,110
and continue to stay with him.

913
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,400
I can't do that.

914
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,160
Hold on.

915
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,210
Let me finish.

916
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,810
When we go through the procedure

917
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,960
of a divorce, we can

918
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,210
both dump him.

919
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,810
Then, aren't you afraid

920
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,250
that I'll marry him

921
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,270
after your divorce?

922
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:46,570
You advised me

923
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,350
to fight with him.

924
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,120
You're such a strong girl.

925
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,720
I don't think you would want to

926
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,160
to marry him

927
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,630
as a tool.

928
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,250
OK.

929
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,490
I'll do as you said.

930
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,550
Come on, let's drink.

931
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,350
Let's clink.

932
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,500
Come on, cheers.

933
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,020
Cheers! Thank you, guys.

934
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,710
Congratulations

935
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,360
to Liu Nianbai for joining Shengji for five months.

936
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,940
We have only one hour.

937
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,730
Let's enjoy the food and drink

938
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,180
and share some innermost thoughts.

939
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,920
Then we have to go back to work in the wards.

940
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,620
Wang Ying,

941
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,940
you're such a buzzkill.

942
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,690
Now my head

943
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,830
is filled with

944
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,500
the work I haven't done in the wards.

945
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,630
That means you're dedicated to

946
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,370
and responsible for your work.

947
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,810
Your turn, Nianbai.

948
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,790
Tell us what's on your mind.

949
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,200
Right now,

950
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,420
I feel

951
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,450
your love and affection for me.

952
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,620
Do you know what the two words

953
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,440
even mean?

954
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,840
Then since you all love me so much

955
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,610
and embrace me,

956
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,340
I decide to stay

957
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,250
in Obstetric and Gynecologic Department of Shengji Hospital.

958
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,510
Please keep showing your support.

959
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,010
You can stay because of your connections.

960
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,040
As for if you can do a good job,

961
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,380
that depends

962
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,380
on your strength.

963
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,910
As Liu Nianbai's instructor,

964
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,920
I have a right to say that

965
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,400
I think Liu Nianbai

966
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,220
is a capable doctor.

967
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,560
Senior, are you serious?

968
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,160
No.

969
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,250
Having a good foreigner tutor

970
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,370
perhaps is one part of his strength.

971
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,890
We have only one hour.

972
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,380
Be nice.

973
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:17,940
Wang Ying,

974
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,700
you're like a mom

975
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,830
taking care of these

976
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,660
young doctors.

977
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,350
A drink to you.

978
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,010
Yeah.

979
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,130
Senior nurses like me

980
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,340
are kind of afraid of new doctors.

981
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,330
Doctors nowadays

982
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,550
are unlike those from the past.

983
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,830
In the past,

984
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,890
no matter how harsh the words were,

985
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,470
they kept the hard feelings in mind

986
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,060
and tried harder to prove their capabilities.

987
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,580
But now,

988
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,610
they cry often.

989
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,660
A few days ago,

990
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,810
a new intern

991
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,330
had her first experience in the delivery room

992
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,250
and was sprayed all over

993
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,360
with amniotic fluid.

994
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,880
She cried.

995
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,730
And I told her,

996
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,270
"Dry your tears and finish the job.

997
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,140
Why are you crying?"

998
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,310
She said,

999
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,700
"I'm a princess at home."

1000
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,380
Does she mean

1001
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,020
she needs a crown to deliver a baby?

1002
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,220
That's so mean.

1003
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,510
I pitied the pregnant lady.

1004
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,680
She was already worried that

1005
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,990
her second baby would be unhealthy like the first one.

1006
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,920
And a doctor was crying beside her.

1007
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,310
So she cried too.

1008
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,820
What's wrong with her firstborn?

1009
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,770
No idea.

1010
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,660
When he came to the delivery room

1011
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,750
with his family,

1012
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,330
I found

1013
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,610
many scars on his face.

1014
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,250
He bit his lips broken.

1015
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,190
His ten fingers

1016
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,410
also had bite marks.

1017
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,540
I thought

1018
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,330
maybe his family was abusive.

1019
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,120
I asked what happened

1020
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,220
to the child.

1021
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,180
They said

1022
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,650
he had always liked to bite his hands and lips.

1023
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,300
The point is he bit until they're bleeding.

1024
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,330
He can't feel pain.

1025
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,250
To prevent the child from biting himself,

1026
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,670
the parents tried

1027
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,290
every possible way,

1028
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,950
but to no avail.

1029
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,310
Could it be a psychological problem?

1030
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,220
The kid is probably 10 years old.

1031
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,490
His intelligence

1032
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,760
is obviously different from his peers.

1033
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,050
He can't speak clearly.

1034
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,920
I suggested they see a doctor.

1035
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,340
They said they had tried

1036
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,270
a dozen of hospitals.

1037
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,340
Some suggested a mental problem.

1038
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,120
Some said a lack of vitamins.

1039
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,970
None of the treatments worked.

1040
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,550
I went to see the chief of pediatric.

1041
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,560
I'm going to

1042
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,530
take the kid there tomorrow.

1043
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,370
Did you check his uric acid?

1044
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,670
What does uric acid have to do with it?

1045
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,820
It could be

1046
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,740
a genetic problem.

1047
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,150
I suggest a uric acid test.

1048
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,790
How sure are you about that?

1049
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,060
Which patient is it?

1050
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,880
I'll go talk to them.

1051
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,570
Great job, young man.

1052
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,710
If you can find out

1053
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,650
the root cause

1054
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,920
of their firstborn's illness,

1055
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,870
I'll buy you lunch for a month.

1056
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,630
Look, Miss Wang,

1057
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,850
half a month will be fine.

1058
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,220
I'll be happy with that.

1059
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,010
You slick.

1060
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,880
What a surprise, Junxiao.

1061
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,140
The way you pour wine

1062
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,220
is just like a wine taster

1063
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,620
in a fancy restaurant.

1064
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,780
I once worked in a Western-style restaurant

1065
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,650
to earn my tuition.

1066
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,640
This wine is really good.

1067
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,930
If you like it,

1068
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,160
drink as much as you can.

1069
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,540
I bought a whole case of it.

1070
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,670
You can't drink.

1071
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,890
Neither can I.

1072
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,420
So I can only ask the two students

1073
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,580
to drink with us.

1074
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,420
All right, guys.

1075
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,830
Congratulations to Zhang Ying

1076
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,020
who divorced

1077
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,670
and protected her interest

1078
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,250
and herself

1079
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,590
when his dickhead husband tried

1080
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,430
to transfer their assets.

1081
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,110
OK, cheers!

1082
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,300
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

1083
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,560
It's good!

1084
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,830
Zhang Ying,

1085
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,680
great job slaying that man.

1086
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,340
I start to feel afraid to let my wife

1087
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,460
be friends with you.

1088
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,620
What if she does

1089
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,690
the same to me?

1090
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,260
It's impossible.

1091
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,430
You two are a model couple.

1092
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,110
You'll never

1093
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,300
fall into the situation I was in.

1094
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,630
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend?

1095
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:37,560
No.

1096
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,880
Not... not yet.

1097
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,230
That means

1098
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,190
they can be, right?

1099
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,210
I'll try my best.

1100
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,500
Where's Sichen?

1101
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,590
He's detained at school to do homework.

1102
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,710
The teacher

1103
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,140
will call me when he finishes it.

1104
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,230
He fell out with his classmates again?

1105
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,190
I have to go to the bathroom.

1106
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,090
Enjoy your wine.
