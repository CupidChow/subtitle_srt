4
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,100
She likes bathing.

5
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,460
She likes wearing face cream.

6
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,039
She likes to sleep

7
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,380
with mommy's hair in hand.

8
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,580
Mommy?

9
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,270
I mean,

10
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
someone like mommy.

11
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,360
Anyway, I kept all her

12
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,040
little habits in a notebook.

13
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,270
It's in her luggage.

14
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,620
You must take

15
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,180
a good look at it.

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,880
Just give me the baby.

17
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,729
I'm her mother.

18
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,500
I'll know after looking after her

19
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,420
for a few days.

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,450
Come.

21
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,160
Slowly.

22

you have violated the rules of the hospital.

25

You will have a demerit on your record.

26

Please do not do it again.

27

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,240
Gossip is over.

Let's go back.

35
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,160
Stop it.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,210
What are you gossiping?

37
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,050
You're obviously worried.

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,860
Are you talking about me?

39
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:21,970
Very funny.

40
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,600

41
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,180

43
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,230
How much is it?

44
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,840
2,600 yuan. It's silk.

45
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,580
So expensive.

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,080
Not at all.

47
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,830
Girls

48
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,670
gotta be nice to themselves.

49
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,580
And nicer,

50
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,560
to their boyfriends.

51
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,870
This pajama

52
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,180
is very popular.

53
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,500
It has a great reputation.

54
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,329
Some people

55
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,519
even bought all the colors.

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,690
It's all set.

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,310
It's a good day today.

58
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,230
We must make it.

59
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,530
I'm counting on you.

60
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,360
Honey.

61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,600
Honey.

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,050
Look at me.

63
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,700
Just go to sleep.

64
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,870
I have surgeries tomorrow morning.

65
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,530
Just look at me.

66
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,060
It's not warm, is it?

67
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,390
You dumb.

68
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,430
Who wears this

69
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,310
to keep warm?

70
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,480
You always kick off the blanket.

71
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,550
Go change the pajama.

72
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,900
It's my ovulation day today.

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
Ovulation day.

74
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,750
Oh what?

75
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,990
Act about it.

76
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,090
I'm tired.

77
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,390
Bear with it.

78
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,710
It's once in a month.

79
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,200
We gotta seize the moment.

80
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,120
Congrui,

81
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,230
I don't think

82
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,970
we should rush it.

83
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,860
What do you mean?

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,409
I'm all ready.

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,330
Getting pregnant

86
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,610
is a natural thing.

87
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,550
We have to do it monthly

88
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,720
so I can get pregnant naturally.

89
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,680
No.

90
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,730
Looking for your cellphone?

91
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,880
Checking if anyone is looking for you,

92
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,390
right?

93
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,440
I called everyone

94
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,740
in your office today.

95
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,650
No matter what

96
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,470
happens tonight,

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,560
I asked them to go for your boss,

98
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,450
not you.

99
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,900
I also put your phone away.

100
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,930
We had a deal,

101
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,060
didn't we?

102
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,420
Are you regretting it now?

103
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,180
No.

104
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,270
Feng Yuanhang,

105
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,240
I have blocked all the excuses

106
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,230
you can find.

107
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,360
I'll just see

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,470
what else you have got.

109
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,490
I…

110
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,780
We have

111
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,430
talked about it before, right?

112
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,409
We're going to have another baby.

113
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,010
Congrui, I…

114
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,750
What is it?

115
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,130
Tell me.

116
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,680
I had a vasectomy.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,570
You what?

118
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,630
What do you mean?

119
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,120
I said I had a vasectomy.

120
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,830
I did it when we came back from the countryside.

121
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:24,850
Congrui.

122
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,280
You… calm down.

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,350
I can explain.

124
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,630
I did it for your good.

125
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,980
You did nothing for my good!

126
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,630
Is it your first time here?

127
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,210
Why have I never seen you?

128
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,650
It's not.

129
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,530
You are so cute.

130
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,130
Really?

131
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,680
But my husband

132
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,960
doesn't think so.

133
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,770
You're married?

134
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,750
I wore a very expensive

135
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,260
pajama tonight.

136
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,179
But he told me he had a vasectomy.

137
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,429
Look…

138
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,230
Sorry.

139
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,480
She is not available.

140
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,050
Why are you drinking so much?

141
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,300
How much did you fill her?

142
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,070
None of my business.

143
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,270
She wanted to challenge you

144
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,480
and asked for Long Island.

145
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,990
She becomes like this after one glass.

146
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,250
Get her some milk.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,530
Warm milk.

148
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,590
Come, drink some milk.

149
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,820
Drink.

150
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,420
Here.

151
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,100
Water.

152
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,580
Water.

153
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:34,860
Be careful.

154
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,430
Sanitizing wipes.

155
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,770
Are you serious?

156
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,540
No such thing.

157
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,360
Out of control.

158
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,610
No sanitizing wipes.

159
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,740
And you're not out of control.

160
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,880
My life is out of control.

161
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,540
You're drunk.

162
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,680
I'll take you home.

163
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,220
Whatever it is,

164
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,980
let's talk about it tomorrow, okay?

165
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,220
I'm not drunk.

166
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm just sore all over

167
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,720
and nauseous.

168
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,180
This is drunk.

169
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,390
That's what

170
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,700
it feels like being drunk.

171
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,030
Yes, that's what it feels like.

172
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,440
Come on, I'll take you home.

173
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,430
I don't want to go home.

174
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,580
It's scary at home.

175
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,320
What happened today?

176
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,780
Du Di,

177
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,850
can I stay at your place tonight?

178
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,300
I don't want to go home.

179
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,130
Of course you can.

180
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,860
Let's go.

181
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,140
Come.

182
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,810
Get up.

183
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,700
Be careful.

184
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:53,700
Be careful.

185
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,570
Come, one, two, three.

186
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,510
Good.

187
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,440
Du Di, I want to marry you.

188
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,420
I want to marry you, too.

189
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:08,940
Great.

190
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,910
Congrui, why are you still up?

191
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,370
I know,

192
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,150
it's been hard for you

193
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,490
since Calabash got picked up.

194
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,140
You can't deal with it

195
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,150
for a short time.

196
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,280
It's all my fault.

197
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,130
Sorry.

198
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:40,920
Du Di,

199
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,760
I've been upset with you

200
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,070
because of the abortion.

201
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,590
I'll let it go

202
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,090
from today.

203
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,480
I forgive you.

204
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,460
I won't get difficult with you

205
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,440
for this anymore.

206
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,310
Thank you, Congrui.

207
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,170
You know,

208
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,740
I've been

209
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,400
planning my life since always.

210
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,130
Of course I know.

211
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,750
You're the Princess Planner

212
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,680
in our school.

213
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,470
Nothing happens

214
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,820
out of your plan.

215
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,930

[Dorm of Shengji Medical School]

217
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,150
Hello,

218
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,970
I'm Wu Congrui.

219
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,940
I'm Du Di.

220
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,870
Du Di.

221
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,920
Special name.

222
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,710
What are all these?

223
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,080
These are my study schedules

224
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,290
for the next eight years,

225
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,360
from undergraduate till graduate.

226
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,210
This is

227
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,810
what I'll do

228
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,740
every month.

229
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,210
Months for eight years

230
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,790
are all planned now?

231
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,400
Yeah.

232
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,020
I remember

233
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,780
the first day at college,

234
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,560
you looked at me

235
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,070
like I was a freak.

236
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,430
Because my dad told me

237
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,730
when I was in kindergarten

238
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,080
that I must make a plan

239
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,140
in life,

240
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,320
and then work hard to achieve it.

241
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,220
Like, I planned to grow taller,

242
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,850
so I did reach jumps and drank milk every day.

243
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,370
And I planned

244
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,840
to get married at 24,

245
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,580
so I gotta get a boyfriend

246
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
in college.

247
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,610
I planned to go to Shengji Hospital,

248
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,130
so I studied hard to be the first

249
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,740
in our class every year.

250
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,090
I planned to go to the OBGYN,

251
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,080
so I gotta find the most famous

252
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,120
clinician

253
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,540
in Shengji Hospital,

254
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,490
Huang Yunling,

255
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,250
and ask her to be my mentor.

256
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,150
But you did them all.

257
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,940
I still remember

258
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
how you made Director Huang

259
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,100
to be your mentor.

260
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,250
You summarized

261
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,800
your competition results

262
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,310
and academic performance every quarter,

263
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,190
made a table,

264
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,130
and took it

265
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,240
in front of Director Huang and asked her,

266
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,900
"am I eligible

267
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,970
to be your student now?"

268
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,170
You made her laugh

269
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,410
every time she saw you.

270
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,220
Make a plan

271
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,220
and stick to it,

272
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
so you won't make detours in life.

273
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
This is my family motto.

274
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,380
But,

275
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,800
not everything

276
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,760
works out as you planned.

277
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,580
Yeah.

278
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,420
Why can't I control my womb?

279
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,350
Why do I

280
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,870
have to care about a man's thoughts

281
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,450
when I want to have children?

282
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,930
It doesn't work no matter how hard I try.

283
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,390
Did anything happen to you

284
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,260
and Feng Yuanhang?

285
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,890
Feng Yuanhang had a vasectomy.

286
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,210
When did this happen?

287
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,420
I just learned about it.

288
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:17,840
Funny, isn't it?

289
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,540
I want a baby so much,

290
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,060
but he sterilized himself behind my back.

291
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,680
He has castrated

292
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
my dream of being a mother.

293
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,290
Did you ask him

294
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,960
why did he do it?

295
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,710
I'll call him.

296
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,270
No need.

297
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,720
My life is out of control.

298
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,360
There is a mistake in my plan.

299
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,450
I have to make a new one.

300
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,010
Shut it down.

301
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,660
And restart it.

302
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,330
Congrui.

303
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,220
You're so early.

304
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:29,890
Director Huang,

305
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm quitting.

306
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,910
What is it now?

307
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,860
You're resigning because the baby

308
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,540
was taken away?

309
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,540
Director Huang,

310
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,760
you have always been my idol.

311
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,580
You have taken pains

312
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,510
cultivating me in the past years.

313
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,060
I don't deserve it.

314
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,690
I have never made you proud.

315
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,300
I don't want to be a doctor anymore.

316
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,210
Tell me,

317
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,900
why did you want to be a doctor in the first place?

318
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,260
I was fond of kids.

319
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,109
I have delivered

320
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,930
so many new lives

321
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,750
and saved so many mothers,

322
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,020
I feel proud

323
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,859
and accomplished.

324
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,740
So you don't like kids now?

325
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,329
You don't feel accomplished now?

326
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,690
It was my life plan that went wrong.

327
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,890
I don't have the confidence to be a doctor anymore.

328
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,569
What worries me the most

329
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,060
is your perfectionism,

330
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,900
your life plan.

331
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,900
If people can

332
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,180
completely control their life,

333
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,260
would there still be

334
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,820
regrets, disappointments,

335
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
and ups and downs in this world?

336
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,400
I disagree.

337
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,100
People can

338
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,560
completely control

339
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,480
their own life,

340
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,470
as long as they discipline themselves

341
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,800
and work hard enough.

342
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,200
But you can't control

343
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,970
other people's lives,

344
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,490
especially your family and marriage.

345
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,730
You will suddenly find

346
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,330
the person you've slept with for five years

347
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,810
is a total stranger to you.

348
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,040
I just came to tell you this.

349
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,600
As for the resignation letter,

350
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,530
I will send it to you later.

351
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,560
Hey, where are you?

352
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,270
We have to talk.

353
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,480
I want a divorce.

354
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm moving home these two days.

355
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,650
You have made up your mind

356
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,910
divorcing him?

357
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,750
Yes.

358
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,220
We have signed the agreement.

359
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,730
I'm moving back to live with my parents.

360
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,420
Did Feng Yuanhang

361
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,670
agree to divorce, too?

362
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,740
He didn't.

363
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,770
But he had to.

364
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm determined.

365
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,050
He had to sign the paper.

366
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,850
What about your parents?

367
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,060
They didn't stop you?

368
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,320
No.

369
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,240
My parents used to have

370
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,170
a very good impression of him.

371
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,950
They thought he was reliable

372
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
and ambitious.

373
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,940
Never thought he would do

374
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,080
something so disappointing.

375
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,660
My dad was going to beat him,

376
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,720
but I stopped him.

377
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,590
What's the use

378
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,980
of beating him

379
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,840
if he never cared for me?

380
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,090
And one more thing,

381
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,450
I decided to resign.

382
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,840
Resign?

383
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,280
You said

384
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,650
you wanted to make a new plan,

385
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,550
so it is to divorce

386
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,310
and resign?

387
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,080
Wu Congrui,

388
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,860
you are not an impulsive person.

389
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:58,940
Is there something else

390
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,410
you didn't tell me?

391
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,630
If you're angry with Feng Yuanhang,

392
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,860
just divorce him.

393
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,010
There's no need to resign.

394
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,780
From the day you were admitted

395
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,370
to Shengji Medical College,

396
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,150
you've been planning to be

397
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,760
a gynecologist in Shengji Hospital.

398
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,370
We had competed with each other

399
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,530
for years in school.

400
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,810
Your biggest dream

401
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,850
is to help the pregnant

402
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,020
give birth to children safely

403
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,140
and witness the birth of new lives

404
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,200
one after another.

405
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,280
Now there's just something wrong with your marriage,

406
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,620
and you're giving up your dream?

407
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,620
My dream?

408
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,770
My family, husband, children,

409
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,920
and my career are all in a mess.

410
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,060
They're all going against my plan.

411
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,680
I don't have the courage

412
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,130
to make plans for the future.

413
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,610
If life keeps getting out of control,

414
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,880
I don't know

415
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,560
where I'm going.

416
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,030
Your life has

417
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,910
gone according to your plan

418
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,890
for a long time.

419
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,930
You're a lucky one.

420
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,110
Some people

421
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,890
can't even stick to

422
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,490
one day's plan.

423
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,730
Life is long

424
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,910
and you did not lose control.

425
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,880
You gotta cheer up.

426
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,550
I need time

427
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,060
to organize my own life.

428
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,660
I want to stay away from the hospital

429
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,730
and think about it.

430
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,280
You don't have to say anything.

431
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,670
I have sent the resignation letter

432
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,530
to Director Huang.

433
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,370
I won't let you go.

434
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,390
I won't let you resign.

435
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,620
I'll get your resignation letter back.

436
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,570
If you don't stay

437
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,440
and continue to compete with me,

438
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,110
I will look down on you

439
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,960
for the rest of my life.

440
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,170
It doesn't matter.

441
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,450
I don't care.

442
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,540
Wu Congrui.

443
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,830
Look,

444
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,600
your data are fine…

445
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,620
Di,

446
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,290
Congrui is not with you?

447
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,240
We were together.

448
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,320
She should be in the office now.

449
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,210
Oh no.

450
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:50,920
What's wrong?

451
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,120
The head nurse said

452
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,830
that Wu Nan and his wife

453
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,810
came again with their baby.

454
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,180
They are waiting for her in the office.

455
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,290
Who knows what is

456
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,800
going to happen.

457
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,180
These kinds of people just don't deserve kindness.

458
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,340
If she dares to make trouble again,

459
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,360
I won't care about

460
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:01,940
any hospital rules.

461
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,470
Di, don't be impulsive.

462
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,700
What are you doing here?

463
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,590
Is there something wrong with the baby?

464
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,490
Don't get us wrong, Dr. Wu.

465
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,810
We are here to thank you.

466
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,750
Yes.

467
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,490
We are here to thank you.

468
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,540
Thank me?

469
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,620
She cried every day

470
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,170
since we took her back.

471
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,490
I never had

472
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,360
a good sleep these days.

473
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,940
I'm breaking down, really.

474
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,670
One day in the middle of the night,

475
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,900
after I changed her diaper,

476
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,170
she still couldn't quiet down.

477
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,080
It took me a long time to find out

478
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,020
that she had heat rash

479
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,850
on her butts.

480
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,360
I hurried to get powders

481
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,500
and suddenly realized that

482
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,030
you have looked after her for so long,

483
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,420
but she doesn't have

484
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,950
even a mosquito bite on her body.

485
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,180
She was clean,

486
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,520
and fresh.

487
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,710
You must have been very attentive

488
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,380
so that she was looked after so well.

489
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,450
You said

490
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,620
that the baby has a tiny throat,

491
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,580
so be patient

492
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,820
when breastfeeding.

493
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,340
After feeding,

494
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,240
don't forget to pat her on the back.

495
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,810
You also said that

496
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,510
it's easy for the baby to wake up,

497
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,420
so the room temperature must be strictly controlled.

498
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,820
If it's too high,

499
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,820
she might sweat,

500
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,820
and get rashes on the forehead.

501
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,290
If it's too low,

502
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,500
she would cry.

503
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,540
By the way,

504
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,380
she really likes bathing,

505
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,150
and wearing face cream.

506
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,070
When she sleeps,

507
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,180
she likes touching her mommy's hair.

508
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,440
I took after her

509
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,870
just as you said.

510
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,380
Really,

511
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,590
she stopped crying

512
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,020
and ate a lot.

513
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,210
When she was sleeping

514
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,630
with my hair in her hand,

515
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,060
I was so touched.

516
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,150
You were so good to my child,

517
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,500
but I...

518
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,860
I treated you so badly.

519
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,540
I'm really…

520
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,850
I'm so sorry.

521
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,510
Dr. Wu,

522
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,770
I don't know

523
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,100
how to say nice words.

524
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,020
But I'm really grateful

525
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,780
for what you did for Calabash.

526
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,890
Thank you.

527
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,890
You called her Calabash.

528
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,100
Yes.

529
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,250
I heard from the nurse

530
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,890
that you used to call her Calabash.

531
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,130
I discussed it

532
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,910
with her father.

533
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,570
You are the savior of my child.

534
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,860
She would like the nickname

535
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,170
you gave her.

536
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,340
And,

537
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,970
we named her

538
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,940
Han Xierui,

539
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,450
so she can remember

540
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,920
your kindness when she grows up.

541
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,030
What do you want?

542
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,450
Don't blame me for being rude

543
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,510
if you keep making trouble here.

544
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,660
They came to apologize to me.

545
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,250
That's embarrassing.

546
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,850
Can I hold her?

547
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,950
Sure.

548
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:47,770
♫My baby, are you sleeping♫

549
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,570
Calabash,

550
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,980
do you still recognize me?

551
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,490
I miss you so much.

552
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,810
Dr. Wu,

553
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,180
♫I'm hearing your breath♫

554
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,700
you...

555
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,420
Would you like to be

556
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,530
the godmother of Calabash?

557
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,280
This is a tradition in our hometown.

558
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:02,860
♫So lucky I can touch your smile♫

559
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,010
They say that if the child

560
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,620
got sick frequently when she was little,

561
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,930
it would be better to get her

562
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,840
a competent godmother.

563
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,260
If you don't mind...

564
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,890
♫So lucky I can meet you♫

565
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,170
Of course I don't.

566
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,720
What does it take to be a godmother?

567
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,480
Should I pack a red envelope or...

568
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:17,240
♫Let me hold your tiny hands♫

569
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,500
Or buy her gold and silver bracelets?

570
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,870
We can put this behind.

571
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,110
Don't you exchange your contacts first?

572
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,360
Exactly.

573
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:24,430
♫Courage grows in my mind♫

574
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,710
Right.

575
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,360
Du Di, the phone's in my pocket.

576
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:22,500
Come.

577
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,110
I'll add you.

578
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,890
♫Let me keep your company through seasons♫

579
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,150
We came in such a hurry.

580
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,840
In a few days,

581
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,000
we will be well prepared,

582
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,710
and invite Dr. Wu to dinner.

583
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,820
That would be the ceremony.

584
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,130
♫Keep all your growth in my heart♫

585

invite you

to our family group chat.

588
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,590
So you will see the photos

589
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,360
and videos

590
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,420

♫Even the air is sweet♫

597

from her godmother.

599
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,180

Okay.

Never get enough.

Before Director Huang submits it,

How can you talk to us like this?

653

We are your parents.

four months pregnant.

658

Mom, you're 50.

659
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,960
Are you crazy?

660
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,210
We just had

661
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,020
a 48-year-old pregnant woman.

662
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,090
She was so healthy

663
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,490
but she got broken down laboring.

664
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,140
Are you kidding me?

665
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,260
We did not break any rules or policies.

666
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:11,910
This is not

667
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,100
about rules or policies.

668
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,580
Have you cared for

669
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,510
my mom's health?

670
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,010
Your mother is in good health.

671
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,320
It was your idea.

672
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,740
You want another child.

673
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,500
Did you force her?

674
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,310
You still

675
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,420
want a son, right?

676
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,970
There's nothing wrong with me

677
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,630
wanting another child.

678
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,690
Are you crazy?

679
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,100
Stop, stop yelling.

680
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:28,910
How dare you

681
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,760
talk to me like that?

682
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,950
You have a doctorate.

683
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,630
Have you learnt nothing from school?

684
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,840
Go back home

685
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,960
and do a check-up first.

686
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,860
You don't

687
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,550
have a say in this.

688
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,020
Set up a file

689
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,770
for your mother in Shengji.

690
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,300
Why in Shengji?

691
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,510
There are so many hospitals in our hometown,

692
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,460
why do you have to come here?

693
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,730
Everyone in our hometown knows

694
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,610
that you're a doctor in Shengji.

695
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,780
Why should I

696
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,800
go to other hospitals?

697
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,350
I don't care.

698
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,820
You made this happen.

699
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,530
You deal with it.

700
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:51,890
You…

701
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,940
You're getting unreasonable.

702
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,090
You studied in the medical school for eight years,

703
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,820
and how much did you cost me

704
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
for accommodation and tuition?

705
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,970
Now you even refuse

706
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,020
to do a little favor for us.

707
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
You're ungrateful.

708
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,470
Who told me

709
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,570
to quit my Ph.D.

710
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,970
because it was costly

711
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,730
and forced me to make money

712
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,750
after getting the undergraduate degree?

713
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,620
You never

714
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,340
cared for me.

715
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,020
The tuition

716
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,530
was borrowed from my grandmother.

717
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,980
How much did you spend on me?

718
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,130
Have you ever counted it?

719
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,710
Tell me now

720
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,460
and I'll give it back to you.

721
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,060
You…

722
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,400
Stop it.

723
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,020
It's not easy for us to reunite.

724
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,220
You, go over there.

725
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,970
Let me talk with her.

726
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,540
Du Di,

727
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,270
your dad isn't that bad as you think.

728
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:34,900
Mom,

729
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,970
do you remember what did you tell me

730
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,110
every time when Grandma complained

731
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,540
when I was little?

732
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,390
I…

733
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,600
You said as long as I'm with you,

734
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,240
it's enough.

735
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,350
As long as I work hard,

736
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,190
Grandma wouldn't

737
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,190
blame me anymore.

738
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,220
I tried my best.

739
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,030
I'm the only doctor in our family

740
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,660
and then what?

741
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,320
And then you complain every day

742
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,540
that why I'm not a boy.

743
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,190
What does it mean to you

744
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,060
for everything I've gone through,

745
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,520
and all the efforts

746
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,060
I have put in?

747
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,510
Am I born

748
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,420
to be humiliated?

749
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,370
No, Mom didn't mean to.

750
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,830
We love you so much.

751
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,730
Don't tell me that.

752
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,460
Daughters don't deserve love in our home.

753
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,500
Du Di.

754
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,160
Will she set the file for you?

755
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,540
Not yet.

756
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,820
I told you she is stubborn.

757
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,540
You insisted on coming to beg her.

758
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:34,940
Now

759
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,940
we came all the way here

760
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,800
and she doesn't even buy us a meal.

761
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,840
What should we do now?

762
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,890
What can we do?

763
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,220
Find a hotel first.

764
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,240
I'll go to her every day.

765
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,060
I don't believe she doesn't file.

766
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:19,980
Pastry,

767
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,790
I am the first

768
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,680
to work today.

769
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,380
So active,

770
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:22,900
and diligent.

771
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,980
Will Du Di be touched

772
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,400
by me?

773
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:30,530
Morning.

774
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,100
Morning.

775
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,260
Di, what are you doing

776
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,640
in the classroom so early?

777
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,790
Bonding with mold.

778
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,960
Mold?

779
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,800
The ugly one?

780
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,390
Better than you.

781
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,720
You are really the most

782
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,780
manly woman I have ever met.

783
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,830
Watch your tongue.

784
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,790
I just saved you.

785
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,340
I didn't choke.

786
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,220
I didn't need the Heimlich maneuver.

787
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,460
I could just pat myself back to life.

788
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,240
It's all your fault,

789
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,350
making me be a cleaner

790
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,540
early in the morning.

791
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,450
Thank you, Di.

792
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,000
Thank you for saving my life.

793
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,000
Just go change.

794
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,940
There are two delivery surgeries.

795
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,500
Yes, madam.

796
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,420
My pastry.

797
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,820
Doctor, help me with this.

798
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,100
Who are you looking for?

799
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,560
Is there a doctor

800
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,800
named Du Di working here?

801
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,449
Yes, she should be busy

802
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,320
in the delivery room now.

803
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,350
What do you want from her?

804
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,550
Let's just leave

805
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,360
and come back this afternoon.

806
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,530
We're not leaving.

807
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,909
We'll just wait for her here.

808
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,620
I won't leave

809
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,580
until she sets up a file for you.

810
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,530
Okay, you're

811
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,830
the family members of her.

812
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,960
You can wait in the office.

813
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:31,610
Okay.

814
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,500
-Okay.
-Thanks.

815
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,469
Let me help you.

816
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,190
No, it's fine.

817
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,750
It's okay.

818
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,449
Thanks.

819
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,810
Here, this way.

820
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,420
Come.

821
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,969
This is Du Di's workstation.

822
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,239
You can sit here and have a rest.

823
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,620
Okay.

824
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,380
Give me the bag.

825
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:46,699
Come.

826
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,100
Come.

827
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,219
I'll pour you some water.

828
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:48,780
Okay, thanks.

829
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,409
Please sit down.

830
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,580
All doctors are like this,

831
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,139
having no time for their family

832
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,200
when they're at work.

833
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,910
Have some water first.

834
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,390
Okay.

835
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,860
Go ahead and drink.

836
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,160
I'll go check

837
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,660
if she finishes the work.

838
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,750
I'll call her over later.

839
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,590
Thank you, son.

840
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,140
You're welcome.

841
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,630
No.4 bed is a bit special,

842
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,140
you have to tell me

843
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,300
after the urine protein data comes out.

844
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,430
What are you looking for, Dr. Li?

845
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,980
Did you see Congrui?

846
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,900
She's in the classroom.

847
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,790
I just saw her

848
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,360
finish practicing the delivery.

849
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,060
Should be out soon.

850
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:29,820
Okay.

851
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,620
Congrui.

852
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,100
Come.

853
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:39,830
I have something to tell you.

854
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,100
What's wrong?

855
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,950
The two people in the office

856
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,400
are Du Di's father and mother.

857
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,290
Her parents are here?

858
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,060
Why didn't she say anything?

859
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,670
They are looking for Du Di.

860
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,190
But Du Di can't get out of the delivery room

861
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,390
for a while.

862
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,220
It's not appropriate for me

863
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,510
to entertain them.

864
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,620
Can you go check on them?

865
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,170
Okay, I'll go right now.

866
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,340
Uncle, aunt.

867
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm Wu Congrui.

868
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,610
Hi.

869
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,480
I'm Du Di's friend.

870
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,860
You are Congrui.

871
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,770
I heard of you from Du Di.

872
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,830
We have been

873
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,740
very close friends

874
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,100
since college.

875
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,050
What do you want from her?

876
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,430
Du Di has two

877
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:19,950
delivery surgeries now.

878
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,390
I'm afraid she won't

879
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,430
come back for a while.

880
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,920
Then we'll wait.

881
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,660
You can tell me.

882
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,560
We're close as sisters.

883
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,580
We share everything.

884
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:30,970
Okay.

885
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,500
Dr. Wu, can you

886
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,060
help your aunt set a file?

887
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,540
Congratulations, aunt.

888
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,850
Set a file for you?

889
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,180
How old are you?

890
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,340
50.

891
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,500
50?

892
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,150
Sorry, I don't mean anything.

893
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,550
The oldest woman I helped deliver

894
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,860
is only 48.

895
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,220
Here is the case.

896
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,560
There must be high-risk factors

897
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,290
if you come from other places.

898
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,830
No, you are 50.

899
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,310
Of course there are risks.

900
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,000
No.

901
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,270
These high-risk factors

902
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,800
are according to medical tests.

903
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,530
You confused me.

904
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,390
How about this?

905
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,820
I'll take you to our Director Tian.

906
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,970
That would be great. Let's go.

907
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,910
Let's go, aunt.

908
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,900
Slow down.

909
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,940
It's okay.

910
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,150
Be careful, aunt.

911
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,460
Come, aunt.

912
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,340
Be careful.

913
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,650
Sit down.

914
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,120
All the procedures

915
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,880
have been done.

916
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,420
From now on,

917
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,740
you will be Director Tian's patient.

918
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,040
Here.

919
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:07,900
Okay.

920
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,850
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

921
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,590
Thank you for all the errands you've run

922
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,860
for the whole morning.

923
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,300
Can we

924
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,520
invite you to lunch?

925
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,480
No need.

926
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,710
Du Di helps me a lot usually.

927
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,470
We're close friends.

928
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,070
We should help each other,

929
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,140
shouldn't we?

930
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,510
You should just leave.

931
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,140
I won't do it for you.

932
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,620
We don't need you.

933
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,500
We've already done it.

934
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,590
I helped them

935
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,650
and got it all done.

936
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,110
Director Tian received them herself.

937
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,160
Can you stay out of it?

938
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,700
How can I?

939
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,500
You're too busy for this.

940
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:46,840
This is not about

941
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,000
me being busy.

942
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,820
Then what is it?

943
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,920
Aunt, it is fine.

944
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,290
Just sit here.

945
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,220
Hi, aunt, uncle.

946
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,540
Hi.

947
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,240
Why didn't you ask me first?

948
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,740
It was your mother.

949
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,930
Will you help me too

950
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,420
if it was my mother?

951
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,850
You don't understand.

952
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,670
They can set up a file

953
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,120
in the local hospital,

954
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,620
but they just won't.

955
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,240
And my mom is 50.

956
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,340
I don't care.

957
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,250
I won't use

958
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,650
Shengji's medical resources

959
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,900
to satisfy my dad's vanity.

960
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,820
I'll ask them to go back.

961
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,160
What you say

962
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,120
is always true,

963
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,320
but Director Tian

964
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,620
didn't accept her

965
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,050
because she is your mother.

966
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,190
I didn't tell her

967
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,210
it was your mother.

968
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,850
I told her,

969
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,970
she's my relative.

970
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,400
Anyway, you know what,

971
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,780
after all the check-ups,

972
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,530
your mother is really at high risk.

973
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,150
She has high blood pressure and diabetes.

974
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,470
Director Tian said

975
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,950
if she was in the local hospital,

976
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,800
she would definitely be persuaded terminating the pregnancy.

977
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,230
But in Shengji,

978
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,730
we can try to keep the baby.

979
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,890
Then terminate it.

980
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,960
Why bother?

981
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,650
That's a new life.

982
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,360
Your blood.

983
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,230
Okay, think about it,

984
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,230
if this is not

985
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,580
your parents' child,

986
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,400
would you ask her to abort it or keep it?

987
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,540
Okay, stop being angry.

988
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,570
Rationally,

989
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,620
I should help her.

990
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,640
Reasonably,

991
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm a doctor,

992
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,810
and I should persuade her to keep the baby.

993
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,240
So you mean,

994
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,260
I'm irrational and unreasonable?

995
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,230
No, no.

996
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,700
That's not what I meant.

997
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,910
Look at me.

998
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,850
You be responsible for the patient you received.

999
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,420
It's none of my business.

1000
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,370
All right.

1001
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,550
I'll be responsible for it.

1002
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,210
You don't have to do anything.

1003
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,750
But,

1004
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,910
can we

1005
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,650
have lunch together?

1006
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,320
You have surgery this afternoon.

1007
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,910
You can't do it

1008
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,840
without eating anything.

1009
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,020
I'm telling you,

1010
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,720
to make you happy,

1011
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,990
I spent a lot of money today

1012
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,580
to get you this big drumstick.

1013
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,440
It was very expensive.

1014
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,060
Eat some.

1015
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,960
Then I'll take your mother

1016
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,880
for ultrasound this afternoon.

1017
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,200
Fine.

1018
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:25,900
Copy that.

1019
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,670
Uncle, have some soup.

1020
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,310
Aunt, eat more.

1021
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,510
You just said

1022
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,570
you and Du Di are colleagues?

1023
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,540
To be precise,

1024
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,730
she is my senior and mentor.

1025
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,140
She has students now?

1026
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,330
She is awesome.

1027
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,230
Although she is a resident physician

1028
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,300
for only three years,

1029
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,920
under the leadership of the chief director,

1030
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,660
she has done a lot of

1031
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,460
primary operations.

1032
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,320
And she practices the skills diligently,

1033
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,960
and has superb surgical techniques.

1034
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,550
I lack clinical experience,

1035
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,970
so the director particularly asked her

1036
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,700
to teach me.

1037
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,430
What's the use of that?

1038
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,640
She is so old

1039
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,260
and still single.

1040
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,420
Have you seen her boyfriend?

1041
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,880
This is her private matter.

1042
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,680
I'm not familiar.

1043
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,530
I heard they are together since college.

1044
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,480
Why are they still not married?

1045
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,560
Our relatives always ask

1046
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,990
why she's still not married

1047
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,690
since she's 29 now.

1048
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,080
Is there anything wrong with her?

1049
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,730
Don't say that about our daughter.

1050
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,580
The relatives said that.

1051
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,970
What's wrong with

1052
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,800
not getting married at 29?

1053
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,620
If she wants it,

1054
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,470
she can stay unmarried

1055
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,750
when she gets 39, 49, 59,

1056
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,870
69, or 99.

1057
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,390
There is nothing

1058
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,310
wrong with it.

1059
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,740
People will laugh at her.

1060
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:41,740
Uncle, aunt.

1061
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,680
How is the food here?

1062
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,300
Good.

1063
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,240
It's great.

1064
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,440
You guys are so nice.

1065
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,710
You helped me,

1066
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,830
and invited us to lunch.

1067
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,210
Better than my own daughter.

1068
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,000
We're good.

1069
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,540
We want to go back to the hotel and rest.

1070
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,760
You go back to work.

1071
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,310
Aunt.

1072
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,430
The maternity check is at 2:00 PM.

1073
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,180
I'll take you there.
